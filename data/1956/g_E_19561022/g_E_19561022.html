<p><span class="font26">W</span><span class="font16">ERE you shocked by the May 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Reuters news dispatch that quoted an American field chaplain in Germany as saying: “About a quarter of the troops live with German girls”? Or were you amazed by German Justice Minister Fritz Neu-mayer’s statement last June 6 that at least 67,753 illegitimate children have been fathered by Allied soldiers since 1945— 37,000 of them by Americans?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Did you know that in Korea the 10,000 members of the Seoul Prostitutes’ Union call themselves the “Yang-Ki-Bals” (Yankee belles), and that a military chaplain recently reported that “by conservative estimate more than nine out of ten of the American servicemen marrying Japanese girls live with them as man and wife during the period of so-called courtship”? Do you remember reading that Carl F. Yaeger told the National Lutheran Council about the “appalling moral practices&quot; among American soldiers overseas, and did you know that the sale of women brings $85 million a year in foreign exchange to Japan</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">—ten times what the tourist trade does?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But whatever land is involved, do the words “Christian nations” strike your mind? And do the proud figures of increasing church membership pass before your eyes as you read these reports?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When the children of a town cannot read, people look at its schools; when men leave the kind of moral record described above, it is time to look at their churches. Alson J. Smith, writing in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Century, </span><span class="font16">called for an urgent and immediate “program of preinduction education in health and human relations for teen-age people.” But why not just teach them -real Christianity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is plain that they have not been taught real Christianity. Often army chaplains make pointed statements about this. Chaplain George H. Birney said: “I often say to my fellow chaplains that our churches have failed. My Catholic colleagues deny this most emphatically. The church as they conceive it cannot have failed; the people have failed the church. As one Catholic associate used to tell the new men of our unit in his orientation lecture, ‘Two-thirds of all the Catholics in this regiment are going to hell as fast as they can go.’ But</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">OCTOBER</span><span class="font15"> sr, </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">19SS</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">so far as he was concerned, it was not the church’s fault.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">He continues: &quot;We Protestants, it seems to me, dhn be more realistic. I am convinced that this immorality is our fault and that it is high time we admitted our guilt .■ . . We have raised a generation which is biblically, theologically and morally illiterate. And that is the fault of the churches.&quot;—</span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Century,</span><span class="font18"> January 11,1956.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Chaplain Birney’s charge is serious. But the most serious thing about it is that it is </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">true. </span><span class="font18">Today’s generation in general does not know the Bible, ft does not know doctrines, and many of its church members flagrantly disregard morals. Despite the beauty of their buildings, today’s churches really have not stood up for the high principles of Christianity. They have become community centers and places for personal advancement, rather than places that require sacrifice and service. They ignore the morals of their members and permit immoral persons to remain in their midst.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">True Christianity, however, cannot do this. It cannot be blind to such conditions. It is told: “Remove the wicked man from among yourselves.’’ And: &quot;Quit mixing in company with anyone called a brother that is a fornicator or a greedy person or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner, not even eating with such a man.&quot; Today’s churches ignore that command completely!—-1 Corinthians 5:13, 11, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Chaplain Birney calls for reforms: “First, we must strengthen our preaching program. ... It is a time for calling a spade a spade. We must step up our evangelistic emphasis. We must get commitments for Christ. . . - And we must teach our people what it means to be Christian, Let’s rediscover the Bible as a source book for sermons. Let’s challenge sin with Christ’s own weapon—the eternal gospel. More specifically, let's make plans to train our churches In the inoral law.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Does that sound like a proposal to return to Christianity? That is what it would amount to. Christ called a spade a spade. He and his disciples certainly had evangelistic emphasis. He stirred multitudes to follow him. He showed them what it means to be Christian. He preached from the Sacred Scriptures. And he certainly trained his followers in a strict moral law. But today’s churches have not followed Christ in these respects. The apathy of their members shows that their preaching program is weak, their evangelistic emphasis is inferior, their members’ knowledge is limited and their use of the Bible insufficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Will the churches change? The revolution that is needed has not yet become evident. Christ would rise up in indignation at these conditions; his real followers would be expected to do the same. But today’s churches have not done so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">True religion must demand right morals. It cannot wink at fornication. Instead, it must expel from its midst anyone who refuses to live up to the Bible’s right moral principles. The Bible says of the man who knows the Christian moral principles and refuses to abide by them: “Hand such a man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh.&quot;—1 Corinthians 5:5, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">True Christianity must follow that command. If it is not followed in your church, then it is time to look around for a people who do follow it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">You think there is no such group today? Oh, but there is! They are the people who provided you with this magazine. Find them and become convinced that these witnesses of Jehovah do follow true Christian principles, do maintain high moral standards, and actually will expel from their midst anyone who refuses to conform to such right principles.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">HlS^is an age of worry. Though no one likes to worry, most people worry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Many persons seem to do little else but worry. Some are chronic worriers, who often make life miserable for others. The peoples of all nations are oppressed by worries. How to break out of the bondage of worry? Mere psychological tricks bring no lasting relief. There must be a sure way. There is. Almighty God has purposed to bring in a whole new world, a world without worry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">But before we learn of God’s way to relieve mankind of worry, we should know some things about worry, especially why it is now at its peak of intensity. Worry is an uneasy feeling, an anxious feeling, a troubled feeling. Worry drives away peace of mind; worry brings in a disturbed condition of mind. Yet, instead of learning about God’s sure way to unburden mankind from worry, masses of people are turning to materialism, hoping that the possession of things will bring them some peace of mind. Is materialism lifting the web of worry that has enveloped mankind?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Listen to the dean of Columbia University’s Psychoanalytic Clinic, who said last</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">s<sup>:</sup></span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font22">March 17: &quot;Wellveinan age of enormously Increasing anxiety, despite the fact that *we’ve never : had it so good?” Yes, politicians may tell the people that they never had it so good, and people may have more in a material way than at any other time. Yet worry keeps on increasing enormously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Oddly enough, the quest for happiness and peace of mind through possessions has brought more worries, new worries. Why, in Amer-</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">ica, now enjoying a high degree ■ of prosperity, an insight into the state of the public mind is given by best-seller lists. What books have sold best? </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">The Search for Bridey Murphy</span><span class="font22"> and </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">The Power of Positive Thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">No, materialism is no remedy for worry. In fact, it only hounds people with a new worry, for in an age of prosperity few persons dare not seem prosperous. Many worry continuously lest their neighbors acquire better possessions. The persons who have turned to material things for peace of mind, making money their love, &quot;have stabbed themselves all over with many pains.” Wealth is not the way to a tranquil mind: &quot;A rich man may buy off his life: a poor man can ignore the robber’s threat?’ “The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.”—1 Timothy 6:10, </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.;</span><span class="font22"> Proverbs 13:8, </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt;</span><span class="font22"> Ecclesiastes 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">One of the signs that all kinds of people, rich and poor alike, are worrying more than ever before is the increase in bruxism —the unconscious grinding and clenching</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">of the teeth. Recently, at the thirty-first annual Greater New York Dental Meeting, Dr. Thomas E. J. Shanahan reported that bruxlsm usually develops from worry and tension. The crux of the matter, Dr. Shanahan reported, is worry. In this respect, he said, no members of modem society are found to be free from the damage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Foretells Age of Worry</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">But why is there so much worry today? The reason is clear to those who go to God's Word,, the Bible. This book alone shows that we are living in the last days of the Devil’s world. None other than the Lord Jesus Christ foretold that this time of the “end of the world” would be the most worrisome in all history. For this day the Son of God foretold there would be &quot;upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.”—Luke 21:25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Since 1914 we have been living in this age of worry foretold by the Son of God. Now nations worry lest they fall behind in the arms race. People worry as talk of atomic tests, radioactive fall-out and possible casualties increases. Recently a United States general excited more worry throughout the world when he said that hundreds of millions of people, including a great many in friendly countries, would be killed in event of an all-out nuclear attack, on the Soviet Union. The more people look into the future the more they worry. This unparalleled state of worry in the world, Jesus shows, is one of the evidences that God will soon bring in a world without worry. Jesus’ prophecy at Matthew chapter twenty-four shows that this generation will not pass away until God’s world without worry is brought in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Before a new world can be brought in this old world must be destroyed. God will do that at his war of Armageddon. At this war, to be fought in heaven and on earth, God will destroy this system of things, ending forever the oppressive rule of imperfect human governments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Describing Christ Jesus leading God’s heavenly armies to battle at Armageddon, the Bible says: &quot;The armies that were in heaven were following him on white horses, and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen. And. out of his mouth there protrudes a sharp long sword, that he may smite the nations with it, and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron.”—Revelation 19:14, 15, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">All Worries End</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The shepherding of the nations by Christ Jesus with a rod of iron means their destruction. This crushing of the nations will remove the source of countless worries. No oppressive governments, no totalitarian rulers, no iron curtains, no arms races, no wars. Never, never more will mothers worry over losing their young sons on the battlefield, for there will be no battlefields, no military schools, no soldiers. Concerning those who survive Armageddon into God’s new world, the Bible says: “They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth children for destruction; for they are a race of the Lord’s blessed ones, and their offspring shall remain with them.”—Isaiah 65:23, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer, Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Nor will mothers ever need to worry that their children will fall into the hands of kidnapers or other evildoers. For Armageddon will have rooted out all the wicked from the earth. &quot;Yet a little while and the wicked shall be no more; though you look hard at his place, he will not be there. But the meek shall possess the land, and rejoice in abundant prosperity.” (Psalm 37: 10, 11, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.)</span><span class="font18"> Wherever one may look in God's new world one will find no trace of jails, prisons or a policeman’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">uniform or any other signs of a worrisome society, such as iron bars on windows, locks on doors or peepholes in doors. How serene the sleep of those who live in God's new world!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Even when children in God’s new world play with the animal creation, parents will not need to worry. No fear either that a wild animal will carry off a child! Instead the child will lead the animal. Nor will anyone worry that a creeping thing of the ground will sting a child; instead children will play with the reptiles of the field. Concerning this worry-free, harmless peace between man and animals the Bible says: “The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; . . . and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder’s den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.” —Isaiah 11:6-9, </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Today people worry over what they are going to eat and where they are going to live. But in Jehovah’s new world none of such worries will ever plague mankind, for commercialism will not take root in the new world and the word “landlord” will be no more. Jehovah promises: “Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat.”—Isaiah 65:17, 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">With these blessed conditions prevailing in the new world, what worries could exist ? Will people worry over health? Will they worry over the peril of heart trouble and cancer? Will they worry over </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">Jerfrfcn </span><span class="font22">foods, lest they contain something </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">harm</span><span class="font22">ful? No, never! Not even death will be a worry then. Death must be destroyed and pain must pass away. Declares Jehovah's sure Word of prophecy: “He will destroy on this mountain the veil that veils all the peoples, and the web that is woven over all the nations; he will destroy death forever.” The Christian apostle John confirmed that this will be the worry-free state of the new world when he wrote under inspiration: “I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away.,.. And God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more. The former things have passed away.” That means all worries end. —Isaiah 25:7, 8, </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.;</span><span class="font22"> Revelation 21:1, 3, 4, </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">But wait. Will there be need for worry over any possibility of losing these conditions? No, the security of the inhabitants of the new world is sure. Never again life insurance, property insurance or any other kind of insurance. Jehovah’s Word is sufficient insurance: “The bow, the sword, and war I will break off from the land; and I will make them lie down in security.” “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith Jehovah, so shall your seed and your name remain.”—Hosea 2:18, </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer, Trans.;</span><span class="font22"> Isaiah 66:22, </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver,</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Stop Worrying Now!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Why not begin to live for God’s new world now? Yes, why not begin to stop worrying now? It can be done. The New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses is proof that it can be done. The New World society take to heart Jesus’ command. What command? Not to worry about the future when we see the world flooded</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">with worries. Concerning the worrisome conditions to mark the “last days” of this world, Jesus declared: “As these things start to occur, raise yourselves erect and lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near.”—Luke 21:28, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Knowing for a certainty that God’s war of Armageddon will, during this generation, make way for a world without worry, we can heed the Lord Jesus’ words: “Do not worry about tomorrow.”—Matthew 6:34, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Right now begin dispelling worry. Drive worry away with the peace of mind that comes, not from materialism or psychology, but from a sure knowledge and understanding of God’s Word. Then “the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.” So powerful is this “peace of God” that it excels all thought, conquering even worrisome thought, enabling the true Christian to heed the apostle’s injunction: “Do not be anxious over anything.”—Philippians 4:7, 6, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">To gain this “peace of God” associate henceforth with the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses. It is the only organization on earth today that is bringing the peoples of all nations this new-world hope. Meet with Jehovah’s witnesses. Accept their offer to come even to your homes and take up a home Bible study with you, and so learn more of these truths that dispel worry. Let these new-world truths flood your mind and heart Do this now. Put yourself in line to survive Armageddon. Then see this age of war and worry give way to an everlasting age of peace and tranquillity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The medical Term “Shock”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">HEN doctors speak of “shock” they are not referring to a pile of sheaves of grain; neither do they mean a sudden jolt, agitation or surprise. No, the medical use of the term denotes: “A state of profound depression of the vital processes resulting from wounds, hemorrhage, crushing injuries, etc.” </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">—Webster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;L Shock results when the vital organs do not receive enough blood to maintain health. The outward manifestations are a cold, clammy and pale skin, mental dullness, physical weakness, very low blood pressure and a fast but &quot;thready” pulse. What causes this condition helps us to appreciate how wonderfully the Creator made man’s circulatory system. In the state of health a certain volume of blood courses through the blood vessels and a certain blood pressure is maintained, provided that the heart beats at a certain rate and the blood vessels have a certain capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">C, Should the blood volume suddenly be reduced, as by wounds and especially burns, the body would at once compensate in three ways: liver, spleen and other blood storers pour into the stream the extra supplies of blood they have on hand, the blood vessels are contracted to make a smaller supply of blood reach farther, and the heart action is speeded up, both processes being triggered by the sympathetic nervous system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">C However, all this can go only to a certain point. When the blood loss goes beyond the capacity of these other organs to compensate, “shock” is the result, and if it goes beyond that, death ensues. Of course, should chemical, nervous or mental factors interfere with the operation of any of the three factors involved, the result would be the same. Shock has therefore been aptly described as being due to &quot;a disparity between the size of the intravascular </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">space,</span><span class="font17"> the amount of circulating fluid </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">volume </span><span class="font17">within the space, and the degree of blood </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">pressure</span><span class="font17"> applied to that volume by the heart muscle.”—</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Seminar,</span><span class="font17"> Summer 1956.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Q</span><span class="font16">ERSONALLY, I heard no noise, no sound. I was suddenly wide awake and saw a huge flash of light all over the city from the window of my bedroom. In the deathlike hush that followed voices began to call. &quot;Get under the bed, I believe it’s an earthquake,” said one. “I've got glass in my mouth!” cried another.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19561022_files/g_E_19561022-9.png" alt="" style="width:187pt;height:122pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">We rose quickly and, partly dressed, proceeded across fallen Venetianblinds and broken glass from the window out into the hall. The couple from the next room came out at the same time. Downstairs a surprise greeted our eyes: The front door, which was very strong, hinged in three places and double-locked and braced, had been blown completely across the room as if by a mighty hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A quick check revealed that all the windows in the house were broken, even though they have steel frames, and in some places they were almost pulled from the wall. Large chunks of cement and hundreds of pieces of broken glass were scattered over beds and floors and were imbedded in the opposite wall. The upstairs ceilings were cracked and some began to sag. A hole in the roof was large enough to crawl through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What had happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Someone in the house looked out the back window and called to us. A huge column of fire was reaching hundreds of feet into the air. It rose from the vicinity of the army station on Calle 25 with</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Carrera 1. Perhaps there is more ammuni</span><span class="font16">tion there and other explosions will take place! So thinking, we dressed more completely so as to be more presentable and came back downstairs where we would be safer. No one was hurt except for a few cuts from flying glass or a bump on the head from pieces of concrete. Seeing the neighbors in the street, we gathered with them to try to learn what had happened. It is doubtful if the complete story will ever be known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">According to conversation that was going around within a few minutes after the explosion, a caravan of trucks loaded with some kind of high explosives was parked at the army station and had exploded. The president, Rojas Pinilla, referred to the trucks in his address in Cali later, but did not explain. The number of trucks that exploded does not appear certain, although it has been reported as six. Although the explosive was generally referred to as dynamite, the. impression of many present is that the explosion was of something more powerful, such as nitroglycerin. For example, people in the section were covered with a black, greaselike substance after the explosion that washed off somewhat like grease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Damage and Casualties</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">People were awakened some thirty kilometers away. Our house, damaged as referred to above, was some ten blocks away. A piece of the chassis of a truck</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">fell through the roof of another house on our street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">At the point of explosion a crater appeared some 30 feet deep and nearly 200 feet long. The army </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">building housing some </span><span class="font18">320 soldiers was completely demolished, only the bare steel skeleton left standing in twisted, grotesque shapes. Of the soldiers, only two were left. The others had literally disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">From twojo four blocks in every direction there was total destruction. For many blocks, buildings must be rebuilt completely, not repaired. The house of an artist some eight blocks away almost collapsed. The cathedral in the center of Cali, seventeen blocks away, had its windows blown out and damage was done to the bishop’s house adjoining, It is almost impossible to go anywhere in Cali without seeing the effect of the explosion. At the Universidad del Valle, completely on the other side of town and some fifty-five blocks away, heavy glass doors framed in steel were broken by the same shock waves of destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">By daylight some sense of order was felt, yet oppression and death hung heavily over the city. A haze from the great fires hung low and the unceasing whine of the fire and police sirens continued, even into the next night, before there was any letup. Police, soldiers and firemen battled valiantly along with volunteer workers of the Red Cross, doctors, nurses and officials of the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Only official cars and rescue trucks or equipment were allowed in the danger section of the city. Literally thousands of people flocked to the area, making rescue operations more difficult, some looking for friends or loved ones, but mostly just out of curiosity. In a borrowed car I drove in the parts where I was permitted, to check on the safety of friends. Every street was covered with broken glass and other debris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Even yet ft is impossible to state the </span><span class="font18">number of dead and wounded. By August 11, 1,500 'were reported dead unofficially. The number authorized to be released </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">was 1,097, although still unofficial. </span><span class="font18">The official numbed of identified dead was 351. Between Tuesday and Wednesday some 544 bodies and parts of bodies were buried in a common grave, many of whom, naturally, were not identified. When one considers the fact that, of the soldiers who were destroyed in the building nearest the explosion, most will be unidentified and perhaps for a great part not found, it can be seen that the number of dead is very high. The number of wounded has been put at 1,800 to 2,000; but, again, people in private homes many blocks away generally dressed their own minor wounds and went about the work of reconstruction without reporting their injuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The cemetery just across the railroad, some two to four blocks away, with somewhat over 5,000 vaults, had over 90 percent of the vaults damaged by the explosion, according to the man in charge. Nevertheless, he states that no bodies came out of them as was at first reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">The Cause</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">What caused the explosion? In his first message to Cali the president hinted that the explosion was caused by his enemies in an act of sabotage. Later, however, when he was here </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">personally, he reversed this </span><span class="font18">statement by saying that he did not think that even his enemies would stoop so low. Some religious leaders, as might be expected from false religion, have blamed God, stating that this is punishment because some of that section was a bad section. These men fail to explain why their main church, the cathedral, and the bishop’s own house were damaged also, even though they are some seventeen blocks</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">away. Also many other churches were damaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The general consensus seems to be that it was simply an accident made by a stupid error. If it was just an accident, the people of Cali want to know who is to blame. Who permitted official trucks, loaded with such deadly cargo, to be parked in a city overnight, and on a public street at that? Why was not an order given to park them in some isolated place in the country, as must be done with private loads of dynamite?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">That knowledge was had of the danger is shown by the prevailing public opinion that the caravan was ordered moved twice from two other places before it finally parked for the night on Calle 25. Who should be held responsible for the great loss suffered, both personally in the case of the many dead and wounded and financially in the case of the businessmen in the section? This latter loss is estimated at well over 100,000,000 pesos, or roughly some 25,000,000 dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">These are questions that will be asked for a long time to come and questions for </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">which the petpie of Call deserve an an swer. The answer, however, appears to be </span><span class="font16">Slow in coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Another interesting point is the time of the explosion. First radio announcements and others gave the time as about 1:07 a.m. or 1:10 a.m. Later, government bulletins gave the time as 1:25. In fact, there is much about the explosion in Cali that needs to be explained. Generally speaking, the ordinary person has been told that an explosion took place in Cali—and this he already knew. When, why and of what, have not been successfully answered as yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Cali is still nervous. All the people can talk about is the explosion, even though calm has returned and good order prevailed from the first. Some have had paralysis strokes, heart failures and other infirmities, apparently as an aftermath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Nevertheless, there is one group of people who are talking about something else. Jehovah’s witnesses in Cali continue preaching about Jehovah's new world of righteousness, where even explosions will be a thing of the past.</span></p>

By the roadside stood a block of stone on which was carved the image of a man throttling a lion. The man pointed a sly finger at it and said to his companion: &quot;You see, ^e men are stronger than you.” A smile flickered on the lion’s face. “If lions knew how to carve,” said he, “you would often see a man with a lion on top of him.” &lt;$&gt; Looking at it from the physical standpoint, the lion had a point. Many men admit that the swipe of a lion’s paw would make a human heavyweight champion look puny. Some even say that the blow of a lion’s paw is the hardest in nature. But there are other claimants. A polar bear would gladly enter the ring in a contest for nature’s heavyweight championship. With one sweeping stroke of its paw a polar bear can lift a seal out of the water and land it stunned on an ice floe. That is a punch that should make any heavyweight contender swell with confidence!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Other bears, of course, would object to putting the crown on the polar bear.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Almost unbelievable is the strength of black bears. According to the owner of a private zoo, a large bear in Its death flurry has been known to seize a 500-pound wooden block and hurl it through the roof of a cabin. The grizzly bear thinks nothing of carrying a 200-pound deer under its arm. In times past men have arranged fights between grizzly bears and bulls. More than once men saw the bull's neck cracked with very first blow of the grizzly’s mighty paw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But whether a bear would come off victorious against a gorilla is some- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♦</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">thing else. In its hands a gorilla can break a thick branch, a * lion’s forearm or a leopard’s neck. Frightened gorillas have i bent two-inch steel bars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The reptiles also have claimants for the crown. Zestfully the alligator will test his jaw strength on other contestants. In the alligator’s jaw a large turtle’s hard shell is crushed as if it were paper. A 120-pound crocodile in France exerted a pressure between its jaws of 1,540 pounds! Giant pythons, if well anchored, can make a young elephant look helpless.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">But a full-grown elephant probably thinks itself entitled to be crowned as king of nature’s heavyweights. In some countries elephants are used to haul logs to a river. In Burma one elephant pulled a load of four tons— no </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">triQing feat,</span><span class="font17"> considering the absence of wheels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">‘ft With its 40,000-odd muscles, the elephant’s trunk is enormously powerful. With it an elephant can lift a man like a matchstick and catapult him 120 feet. In South Africa a man once came upon the skeleton of a large crocodile high and dry fourteen feet in a riverbank tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">He questioned the Africans and learned the story: The crocodile had had the temerity to seize, of all things, the trunk of a drinking elephant. Enraged, the elephant trampled the crocodile to death, hurling it high up into the tree!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">■g But to crown the elephant without seeing a whale in action would be a mistake. The blue whale, after all, is more than a hundred feet long and weighs well over a hundred tons. An elephant by comparison is a mere pygmy of about five tons. The blue whale's pulling strength has been estimated at 400 horsepower. “A female blue whale,” writes Ivan Sandersen in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Living Mammals</span><span class="font17"> of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the World, </span><span class="font17">&quot;once pulled a twin-screw, steel-hulled, ninetyfoot whale-chaser with her engines going full « speed astern, forward at an aver* age speed of five knots for eight and a half hours, despite the fact that there was a quarterton harpoon embedded in the animal’s back.” What tremendous pulling power is packed into the huge body of the blue whale!</span></p>

<p><span class="font26">A</span><span class="font16"> HUNDRED and thirty-five million radios, plus nearly forty million television sets are resounding with the great debate over who will be the next president of the United States. Both parties are pressing every effort toward getting their views accepted. The public gets an insight into the intricate workings of the American system, and the eyes of the world focus on the selection of the next president of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The actual choosing of the candidates started long ago, but their final selection really occurred at the Republican and Democratic conventions held during August. The conventions were as different as the problems they faced. The Democratic convention was a place of turbulent uproar, and in the end there was an appearance of good fellowship all round. In comparison, the Republican meeting was a “kind of respectable trance” that came to life only with tile arrival of its one and only choice for the nomination, President Dwight D. Eisenhower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Democrats</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Have Their Day</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Democratic convention was by far the best TV fare, as far as the home viewers were concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the keynote address Tennessee’s 36-year-old Governor Frank Clement cried against the party in power: “How long, O how long shall these Republican outrages endure? How tong, O how long will Americans permit the national welfare to be pounced upon at home and gambled abroad? How long, O how long will Republican roustabouts engage in a sideshow scramble for power and privilege?”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“Rise up as one man,” he said, “and smite down those money-changers who have invaded and violated the people’s temple of justice.” He spoke of “corruption in high places, involving an unprecedented spree of giveaways, grab and greed.” And he called to the farmer: “Come on home before it’s too late. Your lands are studded with the white skulls and crossbones of broken Republican promises.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But the Democratic disagreement was not just with the Republicans, but also among themselves. When Adiai E. Stevenson seemed far in the lead on prospective votes, former Democratic president Harry S. Truman made a spectacular announcement that he was backing Stevenson’S opponent, Averell Harriman, governor of New York. He said that this is no time for trial-and-error leadership, and that</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Harriman’s experience would be best The New York Times said Truman '.‘came deliberately to take control of the Democratic party away from Adlai E. Stevenson,” but that he had apparently mistaken his popularity for power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Would Stevenson ride out the Truman crisis successfully? To many professional politicians Stevenson is an intellectual. Though his goals are similiar to, his manners and methods are almost the direct opposite of Truman’s. Some people think this is to his advantage, but certainly Truman and his friends do not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">I'ruman’s opposition failed and Stevenson wound up with a resounding first-ballot victory: 905$ votes to Harriman’s 210! Perhaps Stevenson could even be thankful to Truman. He came out a stronger candidate as a result of the fight. One Stevenson adviser said: &quot;We took a sock in the nose from Harry Truman and found out it didn’t hurt at all.” </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font18"> added: “On the convention’s final night, Harry Truman walked down the ramp to the platform, faced the delegates—and ate crow as though it were squab. Adlai Stevenson, he said to tumultuous applause, was indeed a fighter, because ‘he’s given some of us here a pretty good licking.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Stevenson’s acceptance speech laid out his plans. He said we stand “on the threshold of a great, decisive era,” in an “America where poverty is abolished and our abundance is used to enrich the lives of every family” through government action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">But what about the vice-presidential candidate? Who would he be? Stevenson left that entirely up to the delegates, without a word about his personal choice. Would it be smiling, hand-shaking Senator Kefauver of Tennessee? young Senator John Kennedy of Massachusetts, or Tennessee’s Albert Gore? On the first ballot Kefauver, who had withdrawn from the presidential candidate race in favor of Stevenson, polled 483$ votes, Kennedy 304, Gore 178. On the second ballot Kennedy surged ahead, but* when he was just 38| votes short of the nomination, Gore withdrew in favor of Kefauver. Oklahoma switched to Kefauver, Minnesota swung solidly behind him—the stage was set, and Kefauver won the nomination with a final count of 755J to Kennedy’s 589.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">.* . And the Republicans Have Tkeirs</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">In sharp contrast with the Democratic convention’s excitement, all seemed serene at the Republican gathering. Huge demonstrations were planned to/'erupt spontaneously at a given signal,” but a little more drama would have brightened up the enthusiasm, at least of the TV audience at home. The Republicans’ convention was four days instead of the Democrats' five, but, even so, their choice of candidate was so obvious that they seemed to be suffering an embarrassment of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">In the Republican keynote speech, balding, blue-eyed Arthur Lanjdie, governor of Washington, answered Democratic charges and raised a few of his own. He said the Democrats had “left us a staggering national debt, a greatly reduced value of the dollar, a colossal bureaucracy and vastly increased taxes.” </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">He said: “The </span><span class="font18">Democratic party was responsible for the security of our country and of the free world precisely when Communist </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">world </span><span class="font18">aggression achieved its maximum success, when the nations of Eastern Europe were lost to freedom and when, on another continent, China became part of the Communist empire.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">His own party, he contended, has “done more than just talk about peace; we have worked for it.” Other points of his address: “Under the new Republican laws in the first six months of 1956 average farm prices steadied and then went up. They are still going up.” “Our policies have</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">sustained over 66 million peacetime jobs for American men and women at the highest wages in our history?’ “We have witnessed the greatest gains for civil rights over a period of 80 years.” “We have checked the runaway inflation we inherited from the previous administration. We have reduced taxes,” The American people, he said, will &quot;throw the Republicans out of office the day when, if ever, they copy the Democrats and put the party first and America second,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The real life came into the convention, however, with the arrival of President Eisenhower. His position of party leadership was obvious, and his renomination as his party’s candidate was unquestioned. Big issues, like isolationism, that formerly split the Republicans seem to melt under his personal power. And his acceptance speech lifted his policies toward a bold future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">With the theme “I hold that man is in the right who is most closely in league with the future,” he said: “Today I want to demonstrate the truth of a single proposition: the Republican party is the party of the future. . . . For this reason [they] will be decisively approved in 1956.” He envisioned a tomorrow when the pain of crippling disease would be vastly reduced, when political wisdom would ensure justice and harmony, and when man could enjoy “the full realization of all the good things in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Despite certain opposition, only a flat last-minute turndown by President Eisenhower would have prevented Vice-President Nixon from being renominated as the Republican candidate for that post No such turndown was expected; none came. Nixon’s nomination was unanimous. He said the Republicans were running on the record of the Eisenhower administration with its belief “in human welfare but not the welfare state,” and in social gains but not the socializing, federalizing or nationalizing of basic American institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Analysis</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The platforms of both political parties look to the future and spell out major responsibilities. In a direct switch from the 1952 campaign, the Democrats are saying it is time for a change, while the Republicans are the ones who are saying: “You never had it so good.” The Democratic campaign is based on charges of “betrayal” of natural resources, attacks on the farm program, on foreign policy, and on VicePresident Nixon. The Republican campaign, on the other hand, is based on the “peace and prosperity” slogan, and on their exceptionally popular candidate, President Dwight D. Eisenhower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Thus, the United States now finds itself in the midst of charges and countercharges as it follows the twisting, bumpy road that leads to November 6—the date on which the people will decide which candidate will be the next president of the United States,</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">&quot;Shin Yung-Hi, eldest daughter of Han Sung-Hwa, 185 Yongdungpo Dong, Seoul, 28 years of age, has been a mental patient for some time. Her mother, hearing of the rumor that some pastor can heal by offering prayer and by treating the sick portion of the body, requested Lee Soon-Ryae, 38 years, 447 Yangpyung Dong, Seoul, who is a steward of the Sae-ma-ul Presbyterian Church, to come and 'heal my daughter’s disease by prayer* on August 23rd at 12:00 p.m. Accepting this request, the steward, believing that God heals even handicapped ones when prayer is offered, sat on Miss Shin’s stomach and rubbed and beat her chest and cheeks from 1:00 p.m. to 5 p.m. The patient Anally died from suffocation.

<p><span class="font18">&quot;According to the information rendered by the 7th Security Bureau a church in Kyo Dong, Kanghwa-kun, sponsored a revival preaching assembly on August 9th.

<p><span class="font4">&quot;Father McDonnell tells us in his article, 'God and the Patriot/ *We are bound by civil laws to defend our country/ This is true, but he continues and says, ‘The law of God also binds us to defend our country.’ This the average Catholic does, although, according to St, Thomas the law only applies if it is a just war* Now let us ask ourselves how can any of these modern wars possibly fit the conditions of a just war. To most Catholics all wars are just. See how in World War I, the German . . . CJatholies hated and killed their American and English brothers and we, acting in a like manner, killed our German brethren In Christ. In World War II this same horrible scene was repeated when most Catholics obeyed their respective States and in hatred and fear killed those whom Christ insists they love. Since we have obeyed Caesar and not Christ, we still live in a world filled with hate and fear, in a world which still vainly cries for peace. We are called to Christian warfare but we continue to indulge in carnal warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘If the State would order us to kill ourselves we would refuse to obey, either out of love for the law of God or because of love of our own skin* However, if the State tells us to kill our innocent brother living in another land, we generally do so, forgetting entirely, ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself' and that ‘Love does no evil to a neighbor? It seems we are always ready to meet evil with eviL To do evil rather than suffer evil. Charity (Love)—It seems to have grown so cold in our modem world. Why can we not return cruelty with mercy and hate with love as the Divine Master tells us? Why can we not say with St. Peter that we will obey God rather than man?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Pussy cats may still have it over most of us, as far as seeing at night, but not over the United States Air Force. This is because the Air Force now has an electronic “cat eye” that can see In the dark with daylight clarity. Known popularly as “cat eye,” it is an optical amplifier. It greatly intensifies light that is always present but unseeable to the human eye. It Is about 1,000 times more sensitive than a television camera. With the “cat eye*' pilots at night can view the ground on a TV-like screen and see it as if it were daylight The “cat eye” presents “a cathode ray tube image not unlike a television picture,” the Air Force said. “In a flight test at Wright Air Development Center, airborne observers were able to see the ground clearly on a moonless, winter night.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">./reading clinics, that in colleges even pro-' f&amp;sors enroll and that books on speed reading go through printing after printing, you will want to know whether this would foe of any value to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Would it be of value to you? Yes, probably you can improve both your speed of reading and your understanding of what you read. You can learn to see more words at a time, to quit wasting time by looking back at previous words, to pick out the main ideas and to concentrate better than you now do. These parts of the speedreading theory are good. But you cannot skim through two or three thousand words a npnute, picking out only key words or the'opening and closing sentences of the paragraphs, and still think that you really have learned anything from what you have read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">William G. Perry, Jr., and Charles P,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font22">though some of the news reports that you see about speed reading might make you think you could. Actually a couple of thousand words a minute is slow going in comparison with some of the speed-reading cult’s claims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">One Denver newspaper shouted: “52,-000 Words a Minute Read by [University of Denver] Coed in Whiz, Quiz Test/’ Do you believe that? Do you believe anyone could whip through 150 columns of this</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font22">magazine in a minute?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The newspaper said that this student read 4,198 words in a mere 4,8 seconds, with 100 percent comprehension. But if you read the article carefully you learned that even when she slowed down to a mere 16,550 words a minute on a novel by William E. Barrett he reported that she had merely a “brief grasp” of what she was supposed to have read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">There is so much to read today that almost everyone is impatient with his reading rate. Many people read at the same speed that they talk, something like 150 words a minute. Others can read 300 to 500 words in a minute. Among one group of businessmen the average was about 250. Perhaps, as one of these people, when you hear that business executives are going to Whitlock of Harvard University wrote in the </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic Monthly:</span><span class="font22"> “We have talked so much about selection and skipping that we must face up to the charge of recommending superficiality/* Such skimming is like reading just the headlines of a newspaper. You can get the idea of the day's events from the headlines, but they are so brief that often you can get the wrong impression from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">You would have gotten the wrong idea from the headline of the afore-mentioned Denver news report. Only after carefully reading the article would you know that the woman did not really know what she had read after all. Such misinformation can lead to shallow thinking and wrong decisions. The ability to skim and skip is of value in getting through the mass of</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">reading material that faces us today and into what is really worth our time. But we must then take the time to see what that worthwhile material really says if we want to benefit from it</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">If you watch out for this danger, then the principles that are used in the reading clinics can be of value to you. Apparently it is true that the average person reads twenty-five to fifty percent slower than he is capable </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font18"> reading, and that he actually can learn more and remember better when he reads at his faster speed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">There are several things that the really skillful reader does that you can learn to do. Some of these things are mechanical, that is, they concern such things as the way you use your eyes to perceive what is on the page. Others are mental, that is, they concern the way you comprehend and interpret the little black marks on the page, converting them back . into the thought that the author recorded. Here we shall consider principally the mechanical problem of how you perceive what is on the page.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Bow Many Words Do Yau See?</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Some people read like a two-fingered typist. They look at a word, say it, then look at the next word. They continue this word-by-word process at a slow rate of up to 150 words a minute, quickly tiring, and often remembering little of what they read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Speed readers say that this is like transferring a thousand marbles from one box to another by picking them up one at a time instead of grabbing whole handfuls, to get the job done much faster. They say that as the hand can hold more than one marble, so the eye can see more than one word—that it can see whole handfuls of them, and that as you read them faster you read more nearly at the speed at which you think. Thus you will become more interested and can concentrate easier, for the thinking part of your mind will not get bored and wander off while the reading half picks up the words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The skillful reader’s eye takes no longer to absorb three or four words at one fixation than the poor reader takes to fix his eye on a single word. And the word-byword method further hampers understanding by bringing the meaning choppily, instead of in the thought units in which the words were written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Most people already read more than one word at a time. If you do not think this is so, then have someone read this paragraph while you sit by his side holding a small mirror'in such a way that you can watch the pupils of his eyes. You will see that they do not move smoothly along the line of type, but jerk across it in little stops. The seeing is not done while the eye is in motion, but only during the stops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">As you watch the reader’s eyes, jot down the number of times that they stop while he reads each line of these paragraphs, then count the words on each line that he read. If his eyes stopped three times on a line of six words, he saw an average of two words at each fixation. Even if they stopped as much as five times on a line of six words, which is very unlikely for a good reader, there was at least once that he saw two words at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">After you have done this you can exchange positions with the reader and have him count the number of times your eyes stop on each line, and the number of times you regress while reading a paragraph. Both of these figures may prove enlightening to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">How does a person who now reads word-for-word learn to see three or four words at a time? The reading clinics use projectors to flash several words at a time </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">on </span><span class="font18">a small movie-type screen. These words appear for such short fractions of </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font18"> second that it is impossible for the reader to make</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">more than </span><span class="font22" style="font-variant:small-caps;">gob</span><span class="font22"> fixation. That is, he cannot look, then move his eyes and look again, but he learns to see the whole group of worts at once. Some people see four or five worts at a single fixation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">How can you increase the number of words you see at a time? You cannot do it by thinking too much about it, for the movement of the eye in reading, much like digestion, is almost an unconscious action. The best way for you to develop this ability is to read a good deal of easy, interesting material. In material that is both interesting and easy for you to read, your eyes naturally take in groups of words at a time. You can practice on narrow newspaper columns too, trying to get the meaning of a whole line by letting your eyes rest on it only once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">But this is not the only thing that will speed your reading. Perry and Whitlock, who think the problem is more one of comprehending what you see than of extending your eye span, said in the afore-mentioned Atlantic </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Monthly</span><span class="font22"> article: “In its proper place a really good reading gadget can be very useful, especially those which stretch the pace of the reader on regular consecutive reading and then let him discover by a rigorous check that he can do better than he had thought.” You can act as your own reading accelerator by constantly forcing yourself to read a little faster than you have been doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Regressions* Vocalizing* Head Swinging</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Something else that will improve your reading speed is to break the habit of going back to see if you read correctly. Everyone does this at times, but the poor reader often reads meticulously, digesting and redigesting every sentence and paragraph to see if he got it right. He gets so involved in the details that he often misses the main theme. Like the tourist who cannot see the forest for the trees, this reader cannot see the main thought for all the words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Plowing straight ahead without regressing will improve your speed, unify the train of thought, add to your concentration and aid the smooth absorption of ideas—which is your main purpose in reading anyway. Unless the material is especially difficult regressions to any great extent are unnecessary. How can you overcome the bad and sometimes almost unconscious habit of regressing? Simply by replacing this bad habit with the good one of plowing straight ahead and of going back only when you really did not get what the paragraph *was talking about, not just because you have lost faith in your ability to understand it or because you have the bad habit of regressing at the slightest provocation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Another mechanical barrier to rapid reading is the habit of forming the worts with\your mouth or vocal cords, actually saying the worts to yourself while you read. If you do this you probably read very slowly, about 120 to 150 worts a minute. If you continue to form the words with your lips or with your vocal cords you will never be a fast reader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">To test whether you do this, put your fingers over your lips, read silently, and see if your lips move. If you do have this habit it may be necessary to put your fingers over your mouth and hold your Ups still until the habit is broken. But this effort will be well worth while, for you should be able to read at a much faster mental pace if you do not slow yourself down to the audible one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The most rapid reader says nothing, hears nothing and sees all. He sees the action, the movement and the sounds that the worts describe, rather than the words themselves. Like listening to someone speak, he is far less aware of the worts than he is of the ideas that they present</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Other mechanical problems that will hamper your speed are head swinging and poor eye return. If it is necessary to do so, lock your head between your hands to develop the habit of moving only your eyes. Visualize the line quickly and then swing your eyes (not your head) back to the beginning of the next line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Skimming</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Another principle that is applied by the proponents of rapid reading is to read for the main ideas and let the details take care of themselves. This assumes that most people are so concerned with the details that when they have finished reading they have a jumble of details vaguely in mind, but not the few main points. In this respect this principle probably is true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">But the danger is that in skimming for the main ideas at speeds of ten or fifteen times the speed of normal speech you cannot expect to get much out of what you read. If, for example, you wanted to know merely that this article is about speed reading, that it shows that you cannot get the details at fantastic speeds, but that you can measurably increase your speed by learning to see more words at a time, by being forced to read faster, by not regressing and by not moving your lips, then you</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">could learn that by </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">skimming</span><span class="font22"> through this article in just a few seconds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">But you can also learn it by spending just 10 to 20 seconds to read the middle fifty words </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">in that last sentence!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Then why did you read the whole article? Becaqse you wanted the details. You wanted to know how these things are done. You wanted to see if there was logic behind each of the points, and therefore whether you should accept them. Further, you wanted to get them right, not just get a superficial view. And to get these details you must read—read rapidly, perhaps, but </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">read,</span><span class="font22"> not just skim!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Perhaps this suggests to you that you should have more than one reading speed. You should. On lighter material you can shift into high gear and skim through the pages. But you cannot read important material that way. It is best to have a variety of speeds and methods of approaching material, depending upon your purpose in reading. If the material is inconsequential it can be dealt with lightly; if it means your Jife it should receive the attention it deserves. By improving your reading speed you will be able to get rid of the inconsequential material quicker, and to have more time to spend with the things that really are important.</span></p>

<p><span class="font28">H</span><span class="font22">ALLOWEEN, more formally known as the vigil of Hallowmass or All Saints' Day, masquerades as a solemn religious observance of highest rank. According to celebrants, it Is the most propitious time for ghosts, evil spirits and shivering souls of the dead ones to make social calls. On this day also youngsters get a delinquent glint in their eyes. And much to their surprise, they often find grownups unusually co-operative come this night of ghosts, goblins and goose bumps. A mayor whose city was swept with Halloween vandalism remarked: “I sat through it and watched it all. I enjoyed myself. It was Halloween night.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Churches, schools, clubs and lodges contribute to the Halloween festivities by holding parties, some of them offering free cider, doughnuts and candy for the children. The Tulsa Tribune printed this blazing headline: &quot;Halloweenies Find Devil’s Den in Church?* A Methodist church, with all its hidden stairways, narrow corridors and dark rooms, was said to be &quot;a perfect locale” to stage a hair-raising, spine-tingling Halloween party. &quot;Silent ghosts met the guests as they entered the church and led them up and down hidden staircases and through a chamber of horrors known as the ‘devil’s den.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">But have you ever stopped to ask yourself, what does all of this superstition of witches, ghosts and hobgoblins, tabby cats and jack-o’-lantems have to do with Christianity? Does the claim in itself make it Christian? Most certainly the vandalism, violence and destruction wrought on this night stamp the occasion not Christian, but demonic, Even a surface investigation is enough to uncover the pagan influence behind this celebration and establish its opposition to Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">According to Ripley’s &quot;Believe It </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">ar </span><span class="font22">Not,” Halloween (Allhallows’ Eve), the eve of Al] Saints* Day, was Instituted by &quot;Pope Boniface IV to commemorate his conversion of the pagan pantheon of Rome into a Christian place of worship 612 AJJ.” Many centuries before this, however, the ancient demon-worshiping Druids, who feared and worshiped the dead, observed a similar festival on October 31. On that night, the Druids believed, the Lord of the Dead, Prince of Darkness, whom the Bible tails the Devil, assembled all souls who had been confined to the bodies of animals upon death, and shipped them on to their final resting places. Cats were believed to be humans changed into animals for some misdeed. The souls of the wicked were turned into black cats. Until quite recently, black cats were burned alive on Halloween, night. It was the worst fate imaginable to encounter a black cat along the road on Halloween, a superstition that has stuck to this day.—Ephesians 6:12; John 12:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The old Celtic calendar had New Year's Eve fall on October 31, and November 1 was the first day of the new year. The pagan Celts seriously believed that on the eve of the new year the souls of the dead took their last fling of the season. The spirits roamed the earth unmolested and were appeased by the food, drink and sacrifices of the living. Huge bonfires were lit for a twofold purpose—to give the old year a big send-off and to keep away evil spirits. In Wales the Druidic priests kept a fire alive on a large stone altar the year round. On the eve of the new year the old fire was</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">let die and a new fire was begun. Worshipers would snatch live coals off the altar and dash home to light their own fires with then?. These were thought to be holy fires capable of purifying a home of all evil. They were also thought to free souls from purgatory; that is why the sites of the bonfires were called Purgatory fields. Often butter was left in the open for souls returning from purgatory to soothe their purgatory bums with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">In the eighth century effigies were burned in these bonfires, or a pretense was made of burning a living person in them. There are grounds for believing that Druidic priests actually offered up live human and animal sacrifices on these occasions. In the Persian rites of Zoroastrianism fire was believed to purify all coming in contact with it. To come near to holy fires was to receive special light from the gods and to be cleansed of all sins. For this same reason Baal worshipers 'caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech.’ Parents desired their children to be free from original sin. However, through this purgation many a helpless babe became a victim to the bloody demon god Molech.—Jeremiah 32:35, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">This very same belief about the “purifying” efficacy of fire is held to by the Roman Catholic Church today. By maintaining the existence of a purgatory Catholic priests openly teach, as firmly as ever ancient fire worshipers did, that literal fire can purge away the guilt and stain of sin. These priests hold that the least sin-stained individual must pass through purgatorial fires before he can find favor with God. Jehovah, however, calls such teaching an abomination. To those who passed their children through the literal fire unto Molech, Jehovah said: “I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.”—Jeremiah 32:35, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Instead of fire’s purging sins away, God’s Word says: “We have the release by ransom through the blood of that one [Christ Jesus], yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses.” “The blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.” So, according to God’s own Word, pagan Halloween or purgatorial fires have nothing to do </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">with </span><span class="font18">cleansing away sins. What cleanses away sin is the exercising of faith in the shed blood of Christ.—Ephesians 1:7; 1 John 1:7; John 3:16, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Who today that knows the Bible and loves God can honestly say that Halloween is a Christian holiday? Whoever heard of such paganisms in the Christianity of Jesus </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Christ and the</span><span class="font18"> apostle </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Paul? Halloween</span><span class="font18"> is a day of lies. It lies about the condition of the dead, saying that souls of men never die, that they enter animals and exercise influence over the living, whereas the Bible plainly says: “The soul that sinneth, it shall die”; “the dead know not any thing.” Therefore, they do not wander about, nor have they any power to influence the living. Halloween Ues about God’s means for redemption, namely, Jesus Christ, by maintaining that fire is necessary for the cleansing away of sin. Halloween is the Devil’s tool for repeating lies about God and his purpose.—Ezekiel 18:4, 20; Ecclesiastes 9:5; John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Halloween, therefore, is God-dishonoring and wicked. Christians will have nothing to do with it.—1 Thessalonians 5:21, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">22.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T rinidad</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">S</span><span class="font16">OME of the islands of the Caribbean area are quite small. Flying over them one might be moved to say, “So mijfh water! So little land!” Even Trinidad, the largest island in the group, is only some fifty miles long and thirty-five miles wide. It is from the island of Trinidad that the Watch Tower Society directs the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses in some of the British islands in this vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the pleasant tropical atmosphere, among friendly, easygoing people, Jehovah's witnesses actively carry on their God-given assignment to preach the good news of the Kingdom. They have had good success. On some of the islands the good news has been preached for many years, so that most of their numbers are native residents. There are also some foreign missionaries who were trained at the Watch Tower Bible School of Gilead and were sent here to assist in the preaching work, to open up new fields and organize congregations. The missionary motor vessel “Light” has visited the smaller islands, called the Grenadines, a number of times. Much interest has been aroused in the work of Jehovah's witnesses, A new congregation has resulted in the little island of Carriacou.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The method of preaching follows that exemplified by Jesus and his apostles. The ministers go from house to house and then follow up the interest, Most of the people are friendly. They readjly invite the witnesses in, and then listen to a short sermon on some Bible topic. The people have a great love for the Bible, which makes the placing of Bible translations rather easy. They listen attentively when you speak to them and often ask questions. By going back to those manifesting interest, a Bible study is arranged. At these studies questions are answered and a large number of people grow in knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes. They, in turn, speak the truth they learn to still others. In this way the gospel is being preached, congregations are swelling in attendance and many are helped on the road that leads to life</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Public meetings are very easy to hold in Trinidad. Most of them are held out in the open air, and a good attendance is almost a sure thing; unless, of course, it rains. People are afraid of cold, damp air and do not come out after a rain even if the night clears off. On a clear night, under a full moon, you can invariably expect a peak attendance. The audience becomes so engrossed in the speaker’s argument that they will often speak out with approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There is a problem that arises when Jehovah’s witnesses wish to hold larger assemblies. They seem unable to find a place large enough to accommodate their gatherings. Theaters are rented most of the time. They handle a fairly large group and are supported very well. The people love to assemble and do assemble, especially on Sunday when they are free from their work. At one of the last assemblies in Trinidad over 1,800 were present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The baptism talk and ceremony is a high point of each assembly. The people</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">here especially enjoy seeing the actual immersion. Here they can see for themselves that Jehovah’s witnesses are making disciples of men of all nations. At a recent assembly in Trinidad, an Indian who was formerly a Moslem was a candidate for Immersion. Standing nearby was a Portuguese man. Around him were a group of Negroes and those of mixed races. All of these were waiting to be baptized. That&lt;lay fifty-four were immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The film &quot;The New World Society in Action” was widely shown in the islands during the past year, with 46,512 in attendance. This has proved to be a very valuable way to break down prejudice and banish wrongly formed opinions of the work we do. One missionary reports, &quot;Many persons have had their eyes opened to the fact that Jehovah's witnesses are not just a local organization, as is shown by the following typical remarks: ‘But look at this, people from all nations, these witnesses must be ail over the earth by now.’ ‘I never realized your organization was that big.’ ” A </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">police</span><span class="font18"> officer had this to say of the film: “In St. Lucia where so many people cannot read, they are not able to grasp as much from a talk as we might imagine. But </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">something like this </span><span class="font18">film that they can see with the eye—this makes a greater impression.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">As a result of the zealous work done in Trinidad a tremendous increase has come about. Back in 1945 there were only 392 witnesses preaching the good news in this vicinity. Now, just ten years </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">later,</span><span class="font18"> the number has jumped to 2,291 regular ministers of the good news. This encouraging expansion has been observed by all and often remarked upon. A former chief justice of the Windward and Leeward Islands called this phenomenal growth a modem miracle. The Bible says it is Jehovah's doing. “The Lord Jehovah, who gathereth the outcasts of Israel, saith, Yet will I gather others to him, besides his own that are gathered.”—Isaiah 56:8, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Am.

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Integration and Mobs</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">&amp; When the U.S. Supreme Court decided against school segregation It left enforcement of Integration up to the federal district judges. In September mob violence threatened to nullify the desegregation orders by district courts. In a dozen towns In border states along the fringes of the deep South angry white crowds gathered to prevent school integration. Some mobs of segregationists were successful: the frightened colored children either did not enroll or, having enrolled, failed to show up for classes. In Clinton, Tennessee, a farming community of some-4,000, twelve colored children began classes along with 700 whites. There was no trouble. But trouble soon started when extreme segregationists from outside the state went into Clinton and whipped up mob violence. Mobsters smashed up cars on the main street To keep order the governor ordered some 600 National Guardsmen Into Clinton. With tanks, rifles and bayonets the troops guarded the high school while colored children went to their classes. In Sturgis, Kentucky, a mob of 500 tried to break through a ring of troops who were escorting colored children to school. There were sporadic outbreaks all across the South. In many cases accurate reports were not available, since the mobsters almost invariably drove newsmen from town. The New York Times said: &quot;The prospects for school desegregation seem exceedingly gloomy.” President Eisenhower said: &quot;It is difficult through law'-qnd through force to change a<sup>-</sup>man's, heart. . . . This Is a question of leading and training and teaching people and it takes some time, unfortunately.’'</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Arms for Afghanistan</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A land of mountains, Afghanistan is chiefly an agricultural country; Afghans live on a per capita income of less than $50 a year. Yet this primitive country is playing an important part In the East-West struggle. A pro-Western Afghanistan would strengthen the chain of alliances on Russia’s southern flank from the Balkans to Pakistan. So the U.S&gt; has put $50,000,000 into Afghanistan. Despite this the Afghans have been cool to the West, perhaps because most of the money went into projects the average Afghan Knows little about. The Soviet Union has courted the Afghans more adroitly. Moscow poured $14,000,000 into the country in such a way that the Afghans could see the results; thus Soviet money paved the streets of the capital, Kabul. Last winter the top Soviet leaders paid a visit to Afghanistan; they announced a 4100,000,000 credit for the country's agriculture and power and other projects. In September Moscow stepped up the wooing i reports to &quot;New Delhi said that Moscow has agreed to send Kabul guns, ammunition and planes. There Was deep concern in the West. A pro-Sovlet Afghanistan Would give the Communists a land bridge to the Moslem and Asian worlds. The looming danger, as some observers saw it, was an Afghan attack on U.S.-armed Pakistan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">A Prime Minister Steps Down </span><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; Politics In Pakistan have recently been in a state of turmoil. There even developed a rift in Prime Minister Mohammed Alfa own party. In September Mohammed All resigned as prime minister of Pakistan after a year In office. The prime minister Said that since he was resigning tran his party he felt It a “point of honor” to resign as prime minister also. He explained: &quot;It is my conviction, that if democratic institutions are to be worked successfully the leadership of the country must be vested In Parliament. If parliamentary leadership is continually subjected to the caprice of personal and power politics by elements external to it, the conventional democratic concepts and constitiv tional practices will have lost all their relevance.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">The Soviet Naclear Teats</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">4) Scientists can detect atomic explosions in faraway places through the use of seismograph equipment and by analysis of air samples. In August and In September the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission was busy announcing news of new Soviet nuclear explosions. Chairman Lewis L. Strauss revealed that the &quot;usual Soviet proving ground&quot; used for the testa la located in southwest Siberia, a landlocked area. &quot;The Soviet Union,” the chairman said, &quot;has never given the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">world any assurance with respect to the way in which it conducts nuclear weapons tests and has, in fact, never made an advance announcement of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font17"> of Its detonations or test series. Only three times has the Soviet made any statements about its weapons tests.” American officials felt somewhat nettled that Indian and Japanese spokesmen, who keep on protesting about American nuclear tests, remained silent about the Russian blasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Erasing Stalin’s Name</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Ever since the downgrading of Stalin began last February, the campaign of erasing his name has picked up momentum. In September the Supreme Soviet Parliament of the Soviet Union continued the campaign by deciding to erase Stalin's name from international peace prizes and domestic achievement awards. Henceforth peace awards will be known as International Lenin Prizes for Strengthening Peace among Peoples. The Soviet Prize Committee awards ten such peace prizes each year. Each will be accompanied by the usual 100,000 rubles, a diploma and a gold medal. Meanwhile, in Austria the Viennese saw further evidence of the erasing. Vienna’s Stallnplatz, or Stalin Square, was renamed Schwarzenberg platz in honor of Karl Philip Schwarzenberg, an Austrian Held marshal who commanded the allied armies opposing Napoleon and won the victory at Leipzig.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Russians Publish a Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Ever since the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, no Bible publishing has been permitted in Russia. But the latest twist of Kremlin policy has changed even this: the Soviet government granted the Moscow Patriarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church permission to print a Russian Bible upon the church’s own printing presses. The first edition of 25,000 copies recently came oil the presses. The Bibles are published in excellent type on good quality paper. An initial shipment of fifty copies of the Russian Bible was received recently by the Four Continent Book Corporation in New York. The selling price in New York is $10. In view of the scarcity of Bibles in Russia and the heavy demand for new books, the new Bible may be easier to buy in New York than in Moscow,</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Typhoon Emma</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$■ A gale is a storm with winds of 50 to 75 miles an hour. Typhoons and hurricanes are exceedingly violent windstorms with a velocity usually between 75 and 100 miles an hour. In September typhoon Emma was born in the area of the China Sea. No ordinary typhoon was Emma; it broadened out to become a 600-milewide colossus of destruction. Emma’s center winds whirled tempestuously as high as 155 miles an hour. The typhoon pounded Japan with 15 to 22 inches of rain, flooding homes and fields. It hit the U.S. fortress island of Okinawa with devastating force, cutting power lines, smashing windows, tearing off roofs, flooding homes, upsetting autos and setting free 36 vicious sentry dogs of the U.S. Army. A U.S. typhoon-tracking weather plane with 16 men aboard was engulfed by Emma’s destructive fury. The typhoon caused at least 50 deaths. It was the worst typhoon to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">hit</span><span class="font17"> Okinawa in seven years and the fourth to hit or sideswipe the island this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">The Railroad Bridge Disaster</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; Shortly after midnight on September 2, a ten-car train was traveling an eleven-mile stretch between Jadcherla and Mahbubnagar, India, when it ran into a twenty-foot singlespan bridge. It was raining hard. What was normally a placid rivulet was now a raging torrent. The locomotive </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">crossed the bridge safely. But </span><span class="font17">then the bridge quaked and collapsed. The tender and first two coaches broke loose at both ends and plunged into the monsoon-swollen torrent below. At least 112 passengers died; many were trapped in their berths. Most of the bodies were washed into a pond two miles downstream. What was left of the train was an odd sight: a locomotive on one bank of the stream and eight coaches on the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Suicide Statistics Released</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; Suicide is not a minor affliction of mankind. One statistician estimates that about 310,000 members of the human race take their lives each year; no one knows how many more attempt to. In the U.S. the suicide rate, from 16,000 to 20,000 a year, is more than ten times the death rate from poliomyelitis. A pamphlet issued by the U.S. Mental Health Association shows that self-killings are not mainly the acts of aged persons; </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font17"> average age is from 25 to 35. Recently the World Health Organization released its new tabulation of the death rates by suicide in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">26 countries.</span><span class="font17"> No </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">figures were </span><span class="font17">available for Iron Curtain countries. Most of the Englishspeaking nations are in the middle of the list. At the top, statistics (In death rates per 100,0001 show. Denmark 24.1; Austria 23.4; Switzerland 21.8; Japan 20.5 and Sweden 18.6. The middle of the list: England and Wales 10.8; the U.S. 10.1 and Norway 7.7. At the bottom of the list; Italy 6.4; Scotland 5.5 and Ireland with 2.3. No explanation was offered as to why long-peaceful countries such as Switzerland and Sweden figured in the same high bracket as war-wracked Austria and Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">U.S.: Church Membership</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Record</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Only 36 percent of the American population was affiliated with churches or synagogues in 1900. In 1950 the percentage had risen to 57. In 1955, according to the new </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of American Churches,</span><span class="font17"> church membership reached 60.9 percent, or 100,162,529 persons. It was the first time in history that more than 100,000,000 persons in the U.S. were listed as regular church members. The book showed Protestants at 58,448,567 and Roman Catholics at 33,396,647, In analyzing the figures, however, one must take into consideration the fact that the Roman Catholic Church counts all baptized persons, including infants. Protestant churches usually count only those who have attained full membership. Dr. Benson Y. Landis, editor of the yearbook, said in a statement that the statistics gave “evidence of increased interest in religion in the United States,” but that &quot;the figures alone cannot tell how deep this interest goes or whether the nation is actually undergoing a spiritual awakening.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Moscow Horns Muted</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; The Moscow driver has long been used to slamming his foot on the gas pedal and his hand on the horn and pressing ahead. Recently Moscow authorities decided that horn blowing had to stop. When the ban went into effect it was clear that the greatest strain was on the motorists. They had to thread their way cautiously through masses of pedestrians who crossed streets with the usual disregard of the red lights, some of them roaring with laughter as they dodged cars with muted horns. The biggest strain on-the motorists, perhaps, was the penalty for tooting—not a mere fine, as in New York city, but loss of one’s driver’s license.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Beauty Shows and Culture</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; In Italy the Roman Catholic Church has long opposed the promoters of the Miss Italy contest. This year the beautycontest promoters decided to dignify the contest, held at the beach at Rimini, by injecting culture. A cultural quiz was held at the beach. The results? Disastrous. The beauties failed to identify Hamlet and Lucrezia Borgia. Romulus, the legendary founder of Rome, seemed to be unknown. No contestant knew the boiling point of water; one could not name a single Italian wine. Learning of the cultural fiasco, the Vatican newspaper Osser-</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">vatore Romano</span><span class="font17"> commented: &quot;The attempt to ennoble the beauty contest, to demonstrate that these feminine fairs are different from horse shows by virtue of God's gift of Intelligence, was shipwrecked on the beach at Rimini.”</span></p>

The Widow’s Mite Unacceptable
● The Jersey Journal, March 26, 1956, said: “Msgr. P. B. O’Connor, pastor of Queen of Peace Roman Catholic Church, North Arlington, startled his congregation yesterday. ‘To those of you who have not been here since last Palm Sunday,’ the pastor said, ‘I want to say that we do not accept silver in the collection basket. In fact, I am thinking of getting a basket which, if any coin is dropped into it it will automatically ring a bell and fire two shots in the air.’ It is reported that after this pastoral admonition, the collection baskets were as green as the palms.”

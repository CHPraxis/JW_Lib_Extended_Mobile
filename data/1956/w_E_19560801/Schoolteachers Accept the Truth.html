<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>From the Watch Tower Society’s Nigerian branch</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● I am writing to tell you that two out of four teachers at this school have now become Jehovah’s witnesses. They have joined us in the grand work of promoting true worship. All together, including myself, we are five in number. When I first started to preach to my fellow teachers they would joke about it and start arguing. But as time went on they began to listen intently and asked many reasonable questions. At our last circuit assembly these two teachers were baptized. It was a delight to see these two new brothers returning from the assembly full of joy, rejoicing in the truths set forth in <em>The Watchtower </em>and responding to the call by saying “Send me!”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● Because of their stand for the truth, the members of the Apostolic church tried their utmost to turn them away, but all to no avail. Finding their efforts failing, they began abusing us by calling us “bigots,” “intolerant,” etc. But these new brothers were not moved. They have all the latest publications and have obtained new Bibles. They are filled with love and enthusiasm and are continually studying. The more they go into the field the more and better are their experiences.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● Now the headmaster of the school and the other teacher are paying much attention. The headmaster even brings <em>“Let God Be True” </em>with him to school and is studying it very seriously.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● The fifth teacher, although not yet baptized, has already started preaching. One brother told me that he saw this teacher preaching near the court at the week end. Unable to answer a question he called the brother over for help. The three of us teachers who are brothers now give our students regular talks about Jehovah God and the new world after school is over.</p>

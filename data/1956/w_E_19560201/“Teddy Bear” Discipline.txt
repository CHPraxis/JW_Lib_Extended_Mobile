“Teddy Bear” Discipline
● Modern parents, in this age of delinquent youngsters, can take a lesson from the mother “teddy bear,” the koala. When baby koalas “are really naughty,” writes Ivan T. Sanderson in his new book Living Mammals of the World, “the mother turns them over her knee and spanks them on their bottoms for minutes on end with the flat of her hand, during which time their screams are soul-rending.”

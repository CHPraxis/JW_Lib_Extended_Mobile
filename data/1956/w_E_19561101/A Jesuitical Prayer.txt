A Jesuitical Prayer
● The Roman Catholic Jesuit magazine America, in its issue of March 31, 1956, said in an article entitled “Our Brother, the Jew” the following: “On Good Friday the Church bids us pray ‘ . . . that our Lord and God may take away the veil from their hearts, so that they, too, may know Jesus Christ Our Lord.’” However, the Jesuits published in their magazine only part of the Good Friday prayer—a phrase from the middle of it. In its more complete version this famous prayer runs as follows: “Let us also pray for the perfidious Jews; may the Lord our God remove the veil from their hearts so that they, too, may acknowledge Jesus Christ our Lord. Almighty Eternal God, Thou who dost not exclude from Thy compassion even the perfidious Jews, listen to our prayers which we offer on behalf of this deluded people, so that they see and recognize the light of Thy truth which is Christ and may be rescued from their darkness by the same Jesus Christ our Lord.”

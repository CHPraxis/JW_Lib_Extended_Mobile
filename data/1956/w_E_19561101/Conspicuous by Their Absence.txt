Conspicuous by Their Absence
● When preacher Alan Walker of the Methodist Church in Australia addressed 550 church leaders in Silver Bay, New York, he said that teen-agers were “conspicuous by their absence in American churches.” He suggested that Protestant churches had allowed their Sunday Schools to interfere with teen-agers’ attendance at regular worship services, and that “when they leave the Sunday School they leave the church.”—New York Times, July 16, 1956.

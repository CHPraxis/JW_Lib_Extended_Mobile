Soviets Printing Bibles
● In spite of the Communists’ official position that religion is an opiate for the people, they have been unable to stamp out the peoples’ need for religion or their clamor for the Bible. Thus the New York Times, September 4, 1955, tells that “the Soviet Union’s printing houses are producing 25,000 Bibles, containing both the Old and New Testaments, on popular request. The printing is being done under the auspices of the Russian Orthodox Church, which also will have charge of distribution.” Just another link in the chain of evidence that “the word spoken by Jehovah endures forever.”—1 Pet. 1:25, NW.

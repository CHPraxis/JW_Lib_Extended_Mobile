Turning Tables on the Pranksters
● Halloween has its origin in demonism, in the religious teaching that the dead are not dead but are more alive than ever. On that night mischievous youngsters call at the homes of their neighbors and demand a “treat” in the way of food or money or else they will do some mischief, a “trick.” How one of Jehovah’s witnesses handled the situation at the last Halloween is shown in the following:
●“On the night of October 31, a group of youngsters dressed up as witches and goblins called and demanded the usual ‘trick or treat.’ They were told that we did not have the usual treat but that if they returned in a few minutes we would tell them a Bible story. So they left to make a few more neighborhood calls. In the meantime we got our Bible out, but wondering whether they would return or not. Sure enough they did, and they were told the story of King Saul and the witch of Endor, which was tied in to an explanation of the real nature of Halloween. The children enjoyed it so much that they chose to visit a good while and when they left they said: ‘That’s the best “treat” that we’ve had all night.’”

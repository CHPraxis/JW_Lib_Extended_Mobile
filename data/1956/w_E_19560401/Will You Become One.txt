Will You Become One?
Jesus told those who would be with him in heaven: “I and my Father are one.” Of them he prayed to his Father: “That they may be one, even as we are one.” And of the earthly class he said: “There shall be one fold, and one shepherd.”
Both in heaven and on earth, all who gain life must become one. One in person? No. One in effort and purpose. There must be universal oneness under Jehovah. The Watchtower magazine will help you come to this oneness, for it reflects clearly and understandably the light from God’s Word, the Bible.

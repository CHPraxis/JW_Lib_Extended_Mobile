SHINING AS THE “LIGHT OF THE WORLD”—Matt. 5:14, 16, NW.
To shine one must heed Jesus’ instructions: “Let your light shine before mankind, that they may see your right works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.” It means to share in passing on to other persons information that will light the way they are to walk. The Watchtower is an aid to that end. Recommend it to others by going from house to house and obtaining a year’s subscription for only $1. During April three booklets dealing with important Bible subjects are to be given to each new subscriber.
‘GO, MAKE DISCIPLES!’
Jesus told all Christians to teach. Would you like to obey that command? Would you like to share your faith with others? Do you feel qualified? The book Qualified to Be Ministers will fill your need. It is for those not satisfied to ‘sit and listen’ only. It contains material on how to prepare and deliver sermons, simple rules on logic and argumentation, how to conduct instructive congregational meetings and direct unified activity in field missionary work, and reviews six thousand years of religious history, with special attention being given to the modern history of Jehovah’s witnesses. The book is for the novice as well as the most thoroughly trained Christian minister. With it you can fulfill the most important Christian activity—“Preach the Word!” Obtain your copy for only 50c.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● An answer in the November 15, 1955, <em>Watchtower </em>said Jehovah could, if he wished, destroy even an immortal creature. The booklet <em>What Do the Scriptures Say About “Survival After Death”? </em>says that if the demons had originally been created immortal they could not be destroyed from the universe. Which is correct?—J. L., United States.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The statement in the booklet about survival after death refers to immortality according to its basic meaning of deathlessness, indestructibleness. The other statement about God’s ability to destroy even an immortal creature rested upon the view that he is absolutely almighty without any limitation upon his own power by even himself. So this latter statement presented what seems in accord with this view. However, it enters into the realm of speculation, because it is in fact based on a speculative question.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Hence we are letting the statement in the booklet stand, in accord with the meaning of absolute immortality as conveyed in the Holy Scriptures. A fuller discussion on this may be expected in time in the columns of <em>The Watchtower.</em></p>

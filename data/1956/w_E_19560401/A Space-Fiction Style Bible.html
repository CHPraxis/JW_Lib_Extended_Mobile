<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><em>● </em>An Associated Press dispatch from Bristol, England, says an Anglican bishop suggested rewriting the Bible to get children interested in it. Said Dr. F. A. Cockin: “Many parents care very little about what happens to their children when they go to Sunday School—and the children themselves are no longer interested in old things like the Bible. If we were to rewrite the Testaments in terms of space fiction the church might achieve much.” The church of England must be in very sorry straits as regards its efforts to teach religion to children.</p>

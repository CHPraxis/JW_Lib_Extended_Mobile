<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Jesus told those who would be with him in heaven: “I and my Father are one.” Of them he prayed to his Father: “That they may be one, even as we are one.” And of the earthly class he said: “There shall be one fold, and one shepherd.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Both in heaven and on earth, all who gain life must become one. One in person? No. One in effort and purpose. There must be universal oneness under Jehovah. The <strong>Watchtower </strong>magazine will help you come to this oneness, for it reflects clearly and understandably the light from God’s Word, the Bible.</p>

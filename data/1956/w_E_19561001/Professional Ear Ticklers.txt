Professional Ear Ticklers
● In the United States there is an organization called the National Laugh Foundation. It recently gave out its 1956 awards. The winners were a politician and a clergyman. The awards go to Adlai Stevenson and Bishop Fulton Sheen for what the foundation calls their contributions to the humor of the nation. The Laugh Foundation’s awards could not help but remind thinking Christians of the Bible prophecy for the last days when “there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching, but, in accord with their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled.”—2 Tim. 4:3, NW.

The World Turned Upside Down
“1914—a year written with fire and blood in the history of man. The world war itself—and still more the conditions that followed—turned all accustomed notions and ideas upside down and inside out. Time was torn and splintered, ripped in two—we entered an altogether different era, morals became different, grosser and rougher than ever.”—Bokken Lasson in the Norwegian periodical Alt for damene, August 14, 1954.

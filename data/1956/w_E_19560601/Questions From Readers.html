<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● In the book <em>You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World, </em>on pages 281, 282, paragraph 14, it speaks of Hobab as the brother-in-law of Moses the prophet, whereas page 283, paragraph 16, quotes </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:11-7:4:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Judges 4:11</strong></a><strong>, <em>NW, </em>which states that Hobab was the father-in-law of Moses. How does the book harmonize with itself in treating Hobab in this double relationship to Moses?—B. G., United States.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name Hobab may be one name but it may apply to two separate individuals, namely, to a father and to his son. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:10:29-4:10:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Numbers 10:29</a>, which is quoted on page 282, says of Hobab the son whose sister Zipporah Moses married: “Then Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, the father-in-law of Moses: ‘We are pulling away for the place about which Jehovah said.’” (<em>NW</em>) Since Reuel the Midianite was Moses’ father-in-law, then Reuel’s son Hobab was the brother-in-law of Moses. This Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses is the one whom the chapter in the book is discussing as a prophetic picture of the present-day “great crowd” of the “other sheep” whom Jesus Christ, the greater Moses, is gathering to his fold today.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The chapter continues to discuss this same Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses in paragraph 16, but in the midst of this paragraph it quotes <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:11-7:4:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judges 4:11</a> according to the <em>New World Translation, </em>which reads: “Incidentally Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites, the sons of Hobab, whose son-in-law Moses was.” In rendering <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:11-7:4:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Judges 4:11</a> thus the <em>New World Translation </em>is in agreement with the literal translation by Dr. Robert Young, by J. B. Rotherham and by J. N. Darby, also the translation of the Jewish Publication Society, Moffatt’s translation and <em>An American Translation. </em>True, the <em>American Standard Version </em>does read: “Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses,” but in the marginal reading it says: “or, father-in-law.” And the <em>Revised Standard Version </em>reads: “Hobab the father-in-law of Moses.” So the decision of the majority is to make the translation read according to what the original Hebrew says.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">According to this, then, the name of Moses’ father-in-law was the same as that of his brother-in-law, namely, Hobab. Thus in the Scriptures several names are assigned to Moses’ father-in-law. In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:2:16-2:2:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 2:16-22</a> he is called Reuel; in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:1-2:3:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 3:1</a> he is called Jethro; in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:16-7:1:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Judges 1:16</a> he is called <em>Qeini </em>in the Hebrew, or “the Kenite, whose son-in-law Moses was.” The fact is that the rabbis of the Jews say that Moses’ father-in-law had seven names.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">If, however, we persist in arguing that Hobab was only the name of the son of Reuel and was the name of only the brother-in-law of Moses, then we must understand <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:4:11-7:4:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Judges 4:11</a> to mean that Hobab was Moses’ father-in-law only in a representative capacity. That is to say, Hobab acted representatively for his father Reuel who likely was now dead.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">So from either understanding of the matter the book <em>You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World </em>is not at disagreement with itself, neither is the <em>New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures.</em></p>

Ridicule Proves Nothing
Recently a reader of Our Sunday Visitor, “The Most Widely Circulated Catholic Weekly in the World,” wrote it relative to its slur on Jehovah’s witnesses. In reply the associate editor of the paper, “Rev.” R. Ginder, said: “But if you have had much to do with the Witnesses you must by now have realized that it’s not a religion—it’s a disease of the mind. I mean it. It’s a frenzy that seems to eat out certain sections of their intelligence. It makes them bullheaded, impervious to argument, and utterly incapable of handling the truth.” It was that way when Jesus was on the earth. Unable to answer his argument his opposers said: “He has a demon and is mad.” And Paul had the same experience even as Jesus foretold his followers would have. When Paul was making his defense before Governor Festus, in the presence of King Agrippa, Festus interrupted him to exclaim: “You are going mad, Paul! Great learning is driving you into madness!” It is therefore not surprising that the Christian witnesses of Jehovah today receive like reproach.—John 10:20; Acts 26:24, NW.

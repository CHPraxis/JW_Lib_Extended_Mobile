<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“What is your opinion about the subject of hell?” Pastor Emeritus Oluf Rothe, one of Denmark’s most noted clergymen, was asked by a newspaper on the occasion of his 50th anniversary as a Protestant priest. He answered: “Hell simply was a dumping place outside Jerusalem where the refuse from the city was incinerated. When Jesus talked about somebody’s going to hell he meant that the person did not deserve anything better than being taken to the dumping place. And the Gehenna here mentioned was so vast that refuse was incinerated there day and night—from thence the entire doctrine of hellfire originates which has been diligently employed to scare man for 2000 years!”—<em>Arbeiderbladet, </em>Oslo, Norway, November 29, 1955.</p>

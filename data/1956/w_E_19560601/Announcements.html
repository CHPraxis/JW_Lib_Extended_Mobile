<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>District Assemblies for the British Isles, Canada and the United States—1956</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The command to ‘assemble ourselves together’ constitutes important counsel to Christians. While this is regularly done within the congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses, keen interest is manifested when larger assemblies are arranged. It is now time to arrange for the 1956 assemblies and all will make their plans to attend one. Which one? The one of your choice. In its letter of April 23, 1956, to the congregations the Society has suggested that, in a few instances, if those in certain circuits will attend specified cities the facilities will accommodate the size of crowd expected more satisfactorily and at the same time a good witness will be accomplished in those cities.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Each of the 40 assemblies (six in the British Isles, eight in Canada and 26 in the United States) will be for four days and will have identical programs. Also, there will be Spanish programs at Waco and Lubbock, Texas, Phoenix, Arizona, and Long Beach, California. There will be an assembly not far from your home. Be sure to attend. (Assemblies will be held in many other lands too this year. For information write to the branch office of the Society nearest you.)</p>

<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb">Very graphically the warfare of God’s servants is described: “Go on acquiring power in the Lord and in the mightiness of his strength. Put on the complete suit of armor from God that you may be able to stand firm against the machinations of the Devil; because we have a fight, not against blood and flesh, but against . . . the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly [invisible] places.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:10-49:6:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eph. 6:10-12</a>, <em>NW</em>) The only way in which anyone can stand firm is to be equipped with the complete suit of armor from God. Ministers of God want to help others to understand this vital matter and will do so by using the “sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word,” to point out to good-will persons what to do. During June Jehovah’s witnesses will call on people and, after giving an oral Bible sermon, will offer printed Bible sermons in book and booklet form on a 50c contribution. This will be the means of helping many to start their all-important fight against the wicked spirit forces that dominate mankind as a whole.</p>

Preaching to Fellow Workers
Ever since the Society held its 1955 series of international assemblies in Europe it has been receiving glowing letters of appreciation and reports of interesting experiences enjoyed by the writers because of their having attended these conventions. Among such is the following by a witness in Virginia, who was among the 795 passengers on the chartered ship the Arosa Kulm: “For sixteen years I have been employed at the D.P. Manufacturing Company and all my fellow employees know that I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Upon my telling of my plans to attend the European assemblies this summer, the company gave me a fine write-up in its monthly magazine. As a result, upon my return many asked questions about the trip. In fact, I had the opportunity to speak to six different shop groups, with a total of 220 attending, the largest group having 114. I was given thirty minutes for these talks and took advantage of the opportunity to witness to them concerning Jehovah’s name and kingdom. Three of the shops invited me to give the talk in place of their usual safety meeting and at the other three I took the place of their regular Bible classes, which were being conducted by Sunday School teachers during lunch hours.”

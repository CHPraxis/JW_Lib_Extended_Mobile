“Physician, Heal Thyself”
● In the early part of February, 1956, the World Council of Churches met in Sydney, Australia, to consider “Christianity’s plans and strategy for Southeast Asia.” One of the speakers addressing the Council was the dean of Yale’s Theological Seminary, Dr. Pope. In discussing the problems facing them, Dr. Pope, among other things, made the following significant statement: “Divided and rent asunder in its own life, the church itself speaks in broken accents and sometimes seems to add to the confusion of tongues. The nations of the world might understandably reply to the church’s plea for international unity and peace: ‘Physician, heal thyself.’”—Time, February 13, 1956.

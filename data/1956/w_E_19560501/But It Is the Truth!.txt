But It Is the Truth!
● The schoolteacher of a certain Florida second grade had asked her pupils to write a Christmas story. The children were to ask her about any words they could not spell and she would write them on the blackboard where she had already written such words as “Christmas,” “stocking” and “Jesus.” Eight-year-old Richard asked her how to spell “celebrate” and “birthday.” After young Richard had finished his story the teacher, noting what he had written, exclaimed: “Richard, this is not nice!” What had he written? What he had learned from his mother, who is one of Jehovah’s witnesses: “There is no Santa Claus. Christmas is not Jesus’ birthday. We do not celebrate Christmas.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● The 1956 <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>shows that today there are forty witnesses of Jehovah in South-West Africa. However, back in 1945 there was but one lone witness. Recently this lone 1945 witness was visited and he told how he came to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Back in 1929 while working in a mine he kept getting eggs from a nearby farmer. These eggs were individually wrapped in paper, pages from a certain book. The printed matter on these pages struck a spark of interest and he kept on reading them, wondering where the book came from. Then one day the last page of the book was reached and on it he found the name and address of the Watch Tower Society. He wrote to the Society in Germany, obtained literature and soon thereafter took his stand for the truth. Today, at the age of seventy, he continues, a faithful witness for Jehovah.</p>

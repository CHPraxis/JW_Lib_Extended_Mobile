Faithful Transmission
● The new book The Dead Sea Scrolls by Millar Burrows brings up the question as to whether these scrolls change the Bible as we know it. The author answers with a categorical “nay.” In fact, both the Isaiah manuscript and the Habakkuk text confirm, as Burrows writes, that “the essential truth and the will of God revealed in the Bible . . . have been preserved unchanged through all the vicissitudes in the transmission of the text.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● The new book <em>The Dead Sea Scrolls </em>by Millar Burrows brings up the question as to whether these scrolls change the Bible as we know it. The author answers with a categorical “nay.” In fact, both the Isaiah manuscript and the Habakkuk text confirm, as Burrows writes, that “the essential truth and the will of God revealed in the Bible . . . have been preserved unchanged through all the vicissitudes in the transmission of the text.”</p>

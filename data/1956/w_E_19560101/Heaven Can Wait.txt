Heaven Can Wait
 J. J. Scherer, a Lutheran clergyman in Richmond, Virginia, for nearly 50 years, told a group of Roanoke ministers his view on going to heaven: “If tickets were offered me, one for a stay in heaven and the other in Virginia, I would choose the ticket to Virginia. I want to go to heaven—but not today.”—Dallas Times Herald, June 29, 1955.

Hungary: Education in Church
● From Budapest, American newspaper publisher Eugene Pulliam sent his papers a report on religion in Hungary: “In keeping with the new Soviet line of ‘sweetness and light,’ the Communist high command in Hungary revised its policy of persecution of priests and pastors. A program of so-called co-operation between state and church was inaugurated. Instead of being scolded and threatened for believing in God and attending church, people are now urged to go to Mass and to church. . . . Never has Hungary witnessed such a revival of church attendance. . . . Of course, there always is a catch: a requirement that priests and pastors should read each Sunday a short ‘sermon’ extolling the Communist philosophy.”—Time, October 17, 1955.

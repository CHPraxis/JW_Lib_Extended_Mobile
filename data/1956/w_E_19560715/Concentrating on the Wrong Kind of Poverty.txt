Concentrating on the Wrong Kind of Poverty
● Time magazine, January 9, 1956, told that many a Bible Belt (southern part of the United States) church found itself in a strange position during the Christmas season of 1955; it was running out of poor to whom to give Christmas baskets of food, clothing and toys. However, judging by the results of polls conducted in the United States as to the people’s religious literacy and especially as to their familiarity with the Bible, can it be that the churches are concentrating on the wrong kind of poverty? There certainly are many spiritually poor, and Jesus said that those who were conscious of their spiritual poverty were happy. Were the churches to concentrate on ending spiritual poverty they would not be running out of opportunities for doing good.

Letter of Appreciation
December 11, 1955
Dear Brother Knorr:
It occurs to me that you have probably heard many times expressions of appreciation by brothers who have enjoyed rich spiritual blessings during the year 1955. But I am anxious to add another word. Often do I think of the great responsibility that you have before Jehovah. And it is so obvious that you have his rich blessings. That must give you great peace and joy.
I never expected to have such joys with my brothers in many lands as I had the past summer in Europe. And the Society did a wonderful service to the brothers in making that trip possible. It was a tremendous task. I hope, too, that you have another New World Society movie of it. The public seems to like the closeness that the pictures bring and so do the brothers who remain at home.
And the spiritual food that constantly flows from the temple is most thrilling and satisfying. New light is coming from the temple and about the temple. I have just read carefully the December 15, 1955, Watchtower. Wonderful light! It will aid much in causing all to see the value of bringing all the ‘tithes’ into Jehovah’s house.
Rejoicing with you in this great day of Jehovah, I am
Your fellow servant with much love,
H. L. P.

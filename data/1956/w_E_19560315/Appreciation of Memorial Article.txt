Appreciation of Memorial Article
January 21, 1956
Dear Brothers:
Words can never tell how I thank and praise Jehovah for the January 15 Watchtower lessons on “‘The Table of Demons’ versus ‘The Table of Jehovah.’” And I want to thank you, his loving slaves, as the instrument to bring this good food to his people.
Always my heart has longed to discern our Lord’s human body in the loaf, but I have tried to suppress the thought in obedience to what I thought The Watchtower taught. Now I can really comprehend the altar arrangement of Jehovah and see the perfect sacrifice upon it as I never did before.
This coming Memorial will be the most blessed one of my life due to this loving provision of Jehovah through his organization.
I’m sorry to take your time in this way for I realize, more especially since seeing the New World film, how valuable every minute of your time is. But I cannot be content to let such a great blessing go unacknowledged.
May our Sovereign God Jehovah continue to use and bless you all, to the honor of his name and the feeding of his sheep.
Your sister in Christ,
H. G. M.

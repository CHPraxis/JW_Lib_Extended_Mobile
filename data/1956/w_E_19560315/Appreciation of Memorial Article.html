<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sh">Dear Brothers:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Words can never tell how I thank and praise Jehovah for the January 15 <em>Watchtower </em>lessons on “‘The Table of Demons’ versus ‘The Table of Jehovah.’” And I want to thank you, his loving slaves, as the instrument to bring this good food to his people.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Always my heart has longed to discern our Lord’s human body in the loaf, but I have tried to suppress the thought in obedience to what I thought <em>The Watchtower </em>taught. Now I can really comprehend the altar arrangement of Jehovah and see the perfect sacrifice upon it as I never did before.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This coming Memorial will be the most blessed one of my life due to this loving provision of Jehovah through his organization.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">I’m sorry to take your time in this way for I realize, more especially since seeing the New World film, how valuable every minute of your time is. But I cannot be content to let such a great blessing go unacknowledged.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">May our Sovereign God Jehovah continue to use and bless you all, to the honor of his name and the feeding of his sheep.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sj">Your sister in Christ,</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sj">H. G. M.</p>

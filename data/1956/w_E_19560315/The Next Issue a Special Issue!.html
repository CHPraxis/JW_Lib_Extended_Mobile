<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● “ALL mankind should be one!” That is the opening sentence of the thrilling April 1 <em>Watchtower. </em>Simple, straightforward, down to earth, it shows that never has mankind been more seriously divided than now. All worldly schemes for unity, whether political or religious, have failed. Yet brotherhood is possible.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">●Where did disunity originate? Why does it exist? Why was Christ’s death necessary? How is God involved in the unity that even religions do not provide? How can you gain it? These are important questions.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">●A second article deals with the Communists’ fear of Bible truth, their vicious persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, and with the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in Russia even now.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">●What is it like to be in a slave labor camp? What happens to Jehovah’s witnesses there? How was the great April, 1951, purge against the witnesses carried out? What happens when camp guards and office workers heed the preaching and themselves become witnesses? How have the Communists defeated their own purpose in imprisoning Bible believers? These are interesting questions.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Read the answers for yourself in the April 1 “Watchtower,” next to be published.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● The following letter was sent to the Federation of Churches in the United States and forwarded by them to the Society: “I would be obliged if you would get me on to a branch church of Jehovah’s witnesses to take a Bible study course by correspondence and become a minister of the gospel. I am a member of the Baptist Church for many years but I am afraid I’ve not been given enough work to do. By reading the Gospel tracts and magazines of Jehovah’s witnesses I’ve fallen deeply in love with their doctrine. I am anxiously waiting an early reply, A. G. T., London.”</p>

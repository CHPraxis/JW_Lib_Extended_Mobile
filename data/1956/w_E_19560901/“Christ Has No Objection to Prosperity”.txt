“Christ Has No Objection to Prosperity”
● Foremost advocate of divine healing in the United States is one Oral Roberts. In February, 1956, he visited Australia and, while putting on a healing campaign at Sydney, registered at the city’s lavish hotel, the Glen Ascham, under an assumed name. When newspaper reporters discovered the subterfuge, Roberts replied: “Christ has no objection to prosperity.” But if Christ has no objection to prosperity and Roberts had a clear conscience why did he register under an assumed name? Because of fear of man? Could it be that he feared some persons might make an unfavorable comparison between Roberts’ choosing the most exclusive hotels and the example and teaching of the One whom Roberts professes to follow, Jesus Christ?

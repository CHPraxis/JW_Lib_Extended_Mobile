Blames God for Accidents
● Because of improper religious education imperfect men often blaspheme God by blaming him for accidents, as though God should continually perform miracles to protect men from the consequences of their own folly. Thus a Mr. Joseph Jenkins, Sr., of New Jersey, upon hearing that an auto accident had for the fourth time in five years claimed a grown son of his, said: “I don’t know why God has to take my boys this way.” His spouse gave him small comfort, for she also blamed God, saying, “The Lord gives them to us and the Lord takes them away.” God does not cause automobile accidents. It is blasphemy to blame him for mechanical failure or errors of judgment on the part of men! As the Scripture says: “Time and chance happen to them all.”—Eccl. 9:11, RS.

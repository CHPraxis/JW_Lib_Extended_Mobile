<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Restaurants are noted for using atmosphere to attract customers. Not long ago the Broadway Christian Church in Wichita, Kansas, decided to improve on its usual after-services refreshment attraction by also adding atmosphere. An “old fashioned” Sunday service was called for and parishioners came attired in old-fashioned clothing. Other atmosphere features included oil lamps, lantern lighting, music by pump organ and segregation of the men and women in the church pews. “This is being done,” explained the pastor, “not to provide entertainment, but in an effort to recapture the atmosphere and spirit of our forefathers.” In view of the dearth of spiritual knowledge in the world, it seems that Christendom’s churches need Bible truths more than they do atmosphere, “for the scene of this world is changing” permanently at Armageddon.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:31-46:7:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:31</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

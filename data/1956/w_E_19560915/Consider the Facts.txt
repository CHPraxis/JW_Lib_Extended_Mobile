Consider the Facts
Is Diversity a Blessing?
● Commenting on the diversity of religions in America, cleric Walter Donald Kring of Unitarian Church of All Souls, New York, recently said, according to the New York Times of October 17, 1955: “It would seem to me that one of the greatest contributions of America to the world has been the concept that actually there is a better chance to find truth if it is sought in as many ways as possible.” If this diversity of religions is such a blessing, Christ’s apostle did not know about it. Or is it that cleric Kring does not know what Christ’s apostle wrote?—”I exhort you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you should all speak in agreement, and that there should not be divisions among you, but that you may be fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of thought.”—1 Cor. 1:10, NW.
Agnosticism in Israel
● People often suppose that, of all modern states, the rulers of Israel would be among the most religious. A correspondent for a famed newspaper recently found otherwise. In his article “The People of Israel,” reporter John Beavan wrote in Britain’s Manchester Guardian Weekly of December 8, 1955: “In spite of the concessions it has made to the Orthodox parties, the State has remained remarkably secular, and public men are required neither to believe nor to practice. Indeed, they pay less lip-service to organized religion than is required of agnostic Englishmen in official positions. But more often they are religious in a wider sense. Agnostic, humanist, or rationalist views are expressed with a fervor and conviction I have not found elsewhere in recent years. Somewhere in every conversation it is necessary to speak of ‘the dignity of man.’” Scuttled, then, are any claims that the modern nation of Israel has any connection with the fulfillment of Bible prophecy! The prophesied return was to restore true worship of Jehovah. This has been fulfilled upon spiritual Israel, not natural Israel.

Jamaican Youth Teaches Schoolmates
● “So keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, buying out the opportune time for yourselves, because the days are wicked.” That those who heed this admonition of Paul as found at Ephesians 5:15, 16 (NW) are blessed in their doing so is apparent from the following experience of a Jamaican youth: “I am a student in secondary school where there are classes in religious knowledge. During my first attendance at one of these classes the subject of the trinity came up. Right away some of the students put up their hands and told the teacher that I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses and that I did not believe in a trinity. I was asked to explain and so stood up and from the Bible showed why Jehovah’s witnesses do not believe the trinity teaching. The students were so convinced of the correctness of our position on the trinity that when the teacher tried to defend the trinity, using a Catholic publication to back him up on the trinity, the students jeered him. He was dismayed and dismissed the class. I explained to him afterward that that Catholic book was without support, whereas the Bible was authentic. He then said to me, ‘In the future when you hear me say anything contrary to the Bible, you let me know and I will let you explain it to the students.’”

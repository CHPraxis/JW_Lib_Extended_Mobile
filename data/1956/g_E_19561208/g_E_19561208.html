<p><span class="font31" style="font-variant:small-caps;">T</span><span class="font25" style="font-variant:small-caps;">his</span><span class="font24"> twentieth-century civilization is in sad shape. It is not just the threat of an atomic war. It is the way millions of people have to live. More than one half of earth’s population is short on food, starving slowly but surely. More than one third of earth's Inhabitants are seriously affected by the housing shortage. Other millions have no decent clothing. With earth’s population increasing by tens of millions, what does the future hold? Can a larger population be fed, clothed and sheltered?</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">To find out what a civilization with a larger population might be short on, four professors of the California Institute of Technology recently made what they called “a speculative projection” into the twenty-first century. What did they find?</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The professors found that earth’s population will increase from today’s 2,600,-000,000 to some 6,700,000,000 in a hundred years. The living standards then? The professors firmly believe that technology can feed, ciothe and shelter all these people adequately. They foresaw only one rawmaterial shortage—brain power. “The critical limiting factor on the world’s resources,” said Professor John Weir, “is not materials, energy or food but brain power.&quot;—New York </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font24"> May 21, 1956.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">A brief look at a past civilization will be enlightening. Was the critical need of ancient Rome brain power? From that civilization’s ruins—its temples, its homes, its amphitheaters—we know it had brain power. Its woeful shortage was something else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The Bible gives us information as to what that civilization lacked. A Christian apostle, describing the people of that time, said they were filled “with all unrighteousness, wickedness, coveteousness, injuriousness, being full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malicious disposition, being whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, insolent, haughty, self-assuming, inventors of injurious things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, false to agreements, having no natural affection, merciless.” —Romans 1:29-31, </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">In concluding his discussion of the ancient Roman civilization, historian John Lord writes: “Of what value was the cultivation of nature, or a splendid material civilization, or great armies, or an unrivaled jurisprudence, or the triumph of</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">energy and skill, when the moral health was completely undermined? ... No form of civilization, however </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">brilliant and lauded,</span><span class="font26"> could arrest decay and ruin when public and private virtue had fled.” Historian Lord, in other words, asks, Of what value is a civilization with plenty of brain power but woefully short on moral power?</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">What of this modem civilization? Is its crying need more brain power? The California professors themselves answer. Reported the New York </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font26"> of May 22, 1956: “The Californians are convinced that even in the present state of our knowledge there is no scientific and technologic reason why half the world should be on the verge of starvation or why there should be so much misery and poverty and disease in backward regions.” This civilization, the professors admit, has enough brain power to provide adequately for its population. Something else is lacking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">A recent book underscores this lack. The book </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Night Raider</span><span class="font26"> of </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">the Atlantic</span><span class="font26"> is the account of Otto Kretschmer, Germany’s most successful U-boat commander during World War II. With his amazing ability he sank, in just 18 months, 350,000 tons of Allied shipping. The book indicates that the commander was under Hitler’s spell and that he was'not a Nazi. When war broke out he was even disappointed Britain was to be the enemy and not Russia, but that did not prevent him from fighting the British with all his brain power. Summarizing the philosophy of the commander, a review of the book said: “It did not matter to him for whom he went to sea in his U-boat as long as he was allowed to sail it. To this reviewer he seems not so much a </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">descendant of the </span><span class="font26">knights of old as the model of the ‘fanatical professional,’ a type neither limited to the Germans nor to the military profession. The greatest asset of persons of this type is their competence, efficiency and persistence; their most serious drawback their ability to operate in a moral vacuum.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">So it is with all kinds of people today, </span><span class="font26">rulers, statesmen, politicians, scientists and average citizens; they have brains but operate in a moral vacuum. They lack moral power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">With moral power there would be no political graft, no criminals, no wars. Think of the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on atomic weapons, armies, navies, air forces, guided missiles, spies and secret police! There alone is represented more than enough money to shelter adequately the world’s population. Not long ago President Eisenhower said that the cost of one destroyer equals homes for 8,000 people. The president explained: “This world in arms is spending ... the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.” Does this sound as if the world neqds brain power? No, civilization’s greatest shortage is not brain power but moral power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Of what value, then, is an atomic civilization that uses its arts more for kitting than for living? Of what value is a jet-propelled civilization when it moves itself to action with selfishness instead of love? Of what value is an electronic civilization when it operates in a moral vacuum? Men may answer in various ways, but God’s Word answers that such a civilization is only fit for destruction. God wiped out one world without moral power in Noah’s day. He can do it again and will at the impending war of Armageddon. This will make way for the new world of God’s promise, of which the Bible says: “There are new heavens and a new earth that we are </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">awaiting according</span><span class="font26"> to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.”—2 Peter 3:13, </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">New \\’orld Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Lovers of righteousness who long for a civilization with moral power can thus be assured that God’s new world will have it.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">Wisdom, integrity, justice and love require more than merely physical strength. Yet they are the things that identify real men. How do you measure up? Are you man enough to be a real man of God?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font28" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">JEHOVAH</span><span class="font26"> God commanded his prophet Jeremiah to search the city of Jerusalem thoroughly to see if he could find a certain man. The city was crowded with men of the ordinary type. Jeremiah was asked to find a man who was honest, who loved truth and justice, who practiced kindness and walked humbly with God. This was not an easy assignment.—Jeremiah 5:1, </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.;</span><span class="font26"> Micah 6:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">What was difficult to locate in Jerusalem seven centuries before Christ is not much easier to find today, even among the so-called enlightened nations of Christendom. The fact is that while the earth is teeming with male creatures, there is a definite shortage of real true men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Right now it is difficult for nations to find men with proper physical development for their armies. The draft board officials are alarmed over the poor physical condition of those called before them and the large number that must be rejected as unfit for military training. As one official remarked: &quot;Boys and hobblealongs can be got, but where are the men?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">If there is a scarcity of men with physical qualifications, then how much more difficult is it to find men with moral measurements that fit them for God’s army or service as his Christian witnesses? Where can a man be found that will qualify as a preacher of righteousness, one who will stand up and war &quot;against the machinations of the Devil”? Jesus said that “the Father is looking for such kind to worship him.” Jeremiah searched for such men in Jerusalem before it fell to the Babylonians in 607 B.C. Today Jehovah’s witnesses are seeking for such men to aid them to turn from the world’s way before this world is destroyed in the battle of Armageddon. Stouthearted, honest, peace-loving, truthtelling men are the kind God has promised to preserve through the war of Armageddon into his new world of righteousness.—Ephesians 6:11; John 4:23, </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">The Frame Is Not the Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">What makes a man? Is it merely a large muscular frame, an athletic ability? Some of the greatest men that ever lived were not athletic at all. Many of the world’s greatest soldiers were little men. On the other hand, a very Goliath-like body, development is not the man at all, if these highest qualities of man’s make-up are missing. The apostle Paul shows the inner man to be the greater—the real man: “Be training yourself with godly devotion as your aim. For bodily training is beneficial for a little, but godly devotion is beneficial for all things, as it holds promise of the life now and that which is to come.” </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span class="font26">man Christ Jesus was not known for his perfect body, but for his qualities of love, mercy and justice, for his wisdom and love for God and man. His loyalty to principle and truth earned him official public reference as “the man!”—1 Timothy 4:7, 8; John 19:5, </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">When people see a handsome man with a good physique, we often hear them say, “He’s such a fine man!” But after a brief conversation with him, their opinion changes. Why? Because his words are childish; he has never cultivated the powers of his mind, and we are disappointed in such a one. We want that good-looking muscular frame to embody a mind filled with the wisdom, justice, love and other endearing qualities that God gave man. We like to see a man whom the lust of power will not corrupt, whom the spoils of office cannot buy, a man who possesses opinion and will power, who loves humility and will not fie. These are the building blocks of true men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">How to Judge a Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">God values a man for what he is, not for what he has. Oftentimes men judge men by what they have. They place a price on him as being worth so much a year. They determine his value by the size of his house, the number of servants he has, the type of car he drives, the thickness of his wallet and bankbook and suchlike outward circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">There is a story told of a Persian prince that well illustrates such worldly foolishness. Dressed as a poor man, this prince went to a feast When he arrived and came near the table the attendants promptly tossed him out—they would have none of his kind. Then the prince dressed himself in his royal robe and jewels and returned to the feast. “Welcome, my lord,&quot; the attendants said' as soon as he arrived. “Take this chair, please. What would your heart desire to eat?&quot; The prince stripped off his robe and threw it at the guests. “Feed my robes, feed my jewels!” he shouted. &quot;It is these that you welcome and not me!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Eliab, the son of Jesse, by all human standards qualified as a man for the kingship of Israel, but God rejected him. To Samuel Jehovah said: “Do not look at </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">his </span><span class="font26">appearance and at the height of his stature, for I have rejected him. For not the way man sees [is the way God sees], because mere man sees what appears to the eyes, but, as for Jehovah, he sees what the heart is.” To qualify as a man before God the creature must have a good heart.—1 Samuel 16:7, </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">What is a man without a heart or conscience? The Bible shows such a man to be worse than a brute beast. “The ox know-eth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib; but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.” Peter likened heartless, indulgent, law-defying, daring, self-willed men to “unreasoning animals born naturally to be caught and destroyed.” —Isaiah 1:3, </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.;</span><span class="font26"> 2 Peter 2; 9-22, </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">A man really cannot consider himself a man if he does not have any feeling for others. If he is cold and hard within, if his faith is gone and hope is lost, the man is dead. A Christian is under obligation to be warm and affectionate toward his brothers. He is to be loving and forgiving, a man with a heart and a man of his word: “For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.” The Christian gentleman has the strength of ten men, because his heart is pure, his motive is right, just and true.—Matthew 12:34, </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">A modern writer asks: “What is it to be a gentleman?” He answers; &quot;Is it to be</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">honest, to be gentle, to be generous, to be brave, to be wise; and, possessing all these qualities, to exercise them in the most graceful outward manner? Ought a gentleman to be a good son, a true husband, an honest father? Ought his life to be decent, his bills paid, his tastes to be high and elegant, his aims in life to be noble? Yes, he should be all these, and somewhat more; and these all men can be, and women, too.” The Christian fulfills this description.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Master over His Passions</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A true man is the master of his body. He is lord over its desires and passions. He is aware that the body is a proper servant but a very bad master; so he constantly keeps it under control and brings it into subjection. Paul said of himself: “I browbeat my body and lead it as a slave, that, after I have preached to others, I myself should not become disapproved somehow?’ —1 Corinthians 9:27, New </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A man must have his passions under control. A man who thus disciplines his body and its desires is able to say No to temptation and lead his frame about like a slave. The fact that man can do just that is why he can be called a man in God's image, the highest and noblest of God's earthly creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Men were made to be courageous too, and not cowardly. They were made to face unpleasantness and sacrifice with great courage. To Joshua Jehovah said: &quot;Only be courageous and very strong.” Men who run away from duty and shirk responsibility and seek after a life of ease and enjoyment can hardly measure up to the stature of the perfect man, Jesus Christ.—Joshua 1:7, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The test of manhood is the ability to deny oneself in the present for the sake of the future, to be able to give up the seen for the unseen. Jesus showed this when he said to his disciples: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and follow me continually.” To follow the Master when you are strong and unwearied is easy, but to Jceep up the pursuit, refusing to lie down and give up after you are tired and weak, as Gideon’s three hundred men were when pursuing the Midianites, this takes a man. Such ones who refuse to give up will receive from Christ the praise, “Well done, good slave!”—Matthew 16:24; Luke 19:17, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The New World society today, like Jeremiah of old, is on the lookout for real men —men who are ready to meet God's standard as genuine footstep followers of Jesus Christ: “For, indeed, the Father is looking for such kind to worship him.” “Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for there is a happy end to the man of peace.” —John 4:23, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.;</span><span class="font8"> Psalm 37:37, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Am.

<p><span class="font28">&lt;t According to four physicians from the Massachusetts Memorial Hospital, there is a connection between smoking and a serious lung ailment known as pulmonary emphysema. Thia ailment is marked by an unnatural swelling and breaking of the tiny air sacs in the lungs. Since it is a rather common lung ailment and “causes a great deal of disability and may even be fatal, smoking may be even more hazardous than has been hitherto recognized.” A study on more than 40 patients having this ailment showed that none of them had shown unusual lung symptoms before the age of 40, and none of them had other diseases that could account for their symptoms. But all of them had been heavy smokers of cigarettes. —Science </span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">Digest,</span><span class="font28"> March, 1956.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CHEMICAL FOOD ADDITIVES DANGEROUS</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">L HE harm that chemicals in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">food can cause </span><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font7">was graphically reviewed by the Spring*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">field, Massachusetts, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News,</span><span class="font7"> January 25, 1955. It told how terror struck in the little French village of Pont-Saint-E sprit on August 18, 1951.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A- healthy and strong young man died after hours of convulsions, during which he had to be tied*to his bed. “A mother had to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">be separated from her ll-year-oid son;</span><span class="font7"> both armed with kitchen knives were trying to cut each other's throat. Mme. Martha Toulouse ran like a madwoman to throw herself in the Rhone River, crying that she was followed by a herd of fantastic animals. Madame Rieu was caught by the leg as she tried to jump out of a window.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Three others attempted suicide. Hallucinated victims—screaming about assassins, ghost fires and prehistoric animals—were carted off in ambulances.” And, &quot;in all, five people died and two hundred were hospitalized within the next week. Some wound up in psychiatric clinics, wrapped in strait jackets.” &lt;&nbsp;And the cause? After three years of vain search a Swedish chemical company wrote that it might have been caused by a product made by them and used in flour to keep bread from becoming moldy. This product was “a combination of mercury and organic elements with a great fungicide power.” Bread made from flour containing this product was fed by scientists to white mice, which died at once and from the same symptoms. Thus the mystery of the “Devil’s Bread,” as it was called, was solved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yes, apparently, selfish men are ever ready </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">to trifle with the</span><span class="font7"> health of their neighbors if they profit financially by it. Thus in January, 1956, the United States government confiscated two freight carloads of lettuce that had been sent from California to the A &amp;&nbsp;P stores in New York city, because it was unfit for human consumption, having been sprayed with a poison, endrin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nor is this the only risk of insecticides. DDT and chlordan often get into meat and cows’<sup>1</sup>' milk. A leading authority on the subject, Dr. Morton S. Biskind, writing in a medical journal in 1953, blamed DDT for the increase in cancer and nervous ailments and especially for the appearance of symptoms of hitherto unknown diseases in both man and domestic animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J. J. Delaney, a New York congressman, writing in the American </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Magazine,</span><span class="font7"> July, 1951, showed that as much as 69 parts of DDT per million were found in fat meat whereas the safe maximum is but 5 ppm. Tests have also shown that as much as 44 ppm of chlordan was found in cream, and chlordan is five times as poisonous as DDT. Mr. Delaney is working on laws that would protect the consumer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For years those fighting harmful chemicals in food have warned that these might cause mental illness, and that chemicals might cause cancer. Under the heading &quot;Cancer Is Traced to Food Additives” the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font7"> August 21, 1956, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;A symposium of the International Union Against Cancer . . . meeting in Rome acknowledged that food additives created a ‘serious public health problem.' They unanimously recognized the ‘urgent necessity of international collaboration for the protection of mankind’ ‘against such hazards as cancerproducing food additives.’ The participants in the symposium also acknowledged that food additives were only one part of a vast problem </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of environmental cancer, which includes </span><span class="font7">occupational and lung cancers.&quot; it also was stated that &quot;no food additives should be used unless specifically permitted by legislation based on lists of substances that have been proved innocuous after stringent laboratory tests.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Condemned as cancer producing were certain food preservatives; certain mineral oils and parafines </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">used to coat milk containers; </span><span class="font7">food sterilization by radiation; estrogens (hormone pellets inserted in animals to put on weight); certain detergents used in cleaning food containers, and especially food dyes. In fact they stated that no food dye at present met &quot;agreed criteria of safety.” Just ten days before this report was made a United States court had banned three dyes as being potentially harmful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since all these chemical insecticides and food additives are the boasted discoveries of modern science, it certainly does indicate that, because of selfishness in man, modern science does harm as well as good.</span></p>

<p><span class="font24">years should be enough to convince even the most* skeptical person that industry</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">ment and things smaller in size are not so effective or so praiseworthy.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font24">based on old-time simplicity is continuing to shrink and fade. Little shops no longer can secure those things that the people want and need. Automobiles, massive machines, refrigerators, etc., are not products of the simplicity enjoyed a generation ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The functional, organizational characteristic of the present system that can provide those things physical and intangible that are highly regarded is complex in make-up and gigantic in scope. Without big corporations, the people cannot have a great many of the things they want and consider vital to survival In the prevailing complicated system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">So the spotlight is on bigness, big business, big corporations, big organizations. And since the dangers of bigness, in terms of concentrated power, are no longer beyond governmental control, because of antitrust laws and the increased power of labor, a semblance of security persists; in fact, the people feel quite lost in wonder at the thought of living in the midst of a forest of giants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Bigness is in style and admired for size. People seem to take great pride in pointing to the biggest building, the tallest pole, the largest boat, the longest highway, the fastest plane—things that are spoken of in superlatives—as if big things are more effective and speak of greater accomplish-</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Superlatives, however, are seductive to man. They do not tell the whole story. The fact remains that there is no relationship between biggest and best, the smallest and the worst. Each product of man or of nature carries its own innate capacity and value for its most effective size. The values of size, therefore, are relative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The free enterprise system was meant to grow up like a great forest. Not only are there trees one and two centuries old towering a hundred feet overhead, but underneath them is another level of trees growing half as high, filling in the spaces where the sunlight was not being used by the larger trees. Then below these is another order of trees filling in the unoccupied places in the more humble positions. And below them are the shrubs and beneath them are the berry bushes and the smaller plants, some only a few feet high; and still underneath these is a whole population of flowers that get their sunshine and do their year’s work early in the spring before the leaves are out on the trees and while the sun can shine through. Then down on the ground and on the tree trunks are mosses and lichens and other life. In one great forest a whole variety of plants live in an element of freedom to compete and survive. And each category does survive, for each one has its place. So was the free ■ enterprise system to function.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Sometimes it is thought that trees overhead are more enduring and that smaller plants below are transient. Not so. Some ground plants are older than the giants above them. Barring accident, there are ground plants that flourish for hundreds of years. So mankind’s choice under the free enterprise system was not to be between big’business and little business, but of normal distribution, just as large </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span class="font26">small trees^oexist. in a primeval hardwood forest. That business that is most effective when big, like the giant Redwood trees, should remain big. A business that is most effective if middle-sized, like the birch and the dogwood tree, should remain middlesized, and that which is most effective if small should remain small; each respecting the functions of the other. Size, then, should be no greater than is necessary for the general good. When size begins to sacrifice the general good to cravings for dominance, eminence, power, ambition or wealth, then the whole system is set aflame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Danger of Size</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Once big business becomes entrenched, individual freedom is greatly curtailed. It has a determined tendency to dominate situations and people. It begins to dictate its will and enforce its power. If influence or power is applied to curb the activities of an individual or business, then such power becomes detrimental to the welfare of mankind. Today, with many industries concentrated in the power of a few men, factions are many. The files of the United States Department of Justice are filled with complaints of small businessmen. Big powers have been known to restrict production on useful products, withhold new products and fence in and block off new developments. General Electric has been guilty several times of antitrust violations, and a whole mountain of complaints is brought against General Motors and other giant manufacturers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">The free enterprise system works its best when business is scattered into many hands. This is the philosophy of the Sherman Act, which declares that power in the hands of a few is dangerous. The act is-directed against big business. It has been amended and strengthened under various presidents; in most </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">instances fear of</span><span class="font26"> big business and of its abuses of power was what was behind the drive to make the act stronger, more inclusive, the penalties more severe. The Sherman Act says in part that “industrial power should be scattered into many hands so that the fortunes of the'people will not be dependent on the whim or caprice, the political prejudices, the emotional stability of a few selfappointed men,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Warnings Against Bigness</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">At the time the Federal Trade Commission was established, in 1914, a joint committee told Congress: “The concentration of wealth, money and property in the United States under the control and in the hands of a few individuals or great corporations has grown to such an enormous extent that unless checked it will ultimately threaten the perpetuity of our institutions.” In 1951, the Federal Trade Commission similarly stated: “If nothing is done to check the growth in concentration, either the giant corporations will ultimately take over the country, or the government will be impelled to step in and impose some form of direct regulation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">These warnings are just as applicable today as the day they were issued, even more so. Today industrial and financial power is concentrated; free and vigorous competition among small business is stifled. How can small independent firms compete with multibillion-dollar corporations? In the United States, for example, &quot;one com-</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">pany has 100 per cent of the virgin aluminum business, three companies control 86 per cent of the automobile output, three companies manufacture 90 per cent of the cans used, three companies produce 80 per cent of all our cigarettes, four companies turn out 100 per cent of the com binders, two companies dominate 95 per qent of our plate glass.” These are forbidding figures. Less than a handful of companies dominate an entire industry. Entire markets are held in the power of three or four men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The ultimate expression of such concentration is power;, and great power in the hands of a few men is dangerous. Powerful monopolies can come into existence only by the destruction of individual and economic freedom, and can perpetuate themselves only by the continued suppression of such freedoms. The ultimate danger of unchecked power is the prospect that it might eventually dominate the entire society and suppress all freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The few at the top, chiefs of gigantic companies, sit, as it were, on the peak of a high mountain with only a faint visibility over the vast plain of employees under them. They are farther removed from the vast population under their control than are the mayors and legislators over the millions of people in cities such as Detroit, Chicago or Philadelphia. Still they must render decisions that directly affect their lives. The worker Ilves to a great degree at the mercy of a few, and can also suffer greatly because of their possible lack of judgment It is frightening to contemplate the consequences of misplaced power and it becomes doubly so when one understands the weakness and insecurity of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">For the free enterprise system to live it must include both big and small companies in the places where they do the most good. The best results of the system come when the individual has as much freedom as possible. This means that individuals in both big and small business must be free from government dictation and from fear of big business heads. It means also that in order for small business to prosper it must be free from control by outside financial interests or big competitors, suppliers or customers. Individuals must be free to work and live like the smaller plants of a great forest, each contributing his share to the good of the other and to the progress and prosperity of the system as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">With greater freedom to adjust and explore, small business has greater advantages to try out new ideas and attitudes, which it would be rash for big business to consider until they have been well proved. Thus instead of big business’ suppressing new inventions or curtailing new discoveries it would hand them down to smaller firms, who could manage without too great a loss. In this way both little and big industries were meant to benefit and prosper from such experience under the free enterprise system.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awakel” correspondent tn Eflypt</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">((&quot;IMPORTANT Principle in the Divorce of </span><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">I</span><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font7">Christians.” &quot;The Laws of the Holy Gospel Are the Only Ones to Be Applied.” Thus Al Ahram, a widely circulated Egyptian newspaper, headed Its June 1 discussion of an important Egyptian court case. Strange as it may sound, the secular court’s decision was simply thatemembers of the Coptic Orthodox Church must be?bound by Christian principles!</span></p>
<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">*8 </span><span class="font7">To understand what happened, you will have to know that until December 31, 1955, Egypt had two court systems to deal with personal status. One was a Moslem court and the other was a &quot;Christian” court set up by the Coptic church, the predominating nonMoslem church in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Much corruption and bribery had been found in both judicial systems. Two religious judges of the Moslem court had been convicted of graft and sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor. Protests against the Coptic system had reached the point where youths kidnaped the patriarch, and where later, on September 20, 1955, a young Coptic man had tried to murder him. The next day the Egyptian Council of Ministers decreed that the religious courts be abolished and integrated with the national courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">U </span><span class="font7">Beginning January 1, 1956, all matters of personal status were to be heard by the national courts (Section of Personal Status). Moslems were to be judged according to teachings of the Koran and Christians by Christian rules. This is where the trouble came in. The Coptic church had been operating under its own rules rather than conforming to what was written in God’s inspired Word, the Bible. </span><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">*1? </span><span class="font7">In the particular case at issue, a man asked for a divorce from his wife, since they had been living apart for more than three years. The Coptic rules would have granted it, but the secular court rejected his appeal on the grounds that the rules of the Christian law, under which the decision is to be given, are set out in the Holy Gospel, which entirely forbids divorce except on grounds of fornication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font7">The court quoted from Mark 10:7-12 the statement that the two who are married are to be one flesh, that no man is to put them apart, that whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and that if a woman, after divorcing her husband, marries another, she commits adultery, it also quoted from 1 Corinthians 7:11 the statement that if the wife does depart she must remain single or else make up again with her husband, and that the husband should not leave his wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The court was quoted as saying that the law of the Coptic church &quot;contained reasons for divorce neither directly nor indirectly mentioned in the Holy Gospel which is the only authority for Christians in the establishment of the rules for the marriage tie.” And also, &quot;the Court, having been entrusted with the duty of applying the law of both parties, which is the Christian law that decisively forbids divorce except on grounds of fornication, cannot comply with the appellant's request for divorce in which he bases himself upon the separation that he endeavored to prolong for futile reasons having absolutely no bearing on the grounds of fornication.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So we have the novel situation of the Court of Appeal, presided over by a Moslem judge assisted by two Christian judges, recognizing and ruling in accordance with the high principles of the Bible, though in conflict with the Coptic patriarchate. By its action the secular court has condemned as un-Christian religious leaders who had abandoned the Master’s clear-cut rule: “Everyone divorcing his wife except on account of fornication makes her a subject for adultery.”—Matthew 5:32, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘j?</span><span class="font7"> While the court has recently called attention to the Coptic church’s ignoring of God's Word, Jehovah’s witnesses, for many years now, have been calling attention to the same thing, and have been helping sincere Coptic people to see the difference between what their church has taught and the noble Christian principles that are recorded in the pure Word of the living God Jehovah. The result is that an organization of more than 300 Christian ministers has grown in Egypt to help many more to understand their Bibles and to see the shortcomings of false worship and the value of the true.</span></p>

<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">By “AwnfttT correspondent in Hong Kong</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font24">HINESE writing is one of the oldest forms of calligraphy known to man. While to many a westerner the</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">characters are merely a fascinating artistic design decorating his favorite downtown Chinese restaurant, adding a strange oriental touch to his evening’s entertainment, to that vast nation that forms one fifth of the world’s population these quaint characters play a much more important role. They make it possible for all literate Chinese to understand each other when their widely varying dialects make speech unintelligible. It is no uncommon thing to see two Chinese from different provinces rapt in conversation and deftly outlining with the finger of one hand on the palm of the other a character to explain something that the tongue cannot convey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Learning characters is, however, no mean accomplishment. To those used to a simple alphabet of only twenty-six letters the task of memorizing a collection of 47,000 characters seems herculean. What, they ask, is the origin of all these complex signs? Why cannot the Chinese find some simpler and more efficient method of writing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">During the autumn of 1955 opinion and comment on these oft-discussed questions were excited in all those interested in the Chinese language. In Peking, capital city of Communist China, a conference was concluded at</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">which a proposal was adopted to do away with the existing form of writing and substitute for it an alphabetic system. To remove the involved and intricate characters and teach to future generations a simple alphabet will, the Communists claim, bring greater literacy to the masses. This has raised a storm of contradiction in noncommunist circles. They accuse the scheme of being just another Communist ruse to get possession of the minds of the people. True, they say, more people may be able to read, but, on the other hand, they quickly point out, the only literature available will be that which has passed the eagle censorship of the Communist blue pencil. The vast wealth of the Chinese heritage of literature and the history of the past four thousand years, everything that has contributed to the culture of the Chinese people, will be a closed book to future generations; the building of the China of tomorrow will be entirely severed from yesterday, for that most vital cement will be gone—the Chinese character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">The Origin of Chinese Characters</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Chinese characters </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">traditionally</span><span class="font24"> had their beginning in the third millennium B.C., when the great Yellow Emperor, Huang Ti, commanded his minister, Chang Kit, to seek a system of writing that would adequately convey ideas. After a careful study of objects, trees, mountains, rivers, animals, etc., Chang Kit produced a series of pictographs that portrayed as nearly as possible the objects they were representing. Being as simple as a child’s drawing his ideographs were quickly understood. For instance, “mountain” was represented by a group of craggy points, thus A, and the well, precious to the agriculturally-minded peasant, was depicted as a dot set in surrounding squares, #, show-</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">ing the communal sharing of a well by eight neighboring plot owners. Other familiar signs were the sun, jifc, moon, yuefc, and man with his two legs, A jen. Then, when ideas inspired by common objects were exhausted, further strokes were added to existing characters that made new su</span><span class="font26" style="text-decoration:underline;">gge</span><span class="font26">stions. Examples of this are very interesting: sun, which had come to be drawn as a circle with a dot, was placed above the line of a horizon, o , and so dawn was expressed. Today the character for dawn is still A </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">tan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">“Sun,” G </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">jih,</span><span class="font26"> shining through &quot;tree,” </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">mu;</span><span class="font26"> thus &amp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">tung,</span><span class="font26"> meant “east.” Today the character is drawn thus, </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">tung.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">&quot;Fields,” H </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Fien,</span><span class="font26"> divided by lines, I </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Chiang,</span><span class="font26"> meant “boundaries” and still does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">&quot;Men,” A </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">jen,</span><span class="font26"> with one mouth, 5 </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">kou, </span><span class="font26">meant “agree”; thus a&quot; ho. This character is another that has retained its original form and today is one of three characters used to write the name of the United Nations, W </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">cf</span><span class="font26"> W Lien </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Ho Kuo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">The Chow Dynasty, 1122-221 B.C., brought a change in writing. The era of simplicity gave place to a period of highly ornate characters. Scribes gave rein to their individual artistry, and characters, although undoubtedly beautiful to many an educated eye, became too embellished for efficient daily use. A standardizing of the national written language was therefore begun during the reign of Emperor Chin, 221-206 B.C., and continued until an accepted speedy style of writing called </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">ky shu</span><span class="font26"> arrived. This is now the modern form. Nevertheless, beauty was not sacrificed entirely on the altar of expediency; the brush came into use in the course of this period, and it is the brush, properly held in the experienced hand, that produces the balanced combination of fine and thick strokes and gentle upsweeps that make the Chinese character the tracery of art that it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Conveying Abstract Ideas</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">This long period of time also saw adjustments and additions to Chang Kit’s system of written language. A means had to be found to convey the thousands of abstract ideas, observations, sentiments and conceptions of life important to all literature and philosophy, which hitherto had been incapable of expression. Four methods of increasing the vocabulary began to be practiced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">First, a number of characters were selected for their usefulness in making combination characters; some were abbreviated, others not. For example, the script for “water,” A </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">shut,</span><span class="font26"> became &gt;&nbsp;; “grass,” &amp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">ts’ao,</span><span class="font26"> became <sup>T</sup>t ; “man,” A </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">jen,</span><span class="font26"> became 4 . Other examples of unabbreviated script are “mouth,” a fc’ou; “girl,&quot; </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">ic nu,</span><span class="font26"> depicting the favorite cross-legged posture of the woman when sitting; “talk,” &gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">yen </span><span class="font26">(note the words represented by the lines issuing from the mouth); and “earth,” ±. </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">t&gt;u.</span><span class="font26"> These characters became known as 'radicals.’ Then a character was taken and compounded with one or more radicals. Each combination would retain the phonetic sound of the chosen character, but the meaning would be determined by the radicals. The following may be helpful examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Af </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">fong</span><span class="font26"> as a lone phonetic means “square.” Combined with “woman,” £, it means &quot;hinder,” W. (Do we detect a sly note of humor here? Did the Chinese believe that a woman within the area of any square could spell only hindrance?)</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Fong</span><span class="font26"> with &quot;word” radical, , means “Inquire”; </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">fong</span><span class="font26"> with “earth” radical, j#, means “neighborhood”; </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">fong</span><span class="font26"> with “man” radical, &lt;&amp;, means &quot;imitate”; </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">fong</span><span class="font26"> with “grass” radical, means “fragrance”; </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">fong</span><span class="font26"> with “gate” radical, S, means “room.” Each time the character has the same pronunciation, </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">fong,</span><span class="font26"> but each word has its own distinguishing tone, so that to the accustomed ear there is no confusion in identifying the meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">A second means of increasing the number of &quot;characters was by employing another principle in combinations. This time two characters of different sounds were joined together to produce a third with an entirely new sound. So “roof,” </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">mien, </span><span class="font26">sheltering a girl, ■fc </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">nu,</span><span class="font26"> indicating her safety, has come to mean &quot;peace,” S aw. Likewise “man,” A </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">fen,</span><span class="font26"> plus his word, </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">&gt;&nbsp;yen,</span><span class="font26"> indicates “trust” or “belief,” ft ftsin. How fine were some of the ideas of the old Chinese! And, if they hoped that the shelter of home would spell “peace,” and a man’s word would be his trusty bond, how disappointed they would be in the world of today!</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">A third method changed the meaning of single characters entirely. Therefore, because of still retaining exactly the form and sound, the meaning of the character as it was being particularly used could only be determined by the context. In English we have many examples of this, as in the instance of “train,” meaning that which is trailed and also to discipline or instruct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Yet a fourth method was found by giving one character different sounds and therewith different meanings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Need for Simplification</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">With the passage of time the language of signs that had begun as a series of simple pictographs had developed into a collection of characters unparalleled by any other language. In the eighteenth century, during the reign of Emperor Kang Hsi of the Ching Dynasty, the famous Chinese dictionary appeared, which bore the name of the emperor. In this dictionary 47,000 characters were listed and defined, together with an explanation of the use of combinations. As an aside it is interesting to note that this dictionary was first published in 1716, and so preceded Doctor Samuel Johnson’s noted English Dictionary of 1755 by several decades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Be that as it may, the prospective student of Chinese may comfort himself with the fact that by far the greater number of these characters are not in daily use. The average dictionary used in modem schools and colleges contains approximately 10,000 characters, and the daily newspapers have a mere 5,000 characters current in their fonts. Between five and ten thousand characters are generally considered sufficient to enable a person to be well read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Nevertheless, no one is going to pretend that building an average Chinese vocabulary is any easy matter. School children spend many diligent hours day after day, for years, in their efforts to retain memory of the necessary characters, some of which have as many as twenty-nine separate strokes. It would seem that some means of simplifying the task would be very welcome. Since China became a republic after the 1911 revolution many efforts have been made by scholars and educationalists to solve the problem. To the time of writing the problem has not reached its solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">The Chinese, who have a strong attachment for the old characters, do not want their abolition in favor of a Western alphabet. Their ancient and picturesque characters are an integral part of their national heritage. Many feel that to sell them would be to sell China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">On the other hand, if the Communist government is to make a success of its administration it must find some way to relieve the heavy burden of mass illiteracy and enable China to step in pace with the modem progressive world of today. In the broadcast from Radio Peking on March 16, 1956, Vice-Premier Chen Yi is reported to have said that 78 percent of the Chinese people cannot read or write. To a government faced with such an arduous task it would probably be of little moment if the majority of the peasantry was not educated to read its past history and literature—they are unable to do so anyway— if they could only be taught speedily to keep abreast of current affairs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font26">One practical point in favor of a romanized alphabet is the fact that </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">businesses </span><span class="font26">conducted solely in the Chinese language are unable to use modern office equipment such as typewriters, which have long been indispensable in all efficient offices of most other countries. A Chinese typewriter does exist, a heavy, cumbersome affair, but it seems to be more a curio than an article of general use. For this as well as trade reasons many offices in the larger cities of China have for many years found it more practical to use the English language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">A second point in favor of a romanized alphabet is the facility with which an English-style dictionary can be used. When consulting a Chinese dictionary for the meaning of a character the inquirer must first determine the radical of the character, then check with the table of radicals at the front or back of the </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">dictionary to </span><span class="font26">discover the section that lists the characters related to each other by the common radical. Turning to this section he must now count the number of strokes his character has additionally added to the radical. He must then hunt for the listed characters that are grouped together because of having a </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">common</span><span class="font26"> number of strokes as well as the radical. Running his finger down the list he will eventually find his character— provided he was fortunate in determining the right radical in the first place. </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">If he </span><span class="font26">made a mistake he must go back to the beginning and start again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Incidentally, on January 1, 1956, the Watchtower Bible and Tract </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Society was </span><span class="font26">happy to release the first copy of the </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font26"> magazine in Chinese characters. The subscriptions that have steadily flowed into the Hong Kong branch office from all round the globe since that date have revealed that, problematic though they may be, the </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">ancient Chinese characters</span><span class="font26"> are playing their part in bringing up-to-the-minute truth to many more thousands of the earth’s teeming millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Hews </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">for “RH”</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"> Parents</span></p>
<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">C </span><span class="font7">A United Press dispatch recently released had the following news fur parents where one is RH positive and the other negative. Among other things it stated: &quot;Pills made from orange pulp and rinds may ensure a safe and normal birth for the twenty-thousand RH factor babies bom in the United States each year. The pills, known as CVP and containing a citrus bioflavonoid compound, apparently have enabled twenty RH negative women whose husbands are RH positive to give birth to normal babies. None of the newborn children required the complete blood transfusions after birth, which is the usual treatment for the ailment. Dr. Warren Jacobs of the Baylor University Medical School reports on the use of CVP in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetrics.</span><span class="font7"> He said that a two-year study of the compound indicates it may help prevent miscarriages common in RH cases and that it eventually may eliminate the need for blood transfusions for the newborn babies. Jacobs said that it would be presumptuous to say that a cure-all has been found. However, he does say that it is apparent that the new compound— produced by the U.S. Vitamin Corporation—has some value in the prevention or reduction </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font7"> the severity of RH fatalities.” The treatment consisted of six capsules, 600 milligrams, daily, and was begun before the fourteenth week of pregnancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“■t’S</span><span class="font24"> TOO late ■ now,”themoth-er said, &quot;leave him in bed.

<p><span class="font24">Many have been the world’s mine disasters, but this is said to have been the worst in Europe since 1906, when over a thousand miners lost their lives at Courrieres, France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">What are the facts concerning the Belgian disaster? In a minor accident at 8:15 on the morning of August 8 one of the wagons in the Bois du Caziep coal mine apparently cut an electric cable and caused a short circuit, which started the rapidly spreading and fantastically deadly fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The world was horrified, but especially in Belgium all other news, even the international Suez crisis, was overshadowed by this disaster. A vivid account of the fire and its fury was contained in the weekly magazine </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">Le Soir Illustri,</span><span class="font24"> which said: &quot;Blocking all exits, a barrier of fire of 900 meters imprisoned 299 miners at the bottom of the pit. It was as rapid as lightning, as pitiless as death. An ejectrlc cable, fractured by a small wagon, a spark of 3,000 volts and, in a few seconds, activated by a violent draft circulating in the mine, a rumbling, roaring column of fire and smoke issued from the pit-shafts used for extracting the coal as well as from the ventilating shafts, blocking all exits. Two hundred and ninety-nine miners were down below. How many of them would see daylight again?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">At 11:30 a.m. an engineer and rescuers tried to go down, but were stopped at a mere 170 meters by a heat so intense that they had to beat a hasty retreat. Their second trip was more successful, and a few men were rescued. Yet, at the pithead, hundreds of families, their eyes riveted on the billowing smoke, waited with dwindling hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Hours turned into days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Tents were erected near the entrance to the mine to take care of the mothers, sweethearts and other relatives who would not leave the site, hoping, always hoping, for news at any time. King Baudouin visited the mine twice. Religious leaders were present. Newspapermen and newsreel photographers recorded the scene, as did the television broadcasters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">At the Scene</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Amid the misery and tears of those awaiting news from below, a woman loses consciousness—she has kept up her vigil longer than her human frame will stand. Red Cross workers go in and out among</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">the crowd, giving bowls of milk to the children. A man attempts to break through the police cordon—he wants to offer his services voluntarily in order to go in search of his brother, or is it a friend? Another lifts a fist and shakes it at the mine. A young woman clasps a rescuer, her husband, dose to her before he goes down into the mine in search of—what? In between them stands their two-year-old child, a fiftger in its mouth, wondering what it is all </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">about. A woman is forced </span><span class="font26">to drink some coffee. Her husband, two sons and a fourteen-year-old nephew are down below. The nephew had gone down for the first time just two weeks before the disaster. Over in the corner stand the cydes, motorcycles and velomotors belonging to the men who are “down there.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">One of the men in the mine is Antonio Lunati, 51. He had worked here for nearly three years, and after his long day’s labor he had worked still longer to build his simple house. Finally he was able to write to his wife in Jtaly, telling her to come and join him. After her two-thousand-kilometer journey to join her husband at her new home she arrived on the train just fifteen minutes after the alarm had sounded at Bois du Cazier. She would never see her ,husband alive again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Hope Fades</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">The entire nation mourned for the</span><span class="font26"> miners and their families. For many days the Belgian national radio canceled all transmissions of light music and broadcast instead somber, heavy music, in keeping with the grave happenings. The fifth day was a national day of mourning and a minute of silence was observed at 10 a.m., as six bodies, already recovered from the mine, were being buried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">The newspapers reflected both hope and despair: “The next 48 hours will be decisive.” “The possibility exists of finding some alive.” “The engineers and technicians gradually lose hope that the air at the 1,035-meter level is still breathable.” “If at 1,035 meters it is the same as elsewhere, then it is certain there are no survivors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Finally, fifteen days after the disaster, the 7 a.m. news broadcast, preceded by a few strains of somber music, announced: “No further hope.” And it reported: “Ninety-two found dead at </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">1,035</span><span class="font26"> meters.” The reports continued: “Forty-two more bodies found.” “A black veil falls on Mar-cinelle—the 1,035-meter level gives up 134 dead.” Five weeks after the disaster efforts were still being made to bring up the bodies of the remaining victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Apart from a few survivors, who escaped right at the beginning of the catastrophe, and in spite of the gallant efforts on the part of the rescue squads, it would seem that those trapped below did not survive very long after the outbreak of the fire. A message was found that had been written on a door five hours after the beginning of the </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">catastrophe: “Fleeing before smoke, </span><span class="font26">there are fifty of us—Wednesday, 13.30.” In addition to the Belgians who lost their lives, many Italians, as well as some Greek and German miners and a British engineer, also perished in the mine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">The Cause</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">While many facts concerning the disaster’s cause were burned in the mine, it is believed that a workman started to push wagons into the elevator to be lifted out of the mine when this should not have been done, that a false signal was given and the cage started to rise, that a wagon halfway into the cage became jammed between the entrance of the cage and the shaft wall, and that this wagon cut the electric cable, causing the short circuit that started the fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">Le Soir</span><span class="font24"> quoted the </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">Courtier de la Bourse </span><span class="font24">(Stock Exchange Journal) as explaining the steps involved, as follows: 1. Signal confusion at the deepest level of the pit 2. False maneuver by the operator. 3. Unexpected outward movement of a badly placed wagon in the cage, 4. Cutting of the electric cable. 5. Three-thousand-volt spark of an abnormally long duration. 6. Combustible material set on fire. 7. Rapid development of a fire in the shaft and a communicating gallery. 8. Beginning of a smoke cloud and toxic gas. 9. Spreading of this asphyxiating cloud throughout all the mine. 10. Numerous hindrances in organizing rescue squads immediately. Remedies for each of these steps were proposed to help prevent such a disaster from occurring again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">Le Soir</span><span class="font24"> asked how the cable could be cut, pointing out that even in a house or apartment it is absolutely forbidden to leave an electric wire bare, even if it carries only a hundred volts. In the home the wire must be protected by a metal tube. Certainly there is even greater reason for this in a coal mine, so the paper asked: “What is the exact position in regard to this at the Bois du Cazier? Inspection reports should exist. What do they contain?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">Le Peuple</span><span class="font24"> pointed out that the fire broke out at 8:15 a.m., and wanted to know why the first rescue attempt was not until three hours and a quarter later. And it asked why the doors separating different levels caught fire, causing a terrific draft that resulted in a terrible conflagration. It thought this meant they were made of wood instead of steel, and asked if this is in keeping with the security so necessary for the miners working down in the pits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Since so many Italians died in the catastrophe the Italian papers also were critical of the lack of sufficient safety precautions to have prevented the disaster. German newspapers, particularly in the Ruhr valley, stressed the importance of finding out haw the tragedy could have happened, and expressed fear that this Belgian disaster would have fatal repercussions on efforts to get Italian miners for German mines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">It is hoped that the many questions raised about the extent of safety precautions in the mines will make it possible to prevent such a tragedy from occurring again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the Bereaved</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">After many days a national fund was opened and appeals were sent out for the support of bereaved families. The need for such assistance was especially evident in one case, where a mother was left alone with ten children—her husband and two eldest sons had perished in the disaster. Millions of francs have been collected as people of all walks of life contributed to the fund. However, untold grief and mental suffering reinain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">It has been reported that one of Jehovah’s witnesses, a Belgian, was a victim of the catastrophe. Another, an Italian, who normally would have been working on that particular shift, was on holiday in Italy at the time. A third witness had been slightly injured the day before and so had not gone down into the pit on the fateful morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Jehovah’s witnesses, in calling upon the bereaved families both here and in Italy, will offer them the same comforting message of real hope that they offer to all who will listen. They will tell them of the nearapproaching time when “there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.” And the witnesses will show them that God’s Word promises that in that new world accidents and disasters of all kinds will disappear, and that no more will there be misery anywhere upon the earth.—Revelation 21:4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">AN you hear me all right?’ That question owes its popularity to Alexander Graham Bell. One day in 1875 Bell was trying to perfect a mechanism called a harmonic telegraph. He was working with acid jars, magnets and wires. Bell’s assistant, Thomas Watson, was attending to one of the transmitter springs. It stopped vibrating; Watson plucked it to start it again. It failed to start, so Watson kept on plucking it. Suddenly Watson heard a shout from Bell in the next room; then Bell came out with a rush, demanding, “What did you do then ? Don’t change anything, let me see!’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fortunate that the right man at the right moment had his ear to a receiver! For Alexander Graham Bell seized upon the faint twang of a bit of steel spring as the key to the secret of sending the human voice through a length of wire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not until the following year did success crown Bell's efforts. On the evening of March 10, 1876, Bell stood at one end of a line, bent over a new transmitter in his workroom. Watson went into another room and put the receiving instrument to his ear. An instant later he was amazed to hear Bell cry out, “Mr. Watson, come here, I want you!” The words jumped out of the receiver. Watson burst into Bell’s workroom, gasping, “I heard every word you said—distinctly!” Then Watson saw the overturned battery and the acid that Bell had spilled over the bench and on hfs clothes; and Watson realized that, unintentionally, Bell had sent an intelligible sentence over wire for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Through the years the telephone has brought marvel after marvel. How marvelous the dial phone to those who use it for the first time! Long-distance dialing is a marvel more and more people are now enjoying. So swiftly do the marvels come that it is difficult to keep up with them. Few persons know that there is now a cordless switchboard, a streamlined space-saver. Then there is the speakerphone, an instrument that leaves one’s hands free while conversing. The amazing button telephone does the work of five telephones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a telephone answering set. If the person you call is not in, a machine speaks for him in his own voice. 'Tm out of the office now,” the voice may say, “but this is a recording. Please leave your message.” Then on his return he will play back the message you spoke and take action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now it even seems as if the question Bell’s invention gave rise to—‘Can you hear me all right?’—will be supplanted by a new one: ‘Can you see me all right?’ Bell Telephone Laboratory engineers have developed the picture phone, described as the first system of its kind to use a pair of ordinary telephone wires to transmit picures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The picture phone is dialed in the usual manner. A miniature TV camera, easy to install, takes the picture. Picture size on the viewing screen ds about two by three inches and is viewed from ope to two feet away. Each person is recognizable, with facial expressions clearly seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The picture phone is not yet available. When it will be depends upon continuing engineering developments and the Remands for it. Will there be a demand? For businessmen the ability to display objects being discussed has big advantages. The desire to see loved ones in distant places needs no advertising promotion. And will mothers not want to hold the new arrival up to the picture phone for fond grandparents to see?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But what happens when the telephone rings at an unexpected moment and one answers in haste with hair disheveled and face unshaven? Fortunately there is a camera switch. So it all depends on whether you remember if the switch is off or on. No doubt the question, 'Can you see me all right?’ has a promising future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Curious Myths</span><span class="font7"> by Baring-Gould tells us the folowing: “In St. Peter's, Rome, is a statue of Jupiter, deprived of his thunderbolt, which is replaced by the emblematic keys.” Presto! We have Peter just that quick!</span></p>

<p><span class="font24">and paint styles, the upholstery and the dashboard were the only significant changes ever made on automobiles. Of the mil</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font24">lions of car owners, it is astounding how few know anything of the great revolutionary developments that have taken place beneath the hood. The piston power plant that gives you the smooth ride you enjoy has not evolved of its own accord from the fourcycle engine of fifty years ago to the V8 configuration of today. It is the result of a half century of engineering refinement and continuous improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">There have been other engines that have attracted the attention of automotive engineers, such as the steam engine, the free-piston engine, the air-cooleds, the electrics, the turbos and even an engine where the cylinders revolved around the crankshaft. But, so far, none of these have satisfactorily measured up to the piston V8 engine— so say the manufacturers. Technicians are convinced that the only power plants that will stick are those that can be as easily manufactured as the piston engine, equally economical with present designs, easier to service, more reliable and potentially more powerful than present makes. And above ail, they must meet popular tastes, regardless of their engineering advantages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Suppose you were to fall asleep and wake up in this world ten years from now. Most likely you would not be too startled by the</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">vehicles you saw upon waking. The engine evolution will be gradual, similar to what has taken place since 1946. What might surprise you, though, would be the hissing and whining sounds of passing autos. You might even say, “It sounds like a jet,” and you would be correct. The compact engines pushing jet planes through the sky at supersonic speeds today are being designed to push cars around on earth. The simple gas turbine engine will work on the same principle as an aircraft jet engine, except that the car will not be driven forward by reaction of a jet stream. Instead, a flow of hot gases is directed against the blades of a turbine wheel and this wheel, in turn, delivers power to the wheels of the car.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">The Gaa Turbine</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The turbocar offers a new kind of ride. It does not leap forward as normal traffic moves from a stop. Its motion is delayed, which is rather disappointing at first. But once it begins to move, you get a sensation quite different from the one you experience in a ride in a conventional car. It seems to flow forward, as though it were coasting downhill with its motor shut off. There is no vibration, no motor noise. All you hear is a soft hiss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The gas turbine has many promising features. It weighs two hundred pounds less than a standard Plymouth engine, yet it is of equivalent horsepower. A lighter engine also means a greater load-carrying capacity. The smaller motor allows designers more freedom to create new body styles, with more room for passengers and better vision. The engine has 80-percent fewer parts, uses about one fifth the oil of the piston engine. There are no pistons, no radiator. The ignition is simple and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">exhaust dean. There is only one spark plug, which is used for starting, and it might easily last the lifetime of the engine. The gas turbine will burn anything, from aviation gasoline to household heater oil. It starts immediately, needs no warm-up and it cannot stall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">With all these advantages, why is the engine not being manufactured? President Harlow H. Curtice of General Motors Corporation said that they are &quot;trying to determine whether the turbine can be harnessed to give efficient and economical performance in the low and normal auto driving ranges.” Right now, to build the turbocar would cost anywhere from $10,000 a car up. The turbine wheel, which is about seven inches in diameter, costs as much as a </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">whole piston engine.</span><span class="font26"> Since it spins as fast as 30,000 to 40,000 times a minute, driven by gas as hot as 1500 degrees Fahrenheit, it must be made of alloys of such expensive metals as molybdenum, cobalt, nickel, chromium and tungsten. Less expensive materials for engine parts that can bear up under intense heat must first be developed before this engine can be made ready for installation in regular passenger cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">In addition, there are other problems that make the engine impractical for mass production at this time. While the engine starts instantly, even in the coldest weather, yet it is sluggish about delivering enough power to move the car. This lag of fifteen to eighteen seconds occurs after every stop and after idling. Think what this would mean at a traffic light during rush hours! Experts warn manufacturers that this hurry-up civilization just will not stand for any car with a slow getaway, despite its other attractions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Another sensitive spot is fuel </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">economy. </span><span class="font26">At full speed the turbine's gas mileage is not too excessive. But at low speeds the ordinary gas turbine is less efficient than a piston engine. And too, since the engine operates under greater strain and at much higher temperatures, its life span is likely to be shorter. Some of the test models had to </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">be overhauled in a thousand hours</span><span class="font26"> of running or less. Some technicians warn that grit and dust will play havoc with turbine blades and a broken turbine blade might be dangerous. Also turbine engines offer no appreciable braking during deceleration. This imposes a severe strain on the brakes. Consequently, the braking equipment wears out more </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">quickly than on</span><span class="font26"> piston cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">The disadvantages of the gas turbine at present appear to outweigh its virtues. However, its advocates declare that none of the problems are insurmountable. But, as is so often the case with a technical improvement, cost is the drawback that keeps it from more general use. A report stated that “recently a company offered to supply Chrysler with a new type of turbine wheel at a cost of $1,000 apiece. ‘This looks good,’ the engineer in charge said. ‘Come back when you’ve got the price down to $25.’ The gap between $25 and $1,000 is perhaps as good a yardstick as any with which to measure the approach of the gas turbine car.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">The Free-Piston Engine</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Many automotive engineers think the free-piston engine may be the intermediate stage between today’s piston engine cars and tomorrow’s gas </span><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">turbines. The principle </span><span class="font26">of the free-piston engine has been known for more than thirty years, and has been applied in Europe for locomotives, ships and stationary power plants with good success. The power plant has no crankshaft or connecting rods and no rotating parts as on a conventional piston engine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">The free-piston engine has two cylinders, each containing two opposed pistons. When fuel is exploded between the pistons they are driven apart and slammed together again. This has the effect of a bellows, forcing air out of the cylinder to turn a turbine wheel, which is geared to turn the rear wheels of the car.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">One great advantage of the free-piston engine over the gas turbine is that the exhaust gases pumped to the turbine never get hotter than 900 degrees Fahrenheit, which means that the blades can be made of noncritical, nonstrategic materials. It can operate on the lowest grades of fuel, from whale “juice&quot; to peanut oil! It has so few rotating parts that friction and wear are far less than in the present engines And it is so perfectly balanced that it operates virtually without vibration or sound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">Popular Mechanics</span><span class="font26"> for September, 1950, declared that “the free-piston engine is by all odds the most efficient power plant ever developed”; that it is “40 to 45 percent efficient—which is to say that it converts this percentage of the fuel it burns into useful energy. Its nearest competitor, the orthodox .type of diesel, is around 35 percent efficient,” and the diesel is more efficient than the piston engine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">A free-piston engine would provide quick getaway power. A truck could start at a traffic light with the speed of a motorcycle. Engineers think that on mass-production basis the free-piston engine would cost far less than engines in use today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Why, then, is it not being manufactured? The big automobile manufacturers have millions of dollars tied up in engine plants and are hesitant about scrapping them to build a revolutionary product, no matter how good. A science magazine reports President Curtice of General Motors as saying that Americans should not expect revolutionary advances, “because the hundreds of millions of dollars we spend annually for new tooling represent a tremendous risk. If we are wrong in anticipating the likes of the public, it could be quite disastrous. The public never demonstrated in the past a willingness to accept so-called revolutionary changes, but is quite willing to accept changes on an evolutionary basis.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">So, as far as Curtice is concerned, the change, if any, will come gradually, not radically; regardless of whether the motor may be a better type, safer, cheaper to run, less troublesome, more efficient, quieter, smoother riding, etc., etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-style:italic;">The Hot-Air Engine</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Another very excellent motor, based on an old and successful principle, is the hotair engine. Careful tests have shown that the hot-air engine surpassed gasoline and approached diesel engines in efficiency. One of its most remarkable features is that it has no exhaust, no valves, no explosions in its cylinders and it is not fussy about fuels. It can run on practically anything that will bum, from oil to wood alcohol. A four-cyclinder hot-air engine, only nineteen inches long over-all, developed enough power to drive a small car and it ran as quietly as a sewing machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">The engine has a “hot” and “cold” cylinder. In the first hot air is expanded, driving a piston and furnishing power to a flywheel and drive shaft. The expanded air is carried over to the cold cylinder, where it is compressed into its original volume. This air is then returned without change in volume to the hot cylinder and the cycle starts all over again. The engine needs no gearbox. It starts quickly, operates quietly, is flexible, efficient and easy to make. It is considered an ideal engine for the low-cost field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Although the hot-air engine was perfected almost ten years ago and used very successfully in the Scandinavian countries, where liquid fuels are scarce, yet for some reason it has never made the production line. Could this be an example of pressure from big business, particularly the oil com-</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">psnies, eliminating anything that will bum cheaper and safer fuels, more efficiently, than their high octane, expensive and dangerous but more profitable gasolines?</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">The British inventor and car designer Harry George Ferguson threatens to revolutionize the auto-making industry with a car that promises to do away with conventional brakes, gearbox, clutch and transmission. According to reports the car will not jerk, stall, skid or jump. Experts predict that it will be “the safest car to drive in the world.” So far no details of the new auto have been made public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">A newspaper report says the car could do up to ninety miles an hour, with fuel consumption of better than thirty miles to the gallon, but it would cost £700 ($1,960) because so many new features were involved. One of the car’s reported features is the ability to move sideways. This, of course, would allow it to park in a space only slightly larger than the car’s length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Electric Car far the City</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">The noiseless, dirtless, exhaustless, smooth-ridlng-at-any-speed vehicle is the flexible electric car—the car for the city. Electrics have never caught on because they have always had heavy, massive, short-lived batteries. The ordinary storage battery now gives only about 13] watthours a pound. In 1942 a prominent automotive engineer declared that “if a battery can furnish 50 watt-hours per kilogram (about 23 per pound), there is a bright future ahead for the electric automobile.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">A French scientist and inventor, Professor Henri G. Andre, says that his new silver-zinc battery can produce some 36 to 41 watt-hours a pound for 300 complete cycles of charging and discharging, or the equivalent. And he adds that this may soon be boosted to 59 watt-hours. According to technicians, Andre’s experimental car offers the soundest basis for the electric idea that has turned up in some sixty years of electric-auto experimenting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Andre's electric car is estimated to be able to run 62,000 miles without any battery replacement, at about half the operating cost of today's gasoline cars. There is no expense for oil or fuel; no drive shaft to break up the passenger compartment, no clutch is needed, since the car is always in gear; no idling, the motor is cut off at a stop. Modern electric motors can be extremely compact and made to fit in almost any small space. The Frenchman figures his car would cost about $3,200 to make, with some French automobile manufacturer as the builder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">Automobile experts are agreed on one thing, that one of these types of engines will ultimately replace the conventional piston engine, just as the jet engine is now replacing the piston engine in high-speed aircraft. Which one it will be, they say, depends on you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">PROTECTION FROM BURGLARS</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Electronic protection is fine, but the security chief of a leading department store found that he could not rely on electronic devices to stop a wave of burglaries. So he obtained four dogs, Doberman pinschers. They make up the canine squad at Macy’s department store in New York city. The dogs’ job is to keep prowlers out once the doors are closed. The dogs, handled by six guards, leave their roof-top kennels when the last customer has left the store. They make the rounds, looking for anything out of the ordinary. One of these canine policemen once found that a steam pipe was broken; she prevented valuable merchandise from being mined. Oh yes, their success as protection from robbery? In over three years’ time, Macy's has not lost a cent to burglars.</span></p><img src="g_E_19561208_files/g_E_19561208-9.png" alt="" style="width:311pt;height:60pt;">
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Pagan Symbols in Catholic Worship</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font8">HE </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Explanation of</span><span class="font8"> tfev </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Baltimore Catechism,</span><span class="font8"> a Cathode book, approved by the late Cardinal Gibbons and many other high Catholic dignitaries, on page 268, under the caption of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Candles,</span><span class="font8"> says: “The Church blesses whatever it uses. Some say beautifully that the wax of the candles, gathered by the bees from sweet flowers, reminds us of our Lord's pure human body and that the flame reminds us Of his divinity. Again, lights are beautiful ornaments for the altar and in keeping with holy things. We illuminate our altars and churches for the reception of our Lord, that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">we may honor him</span><span class="font8"> when he comes in the holy sacrifice of the Mass.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now many reading that language would be carried away with the sentiment there expressed. How many would see the deeper significance of what was there stated, unless the inner symbolisms were understood? Not one reader in a thousand would go beyond the mere beauty of the language, And what is more, most sincere Catholics seem to resent others* prying too deeply into the hidden meaning of the symbols.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the true Christian, in his search for the truth of God<sup>T</sup>s Word, is duty bound to “make sure of all things; hold fast to what is right”—1 Thessalonians 5:21, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">First, notice that the candles used in the description are wax candles, beeswax at that. Why beeswax? Would not a tallow candle do? No more than any material other than wheaten flour would serve to make the sacrificial wafer of the host It must be wheaten fiour for the wafer. It must be beeswax for the candle. Why? Cardinal Newman explains that the use of incense, lamps, candles, images, the ecclesiastical chant and the Kyrie Eleison are “all of pagan origin, and sanctified by their adoption into the Church.” So beeswax </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">candles</span><span class="font8"> are </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">used because those were the </span><span class="font8">exact symbols used by the pagans from whom the custom was adopted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Where, then, must we look for their pagan application? It might shock some to learn this fact, but the truth is that we find a starting point right in the Vatican of Rome. In the Vatican is a statue of the pagan god Mithra. Mithra is also pictured as a lion with a bee in its mouth, held in its lips. Bees make beeswax. But why a lion? A lion in Scripture pictures the conquering Savior. Note what the Revelation says: “Stop weeping. Look! the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered.” But this reference is to the Lord Jesus Christ, and not to Mithra. The honeybee pictures the “word” on the Lion’s lips; and Christ Jesus is also pictured in the Revelation as “The Word of God/’ who gives light. There is nothing counterfeit in all this wonderful description, in symbolic phraseology, of Christ Jesus.—Revelation 5:5; </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">19:13; Genesis 49:9, 10; John 8:12, New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But note how subtly Satan has foisted upon innocent people a miserable counterfeit that turns men away from the pure worship of Jehovah and into the mentally blinding religious superstitions of demon worship. Jehovah warned Israel not to conclude covenants with pagan nations. He said,* “The graven images of their gods you should burn in the fire. You must not desire the silver and the gold upon them, nor indeed take it fbr yourself, for fear you may be ensnared by it, for it is a thing detestable to Jehovah your God. And you must not bring a detestable thing into your house.”—Deuteronomy 7; 2, 25, 26, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trdns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And yet in spite of this warning by God the Roman Catholic Church has taken into its religious house to preserve, not bum, the God-dishonoring symbol of demon worship. Those very pagan statues, which God has condemned as detestable to him, the Catholic Church says it can transmute to evangelical use, in utter defiance of Almighty God. Note Cardinal Newman’s statements: “Confiding then in the power of Christianity [Roman Catholic religion] to resist the infection of evil, and to trans-mute the very instruments and appendages of demon-worship to an evangelical use.” The very thing God Almighty condemned in his people Israel! Where has this adoption of demon worship led them? It has led them to accept the Chaldean god Mithra, a Chaldean symbol of the fake messiah, Satan the Devil, and to install it in their temple and to do homage to it as to God.—Deuteronomy 7:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But where does the beeswax candle come in? Mithra is the pagan counterfeit for the “Lion that is of the tribe of Judah,” the bee in its mouth picturing “the word,” for the Chaldean word for “bee” means also “word.” Hence Mithra is the one symbolized in the lighted beeswax candle. Mithra’s mother, Mylitta, is pictured as the garden in which the bee feeds and derives the source of its honey. She is thus pictured as producing the body of the candle, or the wax. The Roman Catholic Church has borrowed these pagan symbols and has applied them in her worship. Instead of the Chaldean goddess Mylitta being honored as the Queen of Heaven, from whom all sweetness flows, Roman Catholics hail Mary as “Holy Queen,” “our sweetness and our Hope.” The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cabinet of Catholic Information</span><span class="font8"> quotes</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mary as saying of herself; “My spirit is sweet as honey and my inheritance above honey and the honeycomb.” Is not honeycomb the source of beeswax ? </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mary is</span><span class="font8"> therefore symbolized by the garden that supplies what is necessary for the “bee,” the Word of God. Thus she furnishes the body of the child, represented by the wax, and he gives out the light. Note again the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Explanation of the Baltimore Catechism: </span><span class="font8">“Some say beautifully that the wax of the candle gathered by the bees . . . reminds us of our Lord’s pure human body. . . . We illuminate our altars and churches for the reception of our Lord, that we may honor him when he comes in the Holy sacrifice of the Mass.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Instead of honoring the Lord Jesus Christ, the Catholic Church honors the pagan god Mithra and the one whom that god represented, namely, Satan the Devil. They dishonor Christ with their pagan idols. They dishonor Jehovah God whom Christ served. They show an utter disregard for Jehovah’s law, his counsel and his Word, because the Almighty God has consistently shown that he </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">thoroughly </span><span class="font8">loathes and absolutely detests paganism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pope Pius Xn called this the “tragic hour of human history.” This is indeed a tragic hour, an hour when the whole world staggers like a drunken man, confused with the blinding influence of false religion. Blindly it gropes for light, priest and prophet alike. But never once does it appeal to the true God of peace, Jehovah. The Catholic world looks to a poor, impotent beeswax candle with its tiny flicker of pagan light—confusing indeed! But do they want the true light? No, for they fulfill the prediction of the prophet Jeremiah: “A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">their </span><span class="font8">means; and my people love to have it so.” —Jeremiah 5:30, 3L</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">The Philippine Republic</span></p>
<p><span class="font32">T</span><span class="font24">HE Republic of the Philippines is spread over 7,000 islands, of which over 4,000 are not e^n named, and only about seventy of them are inhabited. Here live twenty million people-under a democratic form of government. For the most part they are a people warmhearted and hospitable, inquisitive and very fond of conversation. Their religion is mixed, with the Roman Catholic Church having the largest following. Moslems and pagans each number about 675,000, while the Protestants are less than 400,000 in number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">The Bible is greatly respected by Filipinos, not because they are familiar with its contents, but because of an overpowering curiosity on their part to find out what is inside its pages. Take but a Bible, open it up, point to a few Scripture texts and you will have a Filipino delighted with interest. In fact, he may even take the Bible out of your hand and fondle it with an attitude of reverence. Many of them say: “I have never had a Bible of my own. I wish I had one.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Jehovah’s witnesses are happy to be in this land and visit such people with the Bible and Bible study aids. They have been doing this work in the Philippines in an organized manner for over twenty-five years. World War II, which swept through and devastated much of the country, seems to have stimulated more interest in Bible study. People want to know what the Bible has to say about events now occurring in the earth. And Jehovah’s witnesses are more than anxious to help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">Hence</span><span class="font24"> we find a great increase in Jehovah’s witnesses in the Philippines. While there, were less than 400 of them in 1940, five years later their number had grown to 2,000 and now there are over 24,000 witnesses of Jehovah in the Philippines—an increase of 1,208 percent in ten years! The life experiences of these witnesses read like something out of the Acts of the Apostles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">For example, one minister while standing in front of a shop was glancing through his Bible. A passer-by stopped, looked at him and asked: “Is that a Bible you are reading, sir?’’ When assured that it was, the man said: “Do you have an extra copy that I could have?” “Yes, I do,” said the witness. The man obtained a copy right on the spot. The witness went on checking his various texts before preaching to business managers. Shortly another passer-by stopped, the same episode was repeated and another Bible was placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">“Once a Catholic, always a Catholic&quot; is a statement no longer true. In fact, it has been proved false a thousand times over, as far as Jehovah's witnesses are concerned, because a good many who are now Jehovah’s witnesses were at one time stanch Catholics. A congressman in the Philippine government said to a Watch Tower missionary: “My mother was a Roman Catholic all her life until four years ago when she began studying the Bible with Jehovah's witnesses and then became a witness herself. If you can convince my wife to become a witness, I shall be very happy indeed.” Recently the congressman’s mother died. The congressman was so impressed with the funeral discourse given by one of Jehovah’s witnesses that he went to</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">the Watch Tower Society's Philippine headquarters to get better acquainted with the organization. Today his wish is fulfilled. His wife is now associating regularly with Jehovah's witnesses. Now she has a wish. Her desire is that her husband become a servant of the great God Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A Manila businessman wrote a fine letter of appreciation. Among other things it said: “The girls at the office informed me last month and again this week that you have been calling. I regret to have missed the chance to talk to you. Meantime, I want you to know that I am enjoying the issues of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> immensely. You may put me on your regular subscribers' list. Fil send you a check next week. It is really strange to think of myself getting so interested in your religion, because my religion is Catholic. But no church has a monopoly of goodness. That I believe.” Soon he too may respond to the return visits and to the interest this missionary is showing in his spiritual welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Among those who are classed as pagans, Jehovah’s witnesses here in the Philippines have now established several congregations, These who were formerly pagans are now true worshipers of Jehovah, the only true God. One congregation numbers more than two hundred and in one province alone there are about a thousand of these converted pagans now taking an active part in the Christian ministry. So, as Jesus prophesied, the Kingdom good news is being preached in all the earth.—Matthew 24:14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">The Middle East Explodes</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">&lt;$&gt; For a year and a half pressure has built up in the Middle East. Two events accounted tor this. One was the Soviet bloc’s sale of arms to Egypt. The other was Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, These events alarmed the Israelis, who believed that Western failure to react decisively would increase Egypt’s ambitions. In October Egypt's troops had been largely withdrawn from the Israeli frontier; they were in the Suez region in apprehension of an </span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">Anglo-French</span><span class="font28"> attack on the canal. In October it happened that Russia had trouble in Europe and the U.S, was embroiled in elections,' To Tel Aviv there never was a more favorable time to attack Egypt, Israeli forces struck. They penetrated farther into Arab territory than at any time since the end of the Palestine war. As Israeli forces neared the Suez Canal, London and Paris announced that they would intervene militarily unless the fighting ended. Israel agreed to a cease fire; Egypt did not. With the ultimatum unheeded, British and French forces intervened, initiating their military action by bombing Egyptian airfields. London and Paris said their action was taken to avert a major war in the Middle East and to safeguard the canal. The Anglo-French action, Opposed by the U.S., came as a shock to the world. There was fear the match had been set to the Middle East powder keg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">Poland! “Spring in October<sup>1</sup>*</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">&lt;$&gt; After Soviet leader Khrushchev acknowledged to Tito that there could be “other roads to socialism/’ Titoists in satellite countries were rehabilitated. In Warsaw the Polish Central committee reinstated Wladys-law Gomulka, a Titoist released from prison last April. Nationalist-minded Gomulka urged the dismissal of Defense Minister Marshal Rokossovsky, who represented Soviet control over the Polish army. To ensure success the committee put an old Gomulka comrade in command of the security police. Moscow learned what was happening. A plane landed at Warsaw airport. In it were Khrushchev, top Kremlin leaders and Soviet generals. Khrushchev, in a towering rage, branded Gomulka “a traitor&quot; and said: “I will show you what the road to Socialism looks lifcef If you don’t obey, we'll crush you.” Gomulka told Khrushchev that Polish workers and soldiers would fight Russian troops if they tried to take over Poland. The Soviet generals, facing the threat of a national uprising athwart the supply line of their forces in East Germany, capitulated. After a few hours the most powerful and representative delegation of Soviet leaders to arrive in any satellite country packed Its bags and went home. Gomulka's success rested largely on the fact that he gained control of the security police and thus avoided being arrested. Also behind him were the Polish people, who, as a nation, would have risen up in rebellion against their Soviet masters if Gomulka had given the word. Another success for Gomulka was the Central committee's ouster of Marsha] Rokossovsky, who also packed his bags and <sup>1</sup> left for Moscow. Said Warsaw Radio: “It is spring in October.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">Hungary: Prelude to Battle</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">&lt;•&gt; In 1949 Hungarian Communists staged a coup that brought Hungary within the Soviet orbit. Moscow's control of Hungary thereafter was absolute. The satellite regime bolstered itself with Russian occupation troops, secret police and a 175,000-man Hungarian Red army. But through the years opposition to the regime built up. Catholics were embittered by the imprisonment of Cardinal Mindszenty. Peasants were embittered by collectivization of land. Workers were embittered by a cut in living standards. Rank-and-file Communists were unhappy because Moscow, not Budapest, was running their Communist party. After Stalin’s death a struggle developed between Mat yas Rakosi, a tough, dedicated Stalinist and boss of Hungary's Communist party, and Imre Nagy, the leader of the Communist rank and file. For three years Rakosi and Nagy fought a battle of national versus Soviet communism. As premier, Nagy, regarded by many as a kind man, followed the Malenkov line by putting less emphasis on heavy fridustry. When Malenkov fell from power, Nagy went out; Rakosi came in. Last</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">summer </span><span class="font27" style="font-variant:small-caps;">RAkosI</span><span class="font28"> was ousted, but the nationalist faction was not happy: Rakosi was replaced by Erno Gero, Rakosi’s right-hand man. While the nationalist faction was pressing for the ouster of Gero, events in Poland led to a victory for the nationalistic type of communism, The news had an electric effect. Hungarian students and intellectuals held public meetings, demanding Nagy’<sup>4</sup>” return as premier. The stage was now set for the beginning of a revolution that the Hungarian people were to turn into a war against communism itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">The Uprising</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Pressure built up for the ouster of Gero. Young Communists demonstrated in Budapest streets, shouting: &quot;Down with Gero/’ “We want Nagy,” &quot;Out with the Russians.” The demonstrators sent a delegation to the Budapest radio station so they could broadcast their demands. The delegation was arrested. The angry crowd tried to storm the station. Security police opened fire. Blazing anger swept over the crowd. Rioting began. The Gero regime invited Soviet troops to put down the rioting. To appease the populace the Central committee put Nagy in as premier but kept Gero as party chief. Nagy urged the rioters to disperse. The next day 10,000 Soviet troops and 80 tanks entered Budapest. By noonday violence seemed ended. Then a peaceful demonstration took place in Parliament Square; the demonstrators asked for Gero's complete dismissal. But trigger-happy security police and Soviet tank crews opened fire on the unarmed crowd. When the shooting ended, dead and dying men and women littered the square. This massacre touched off fullscale revolution. The survivors, furious with rage, surged through Budapest streets, tearing down Soviet flaga and emblems and toppling Stalin’s statue. The whole population of Budapest seemed to rise up in rebellion. The uprising spread as Hungarian troops, for the most part neutral, gave rebels arms. The government now announced that Gero had been ousted. But his removal came too late, Masses of Hungarians, some soldiers among them, swept down streets aru actually swarmed over Russian tanks, trying to take them bare-handed. Casualties were in the thousands. At one corner three armored Soviet tanks lay in charred ruins. They had been destroyed by a 14-year-old girl armed with Molotov cocktails. Her body lay nearby. As the rebels gained control of more of the country, Budapest Radio, in a desperate effort to stop the fighting, broadcast: &quot;You have won. Please, please stop. You have won. Your demands will be fulfilled.” The rebels refused to stop fighting until Soviet troops had been withdrawn from Hungary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">North Africa Aflame</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">&lt;$&gt; Algerian nationalists are fighting France for full independence. France wants Algeria, with its large European population, to stay within the French Republic. Half the French army is now fighting the Cairo-backed nationalists. Throughout France the war’s high cost has brought many complaints. Some French officials have pressed for decisive action. In September a ray of hope appeared. The leaders of Morocco and Tunisia said they would try to effect a settlement between Algeria and France. Morocco’s sultan scheduled a conference in Tunis on October 21. The five top leaders of the Algerian rebels, who have been directing the fighting from Cairo, chartered a plane to fly to Tunis. The flight schedule was planned to avoid flying over Algerian territory. But the plane's crew was French, When the plane flew near Algeria, French officials radioed the pilot to land at an airport in Algeria. The pilot agreed. French gendarmes greeted the surprised rebels when the plane landed. The news that the rebel leaders had. been nabbed by a trick touched off anti-French riots in Morocco and Tunisia, More than 100 persons, mostly Europeans, were killed. The sultan, calling the French action an insult to his honor, canceled the Tunis conference. Then the Moroccan government resigned; a new, more strongly nationalist cabinet took over. In France news of the rebels’ capture brought thunderous applause in the National Assembly. But many Western officials doubted the wisdom of the French action, even though the rebel chieftains were French nationals. Some observers believed that the rebel leaders' capture came too late to end the revolt and that now even the whole French army could not bring North Africa back under control of Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">Coup In Honduras</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">&lt;§&gt; Last August a revolt broke out in Honduras against the regime of Dr. Julio Lozano Diaz. As with other revolutions in Honduras, there was bloodshed. About 30 were killed and 60 were wounded. The loyal army, however, suppressed the revolt. On October 7 elections were held. Police in Tegucigalpa flred into a crowd of Liberals, killing one and wounding nine. Election violence killed 11 more. The elections were proclaimed a victory for Dr. Lozano. But the Liberals and nationalists branded the election a fraud. The widespread feeling that the elections were rigged added fuel to the growing resentment against Dr. Lozano’s regime. Then on October 21 the armed forces called on Chief of State Lozano to resign or face bombing by the air force. Dr. Lozano resigned, and Honduras had what was believed to be its first bloodless</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">revolution in history. The new government, made up of a military Junta, said: &quot;We tried to convince the chief of state to take the necessary steps to form a government that would reflect the wishes of the people but were not satisfied by the attitude of the chief of state or his advisers. Therefore, we were forced to take matters into our own hands. . . . On our military honor we promise to return the government to a civilian element that has authentic popular support.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">Singapore in Turmoil</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">Ever since September 18 authorities in Singapore have carried out a strong counter offensive against Communist infiltration. A wave of anticommunist arrests followed. The government suppressed Communist-front organizations, Including the Chinese Middle Schools Students’ Union. In October 1,000 Chinese students staged a sit-down strike to protest against the banning of the union. The police flushed out the students from the schools with tear gas. When they poured into the streets, the students whipped up trouble. Reinforced by other students and hoodlums, gangs of youths put the city in turmoil The gangs, armed with sticks, stones and bottles, attacked pedestrians and vehicles. They bulged more than 30 automobiles. The attacks were directed against Europeans. At least 14 persons were killed. Britain, uneasy about Communist designs on Hong Kong, was plainly worried about the new storm in Singapore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">The Soviet-Japanese Fact</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1951, when the San Francisco peace treaty with Japan was signed, Russia refused to participate. Since then and especially since 1954 the Japanese have sought to end the state of war between the two countries. The post-Stalln regime, Interested ih wooing Japan away from U.S. influence, proved receptive. Rut for months the talks bogged down over Japanese claims for the return of the southern Kurile Islands, in September the two countries agreed to defer territorial issues and tp settle first the matter of restoring normal diplomatic relations. In October Japanese Premier Ichiro Hatoyama flew to Moscow. In a Kremlin conference room Premier Hatoyama and Soviet Premier Bulganin signed a declaration ending the eleven-year state of war between Japan and Russia. Though it was not a formal peace treaty it restored normal diplomatic relations and pledged Moscow's backing for Japan's entry Into the U-N.</span></p>

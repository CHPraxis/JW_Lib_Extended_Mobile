Clergyman Thanks God for Jehovah’s Witnesses
Toward the end of September, 1955, the Watch Tower Society received the following letter from a Baptist clergyman in New York city.
“Dear Brothers:
“It gives me great pleasure to write these few lines and I trust that they will also bring to you some pleasure. My sole purpose in writing is to thank God that I have found the truth. Let me make myself clear, I am not a member of your Society as yet. But I am a minister and have between seven and nine churches that I serve. About two years ago I met Mr. J. M——, and he spoke to me about this truth. Being a minister I listened and invited him to come to my home. As I heard him talk I realized that I knew very little; my people, however, did not know that. My training had been chiefly in the dramatic sphere and from an emotional standpoint and was based on a theology that does not mean much to me now.
“I had a number of your books and I studied ‘Let God Be True’. To sum it up, I am now a black sheep among the Baptist clergymen who held their convention a few weeks ago in Tennessee. But my people say that my sermons are very good—but so unusual, and they are requesting that I hold Bible studies with them, which I am doing to the extent possible.
“In conclusion I again want to thank God for you. And may he continue to bless such men as J. M——. [Signed]”

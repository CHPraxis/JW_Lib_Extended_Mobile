<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>UNWAVERINGLY DECLARING IN MEETINGS OUR HOPE</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The inspired apostle associated the public declaration of our divinely inspired hope with meetings of God’s people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:23-58:10:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 10:23-25</a>, <em>NW</em>) The meeting is one place in which to speak about our hope; but it is not the only place. Christian witnesses must also speak of their hope to those not yet assembling with other believers. During July Jehovah’s witnesses will declare the good news of God’s kingdom from house to house in city and rural areas and also in isolated and remote villages and sections not often served. They will endeavor to leave with people in isolated territory the special offer outlined for this special activity, while in serving their regularly worked territory they will offer three Bible study aid books and three booklets, all on a contribution of $1.50. All are invited to share.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>THEOCRATIC AID TO BIBLE STUDY</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Great treasure is to be found in books. When you enter the public library and see the rows of books you use the card files or ask the librarian for help in finding information buried somewhere in these stacks. Most valuable of all books is the Bible, which is itself a small library of sixty-six books. Can you locate readily in this little library answers to your problems in life? Your key and reference that will direct you to vital subjects discussed in scattered parts of the Bible is the theocratically prepared Bible study aid. Three of such aids are the books <em>“The Kingdom Is at Hand”, “The Truth Shall Make You Free” </em>and <em>“Let God Be True”. </em>Send only $1.50 for all three of these bound books and receive also three smaller publications free. They will make your Bible reading a profitable pleasure.</p>

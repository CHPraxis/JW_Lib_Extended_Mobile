“Only God Has an Answer to It”
The United Press dispatch, March 29, 1956, reports that air force secretary Donald Quarles said that Russia and the United States are approaching a point in the arms race where neither side will dare attack the other. Subcommittee member Charles Deane of North Carolina declared: “It looks like we have reached a point where only God has an answer to it.” The air secretary replied: “Yes . . . But I think somebody said that God helps those who help themselves.” Whom was the air secretary quoting? Certainly not God nor his Word the Bible, for “there is no hindrance to Jehovah to save by many or by few.”—1 Sam. 14:6, NW.

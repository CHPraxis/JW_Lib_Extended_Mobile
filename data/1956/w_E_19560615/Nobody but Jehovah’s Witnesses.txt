Nobody but Jehovah’s Witnesses
The April 16, 1956, Newsweek published an interview with a German youth from East Germany. He had been indoctrinated by the Russians, though not a card-carrying Communist. When asked about the books that were read he replied: “We read Russian and German classics, hardly anything else.” “And the Bible?” his interviewer asked. “(Laughter.) Nobody but Jehovah’s witnesses reads the Bible.” That doubtless accounts for their success in withstanding the brainwashing techniques of the Communists.

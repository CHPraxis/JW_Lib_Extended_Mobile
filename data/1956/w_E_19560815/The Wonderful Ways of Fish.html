<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Scientists are ever coming up with new evidence as to the strange and wonderful ways of fish. In Scotland W. M. Shearer has produced proof that sea trout return not only to the fresh water stream in which they were spawned but to the very same little inlet, even the same stretch of gravelly bank. Shearer discovered this by capturing, tagging and liberating sea trout in the many inlets of the River Dee. A year later he recaptured six of these fish, each one in the same inlet where it had been caught originally. In the United States John Briggs of the University of Florida also came up with something new. He found evidence to support a belief that the first fish returning to a spawning ground swim at once to its outer reaches. The reason for this? Why, to leave room for later arrivals. That is real intelligence! Obviously, giving the fish the credit is not enough, as the God-fearing man Job explained: “But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the birds of the heavens, and they shall tell thee: or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. Who knoweth not in all these, that the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this, in whose hand is the soul of every living thing.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:12:7-18:12:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 12:7-10</a>, <em>AS.</em></p>

It’s Only a Business
● Under the heading “Priests Demand Union Wages” the Ithaca, New York, Journal of January 19 printed an Associated Press dispatch that said that in Ahmedabad about a hundred priests “have formed a union to fight for higher wages and improved working conditions. Contending they are employes of an industry, the priests have asked the Bombay state government to bring them under the minimum wages act and allow them to take their case before a state industrial tribunal.” How unlike the true religion, which is a service of God, not self, and in which mature ministers “shepherd the flock of God . . . , not under compulsion, but willingly, neither for love of dishonest gain, but eagerly.”—1 Pet. 5:2, NW.

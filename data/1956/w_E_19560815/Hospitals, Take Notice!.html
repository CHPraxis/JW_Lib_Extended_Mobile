<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● A personal testimony from one of Jehovah’s witnesses said: “Due to hemorrhage after the birth of my baby I bled for six hours and was practically unconscious when I was rushed to the hospital at Abington, Pa. The doctor said I had lost two thirds of my blood and without blood transfusions I had no chance of recovery. My husband, on his own, sent out and obtained two bottles of <em>Dextran </em>and insisted that it be administered. In view of his insistence the doctors decided to use me as a test case. I responded to the <em>Dextran </em>so well that the attending physician commented: ‘That is amazing stuff. It was absorbed immediately and she is showing wonderful improvement.’ My recovery was far speedier than the doctors expected and I had no untoward effects afterward. Today, two and a half years later, I am still enjoying good health. That was the first introduction to <em>Dextran </em>had by the medical staff of the Abington Hospital. Today they carry a supply of it for similar emergencies. Trusting that this may be of interest to others, I remain [signed] Mrs. C. C. H.”</p>

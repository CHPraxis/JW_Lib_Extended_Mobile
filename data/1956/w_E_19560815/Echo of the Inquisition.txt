Echo of the Inquisition
● At the beginning of this century a priest named Harney of St. Peter’s Roman Catholic church in New Brunswick, New Jersey, made a statement that sounded like an echo of the Inquisition: “I do not doubt, if they were strong enough, that the Catholic people would hinder even by death if necessary the spread of heretical errors among the people, and I say rightly so.”—New York Herald, May 7, 1901, p. 5.

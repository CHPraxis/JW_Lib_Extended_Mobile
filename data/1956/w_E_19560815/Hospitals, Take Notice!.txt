Hospitals, Take Notice!
● A personal testimony from one of Jehovah’s witnesses said: “Due to hemorrhage after the birth of my baby I bled for six hours and was practically unconscious when I was rushed to the hospital at Abington, Pa. The doctor said I had lost two thirds of my blood and without blood transfusions I had no chance of recovery. My husband, on his own, sent out and obtained two bottles of Dextran and insisted that it be administered. In view of his insistence the doctors decided to use me as a test case. I responded to the Dextran so well that the attending physician commented: ‘That is amazing stuff. It was absorbed immediately and she is showing wonderful improvement.’ My recovery was far speedier than the doctors expected and I had no untoward effects afterward. Today, two and a half years later, I am still enjoying good health. That was the first introduction to Dextran had by the medical staff of the Abington Hospital. Today they carry a supply of it for similar emergencies. Trusting that this may be of interest to others, I remain [signed] Mrs. C. C. H.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>KINGDOM PREACHING RESULTS IN TRIUMPH OVER ENEMIES</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The good news of the Kingdom is to be preached under all circumstances and against all opposition. It is remarkable that in spite of the most violent resistance the Kingdom message has continued to be preached, triumphing over its enemies. Nothing can prevent the fulfillment of God’s prophetic assurance that “this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:2-19:110:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 110:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:14</a>, <em>NW</em>) Again this month Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere are going into isolated towns and territories. Those who cannot share in unassigned territory service will present the offer of three books and three booklets in congregation territory. If you wish to share, write us for details.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>A PRACTICAL DEFENSE</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In what kind of defense do you place confidence? Some look to thermo-nuclear weapons, other people put their hope of security in money, still others claim education will level barriers. But to save one’s life the wise course is to heed the words of the One sent forth as the Agent of life: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>, <em>NW</em>) This knowledge can be found only in the Bible and Bible study aids that faithfully turn you to God’s Word. Three of such valuable helps are the bound books <em>“This Means Everlasting Life”, “Let God Be True” </em>and <em>You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World. </em>Make a real defense for yourself and your family by carefully reading these books along with three free booklets on a contribution of only $1.50.

<p><span class="font9">1956 Yearbook </span><span class="font1">of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH, the living God, has the right to demand exclusive devotion. He is the Maker of man and of the earth upon which man lives. All mankind should bring glory and praise to this One, the only Sovereign Ruler, for he himself said: “I am Jehovah, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise unto graven images.” (Isa. 42:8, AS) Jehovah himself reveals that he first made the earth. Then from earth’s dust he created our first parents, Adam and Eve, and placed them in Eden, a paradise home. Jehovah told these two persons to fill the earth, subdue it, and make the whole globe a paradise for their offspring. These two disobeyed God. They preferred to follow the words of another creature, joining him in his rebellion against Jehovah. For rebelling, Adam was sentenced to death. (Gen. 3:19) “Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men.” (Rom. 5:12, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Mankind, still in the loins of their first parents, thus became subjects of the “god of this world,” Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font6">Today mankind lives on this earth, not by right, but by the undeserved kindness of the true God. Not until he chooses to do so will the Almighty God interfere with the false god, the ruler of this world, Satan. Already nearly six thousand years have passed since the rebellion in Eden; still Jehovah has allowed that first disrespectful creature 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(now Satan) to remain. However, Jehovah will not tolerate Satan’s disrespect forever, for pre-dictively he said: “For this cause I have kept you in existence, for the sake of showing you my power and in order to have my name declared in all the earth.” (Ex. 9:16; Rom. 9:17, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> The time for final settling of this issue as to who rules supreme has now come. Jehovah will receive exclusive devotion from all his creation when the false god, Satan, is abyssed in “the war of the great day of God the Almighty” at Armageddon.—Rev. 16: 13-16; 20:1-3, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Students of the Bible have knowledge of God’s purposes, and they know that he sent his Son, Jesus Christ, to lay down his life as a perfect sacrifice in order to redeem mankind from death. This was done 1,923 years ago. Jesus proved himself worthy of being Jehovah’s vindicator, and in 1914 Christ Jesus was placed in a position to rule. His first act in establishing the kingdom of his Father was to cast the Devil with all of his demon hordes out of heaven down to the earth, and with that done we now are very near to “the war of the great day of God the Almighty.” Then Jehovah will show his sovereign power and prove that all devotion is exclusively his. Persons who love righteousness have given to the Sovereign Ruler exclusive devotion. We are living in wonderful days when God-given prophecies about the end of this system of things are having fulfillment. All persons should acquaint themselves with the Bible, read it, study it and get accurate knowledge of it. “For if we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left, but there is a certain fearful expectation of judgment and there is a fiery jealousy that is going to consume those in opposition.” (Heb. 10:26, 27, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> By right thinking, by thinking the way God teaches us to think, we shall be happy to give exclusive devotion to the Sovereign Ruler of the universe. There will be no fear of the expected judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The system of things in which mankind now find themselves keeps them in a very morbid state of mind. Concerning the future, many have no hope. Such live only in the present, saying, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we are to die.” (1 Cor. 15:32, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW;</span><span class="font6"> Isa. 22:13) Men are hateful, lustful, selfish—believing the only way to gain happiness is by conquest of others. They seek this false happiness through conquest in business, in politics, in religion; and often whole nations try to conquer other nations. This world and its people are devoted to selfishness. This will lead to world destruction. There must be a change, and there will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today men worship themselves or other men in high places. They make of themselves idols and love to have it so. People today are no better in this respect than those of centuries gone by. History shows us the worship of stone gods, goddesses, four-footed animals, fish, birds. All kinds of creatures have been carved in wood or stone, then put on pedestals for people to prostrate themselves before. Even God’s chosen people, the Israelites, bowed themselves down before images made of metal, stone or wood; and what was the result? Here is Jehovah’s command through Moses: “You must not bow down to them nor be induced to serve them, because I Jehovah your God am a God exacting exclusive devotion, bringing punishment for the iniquity of fathers upon sons down to the great-grandsons and great-great-grandsons in the case of those who hate me.” (Ex. 20:5, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font6">The whole world knows that it has chosen gods to worship other than Jehovah; and today mankind, wittingly or unwittingly, are against the Sovereign Ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is one archenemy of Jehovah, Satan the Devil, whom the Scriptures call “the god of this system of things.” (2 Cor. 4:4, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> That false god wants to turn every person’s heart and mind away from Jehovah God, to hate him even as Satan and his demons hate Jehovah. The Devil has done and is doing everything conceivable to blind the minds of unbelievers and he puts forth strenuous effort to mislead and blind believers too. He wants all men to worship any object, no matter how degrading, selfish and loveless. He will go to any limits to debauch mankind. But no matter what maneuvers the Devil makes, no matter how loud the propaganda to praise men and worship them, and no matter how severe the pressure of persecution on true followers of Jehovah’s enthroned Christ, the true God still demands of his genuine worshipers </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">exclusive</span><span class="font6"> devotion. For Jehovah’s witnesses there is no room for compromise. They must not bow down to any other gods or serve them. If they do they die, for Jehovah will not tolerate any worship of men or idols.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The life that Jehovah gave to man in the very beginning was a gift, and man, by being obedient to his Maker, was free to use this life to praise and worship Jehovah and so maintain his own life. Obedience to his Maker was essential. The doing of the Sovereign’s will is required of every person living on earth and of every creature in the universe. God’s Son, Christ Jesus, gained eternal life through obedience, thus showing exclusive devotion to Jehovah. The Israelites, on their long trek through the wilderness after they were brought out of the land of Egypt, many times failed in their worship of God. But throughout all of this period Jehovah God was very merciful toward faithless Israel. There were occasions, one after another, that would have given Jehovah just reason to destroy the whole nation. However, for his own name’s sake and because of the promise he had made to their forefathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, he kept on dealing with them as his chosen people. For centuries those stiff-necked Jews went their way and continued to bow down to other gods, forgetting the true worship of the One who gave them their daily needs, and by their actions said: “Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of Jehovah, and he delighteth in them.” (Mal. 2:17, AS) About a thousand years after being delivered from Egypt the Israelites actually used these words, showing how corrupt the nation had become. Can anyone think that the only true God of the universe can allow such disrespect to go on forever?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Later, in Paul’s day, the situation was even worse, and he sized up humankind in this manner: “Although asserting they were wise, they became foolish and turned the glory of the incorruptible God into something like the image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed creatures and creeping things. Therefore God in keeping with the desires of their hearts gave them up to uncleanness, that their bodies might be dishonored among them, even those who exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the One who created, who is blessed forever. Amen.”—Rom. 1:22-25, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>ARE TODAY’S PEOPLE BETTER?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Today some humans may think they have advanced since the days of the Roman Empire, or that they are not like the Israelites, the Greeks or the Egyptians. But are the people today any better in their thinking and in their worship? Look at the so-called heathen nations. They still bow down before their gods of wood, stone and metal. But the Christian nations—surely they are better! On the contrary, they too are still bowing down before crosses, altars and images or dolls supposed to be “the virgin” and other “saints.” Not only in religious practice do we find men, women and children bowing down before their own handmade images and pictures of dictators but we find many worshiping statues of great men, heroes of war, and praying before “eternal” flames or a monument for an “unknown soldier”! Are they not worshiping the dead, who they claim have died, not in vain, but to “make the world safe for democracy”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Have these millions of men and women who have died in world wars made the world safe for democracy or for any of mankind? No; today Christendom bows low and honors her war dead, just like millions of so-called heathens who for centuries have been worshiping all their dead ancestors. Today, in Christendom, men and women seriously trust in carnal weapons and in strong men whom they see, and they actually worship such leaders. This is the world of today. Wherein do they worship the true and living God, Jehovah? Many claim that all this ancestor and image worship, regardless of what it is, brings one closer to God. But does it? To which deity does it bring one closer—to the “god of this world,” Satan the Devil, or to the Sovereign Ruler, the living God, Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today mankind is worshiping idols just as much as did the ancient Israelites and the pagans of olden time. Jehovah rejected his chosen people because they were not giving him exclusive devotion. Today Jehovah God will be casting off a whole world, yes, most of more than two billion now living, because they willfully choose not to recognize the Sovereign Ruler. (Jer. 25:32, 33, AS) It is time for everyone to turn to the living God, Jehovah, to study his Word and to learn his way of life eternal. This “whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one,” said John. (Matt. 13:19; John 12:31; 1 John 5:19, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> In the very beginning Satan was successful in misleading Eve and through her to trip up Adam and to turn them both away from true worship. The wise counsel of Jehovah’s spokesmen of the past and present he has given “that we may not be overreached by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his designs.”—2 Cor. 2:11, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today the world is under the influence and guidance of “the god of this world,” who has blinded the hearts and minds of the people in it. He has blinded them so that they will not see who is the Sovereign Ruler of the universe or understand his purposes. That wicked one does not want man to live; he wants him to perish in Jehovah’s ‘war at Armageddon.’ Mankind, by continuing in their works of the flesh—which are “fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct, idolatry, practice of spiritism, hatreds, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, contentions, divisions, sects, envies, drunken bouts, revelries, and things like these” —will go on to the day of destruction. That is exactly what the Devil wants. “Those who practice such things will not inherit God’s kingdom.”—Gal. 5:19-21, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>WHO GIVE EXCLUSIVE DEVOTION?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Today upon earth there is a New World society of men, women and children who are determined to give exclusive devotion to the true God, Jehovah. They are done with the works of the flesh, for they have been washed clean in the blood and name of Jehovah’s faithful Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. (Eph. 1:5-7, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Now they must bring forth ‘fruitage of the spirit, which is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control.’ (Gal. 5:22, 23, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font6">These sound principles of right living may and must be followed by anyone desiring now to survive and enjoy the approval of the Sovereign Ruler. By making the mind over, that is, by thinking now as Jehovah wants you to think, by thinking beneficially, uprightly, you surely will equip and prepare yourself for New World living. Every person who survives the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” will have proved to his fellows, as well as to himself and to the true God, that he or she really wants to be obedient to Jehovah, giving him exclusive devotion and joyfully worshiping him in his new world of righteousness forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The issue of sovereignty—Who rules supreme? —must be settled; but Jehovah chooses his own time. In many centuries now past he has proved that integrity-keeping persons can be faithful even under extreme adversity. He has proved this by all kinds of men and women from every nation, kindred and tongue. When Jesus Christ was upon earth nineteen hundred years ago he opened up the way for willing ones of mankind to be reconciled to Almighty God. A new nation was being created that would truly bring glory and honor to Jehovah God. That nation, consisting of 144,000 and called the “little flock” (Luke 12:32), Jehovah destined to become joint heirs with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom to rule and reign with him for a thousand years. “Furthermore,” Paul wrote to them, “it is you God made alive though you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you at one time walked according to the system of things of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit that now operates in the sons of disobedience. Yes, among them we all at one time conducted ourselves in harmony with the desires of our flesh, doing the things the flesh and the thoughts willed, and we were naturally children of wrath even as the rest. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us, made us alive together with the Christ, even when we were dead in trespasses—by undeserved kindness you have been saved—and he raised us up together and seated us together in the heavenly places in union with Christ Jesus, that in the coming systems of things there might be demonstrated the surpassing riches of his undeserved kindness in his graciousness toward us in union with Christ Jesus. By this undeserved kindness, indeed, you have been saved through faith; and this not owing to you, it is God’s gift.”—Eph. 2:1-8, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Exclusive devotion Jehovah God is being given by all of these, for they “are being built up together into a place for God to inhabit by spirit.” (Eph. 2:22, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Now even more people of all nations, kindreds and tongues are coming to worship Jehovah. Indeed, a “great crowd” are manifesting themselves in these days along with the remnant or remaining ones of the “little flock.” These all are brought into one fold under Jehovah’s one Shepherd, Christ Jesus. These “other sheep,” as the Bible calls them (John 10:16), know too that Jehovah their God is a God exacting exclusive devotion, and that he will not tolerate any rivalry; therefore they have separated themselves from the world. All in the “one fold” heed Jesus’ statement that he was in the world but not a part of it (John 17:14-16), and: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his [Jehovah’s] righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.”—Matt. 6:33, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Seeking first the kingdom of God demands of one exclusive devotion to Him. The now-established kingdom of God vindicates Jehovah’s name and word. About forty years ago its first operation or act was to cast the Devil from his position of rival in heaven. (Isa. 14:12, AS; Rev. 12:9, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Now Satan and his invisible hordes can operate only in earth’s vicinity. Here, too, their ousting is due. Here, too, the issue of sovereignty or unrivaled rulership Jehovah’s now-established kingdom will settle. (Isa. 9:7; Dan. 2:44, AS) “I Jehovah your God am a God not tolerating rivalry.” (Ex. 20:5, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW,</span><span class="font6"> margin) Jehovah will not give his glory to any other person. His principles of truth and righteousness will be carried out. From now on, in the mind of every living creature, universe-wide, his identity as the Supreme Sovereign and his name Jehovah must stand alone! (Isa. 2:11; Hab. 2:20, AS) “You must not bow down to another god, because Jehovah is exclusively devoted to his name. He is a God exacting exclusive devotion.”—Ex. 34:14, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>“LET YOUR NAME BE SANC TIFIED”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah cannot tolerate any other name to stand equal with his. He is above all. At one time he was alone, with all the power and authority in the whole universe. This supremacy he never has given and never will give to another. Everything that was made, created, brought forth, given life, was at the instance of this One, Jehovah. Creation is his work. He is the source of all life. He can create and destroy when he desires. But Jehovah, the eternal One, from everlasting to everlasting, is the creative God who wishes other persons to enjoy life; hence he gives life as a gift. (Ps. 90:1-17, AS) In Jehovah’s so doing, however, he requires that his creature must recognize him as Sovereign Ruler and give him exclusive devotion. There is no room for competition or rivalry. When Jehovah created man and woman he did not create them to be worshiped. They were to be the worshipers. Jehovah is in the position of a potter. He makes the clay of the ground into a form for his pleasure. The clay on the potter’s wheel is subject to his fingers. It is for the potter to decide the kind of vessel to make—what it will look like, the glory it shall have, whether it should be one of great beauty or just one for common use. After the potter has made many beautiful specimens and set them upon his shelf for people to see, the persons looking at the work of the artist do not worship or praise the vessel. Honor or glory is not given to what is created; but the complimentary remark, the praise, goes to the one that formed the vessel. We should think a person quite unbalanced who stood before a piece of pottery, praising it and glorifying it; but if he spoke words complimentary to its creator we could understand his expression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is the potter. He is the maker. He has produced these beautiful creatures upon earth. He shaped them. He formed them. He gave them their loveliness and made them attractive. He did more. He gave them life. It is Jehovah, then, who is to be complimented. He is the one who should receive the adoration, exclusive devotion. We are the things made. We glorify our Maker, in the same way that the vessel of a potter would bring honor to its creator. It is Jehovah God that has brought us into existence. He is the one to whom credit is due. He does not need to tolerate any rivalry, nor will he.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>‘WALK NOT AFTER OTHER GODS’</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In these days of great selfishness and striving among nations and people there are too many individuals that want praise rather than to give praise. In requiring praise they become rivals of God. The Devil told Eve that ‘if you eat of this tree of knowledge of good and evil you will be like God.’ This idea is still instilled in man, and man wants to be worshiped, even though he is nothing—just dust of the ground, clay formed into a beautiful creature by the Sovereign Ruler of the universe and given life by that Creator. But the living creature does not want to praise his Creator. He becomes proud, haughty, selfimportant; and it is not long until he begins to tell God wherein </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He</span><span class="font6"> is wrong. It is a common thing to read in newspapers the comments of Christendom’s clergymen, and to see how they criticize the Bible, God’s Word. Many clergymen have written books on “higher criticism,” going so far as denying the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus. They claim to be Christians but deny Christ himself as the Son of God. How could such be Christian?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other clergymen of Christendom go so far as to call Jehovah a “bully,” thus bringing the Sovereign Ruler of the universe to a low, despicable position in the minds of those whom this One created. All of this is done to bring disrespect to the Sovereign Ruler and to bring praise to the one who was created, a man. Christendom and its representatives are not giving exclusive devotion to Jehovah. They are interested in their own aims, their own nation, their national wars, even believing that Catholics and Protestants in one country are more blessed, more greatly favored, than Catholics and Protestants in another country. Where is their unity, their brotherly love? Is it just vain words?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is only one true God, and one people living upon this earth, all from God’s original creation; and in his due time all will be of one nation having one God. He will not tolerate rivalry. His kingdom will endure forever. All mankind who refuse to get in line with true worship will be annihilated, destroyed, there being no place in his universe for rebels. “You must not walk after other gods, any gods of the peoples who are all around you, (for Jehovah your God in your midst is a God exacting exclusive devotion,) for fear the anger of Jehovah your God may blaze against you and he must annihilate you from off the surface of the ground.” (Deut. 6:14,15, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> This statement is so definite and positive: “You must never have any other gods against my face,” or, as the margin says, “You must never have any other gods in defiance of me.” (Deut. 5:7, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> But still there are many persons today who worship this world and this system of things, all of which is in defiance of God’s righteous kingdom. On the one hand they pray, “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven” (Matt. 6:10); and, on the other hand, they go forward and support the United Nations organization, which is definitely set against God’s enthroned King Christ Jesus. Religionists have supported and keep on supporting today’s United Nations and yesterday’s League of Nations. Indeed they went so far as to say that this “league” was the political expression of God’s kingdom. Is it not plain to see that they are setting up something of their own in defiance of Jehovah?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>‘CHOOSE WHOM YOU WILL SERVE’</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">How strange it is that today’s world leaders have not heeded the words of Joshua! For Joshua served the same God the leaders of Christendom claim to be serving. He said: “ ‘Fear Jehovah and serve him with integrity and in truth and remove the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt, and serve Jehovah. Now if it is bad in your eyes to serve Jehovah, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve, whether the gods that your forefathers who were on the other side of the River served or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling. But as for me and my household, we shall serve Jehovah.’ At this the people answered and said: ‘It is unthinkable on our part to abandon Jehovah so as to serve other gods.’ ” (Josh. 24:14-16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font6">But though the world leaders do not think that way, that is the way Jehovah’s witnesses think. At some time in their lives every one of the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses was a part of the old world. But they no longer are going to serve the gods east of the Euphrates River, that is, the gods of Babylon, or the gods of Egypt, which put their trust in military strength. Instead, Jehovah’s witnesses have heeded the words: “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.”—Rev. 18:4, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “other sheep” realize Jehovah, their God, brought them up out of Babylon. They willingly came and will not “abandon Jehovah so as to serve other gods.” They see the triumphant kingdom of Jehovah God already established in the heavens, and they see Satan the “god of this world” has been cast down to earth, and they understand the present woe among inhabiters of earth because the Devil has come down to them. Soon the Devil and his whole demonic organization will be abyssed because of not giving exclusive devotion to the Sovereign Ruler of the universe, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Men and women who want to live, not die, must give to Jehovah exclusive devotion. Each of such must willingly choose to dedicate his life to Jehovah’s service and follow his commandments. By following the commandments of God he proves that he loves God. He shows obedience to the will of God. “If you observe my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have observed the commandments of the Father and remain in his love.” (John 15:10, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> This means all Jehovah’s commandments. Some individuals want to choose which commandments they will keep. For example, one will say it is not necessary to be baptized and symbolize his dedication of himself to Jehovah God. He feels that as long as he is associated with Jehovah’s witnesses he will gain Jehovah’s blessing and be taken into the new world of righteousness. He feels: ‘I don’t want to be tied up so tightly with any organization; so I will not be baptized; I’ll go witnessing, but I’ll keep myself free.’ It is not a matter of being tied with an organization. Rather, if you want to live, it is a matter of giving exclusive devotion to Jehovah God. One refusing to be baptized thinks baptism will obligate him and place greater responsibilities upon him. Remember, he already has the responsibility when he has the knowledge. One cannot bargain with God. If he wants life, he gives exclusive devotion to Jehovah God; he keeps God’s commandments and he walks in the footsteps of Christ Jesus and gladly is baptized as an open, public confession of his dedication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sometimes a visiting circuit servant finds a congregation of fifty-five publishers, all going out regularly every month, preaching the good news of the Kingdom and joyfully serving. But on checking the records he finds that twenty of the fifty-five have not been baptized. He wonders why and makes inquiry. He finds that they think that if they symbolize their dedication to Jehovah God too great a responsibility will be put upon them. Ask yourself, Do they really love Jehovah? Are they interested in exclusive devotion to him, or do they want to keep one foot in the old world and one in the new? When Jehovah set out a course of action for his Son, namely, to be baptized in water, then certainly that course of action must be followed by everyone that wants to live eternally in God’s new world. No individual decides whether baptism is right or wrong. A person dedicating himself to Jehovah God and wanting life in the new world must know it is compulsory to be baptized. Some privately think of it as a silly formalism, but in effect such say that they are wiser than God. They flippantly conclude that this being baptized is old-fashioned! Even some might say: “Well, that is the only point I disagree on; otherwise I accept God’s Word.” When further examining, you will find he disagrees also on many other simple things, putting himself in the position of a critic, criticizing the Creator. And here he, the critic, is only a vessel. Has the one created a right to question, criticize or find fault with what the Sovereign Ruler demands of any one of his creatures? (Rom. 9:20, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> When Jehovah shows water baptism is a symbol of our dedication, then that is what every Christian should want to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Was it not said by Jesus: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. And, look! I am with you all the days until the consummation of the system of things”? (Matt. 28:19, 20, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Any individual who wants to live and gain Jehovah’s favor must be humble before Jehovah God and recognize the provision that his Son made for his redemption, and at the same time carry out His commandments. That is why Peter said: “Repent, therefore, and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out, that seasons of refreshing may come from the person of Jehovah and that he may send forth the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, whom heaven, indeed, must contain within itself until the times of restoration of all things of which God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old time. In fact, Moses said: ‘Jehovah God will produce for you from among your brothers a prophet like me. You must listen to him according to all the things he speaks to you. Indeed, any soul that does not listen to that Prophet will be completely destroyed from among the people.’” (Acts 3:19-23, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Listen, then, for these commands are not too much for any creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There may be things that a person does not understand, things that just now are not entirely clear. But the light shines more and more until the perfect day. (Prov. 4:18, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">RS)</span><span class="font6"> The more one studies God’s Word and the more one lives by the commandments of God, the more he sees how reasonable it is; and life eternal is within his grasp. God’s Word is more than common sense. It is wisdom from on high. Follow it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark135"></a>‘NOT OF THIS WORLD’</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses are peaceful, wanting only to be exclusively devoted to Jehovah’s kingdom work. They know their position on earth is to represent God and him alone. Worldly governments do not want their constituents to be neutral as far as this world is concerned. However, when one gives exclusive devotion to Jehovah God he will not be mixed up with this world’s politics, religions or commercial movements. While in the world he is not a part of it. All so minded seek first the kingdom of heaven and Jehovah’s righteousness, and then all other things will be added to them.—Matt. 6:33, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today’s Christian minister cannot live according to the moral code of the old world, wherein it winks its eye at adultery and fornication, thinks it is smart to be drunk. Forgetting and forsaking fine counsel Jehovah has set forth in his Word, more and more persons have become delinquent. Also, more worried have become each nation’s leaders concerning the delinquency. Now any violation of God’s Word shows disrespect for the Sovereign Ruler and his enthroned Christ. Wickedness of the world as described by Jude warns us how it might infiltrate into the congregation of God. And concerning those who try to corrupt the true followers of Christ he said: “These men are murmurers, complainers about their lot in life, proceeding according to their own desires, and their mouths speak swelling things, while they are admiring personalities for the sake of their own benefit.” (Jude 16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Such, of course, are not giving exclusive devotion to Jehovah God; and the scripture tells us that we cannot mingle ourselves with people of this kind or worship their gods or serve them, “for fear the anger of Jehovah your God may blaze against you and he must annihilate you from off the surface of the ground.” —Deut. 6:15, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>SLAVE OR MASTER?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Exclusive devotion to Jehovah God is a very serious requirement. Let us consider it now from Jehovah’s viewpoint. “Exclusive” means keeping others out, or excluding. It means single or sole, or singly devoted. No one can be included in God’s position. He is exclusive. Everyone else stays outside this most honored position that He only can hold. He is alone in his exalted place in the universe. He will not include anyone else with himself. His glory he does not share with another. Christ Jesus appreciated the very exclusive position his Father held in the universe; and on this point Paul wrote: “Christ Jesus, who, although he was existing in God’s form, gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God. No, but he emptied himself and took a slave’s form and came to be in the likeness of men. More than that, when he found himself in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient as far as death, yes, death on a torture stake.” (Phil. 2:5-8, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Again Jesus himself said: “I am going my way to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am.”—John 14:28, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan the Devil chose to try to push Jehovah God out of this exclusive position; and, of course, Satan has not given to Jehovah exclusive devotion, for he seriously considers being like the Most High, and he has put it into the minds of all creation that they should be as God, knowing good and evil; in other words, that they should be judges, deciding what is right and wrong in the universe. So we often find clergymen disputing, challenging, the Word of God, claiming portions of the Bible are just fairy tales; and thus they have set themselves up as God, qualified to question and dispute with Almighty God. What pride!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A humble person, devoted to Jehovah, would be filled with zeal and piety. “Devotion” means an eager inclination or a strong attachment; an ardent love or affection for one. Devotion has to do with one’s religiousness. Today one who understands true religion carries on genuine worship, even as Jesus predicted: “The hour is coming, and it is now, when the genuine worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for, indeed, the Father is looking for such kind to worship him.” (John 4:23, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Anyone giving Jehovah God exclusive devotion will not allow anything else to break into that devotion or to mar it. Jehovah cannot tolerate it; therefore the individual should not let anything interfere. One’s devotion to Jehovah God must be filled with love. It must be an ardent love, a single love to Jehovah God—not a love that can be divided with someone else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On Exodus 34:14 the translation of the French </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Abbe Drioux Version,</span><span class="font6"> 1884) puts it this way: “The God who wants to be loved uniquely”—that is, he wants to be loved in a class by himself, singularly. When upon earth Christ Jesus mentioned two commandments. First, said he, you must love the Father with all your heart, mind, soul and strength; secondly, Love your neighbor as yourself. Here again this puts Jehovah God in a singular or unique position, exclusive, separated from all other love. He is outstanding and in a position alone, as Sovereign. Love goes directly to him without any sharing of that love. That is exclusive devotion. The similar Second Commandment is that we love our neighbors as we love ourselves. Although this love takes in a greater sweep, embracing humankind, who in turn can love us, yet no one human becomes exclusive in this unselfishness on our part. Our love for neighbor can include all mankind. But as to the Creator, he alone claims and rightly is given exclusive devotion. Loving our neighbor as we individually love ourselves is not exclusive, though proper. We do not worship the neighbor, but just show love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With Jehovah our love involves worship, service, obedience; and in this he tolerates no rivalry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus showed the principle of this individual love, for he was very well acquainted with his Father, so well acquainted that he could say when one knew the Son he also knew the Father. “Jesus said . . . ‘No one comes to the Father except through me. If you men had known me, you would have known my Father also.’ ” Setting forth the principle of exclusive devotion to Jehovah God and his kingdom, Jesus also pointed out that greater love for the Kingdom and the vindication of Jehovah’s name is more important than the love of neighbor. The creature’s only approach to the heavenly Father now is through the Son; therefore Jesus said: “Everyone, then, that acknowledges his belief in me before men, I will also acknowledge my belief in him before my Father who is in the heavens.” And, then, to show how great must be this love for the Father that is shown through the Son, Jesus says: “He that has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me; and he that has greater affection for son or daughter than for me is not worthy of me. And whoever does not accept his torture stake and follow after me is not worthy of me.”—John 14:6, 7; Matt. 10:32, 37, 38, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After Jehovah’s ‘war at Armageddon’ all survivors will know him and give him their first love. Even today Jehovah’s witnesses must give him such love through the Son, Christ Jesus; and that puts us in a unique relationship with our Creator, for ‘he is a God that wants to be loved uniquely.’ “The Father is looking for such kind to worship him.” That worship will be with spirit and truth, and it will be exclusive. There is no one else involved in this love and worship; hence it stands alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When one is so exclusively devoted, it suggests another unique relationship between the two, that of master and slave. Jehovah is the Master because he is the Creator, the Owner; and it is required of the creature or owned one to do the will of his Master. Jehovah is the exclusive and sole owner of the creature. He made him. Jehovah God arranged for his Son to purchase the human family, so the scripture says: “You were bought with a price; stop becoming slaves of men.” (1 Cor. 7:23, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> In his letter to the Corinthians Paul set forth a very interesting discussion about slaves: “In whatever state each one was called, let him remain in it. Were you called a slave? Do not let it worry you; but if you can also become free, rather seize the opportunity. For anyone in the Lord that was called a slave is the Lord’s freedman: likewise he that was called a free man is a slave of Christ. You were bought with a price; stop becoming slaves of men. In whatever condition each one was called, brothers, let him remain in it associated with God.”—1 Cor. 7:20-24, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In early Christian times it did not make any difference to God or Christ Jesus if people were free men or slaves. They could still be called to the high position of joint heirship with Christ Jesus in heavenly glory. But no matter what condition they found themselves in, bond or free, such became slaves of Christ; and it was only in that manner that they could become associated with God. Now, too, the person who comes to Jehovah and dedicates himself through Christ Jesus to Jehovah’s service makes himself God’s slave. In this action the Christian is not hypocritical but sincerely pleased to give exclusive devotion to the Sovereign Ruler and to carry out the will of the Father, just as the Son showed obedience to the commandments of his Father. This slavelike relationship comes from the heart. It is the dedicated one’s innermost desire. In his heart he has the proper inclination toward God. For him it is natural to want to obey the true God. It is such an individual’s deliberate choice to be a slave. It is the dedicated person’s preference to put himself in this slavelike relationship to the rightful Master, Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>“SLAVE TO TIME INDEFINITE”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In days of ancient Israel sometimes it became necessary for the Hebrew to sell himself into slavery. God’s Word tells us: “In case you should buy a Hebrew slave, he will be a slave six years, but in the seventh he will go out as one set free without charge. If he should come in by himself, by himself he will go out. If he is the owner of a wife, then his wife must go out with him. If his master should give him a wife and she does bear him sons or daughters, the wife and her children will become her master’s and he will go out by himself. But if the slave should insistently say, ‘I really love my master, my wife and my sons; I do not want to go out as one set free,’ then his master must bring him near to God and must bring him up against the door or the doorpost and his master must pierce his ear through with an awl and he must be his slave to time indefinite.” —Ex. 21:2-6, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here we find a man in slavery, wholly devoted to his master, and he goes so far as to say: “I really love my master.” For a Christian too this is the right frame of mind to be in. Always he should see himself in the slavelike position, eager to serve the Master, Jehovah, who has given him life and all its blessings. No one should ever want to be free from Jehovah God, to go his own way. The Devil was the first one to hold this wrong desire and his end will be destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God rightfully demands exclusive devotion. But when this exclusive devotion is given to the Sovereign Ruler of the universe it must be given on the choice of the individual. He will not be forced to it. He must desire to give it, willingly, gladly. No one will drive him into this position or push him into the service of Jehovah God. But because of his study of God’s Word, his wanting to do Jehovah’s will, it is his inclination, his preference, to be in full harmony with God and God’s purposes and to be his slave, even as Jehovah’s Son Christ Jesus was delighted to do the commandment of his Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One who has dedicated himself to Jehovah’s service certainly is like this Hebrew slave who is willing to be a slave to time indefinite. As to members of the New World society, this means for eternity. Jehovah so loved the world that he sent his only-begotten Son to this earth so that those on earth who choose to believe on him might have everlasting life. He arranged for his Son to purchase the human family. There are many who will refuse to recognize themselves as slaves and come under this purchase price and will choose to go their own way, but that way of theirs, which is the way of “this world,” will mean their death. —John 3:16; 1 John 2:17, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The memory of the righteous is blessed; but the name of the wicked shall rot.” (Prov. 10:7, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AS) </span><span class="font6">Those who refuse the ransom will die eternally and thus be annihilated, never having any existence. Just as Jehovah God recorded through his prophet Jeremiah: “They shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.” (Jer. 51:57, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AS)</span><span class="font6"> All persons who have dedicated their lives to the service of Jehovah God must realize that being a Christian is a serious thing; and, as expressed by Moses: “You must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way, for Jehovah will not leave the one unpunished who takes up his name in a worthless way.” (Ex. 20:7, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> One should not think that because he has dedicated himself to Jehovah God and was baptized in water, God now is obligated to do everything for him. God certainly will carry out his part of the agreement in blessing ahd caring for one; but the slave who says that he will give exclusive devotion to Jehovah God must also carry out his part of the arrangement. He must show that he is a slave, and an obedient one of the Sovereign Ruler. One’s life is dependent on his true, genuine worship, and ‘the Father is looking for such kind of worship,’ for he is “a God exacting exclusive devotion.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>“MY LOAD IS LIGHT&quot;</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Most people in the world take the course of least resistance, and they follow the way of the great majority, which leads into sin and eventually death and annihilation. Some think that being a Christian is a very difficult task, and greater than they can bear in this wicked world. Many do not mind being “Christians,” so called, of Christendom, where they can practice all the self-indulgences, carrying on the lusts of the flesh as Christendom approves; and they feel that they are doing all right. But to be a real Christian, one who is walking in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, is considered in the minds of most people a hard thing to do. But how can we harmonize the supposedly difficult task of being a Christian with the expression of Christ Jesus, who said: “My load is light”? Let us see what Jesus said: “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you. Take my yoke upon you and become my disciples, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for your souls. For my yoke is kindly and my load is light.” —Matt. 11:28-30, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just what does Jehovah God require us as Christians to do? As we examine the Scriptures we find that the first thing is to preach the Triumphant Kingdom message throughout all the world for a witness to all nations. All people are able to talk in some language and express their feelings and their thoughts. And if one has a real, deep feeling of devotion to Jehovah God and has the mind of Jehovah as expressed in his Word, then he will preach good news to others. This in itself certainly is not a difficult task. Those of mankind who have been toiling and slaving in the Devil’s organization and have made themselves slaves to it Jesus invites to leave their loaded-down condition and come to him and be refreshed. Jesus does not ask you to take the yoke upon yourself and do all the work alone. The marginal rendering of this expression “Take my yoke” says, “Get under my yoke with me.” In other words, pull the same load and do the same thing that Jesus did when he was upon the earth. His assigned work was to preach to the lost sheep of Israel and get them in line for the blessings of God’s kingdom. Not only Jesus himself did such preaching but he sent his disciples out to the villages to preach the good news of the Kingdom. At his feet he wanted them to become learners of Jehovah’s purposes and then to tell them out on every occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In reading the life of Christ in the four Gospels we do find that Christ was a mild-tempered person, lowly in heart; and all those who came to him found refreshment for their souls. The sick, on being healed, were anxious to tell what happened; and for his immediate followers the only responsibility he placed upon them was to preach, to talk to others and bring them comfort. He told them to go from house to house, from village to village, from city to city, from country to country. And this great expansion work of going to non-Jews from country to country began seven years after Jesus began his preaching. First of all the message was to go to the Jews to give them full opportunity to hear the divine message; and this message was presented in a most simple manner, merely by a speaking program. Certainly that yoke was kindly. It was not a heavy load placed upon anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Well, where does the difficulty arise in being a Christian? Certainly it is not the preaching that is difficult. It is the opposition that the Devil brings up against those mild-tempered and lowly in heart who do the work that Jesus has assigned to Christians to do. Jesus warned us that the opposition would be intense, but the work that he gave Christians to do would be light. It would not be a heavy load, more than they could bear. In his sermon on the mount Jesus said: “Happy are the pure in heart, since they will see God. Happy are the peaceable, since they will be called ‘sons of God’. Happy are those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them. Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every kind of wicked thing against you for my sake. Rejoice and leap for joy, since your reward is great in the heavens; for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you.”—Matt. 5:8-12, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus, describing conditions that would exist in the earth in these last days when this good news of the Kingdom should be preached, says concerning Christians: “But before all of these things people will lay their hands upon you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, you being haled before kings and governors for the sake of my name. It will turn out to you for the purpose of a witness.” (Luke 21:12, 13, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> All this persecution comes from the Devil’s crowd because Christians are doing a good thing, giving Jehovah exclusive devotion. Just because you go about peacefully preaching the good news, which directs the attention of people to the Sovereign Ruler of the universe and to true worship, the Devil with his demons and his whole organization will oppose you. So, then, we see the thing that is hard is the stand we must take against the Devil and persecutors whom he raises up against human creatures for being faithful to God. The Devil has always been a cruel taskmaster, but Jehovah God through his Son Christ Jesus has given us a work not difficult to do. It is merely to preach. It is this kind, simple Kingdom truth that we bring to people that the Devil objects to. The communistic nations, the democratic nations, the religionists, the politicians, the commercialists, all object to the persistent earth-wide heralding of God’s wonderful triumphant kingdom for the blessing of all mankind. The objectors do not want it! They are opposed to God’s kingdom. But despite all the opposition that comes against Jehovah’s witnesses they move forward in greater numbers and with greater zeal than ever before in carrying out exclusive devotion to the Sovereign Ruler, Jehovah. They are dedicated to God for doing this service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They know by experience that Jesus’ words are true: “My load is light.” They also know that if they take up this load and get under the yoke with Christ Jesus they are going headlong into opposition from the Devil’s organization. But despite the opposers’ activity, Jehovah’s witnesses in the year 1955 have had the grandest field-service report ever offered in honor of Jehovah’s name and in defense of his Word. They have been bringing the “whole tithe” into the treasure house of God, and he has opened up the windows of heaven and poured out a blessing till there was no place for it. (Mal. 3:10, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Da)</span><span class="font6"> Each year Jehovah’s witnesses recount the blessings that Jehovah has bestowed upon them by sending in a report, which indicates the joy and pleasure they have had in preaching this good news of the Kingdom. (See chart for activities of Jehovah’s witnesses in different parts of the world.)</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font6">the Kingdom in 158 lands. This is an increase of 44,770 more than in 1954; or an per cent increase in the average number of persons going out in the field service monthly, talking to others con-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">cerning the Kingdom. Many newly interested individuals began preaching for the first time, and this brought the peak of publishers up to 642,929 for 1955 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the great joys of the year was the bountiful blessing Jehovah poured out upon his servants during the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses. In the thirteen conventions held during ten weeks there were 403,682 in attendance at the public lecture. But what brought greater joy to the hearts of all those who have dedicated themselves to Jehovah God was that 13,016 “other sheep” were baptized during the ten-week period. Throughout the entire service year many more persons were determined to give Jehovah God exclusive devotion; and in the twelve months of the year 63,642 individuals were baptized by complete water immersion, declaring themselves to take on the light load of preaching this good news. This places responsibility upon those already associated with the New World society for years, and that is to train these new ones and bring them on to maturity and help them see their privilege of being regular congregation publishers as well as advancing into pioneer service and special assignments as missionaries in other parts of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today there are 17,011 full-time ordained ministers working throughout the world. To these ranks there could be added many more; and the Society confidently hopes that those who can arrange their affairs to get into the full-time ministerial activity will do so, for in this field there is an abundant blessing. A slight decrease in the number of pioneers has appeared during 1955 service year, there being 254 fewer full-time ministers than in 1954. We sincerely hope that this becomes reversed during the 1956 service year, and that many more will feel confident that Jehovah will open up the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing greater than the pioneers can contain, even as he is doing for all of his servants in overflowing measure. All of these ministers not only preach the good news from house to house and conduct Bible studies, but they leave printed sermons with the people in the form of Bibles, books, booklets and magazines, as well as tracts and other publications that will aid a person to gain a clear understanding of what Jehovah’s purposes are in these last days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year 2,927,062 bound volumes were distributed along with 27,941,465 pamphlets. In addition to this, 36,500,383 individual copies of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazines were distributed from house to house world-wide in forty different languages. New subscriptions to the number of 1,008,221 were obtained for these two magazines, which shows the intense interest on the part of the general public in the message Jehovah’s witnesses have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a way in which each individual can show God that he loves him and wants to worship him; and this way is by staying close to Jehovah’s organization, bringing in the tithes to the storehouse, which includes attending meetings, giving comments, going from house to house preaching, carrying on back-call and Bible study activity in the homes of the people, attending public meetings, and making what material contributions can be made to the organization to advance the Kingdom interests locally and world-wide. Surely Jehovah’s witnesses have been doing this in 1955. Throughout the world there are now organized 16,044 congregations where regular studies are held; and these congregation publishers who have been attending such meetings spend much time, in addition to worshiping in the Kingdom Halls, in their going from house to house preaching the good news. In fact 85,832,250 hours were spent in house-to-house, village-to-village, city-to-city, country-to-country preaching even including iron curtain countries that strenuously object to the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. And when interested people were found, back-calls were made to the extent of 27,143,319, and eventually these turned into Bible studies numbering 337,456 home Bible studies conducted every week throughout the year in the many languages that the missionaries and publishers of the Kingdom speak. There is very marked interest in the work Jehovah’s witnesses are doing, because at Memorial time, April 7,1955, 878,303 persons gathered at Kingdom Halls and celebrated the death of Christ Jesus; and, of these, 16,815 profess to be of the “little flock.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So the work of Jehovah’s witnesses goes on grandly. Jehovah’s blessing is truly upon his New World society. And when we look back over the past ten years we see what prosperity Jehovah has brought to his people. In 1945 there was an average of 127,478 publishers sharing in the preaching work. But today we have an average of 570,694.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As we compare accomplishments of 1955 with previous years we find it is away ahead of any other year in announcing the triumphant kingdom. Because of the success of Jehovah’s witnesses many religionists have accused the Watch Tower Society of being a book-selling organization. But when one looks over the annual report of the Society surely he can see that all those who have devoted themselves to the interests of the Kingdom are ordained ministers, interested in preaching and in placing in the hands of the people things that will bring blessings to them. And so the printed sermons that are published in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> magazine, the books and the booklets that are distributed in great numbers, have brought untold comfort to the hearts and minds of the people. In order to keep up with the demand on the part of the public for the message that Jehovah’s witnesses are bringing them, it has been necessary to print 86,590,360 magazines—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6">—and 46,792,097 Bibles, books and booklets, world-wide. These publications could never be printed in such large quantities were it not for the contributions made by Jehovah’s witnesses themselves to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It should be kept in mind that thirty years ago the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font6"> magazine was being offered at a dollar contribution for a year’s subscription. Then came the “depression” and “inflation” and today’s “world prosperity” with great increases in costs of paper, ink, machinery and building; but still, after all these years have passed with stupendous changes in the world, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> magazine is being offered to the people at one dollar a year for a subscription, twenty-four copies. If it were not for the generosity of Jehovah’s witnesses in supporting the printing of these sermons, this extensive distribution could never be accomplished. Furthermore, if it were not for the zeal and the devotion that all of these witnesses are giving to Jehovah God, this distribution could never be reported here. It is their labor of love that makes it possible for the New World society to put the literature out in such tremendous quantities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To do this work is a joy to the heart of every one of Jehovah’s servants; and they fully agree with Christ Jesus when he said, “My load is light.” Our work is to preach this good news of the Kingdom. The Devil’s organization, the archenemy of Jehovah God, is trying to make this work very difficult and tries to throw every obstacle in its way that he can to slow it down or turn God’s servants away from true worship. In this he will fail, for in the end all persons who gain eternal life will give to Jehovah God exclusive devotion. He will be alone in the universe as the Sovereign Ruler, even as he is now only with opposition. In that new world of righteousness all the opposition of Satan the Devil and his demons, and all those who side with him, will be destroyed, annihilated, moved out of existence; and there will remain true worshipers in the entire earth, all giving to God exclusive devotion. Jehovah puts the test to every one today. Are you willing to meet the test?—namely, “Bring the whole tithe into the treasure-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I open not to you the windows of the heavens, and pour you out a blessing, till there be no place for it.”—Mal. 3:10, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Da.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“TRIUMPHANT KINGDOM” ASSEMBLY June 22 to August 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year 1955 was outstanding in the life of Jehovah’s witnesses. The greatest convention ever arranged for the New World society was successfully held during the summer, beginning Wednesday, June 22, and ending Sunday, August 28. The convention was unique in this: The principal speakers spoke and the same program was carried on in thirteen different cities in ten consecutive weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just as summer began in the Northern Hemisphere, Jehovah’s witnesses assembled at Chicago, Illinois. Five days of beautiful, clear weather started the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies with a peak attendance of 42,116 gathered in the huge Comiskey Park Sunday afternoon (June 26) to hear the lecture “World Conquest Soon—by God’s Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Week after week great crowds gathered in different parts of the earth. The second thrilling convention was at Vancouver, British Columbia; then Los Angeles, California, which proved to be the third-largest convention in the United States; then on to Dallas, Texas; and then New York city, which closed the series for the North American continent. In the Western Hemisphere the peak attendance for any one place was 55,009, at the world-famous New York Yankee Stadium. This was the third time that Jehovah’s witnesses had used this fine assembly place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Eastward then to Europe. Not only the principal speakers this time, but thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses from the United States and Canada and from all parts of the world converged on London, England. Upward of 5,000 delegates from more than fifty countries settled themselves in the stadium at Twickenham with their British brothers, there to enjoy the greatest convention Jehovah’s witnesses had ever held in Britain. The peak attendance was 41,970.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Conventions at Paris, France, and Rome, Italy, were held simultaneously the following week. Then on to Nuremberg, Germany, where the largest gathering of all was held in the Zeppelinwiese Stadium. Paralleling this gathering at Nuremberg, Jehovah’s witnesses met at Berlin, Germany; and more than sixty nations were represented in this massive assembly in Germany. At Nuremberg, spread out in the great field before the speakers’ platform, there were gathered 107,423 on Sunday afternoon (August 14) to hear the discussion on Jehovah’s kingdom, with ample proof that this kingdom alone would gain world conquest, and that for the blessing of mankind. It was thrilling indeed to see thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses camping out on the spacious grounds in all kinds of tents and in special structures put up by Jehovah’s witnesses so that they might inhabit them for their week’s stay. Truly Jehovah’s witnesses from all nations, kindreds and tongues were mingled together, making a new nation and carrying on true worship of the Sovereign Ruler. At every one of these conventions thus far, and those to follow, it was to be seen that this New World society was determined to give to Jehovah exclusive devotion and to promote true worship to the ends of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After this most thrilling Nuremberg-Berlin assembly in Germany, great crowds of people gathered at Stockholm, Sweden, and at The Hague, the Netherlands, during the following week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Throughout all of Europe Jehovah’s witnesses were prominently seen, due to the fact that each of them wore a very neat lapel card that identified the wearer as a delegate to the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly. During the whole summer, in America and Europe, Jehovah’s witnesses were “the talk of the town.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bringing the 1955 service year of Jehovah’s witnesses and the New World society to a close, the thirteenth and final assembly was held in Helsinki, Finland, during a week of beautiful weather, but, more important still, with spiritual blessings poured out from the heavens above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thirteen assemblies in ten weeks’ time brought together 403,682 persons to hear the public address; and outstanding during these ten weeks is the fact that 13,016 persons symbolized their dedication to Jehovah God by being immersed in water at these different assemblies. This grand “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly brought the service year of Jehovah’s witnesses to a close and there was no question in the mind of anyone that Jehovah had poured out a blessing greater than we could contain, and that set his organization off for greater advancement in the 1956 service year. The “great crowd” from all nations, kindreds and tongues was still coming to Jehovah’s temple for worship; and the New World society was anxious to receive them, to teach them and to help them render exclusive devotion to the Sovereign Ruler. Outstanding during this year was the breaking down of national barriers. At these conventions there were no Germans, no Frenchmen, no Italians—they were all Jehovah’s people. There was no politics, no division in religion, no commercialism—they were a peaceful people looking forward to life eternal with one another in a new world, God’s new world of righteousness here upon earth. Astonishing was the fact that upward of 6,000 persons moved from Britain to France, to Italy, to Germany, to Sweden and the Netherlands, on special trains, without any fuss or flurry. All the conventions began on time. The programs were held to a minute schedule. The releases of literature in many languages were hailed with great joy and gladness. Outstanding, of course, was the release of five new publications in the English language. First was Volume II of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures.</span><span class="font6"> Then came the very instructive bound book for the education and better training of the ministers of Jehovah God, entitled “Qualified to Be Ministers.” At all of the English-speaking conventions on the third day there was released a new 96-page publication </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What Do the Scriptures Say About “Survival After Death”?</span><span class="font6"> This contains much about spiritism and the influence of the demons over the present evil world. With great gladness all of Jehovah’s witnesses received the third hard-bound book on the fourth day of the assembly, entitled “You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those attending this marvelous assembly certainly appreciated that Jehovah is in his holy temple, and that the time has come for all people who want life to come to that temple of Jehovah, there to worship and praise him. On the closing day of the convention the public lecture, heard by more than 400,000 persons during the ten weeks, was published in booklet form, being released on that occasion in the language of the country in which the lecture was given. Since that release, millions of copies have been distributed; and many now are anxiously looking forward to the day when Jehovah will strike against the evil governments of the earth and establish his new world of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All of these great happenings over a short period of time (five days at most in each city) caused the newspapers to take note of this great Christian movement. Moving pictures, television, radio, magazines and newspapers were anxious to bring to their public the happenings about Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly’s message still ringing in their ears and filling their hearts to overflowing, Jehovah’s witnesses went back to their homes in all parts of the earth, looking forward to 1956, ready to take hold of the big responsibility that Jehovah God places upon them of continuing the preaching of this good news of the triumphant kingdom in all the world, for a witness to all nations. For details of this grand gathering one can read the report on the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies, beginning in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> for December 1, 1955, and continuing for several months thereafter.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>ADEQUATELY QUALIFIED MINISTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses are a society of ordained ministers. They having dedicated themselves to serve Jehovah God, it is incumbent upon them to “preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season, reprove, reprimand, exhort, with all long-suffering and art of teaching. You, though, keep your balance in all things, suffer evil, do missionary work, thoroughly accomplish your ministry.”—2 Tim. 4:2, 5, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One who is going to thoroughly accomplish his ministry certainly must preach the Word of God; the Bible is the textbook for every one of Jehovah’s witnesses. They receive their ordination from Jehovah God, not from man; for the scripture clearly states: “Our being adequately qualified issues from God, who has indeed adequately qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant.” (2 Cor. 3:5, 6, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Accepting the responsibility and adequately qualifying themselves by the study of God’s Word, Jehovah’s witnesses do go forth to the ends of the earth, doing missionary work, home Bible study activity, organizing congregations and seeing to it that the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses remains clean and exclusively devoted to Jehovah’s service. Many individuals are selected from the New World society to look after the organizational activity and to give special service to the greater number of Jehovah’s witnesses. Now there are upward of 642,000 in the New World society and it takes organization to assist all of these to carry out their ministry. To this end the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society has appointed special workers, such as branch servants, district servants, circuit servants, and members of the Bethel families in respective branch offices; and all of these serve in a special capacity, looking well to the interests of the entire organization. The Society lists here those persons assigned to special duties.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark149"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>SPECIAL TRAINING COURSE FOR MISSIONARIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Watchtower Bible School of Gilead continues to train some of the full-time ministers for missionary-field work. The missionary field has become a big department of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. The twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth classes have already been trained in this school. To date 2,631 have finished the training course, of the 2,721 that started. Of those that finished, diplomas were issued to 2,478, which leaves 153 individuals that failed to meet the diploma standard. It is necessary for everyone to put forth diligent effort to take in the knowledge that the Society wants these missionaries to have in order to be adequately qualified for this service. This school is truly an international school of higher learning. It is interesting to note that 1,155 of the students have come from fifty-eight different countries; the rest of the students from the United States. Upon graduating, they have been sent to the ends of the earth, being now scattered throughout 100 countries, preaching the good news. Our prayers go with them as they gather the “other sheep,” organize small congregations, build them into large ones and establish branches. It is necessary for them to keep their balance in all things, suffer evil, do missionary work and thoroughly accomplish their ministry. A report from the school’s registrar follows.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark151"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark152"></a>TWENTY-FOURTH TERM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">September 1, 1954, opened the fall term of the school with the matriculation of the twenty-fourth class. There were 102 students who enrolled, with one later dropping out. Twenty-five of these were students from Nigeria, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Japan, Finland, Canada and Newfoundland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A delightful winter graduation was held the week end of February 5 and 6. On Saturday 1,876 friends and relatives of the graduates attended the sessions and for the Sunday morning graduation program 2,318 were assembled. In all, 101 students, fifty-one brothers and fifty sisters, graduated and ninety-nine diplomas were awarded. For the graduation talk the school’s president, N. H. Knorr, spoke on the subject “Exclusive Devotion to Jehovah.” This was truly a stirring talk. It was very appropriate for the occasion as the graduates were about to be sent to the four quarters of the earth to uphold the name of Jehovah.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark153"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark154"></a>TWENTY-FIFTH TERM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The twenty-fifth class of students began their schooling on February 15,1955. One hundred and two students enrolled, many of whom were circuit servants and their wives brought from Canada and the United States. Additionally, twenty-four students were brought from Canada to study French instead of Spanish, that they might be assigned to Quebec for foreign missionary service. The other foreign and American students studied Spanish, with the exception of the circuit servants and their wives who were given a special course in advanced English. This class also included students coming from South Africa, Britain, India, Trinidad, the Netherlands, Australia, Norway, France, Denmark, Jamaica, New Zealand, Southern Rhodesia and Japan. The total non-American students numbered sixty-four.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Graduation for this twenty-fifth class was arranged to take place at the large Yankee Stadium convention held in New York city. On Saturday July 23, 1955, the entire originally enrolled number of 102 students graduated. Ninety-three diplomas were passed out to these graduates. The large happy throng assembled at Yankee Stadium hearing the school’s president, Brother Knorr, delivering the graduation talk, gave lusty support in bidding these graduating missionaries and ministers Jehovah’s blessing as they dispersed into the far-flung missionary fields of the earth. They had been assigned to serve in twenty-five different countries.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark156"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark157"></a>JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES—A WORLD-WIDE ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There are many large organizations in the world that have branches or representatives in different parts of the earth. But there is no organization upon this earth where love and unity exist between the branches and the representatives in different parts of the earth as in the New World society. In proof of this we need only to look to the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses during the summer of 1955, when more than 5,000 witnesses of Jehovah from the United States and Canada went to Europe, visiting many of the branches and attending the conventions. Several thousand from Britain and representatives from more than fifty other countries moved to Paris, to Rome, to Nuremberg, to Stockholm and to The Hague, there to associate with their brothers from all parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is not another religious organization on earth that would have representatives going from one place to another at their own expense, attending numerous conventions just for the sake of meeting with their brothers in another part of the world. Here we truly find love one for another, the love that Jesus spoke about: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” They do this because in this way they can express their true love for Jehovah and fulfill the greatest commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses are not an earthly national organization. They are a new nation under Jehovah God’s direction, serving the interests of His kingdom in these last days and announcing that the only hope for the world is the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a pleasure for anyone to travel from country to country and visit the branch organizations, where he is always welcome. The same courtesy and love is shown to anyone that comes. In order to keep the work going in the 158 countries throughout the world the Society has seventyseven branches established in the principal countries and from these seventy-seven points directs the work in the different islands of the sea, the colonies and territories of nations. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania is the principal corporation that outlines the work and sees to it that all of Jehovah’s witnesses are fed spiritually. Its principal publication is the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> magazine, printed in forty languages. During the year 50,858,813 copies of this magazine were produced at their various printing plants. The printing plant that produces the majority of these magazines is located in Brooklyn, New York. But the Society operates large publication plants in Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, South Africa, Brazil, Australia and Greece. Other plants are being built in various parts of the earth to take care of local printing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are other corporations, like the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Incorporated, and the International Bible Students Association of Britain and Canada. These, too, are used in directing the affairs of Jehovah’s witnesses. But principally the policy is set by the officers of the Pennsylvania corporation. In many instances the officers of the Pennsylvania corporation hold similar offices in other corporations throughout the world. All these corporations are nonprofit and religious, and their sole purpose for existence is to see to it that this good news of Jehovah’s kingdom is preached in all the world for a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society sends missionaries to different parts of the world to open up new fields, and at the present time there are 1,814 graduates of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead who are out in foreign service. And they are working at the moment in 100 different lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in all parts of the earth are gathered into 16,044 congregations. These congregations in turn are located in 1,100 circuits. The Society appoints a circuit servant to visit these congregations once every six months, or oftener if possible, to see to it that the principal work that the Society obligates itself to do, namely, preaching the good news of the Kingdom, is being done by each congregation and the ministers of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the seventy-seven branch offices throughout the world the Society has 1,101 workers to look after office correspondence, the shipping of Bibles, magazines and other publications, and in many places the printing of these Bible helps. Each year the branches throughout the world send a detailed report to the president’s office after the service year of the Society closes the last day of August. In addition to this annual report monthly reports come into the president’s office, keeping the Society informed as to the progress of the ministerial work in every part of the earth. Every one of Jehovah’s witnesses knows that he has an obligation to meet before the Sovereign Ruler of the universe, and that is to promote true worship and to give Him exclusive devotion. All having the one God to love and worship, they of necessity love one another and serve one another. Together they say: “Let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.”—Isa. 2:3, AS.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark158"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark159"></a>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population Highest Number of Ministers Preaching 162,409,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945 : 66,670 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 187,120</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States rejoice in the privilege they had during the service year of 1955, reaching an all-time peak of 187,120 publishers preaching the good news. It is interesting to look back over the years and to observe that in 1940 there were 58,000 publishers. For seven years there were between 58,000 and 66,000 publishers up to and including the year 1946. From then on a steady increase was noticed of about 12,000 new publishers every year, sometimes more and sometimes less. This places a real responsibility upon all the ministers of Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States. It is essential for them to continue on in the Bible study work to educate these other sheep and bring them on to maturity, preparing them for field activity. At no time may any of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the world become lax and think the work is done, not when we see the other sheep being gathered at this rate in one country alone. It will be interesting in this year’s report to observe the population of each country along with its peak of publishers for 1945, to compare with the highest number of ministers preaching in the year 1955. It will certainly show what responsibilities fall upon the New World society in taking care of new increases and still finding other sheep. Jesus said: “Other sheep I have which are not of this fold,” and these he is going to gather. It is necessary for us to look well to their interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The branch servant in Brooklyn sets out some very interesting figures in his report for the year eis well as experiences. These will be enjoyed by all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While we have a large number of publishers in this country, there yet remains a great amount of work to be done. Our records show there are 1,236 unassigned counties. That some good work is being done in this territory is apparent from the fact that in April, 1954, there were 226 publishers reporting from unassigned territory. During the next twelve months thirty-seven congregations were formed from these isolated groups, and yet in April, 1955, there were 497 publishers reporting from unassigned territory. It is our hope that more pioneers and other publishers will soon see their way clear to care for much of this territory containing many of the other sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The film “The New World Society in Action” was shown 3,130 times, with 432,520 attending. It has continued to be a rich source of blessing to publishers and good-will persons alike. A district servant, commenting on a showing, writes: “Two of the ones to see it for the first time had been studying for a year or more and did not seem to be making much progress. They attended the showing on Thursday night. The following Sunday the man called asking to go in the field service that morning. At the circuit assembly two weeks later both the man and his wife were baptized. The next day, Sunday, he stayed home from his secular job so he could go in the service and attend the remainder of the assembly. To this outstanding film must go the credit for being the spark that kindled the flames that moved this brother into action with the New World society.” We are happy for the Society’s arrangement for district servants to continue showing the film to congregations, as we feel there are yet many more persons of good will who will benefit from seeing “The New World Society in Action.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Magazine work was stressed during the year, and placements have increased, jumping from 15,382,336 last year on up to 18,093,164. This increase we attribute to more publishers’ becoming magazine-conscious. In addition to regular Magazine Day activity and encouraging publishers to place magazines at all opportunities, this year we arranged special “holiday witnessing” with magazines. It was most successful. Congregations ordered an additional 200,000 magazines for distribution on “Thanksgiving Day” alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Publishers using sermons find more joy than ever in their ministry and they find that Bible sermons open the way for a good witness to be given. For example, a sister talked to a lady in the hallway of an apartment house. When she completed the witness and knocked at the next door she was greeted with: “I saw you come in and determined not to let you into my apartment, as I recognized you as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. But I heard what you said to the lady next door and I would like to hear more. Come in.” And that an effective witness can be given by Bible sermons, even though literature may not always be placed, is evident from a frank expression from a Catholic lady: “I will not take any of the literature, for I would not read it if I had it, but I must say you held me spellbound with the information that you presented.” This makes it apparent that sermons are having a favorable impression upon people whether they take literature or not.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark160"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark161"></a>LEGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Over two hundred cases were won in the federal courts in the United States. Nine were in the Supreme Court of the United States. The others were in various courts of appeals and in many district courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There has been an extraordinary outbreak of interference with the door-to-door ministry during the year. While there have been innumerable arrests, practically all the cases were dismissed before trial or were won in the trial courts. This outbreak of arrests and prosecutions shows the hatred of the representatives of the “god of this system of things” for true worship. It also proves that the enemy in the United States, like a wolf on a leash, is lunging at Jehovah’s witnesses but cannot get his fangs into them to stop the work. The enemy is tied back by the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States that still stand as the law. Significant proof of this is a statement made by a city attorney in a small town to the police chief. Concerning Jehovah’s witnesses he said: “These people give us more trouble than any other people in the country! You can’t get around them —they will take it clear to the Supreme Court.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Also significant of the hatred of some officials is that threatened expulsion of children from the schools because of their refusal to salute the flag has occurred in the face of the outstanding Supreme Court victory in behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses on this issue in 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has continued to bless the forward movement of his New World society. Taking the offensive against the enemy by fighting in the courts wherever advisable has resulted in a continued increase of victories to hold the enemy back. But the real wall of defense has been the “strong tower,” Jehovah, who has provided protection for his people. They are confident that no weapon forged by the enemy will be able to stop their God-given work of preaching. —Prov. 18:10; Isa. 26:20; 54:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The record of the legal office during the service year of 1955 shows that there has been fulfilled upon Jehovah’s witnesses the text ever before them, “He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.”—Ps. 112:7, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A high light of the 1955 service year was the series of “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies held in Canada,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the United States and Europe. The 171,691 persons who attended the five assemblies held in the United States and Canada were deeply grateful for the encouraging and constructive spiritual food received. The fact that several thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses took advantage of the opportunity to travel to Europe to attend the assemblies there has resulted in our feeling closer to our brothers in other lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This past year the Society’s factory in Brooklyn actually exported more Bible study books than were shipped to congregations in the United States. Furthermore, of the eighteen foreign magazines published at Brooklyn, every one increased in circulation this past year, reaching a combined increase of 1,200,000 over the previous year. The Brooklyn factory was called on to produce 94 million more magazines this year than last year. That is the greatest one-year increase on record. We surely need the new factory mentioned in last year’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You will be happy to learn that at the writing of this report 1,990 cubic yards of concrete have already been poured into the foundation and basement of the new Brooklyn factory, which is located just across the street from the Society’s existing nine-story plant. Upward from this sturdy foundation will grow a thirteen-story factory. It is unique in that it is planned and purposed primarily for magazine production.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">No longer is the slow processing of 300 sheepskins needed to make one Bible, as in the second century, for now modern machinery is effectively used in productive witnessing. Speeding at the rate of 700 feet a minute, 5,384 tons of paper unwound and traveled through the Society’s presses in producing the above literature for 1955. This is an increased consumption of 821 tons of paper over the previous year. While this paper was passing in web form through the presses it carried away with it 72 tons of ink, which ink, by the way, was all manufactured in the Society’s factory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes, when special campaigns are arranged for throughout the field, extra hours of work are required on the part of the Bethel family. This we are very happy to do, as it is to us evidence of New World prosperity, to Jehovah’s praise. An illustration of this was when the world-wide special distribution of the new 32-page booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity —Which One Is “the Light of the World&quot;?</span><span class="font5"> was arranged for in April of 1955. For two months we were required to run an extra night shift on some of the presses, as well as other necessary departments of the factory, in order to supply ample booklets to make the campaign successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To make it possible for people out of all nations, tribes and tongues to receive this printed word of truth, this past year the Brookyn factory produced publications in thirty-six different languages. The 445 members of the Brooklyn Bethel family count it a great privilege and blessing to serve their brothers world-wide, and by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness may we joyously look forward to increased temple service as we unitedly serve together, trusting in Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">COUNTRIES REPORTING TO THE UNITED STATES BRANCH</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark163"></a><span class="font6">Territory that is not specifically assigned to any other branch is looked after by the president’s office and reports on these territories come into the Brooklyn office. It is very encouraging to see the progress made in these different parts of the earth, some of them quite isolated, some on small islands of the sea, others on great expanses of land where there is not too great a population. But wherever people live it is the desire of those in the New World society to reach them with the Triumphant Kingdom message that brings comfort to people of all nations, kindreds and tongues.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">208,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 138</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in Alaska always start the service year with a feast at Jehovah’s table, because that is the time we have the circuit assembly. The film “The New World Society in Action” was immensely enjoyed by the 120 that attended. The detailed explanation of the training program that was expounded was beneficial to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One very interesting experience was had by two sisters working together. At one home the man, upon hearing that the sisters were carrying on a Bibleeducation work, grew very angry and began to ridicule religion and the churches, saying all of them were rackets and, besides, the only ones that were going from door to door and doing any good were Jehovah’s witnesses. If he were to join any religion it would be Jehovah’s witnesses. The sisters looked at each other and smiled. After the man calmed down they told him they were Jehovah’s witnesses. At that the man smiled and sheepishly took some literature and promised to read it carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At a small town a subscriber for several years was visited so that we could check on his renewals. He had been looking forward to a visit by the witnesses. One of the first things he asked was, “Have you got the number two' volume of the Hebrew Scriptures?” This person is a deep student of the Bible and is often called upon to substitute for the local preachers to preach in their churches. He recognizes and accepts much of the truth as explained in the Watch Tower publications and when asked by the people where he obtains that explanation he readily refers them to the Society’s literature and to the Bible that backs it up. His magazines, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> are marked where he uses different material. He obtained all the new literature we had and renewed again for both magazines.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark165"></a>BERMUDA</span></h2>

<p><span class="font5">At the end of a very pleasant year of service we are thankful once again to report we have gladdened our heavenly Father’s heart by increasing the knowledge of Him here in these islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The two high lights of the year were the April 3 talk and the New York assembly. Seating capacity at our small hall was severely overtaxed by the seventy-five persons who came to hear “Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is ‘the Light of the World’?” Over half of our publishers managed to get to New York and returned greatly strengthened by the association they enjoyed. Good publicity in the press was obtained on both these occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another milestone of the past year was the holding of our first local assembly. Of course no one came from surrounding congregrations, because there are none, but the week end of service and meetings proved a blessing and also a basis for better ones in the future. We plan to hold one every six months. More brothers are becoming capable as speakers, so we should be able to have a more varied program for future assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Due, no doubt, to the further reminders on family responsibilities we have noticed marked progress among our younger publishers. It is noticable that, where there are attention and help given at home and a zealous lead set in field service, the children respond and grow in appreciation. But where the attention and lead are lacking, progress is slow and there is the usual danger of being led away to worldly attractions when the age of self-determination is reached. In one of our groups there have not been enough publishers out witnessing with whom to pair the children off, so they have been encouraged to prepare sermons and work together. This has proved practical and of interest to the children. An experience comes to mind of two children (brothers) who went out in magazine work one day during the recent summer vacation and in a short time placed over fifty magazines each.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark166"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark167"></a>FRENCH EQUATORIAL AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">4,436,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1948: 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 952</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was only eight years ago that two persons in French Equatorial Africa became interested in the truth and as Jehovah’s witnesses it was natural for them to talk. By the next year the group had grown to fifteen and from then on there has been a steady growth in the number of those wanting to hear the truth and prepare themselves to proclaim it. An important forward step on behalf of the brothers in French Equatorial Africa was the Society’s appointment of two circuit servants from their midst to visit the various congregations that have been established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In just these eight short years this part of the New World society has grown to 952, and our brothers there express great appreciation for the interest the Society has shown in organizing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As in other parts of the earth the Kingdom message is opposed by the religious leaders, who resort to lies and deceit in an effort to keep the people of good will from taking up pure worship. Such was the case at Ngoubagara where the religious leaders said the baptism of Jehovah’s witnesses is not performed publicly, but secretly at night. Their lies did not keep the people of good will away, but rather, to the contrary, only stirred up interest in the baptismal ceremony to be held. Adherents of all religions came from neighboring villages to ‘see for themselves the manner in which Jehovah’s witnesses perform their baptism.’ It proved to be a major spectacle when an almost unbelievable crowd of 1,153 turned out to see forty-six persons of good will symbolize their dedication by water immersion in the Ngoubagara River. Incidentally, this river was a watercourse for cattle and had to be prepared for the baptism, requiring much work on the part of the brothers. As a result the people of the village are now able to use it as a public swimming pool and are grateful for the effort put forth by the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By persistent effort in the preaching work opposition is gradually being overcome. In Bangui the brothers spend three hours every Sunday in the house-to-house work. Public meetings are now being held regularly with excellent results. The combined attendance for the four congregations in Bangui for the talk “Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is ‘the Light of the World’?” was 913, after which sixty persons were baptized.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The work of preaching the good news has been going on in this island for only four years. Two missionaries are now there living in a quonset hut, and they have turned part of their home into a Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One thing bringing us to the attention of the Guamanians was opening our first Kingdom Hall on Guam. It was a quonset rented as a missionary home, and half of it was used for a Kingdom Hall. When the Kingdom Hall sign was put up and the priests saw what we were doing, the official Catholic newspaper went to work to try to prejudice all they could against our work, but whether they knew it or not they were actually giving us free publicity. We know we must be doing some good to cause them to get so excited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fear is ingrained in the native people by the priests, who control their every move. The word of the priest is law. Fear of the priests, fear of their neighbors, fear of their relatives, fear of not being buried in the Catholic cemetery if they associate with us (as though the Catholic cemetery were more holy than any other piece of ground Jehovah owns), fearful to think for themselves or read and study the Bible, are part of their training. It is the truth that can make them free and relieve their mind of these fears. We certainly are thankful we do not fear their fear!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Something happened recently to help break some of this fear barrier. The faith of the Catholic people in their religion was badly shaken when lightning struck and completely demolished the church, steeple, idols and all in it. “Why didn’t St. Victor and the other idols save the church?” some have asked. “If they can’t save the church how can they save us?” One said: “If lightning is an act of God, as we have been told, then why did God strike and destroy our church if it was holy?” Another couple said: “We were good Catholics until this happened, but now we are not so sure.” To the native people it seems like some kind of judgment and they came from all over the island to see with their own eyes the destroyed church. We notice more of the native people are listening carefully to the Kingdom message and are treating us nicer. We feel many of the Guamanian people have gotten more confidence in Jehovah’s witnesses as they see we are actually trying to help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Due to the above incidents many more of the Catholic people are now giving a hearing ear to the truth, and Jehovah’s witnesses are happy that they can comfort them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About half of the population of Guam is transit. It is sort of a melting pot. Many persons come from different parts of the Far East on two-year contracts to do construction work. A number of these have come in and made up part of the congregation. It appears that in the next six months one half of the present congregation will be going back to their native lands, but others fill their places and the Kingdom work keeps on going. They regret to see these publishers leave, but as long as they remain a part of the New World society and continue to do Jehovah’s will all in Guam are happy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark169"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>

<p><span class="font5">It is certainly good to see more interest shown in Iceland on the part of the Icelanders. Now there is a small congregation started and regular meetings are being held. The publishers that live there say that the people are very materialistic, and they have no respect for or faith in the Bible, even though everyone has a Bible in his own home. They are great readers, but do not want to take on a responsibility to teach others. One sister, a widow with four children, has shown real zeal. While visiting relatives in the northern part of the country she did fine witnessing work in a number of cities. It was a great event for our brothers in Iceland to receive the film “The New World Society in Action.” Several showings were given and at one there were eighty-seven persons in attendance. While the more mature brothers were away attending the conventions in Europe, the local brothers kept active, and this was a great joy to the hearts of those who have been trying to promote the work in Iceland. They are looking forward to the first shipment of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Basis for Belief in a New World</span><span class="font5"> in the Icelandic language, feeling that this will arouse the interest of many of the Icelanders.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>ISRAEL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population Highest Number of Ministers Preaching 1,669,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1951: 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955 : 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in the land of Israel moves on slowly. Over nineteen centuries ago there were many Christians that walked in this land and preached the good news of God’s kingdom. Today the Jews returning to Palestine are not interested in the Word of God, nor in the kingdom of God. In 1951 the Society sent four missionaries into the land to try to preach the good news among these people, but very few gave an ear to hear. Even today, five years later, there are only twenty-three doing the preaching work, and two of these are missionaries. We will not give up. The Bible written to the Hebrews says that whether they hear or do not hear we shall go forth and proclaim the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From time to time some of Jehovah’s witnesses drop in to Palestine to visit our brothers, and these have been an encouragement to the few that have taken up the ministry. During the year the Society arranged for a visit to be made to Israel by the branch servant in Cyprus. He called on the congregations and interested ones in Palestine. The brothers there appreciated his visit very much and look forward to his return. The film “The New World Society in Action” was shown on a number of occasions, but it appears that most of the people look at it from the angle of entertainment and taking in knowledge for themselves, certainly not to associate themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses and gain more knowledge of the truth as to what this organization teaches. Jehovah’s witnesses in Israel will not be discouraged, but will press on with greater zeal than ever before to advance Kingdom interests and magnify Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>OTHER ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society operates a boat called “Light” and the crew of the boat is made up of four missionaries. These brothers travel from place to place preaching the good news of the Kingdom. They did very excellent work during the year, having good success in placing literature and making many back-calls on persons that showed interest on previous visits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A report has already been published concerning the island of Trinidad’s forbidding this boat to come into the harbor. But this action on the part of the officials in government caused a great witness to be given in the island of Trinidad, and this has caused much comment throughout that part of the Caribbean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The boat visited thirty islands and territories during the year. Many places on the coast of Dominica between Salisbury and Portsmouth were worked, where for the most part Jehovah’s witnesses were unheard of. A great number of books were placed along this coast and the people were very kind to the missionaries. The Dutch islands of St. Eustatius and Saba were visited again and much good will was manifest. St. Barthelemy, a French possession, also gave great incentive to return. Good interest was found among the half-dozen families on Peter Island of the British Virgin Islands. The newly formed congregation on Tortola has almost completely taken over the work of the missionaries; the publishers being progressively active, it will hardly be necessary in the future for the boat to visit this island for any length of time. Here in Tortola is a young man who is a cripple, living high up in the hills on a regular track on the other side of the island. Many people pass by his home and he does a great deal of preaching to them as they come and go. It is not physical ability that makes a Christian; he is identified by zeal for the truth. One of the sisters from this island had the joy of attending the assembly at Yankee Stadium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During early 1955 the boat was anchored in Great Bay, Dutch St. Martin, when the first freak hurricane struck the area. Some damage was done to the boat’s equipment, but it was soon repaired. A complete field service report follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">661 books; 2,238 booklets; 4,465 hours; 88 subscriptions; 980 magazines; 1,401 back-calls; 211 Bible studies; 113 public meetings.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark173"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ARGENTINA Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">19,000,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 415 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 3,865</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The New World society in Argentina has found much comfort in the text, ‘Be not afraid of evil tidings.’ Our brothers there have gone forth diligently during the year even though there was great unrest. Disturbances were numerous religiously, politically and commercially, but Jehovah’s witnesses in Argentina kept on preaching the good news of the Kingdom and enjoyed a 19 per cent increase in the number of publishers. They had an outstanding year in obtaining new subscriptions and in distributing the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazines in house-to-house witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The branch servant in closing out his reports says that all there are strong-hearted and putting their full trust in Jehovah. From the experiences that he wrote about, some are quoted here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through the circuit servants we have been able to visit isolated interest and in several cases the servants have been able to form isolated groups studying </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> In one case a man who sixteen years ago had left the organization because of trouble among the brothers wrote the Society asking for help. Information was given him about the work and the way it is carried on now and he was told that in a few weeks a circuit servant would visit him. This man answered, expressing his joy at being back in the organization, and recognized that it is in vain trying to work outside of it. He is now an isolated publisher. A letter was written to another man who Inquired about the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscription; he was given the information and told that within a few weeks a missionary would visit him. The circuit servant went and gave several talks explaining the work. Today, through this man, three persons are reporting as isolated publishers. Another one who was visited six months ago by the circuit servant writes upon sending in his report: “I would like you to know that there are fifteen of us who are interested in the truth in this locality.” Arrangements have been made for a special pioneer in a nearby city to visit and work with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Special pioneers have been doing a marvelous work during the year. Four new congregations were organized and two will be at the next visit of the circuit servant. In one city where a special pioneer has been working for just over a year and a half a congregation was organized eight months ago and there are now eighteen publishers reporting. In another city where two sisters had been assigned as special pioneers, the brother who was appointed as congregation servant writes to the office and says: “I desire to express my thanks and joy to Jehovah and the Society not only for having the opportunity of knowing the truth but for being used as a congregation servant.” Last month they reported ten publishers and the two sisters have been moved on to another assignment. Two special pioneers write from their assignment, saying, “Although we are working under restricted conditions this has not stopped us. We are pleased to report twelve publishers this month.” The local authorities have stopped all distribution of the Society’s literature. We gave instructions to work just with the Bible and place literature on back-calls. These brothers have been in their assignment for a little over six months. They sent this experience, which shows that the ‘blackbirds’ cannot destroy all the seed sown: “One lady was studying with my wife and all the block in which she lived had turned against her and threatened to burn her house if she did not stop studying with the ‘evangelists.’ The poor lady did not know wnat to do, so stopped her study. We went back to see her and encouraged her to study again. We told her some experiences. She renewed her study and now controls the situation. She has witnessed to all her neighbors, and several of those formerly opposed now join the home Bible study. This lady is now going from house to house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Clean organization has been stressed and is giving good results, as shown by this experience: &quot;A Catholic woman received a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font5"> and when asked if she would like to have a personal study she sadly answered No. Upon inquiry she said, ‘I want to study. I know this is the truth, but the trouble is I live in common-law marriage. I know your work is very serious and pure, and I don’t know if I will be able to do it.’ ” A couple who had been living in common-law marriage for thirty-five years and had four children received the truth and got married. The brother is sixty-eight years old and the sister sixty-five.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We do not enjoy the many privileges of service that maybe you do in other parts of the earth. We have no Kingdom Halls. Our work and studies are carried on from private homes, in groups of from ten to twenty-five brothers. It is a joy to see that 81.2 per cent of the publishers are attending the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study. In these small groups we have our </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study and service meeting one day, generally Sundays, and during the week the book study and the theocratic ministry course. Although we do not have platforms from which to give demonstrations we do show the brothers what a privilege it is to be house-to-house publishers and pioneers. During the last four months 87.4 per cent of the publishers were doing house-to-house work. Vacation pioneering was stressed. One hundred and seventy-seven took up this service. Six of these are now full-time pioneers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark174"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>

<p><span class="font6">Growth fascinates us, whether it is in a garden, little animals or babies. Humankind is very much interested in growth. Jehovah’s witnesses are intensely interested in the growth of the New World society. They know if they preach the Word, then Jehovah will keep making the increase come forth. Certainly Jehovah has brought a rich blessing upon the work in Australia and vicinity and made things grow there, for hundreds are coming into the organization and growing on to maturity and reaching out into new fields, preaching the good news of the Kingdom. When we look at the report from the branch servant on the territory cared for by the Australian branch we see that there has been a healthy, sturdy and productive growth, and all praise goes to Jehovah for giving this increase. Excerpts from his reports follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tremendous enthusiasm accompanied the distribution of the special booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity —Which One Is “the Light of the World”?</span><span class="font5"> Young and old, newly interested persons, veteran ministers, bedridden publishers, yes, they all shared in the brightest month of activity on record. One young publisher wrote: “My appreciation of the value of this booklet gave me the urge to step into and move along with the campaign. Just where would I start? I soon came to the conclusion that my schoolmates were my first obligation. The first day after the talk I started distributing them among the teachers and children. Most of them readily accepted, but the few rejections only gave me further joy. My initial success gave me zeal to press on in house-to-house work. My placements for the first two weeks were forty-seven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fired by the success of the widespread booklet distribution the feeling of enthusiasm ran high among the brothers at the eight district assemblies that followed. Advertising took on greater proportions; press and radio channels gave us further publicity. Over 12,000 attended the public talk as record turnouts packed halls in the capital cities. At Melbourne the town hall was granted to us for the first time and the 2,348 in attendance indicated close to a thousand strangers and people of good will were present, 800 more than the crowd that heard the prime minister speak in the same place a few evenings before. The caretakers made complimentary reports to the officials. With sincerity and enthusiasm one of them told a brother: “We like everything you do, from the way you park your cars to the way you run your kitchen and cafeteria. If other organizations were like you people, I would never look for another job.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Magazine distribution has soared and now occupies a more elevated position in our ministry. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> appear regularly in more and more homes. A pioneer studied with a businessman who saw the necessity of coming to meetings and going from door to door. Having many business associates, he witnessed to a manager of a steel works, leaving a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> containing the article “The Time of the End.” The manager read it and passed the magazine on to his family to read and, when called on again, requested fifty copies of that particular issue for distribution among some of his employees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Much attention is being centered on the Pacific islands. In addition to the territories that regularly report to the branch office there are places such as Niue Island and the Gilbert and Ellice Islands where interest exists and some preaching has been done. Some interesting experiences have been reported from Tonga. The islanders there do not have the restraining influences that keep many Europeans from speaking to strangers. A visiting brother who had spent several days witnessing on this island was intercepted by various persons as he walked along. Teachers, court officials, a medical practitioner and other individuals stopped him to ask questions about the 'new teaching’ and request literature. He was also invited to the offices of the postmaster, police chief and customs official and there gave a witness as well as addressing the Seventh-Day Adventists, some native Methodist ministers, the Catholic ladies’ sewing circle and other groups. At the one showing of the film in Tonga the only advertising was by means of loud-speakers atop the theater. The usual custom was for some announcements to be made during the day and then a musical program would be put on a half hour before a show. The New World society film was no exception. Before the show began there was a noisy march, some announcements, then marches and popular songs until starting time. Anyway, it brought results. The theater was filled with 275 people and more were outside in the street. Much interest was stirred up and there is an urgent need for mature ministers to help these people learn of Jehovah’s purposes and become established in true worship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A solid foundation for future expansion has been laid in this territory. Four Gilead graduates arrived here in February and together with two Australian full-time ministers they are conducting an average of ten home Bible studies each and over 200 persons are being instructed in this way. The circuit servant’s visit proved timely, helping the brothers to become better organized, the first congregation being formed and a widespread showing of the film carried out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At fifteen showings of the film 3,227 were able to see how Jehovah’s witnesses preach and what their organization is like. After each show people wanted to know more and what they had to do, so arrangements were made to call on them. Many did not wait to be called on. They came to the missionary home to ask questions and have Bible studies. Sometimes three studies would be going on in different parts of the home at once; when one group left, another took its place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one village a young girl came up to one of the sisters and said she would like to come to the missionary home and ask some questions. Next day she came but with only one question: “How do I become one of Jehovah’s witnesses?” Some years ago she had been given the address of some witnesses in the United States by a former governor of the territory. She had been writing to them ever since but up until seeing the film she had been shy about identifying herself to the missionaries who had now come to her land. Now a study was arranged. Every morning, except Sunday, she would come to work at the telecommunications station. Since her bus arrived in town at 7 a.m. her first call was at the missionary home for a study; then she would get her breakfast before starting work at eight o’clock. This routine was followed for several weeks and before long she was going from house to house; she has now become a regular publisher.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">While working the police quarters of a large town, two full-time servants contacted eleven persons, seven of whom subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Perhaps police training made these men more attentive than usual. During one sermon an officer interrupted: “Just a minute,” and then walked away to another room. Returning with a notebook and a pencil he asked: “Now what were those scriptures you read?” An Indian sergeant, after listening to the entire sermon, said: “Come to the station tomorrow. Meanwhile I’ll make my decision.” While the brother was giving his sermon at the next place a knock came and the Indian sergeant appeared. &quot;I’ve made my decision,” he said. &quot;Would you please come back when you are through here?” After obtaining a subscription from the one being witnessed to, the brother returned to see the sergeant. &quot;I’m not a Christian,” he pointed out, “but you can get me a Bible besides the subscription. That would make me very happy because I really am interested. You see, I have these books here,” said he, pulling out </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font5"> These had been placed with him during the unassigned territory campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before the Society’s film could be shown it had to pass the censor, who remarked to the brother: “If you have seen it before I guess there won’t be any need to run all the reels through.” He soon changed his mind. After the first reel he went through the entire showing. When it was over he commented: “I had you people all wrong. I thought you were Communists. You people have been misrepresented a great deal, haven’t you? There must be something behind a big organization like that for it to be able to work with such unity and fellowship. If I hadn’t been the local censor I would still be prejudiced against you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the film was shown in isolated territory there was an average attendance of 277 at each of the five places. In one Indian village of 1,000 people, 660 packed the local theater for the show. In another town a European came to the theater to pass the time away. Amazed that there was no one to sell him a ticket he wandered inside and took a seat beside a sister. When the film showed how </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> was produced she mentioned the subscription. He said: “I’ll take it.” When </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> appeared on the screen she again spoke of the subscription. He replied: “I’ll take it.” At the end, with two subscriptions to the good, she arranged to make a back-call on this person.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The initial work of planting the seed of truth has begun in this new territory. Already, some of the thousands of natives on this 250-mile-long island have rejoiced to hear of Jehovah’s provisions for life in a new world. Likewise, a number of French-speaking Europeans have expressed satisfaction with the truth they have heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At one of the villages the publishers called on the chief and they were soon having a good talk. When he was asked to get his Bible, it turned out to be a Bible history with pictures and short stories. He was speechless when shown the difference between his ‘Bible’ and a real one. So as not to offend him the publisher suggested that his ‘Bible’ was probably for the children, and the chief was glad to have this excuse. A booklet was left and he readily agreed to have another visit to hear more of these good things from Jehovah’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been encouraging for the brothers often to have the experience of calling at a house and then have the entire family listen as the message is presented. On visiting a small tribe of natives, for example, the witness started to speak to three men; in a few minutes the audience numbered over twenty natives.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The high light of the year came in June when the first visit to this territory was made by one of the Society’s traveling representatives. He had with him the Society’s film. Before it could be shown publicly the assistant administrator censored it. After seeing the entire show he immediately issued a permit that declared the film was suitable for exhibition to the natives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A European friend of one of the brothers granted free use of his two native theaters. Due to limited seating the first showing was only for those who associated actively with Jehovah’s witnesses or had attended Bible studies. It was interesting to see that 270 claimed to be with us. At the next showing 400 attended. When the brothers moved out into the open in another village they selected an opening on a sloping section of ground surrounded by cocoanut palms. This setting provided an ideal spot for more than 1,000 natives, including all the councilors of the village, to view the picture. A native brother gave the commentary in Motu, thus enabling the audience to gain the full benefit of the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From time to time, natives from little-explored regions come down to work in Port Moresby, the principal town. Some of these have come in contact with the truth and accepted it. Such was the case of about fifteen natives from a distant Chimbu village. Said the spokesman for this group: &quot;In two-and-one-half moons we go back home. We tell our people about Jehovah God and the new world.” Thus, in remote areas that the Australian brothers have been unable to reach, the seed of truth will no doubt be sown by the natives themselves.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">As the “voice of one crying in the wilderness” was effective centuries ago at the Jordan River, so today in the Solomons. Here a lone voice proclaims the good news of the established kingdom. During one of his exhausting nine-mile trips he had to contend with swamps, crocodiles and mosquitoes before reaching the territory. At one of the villages he met several boys who finished church early so they could speak to him. Fine interest was shown in what the brother told them. One boy, having no money, promised to contribute the next day and so was given some literature. True to his word, he appeared the following day after traversing the same nine miles. He was pleased and wanted more literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If there is just one witness to take the lead and start talking, the truth spreads. On a river boat an unfamiliar native boy sat behind the brother and said: “Too many religions, they no true. They say ‘no kill’ but all fight. Me no like them. Me believe same along you. Can you get me small-fellow Bible?” When asked how he knew about the brother’s belief, the boy replied: “Other boys tell me.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The brothers have been stirred up to greater activity as a result of having their first visit from the circuit servant and seeing the Society’s film. Upward of 3.900 persons saw the film with the largest audience attending at the theater in Apia, where 1,640 were present. The script was read in Samoan so that all could understand the full meaning of the picture. Several native members of the legislative and executive councils saw the film and probably have a much better idea of the Society’s charitable and educational work. The thought most common in the territory before the film was put on was that we were just a small, insignificant new group struggling for an existence. Now the picture has changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The circuit servant happened to call on a Methodist preacher, who was shocked into white-lipped rage by the very presence of the brother. Before the clergyman could regain his balance he unwittingly revealed the complicity of his religion in the official action that had been taken to deny some ministers of Jehovah’s witnesses entry into the territory: “How did you get in here?” he demanded. “You come here only because you believe the missions are not teaching the truth. Do you blame us for trying to keep you out of the territory?” Religious opposers to true Christians today are not unlike their prototype of Jesus’ day, are they?—Matt. 12:38.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The mighty men of the earth think that the peoples of the earth are to be subjected by them and made their slaves. All of them will have a terrible awakening at the battle of Armageddon, even the slaves themselves for submitting to their rulership. Christ Jesus has given freedom to all men to worship Jehovah God with spirit and truth. Jehovah’s witnesses now realize that the triumphant kingdom has been established and that they come under the rulership of Jehovah’s anointed King, Christ Jesus. They find comfort in this world filled with distress, where people are sighing and crying because of the terrible things that are happening. Jehovah’s witnesses in Austria are able to bring much comfort to the people in that land and hold out before them a real hope. Some of the experiences sent in by the branch servant are interesting in this regard and a few are quoted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A congregation servant who is a well-known businessman in his home town wrote to us about the great victory of the Kingdom truth over false science.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;One morning I was asked by telephone to come to the archaeological section of the museum. I was received by a lady dressed in mourning who was the guide of this section. She said: ‘I have asked you to come here to find out what you think of our archaeologic findings. I heard your public talk yesterday, I have read some of your publications, too, and I am very much impressed. All the more, as I have lost my husband in the last war and my only son a few weeks ago. You may believe me, I do not want to live any more, and I have made all preparations in this direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ 'I am very much interested in the Bible, but I cannot get over these findings here that embrace 30,000 and more years and I cannot see clearly what is the truth. Many prominent clergymen have been here, all of whom declared to be in harmony with the estimated age of our findings, although the Bible says that men have been in existence for only 6,000 years. If the clergymen said the truth, then the Bible lies, and I would stick to my decision to hang myself.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I replied: ‘I shall be glad to supply you with the reports and explanations of prominent scientists about evolution and the Bible and I am also willing to have all these findings examined by the Geiger counter at my expense.’ After some further explanations and logical reasoning I said to her: ‘Should you be able to prove that there are any bones of men older than 6,000 years, then I will hang myself beside you, for life would be worthless for me too, because the Bible had lied.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“By this the woman was very much impressed. After she had read several of our publications on this subject, she spoke about it to the scientist who is in charge of this section of the museum and asked him. He answered her: ‘We do not know anything ourselves, but if we told this to the people we should all lose our livelihood.’ Since then, she attended every meeting and Bible study, and a few weeks later she was immersed. Now she is a zealous publisher.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a great triumph when the enemy hurts himself with his own weapon, especially when Jehovah’s holy name is involved. How this happened is described by a special pioneer sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I took with me a weak publisher on back-calls. We came to a Protestant woman who told us that their pastor has explained: ‘Jehovah is the god of Jehovah’s witnesses, but he is not the god of the Protestants, and nobody may have two gods.’ On my question if she had a Protestant songbook she brought it, and I showed her in it the two songs: ‘Unto Jehovah I will sing’ and ‘Jehovah, Jehovah, Jehovah, honor, power and glory be to your name.’ This worked like a hydrogen bomb. She called the shepherd of her soul ‘a lying devil,’ and gave me the songbook with the entreaty to show this to all Protestants in the community. The effect is great, as in these country places such news travels fast from house to house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The difference between the unhappy condition of the people who are ruled and fed spiritually by Satan’s organization and those who are subjects of the triumphant kingdom was outstandingly manifested by the great assemblies in the summer of 1955'. From Austria 2,500 went by four special trains to the assembly in Nuremberg. Everybody, young and old, returned overflowing with joy and gratitude. For most of them this was the first large assembly, and they felt as if they were dreaming during those days of New World life with thousands of brothers from so many nations and tongues.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Quite a number of islands make up the group known as the Bahama Islands, and many of these have received a thorough witness during the past year. The clergy have been aroused and are disturbed that Jehovah’s witnesses are coming to them with the truth concerning God’s kingdom. They have shown animosity toward Jehovah’s witnesses, but during the year the film “The New World Society in Action” has helped many to see that Jehovah’s witnesses are different from what the clergy say. The work is making progress in the isles of the sea and the branch servant in the Bahamas gives us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Public holiday witnessing brings good results. During the time of the princess’ visit to the colony the circuit servant was visiting one of the congregations. As usual there were group efforts on Saturday, the first day of the royal appearance and tour. One of the publishers voiced the opinion that it would be of little value to go out, as no one would be home, all would be in town watching the proceedings. However, ten publishers placed 183 magazines in a total of twenty-one hours. This would not have been done on the average Saturday, as there would not have been so many people home from their jobs. Certainly holidays are fruitful witnessing days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two years ago a woman was contacted on the northernmost island of Grand Bahama whose face lit up with pleasure when she learned it was one of Jehovah’s witnesses that was calling on her. Her father had acquired such books as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Government, Prophecy</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> from which he regularly conducted Bible classes with his family. He preached up and down the island what he had learned and believed, and was condemned by the false shepherds to their fiery hell. He died in 1943, but his daughter and her household would follow no other religion, for they knew what truth was. In December of 1954 a trip was made to this island and the film shown. This woman exclaimed that seeing all of these Jehovah’s witnesses doing so much all over the world made her want to do something too. It would be so wonderful, she said, if she had someone to help her. To her delight she was informed that now she had the needed help, as two of the missionaries were going to stay on the island for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In May a circuit assembly was held on this island, and she and two of her household were immersed, demonstrating to those in that territory their firm stand for Jehovah. Her early training in true doctrine had enabled her to keep herself and her household close to the truth. At the writing of this report the missionaries have been away almost three months, yet this group of sisters have been regularly reporting thirty and more hours a month, and the branch has just received a letter requesting more literature, as they have used up the literature left them by the missionaries. They have taken seriously the training program and have applied the counsel given by the missionaries with good results, which is always the fruit of such a course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Twenty-six brothers from the Bahamas attended at least one of the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies this year. One missionary was privileged to represent us at some of the European assemblies. What was learned there and what we are now receiving through the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine we intend to act upon that we may continue to share in the growth of the New World society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark188"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>

<p><span class="font6">“During the night a vision appeared to Paul: a certain Macedonian man was standing and beseeching him and saying: ‘Step over into Macedonia and help us.’ ” (Acts 16:9, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> That is the way the pioneers must feel in Belgium. In 1951 there were 104 pioneers moving around that small country preaching the good news; now there are eighty-one. During these five years there has been a steady decrease in the number of pioneers and alongside it there has been an increase in the number of congregation publishers. Surely those in the pioneer service are crying out: ‘Come over and help us.’ This is true not only in Belgium; it is true in many countries throughout the world. There is still a great deal of territory in Belgium to be witnessed to. There are 9,000,000 people and all of them should hear the message of the Kingdom. What is the answer? More pioneers. While the work is going on very well in the country, still to the ends of the earth we hear that call ringing out: ‘Come over and help us.’ Here are some interesting experiences related by the branch servant in Belgium. He reports on that country and also Luxembourg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The special campaign with the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is “the Light of the World&quot;? </span><span class="font5">had some wonderful results. It was not something impossible to accomplish when the Society suggested that each publisher should try to place thirty booklets during the month of April. A congregation publisher started to work with the booklet in the street where she lives. In thirty minutes she had distributed twenty copies and after having obtained ten additional ones, she placed those too in about twenty minutes. The result was that after making a back-call on a woman who had taken the booklet after mocking her, the publisher was able to start a Bible study in this person’s home! This encouraging experience shows that Jehovah’s witnesses should not be fearful of working in their own block, because there, too, people of good will are living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">New territory was reached by special pioneers. New congregations will be established during this new service year. There are still many prospects. The last </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscription campaign proved to be a good one. We obtained 900 subscriptions more this year in spite of the transportation difficulties that still exist in this country. This shows that many people of good will are interested in the truth, but it is now the responsibility of the congregation and full-time publishers to aid all of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pioneer work needs improvement. The statement below is very interesting for young brothers and sisters. A circuit servant said this in his report about a sixtyeight-year-old pioneer sister who has been in the full-time service since 1952: “This sister is zealous and devoted. For her age she accomplishes much work in the service, her placements are good, she finds interest and she starts and is conducting home Bible studies. She works together with the publishers and helps them in the service. She co-operates well with the congregation.” During the 1955 service year this sister reached an average of 104 hours, almost 60 back-calls and 6.3 home Bible studies. If she can do it, then the younger ones should certainly be able to take up this wonderful privilege of serving Jehovah in the full-time ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The theocratic organization in Luxembourg has made good progress during the past service year. We have now five congregations, and one publisher for about two thousand inhabitants. The publishers are working with zeal toward the goal of one publisher for every thousand inhabitants. The Catholic Church in Luxembourg has certainly succeeded in making the Bible an unknown book to the Catholics. Jehovah’s witnesses here will find their joy in making it the best-known book to all the honest-hearted people of this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Out of the 144 publishers—the peak in April—over a hundred had the privilege to attend one of the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses. Most of them went to Nuremberg, a few to London, Paris or Rome. What an experience the Nuremberg assembly was for the Luxembourg brothers! Very few of them had ever seen such a huge crowd, equal in size to more than a third of the entire population of Luxembourg, and composed mainly of Jehovah’s witnesses! The “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies have made a lasting impression on the minds of the brothers and undoubtedly will bear fruit during the ccming service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While working from house to house the missionaries found a man who had become very embittered. Before World War II he held a good position as engineer in an important iron foundry, but lost his job as well as his property and freedom after the German occupation, through being suspected of collaboration with the Nazis. While in prison he obtained a Bible from the Protestant chaplain and found much comfort in reading it. However, the chaplain could give him no real help in properly understanding God’s Word. Some years passed and the man was finally released from prison and a little later the missionaries called at his home. He took from them some booklets and a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine. At the first back-call he greeted them joyfully, saying: “I have read your publications. This is what I have been looking for for a long time.” The missionaries hope to start a study with this man soon. He has only one worry now. “I have found the truth,” he says, “but shall</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I be able to transform myself sufficiently to become a member of the New World society?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The training program that the Society inaugurated some years ago to take new publishers out into the field and show them how to present the good news of the Kingdom is having good effect the world over. This training is especially needed in Bolivia as this is a Catholic country and all people are held in illiteracy. It certainly is a joy to see persons pull away from the Catholic organization and begin reading the Bible for the first time, then go out in the work, come to circuit assemblies and there symbolize their dedication by water immersion. Many women who take a definite stand for the Kingdom often receive great opposition from their families. The love of God, however, must come first despite family ties and pressures. Some are seeing the truth in Bolivia and they are now proclaiming the message of the Kingdom along with their fellow workers worldwide. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences and a few of them are related.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The film “The New World Society in Action” arrived late in Bolivia because of the difficulties involved in getting import licenses. However, since its arrival in April it has been shown to many audiences, who have been thrilled by the many wonderful scenes. It was shown in the universities in Oruro and La Paz to packed-out auditoriums. One prominent educator in La Paz was so impressed that he exclaimed: “All education is truly in vain unless you first give the people the proper education about God and his purposes!” A good witness was also given by showing it to workers in two factories in La Paz and to an audience of about 400 in a tin mining town called Chojilla not so far from La Paz. It continues to be exhibited with good results in the interior now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers had many interesting experiences distributing the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity —Which One Is “the Light of the World”?</span><span class="font5"> The circuit servant had the opportunity of giving the public lecture on this theme while he visited with missionaries and a pioneer opening up new territory in Tarija, Bolivia. For advertising, besides the 2,000 handbills distributed, a friendly radio repairman there offered to announce the talk free over his powerful sound system mounted atop a central hotel, the sound of which practically covers the entire city. The local priests came to put pressure on him, but without success. As a result the talk was delivered to a very attentive audience that packed out the local syndicate hall and with many standing and listening around the doors and windows on the sidewalk. Many booklets were given away and one total stranger took a package of them to distribute with friends. One of the directors of the syndicate came up and expressed his thorough appreciation of the talk. He said: “We have been tied to the skirts of the clergy for a long time, but we are getting wise to their tactics and free from the fear of them. Any time you wish to use this auditorium for a discourse or any other program you are certainly welcome!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The missionaries in Tarija are having a fine time holding many Bible studies with the people of good will. They write that these people continue to take in knowledge by keeping on studying. They report that it is a pleasure to see these people put their work aside in their little shops, such as shoeshops, tailor and carpenter shops, and take time for a Bible study. Often they ask their customers to come back later, showing they are neither too busy nor ashamed to study the Bible. Now, due to this proper attitude and course of action, some of these studies are already talking to their friends and making an effort to interest them in the Bible and the Society’s literature. The two missionaries there have recently opened a Kingdom Hall and established a Spanish </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study attended by a group of five or six persons of good will. Yes, there are good prospects in this town.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The country of Brazil has gone through difficult times during the last year. However, those of the New World society were having a good time. They were not interested in politics, but rather in God’s kingdom. A wonderful work was accomplished during the year with the new booklet, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is “the Light of the World”?</span><span class="font6"> and also with the magazines. The Society purchased some new machinery and enlarged their printing facilities during 1954 and the publishers took advantage of this, using more magazines in the field than ever before. Over 800,000 magazines were printed in Brazil during the past year, to compare with 530,000 for the former year. The people of Brazil are anxious for the truth and it is a splendid field in which to give the witness of the truth. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences that have been sent in from different parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As our brothers come along to maturity they begin to realize the necessity for the education of children for their place in the New World society. A circuit servant writes in and tells how in one congregation, among those who give the best sermons at the doors are two little girls of ten and thirteen years. They have prospered in their work and manage to bring adults to the Kingdom Hall. In another city he tells of a fourteen-year-old boy who conducts a study with an engineer who, although a college graduate and speaking five languages, is glad to study the Bible and accompany the lad to the Kingdom Hall and receive further theocratic training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The other sheep are manifesting themselves and this through the reception of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A Sentinela</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Despertai! </span><span class="font5">Says a Gilead graduate: &quot;Magazine Day turned out to be beautiful and, even though I was in the country only three weeks, the friendly attitude of the man with whom I was speaking made it easy to leave our magazines. The next week on making the return call, he met me at the gate, saying, ‘Say, do you have another magazine with you?’ Well, I had to explain that the magazine comes out only monthly and then placed a book with him instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I started a study with him and he attended a talk, stayed for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study and from then on we studied twice a week. On the third week he came to the congregation book study and to the ministry school and service meeting, even though it meant missing supper, and, upon hearing of the blessed privilege of telling the truth to others, there he was at the Kingdom Hall on Sunday, Bible, Kingdom smile and all. He accompanied me and without hesitation explained what he knew of the truth when I got stuck for words. After this, service was a regular thing. He was baptized within three months of the first visit made on Magazine Day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The religious clergy often accuse Jehovah’s witnesses of taking the best of their flocks. Here is how it happens. The parents of one household rejected the message, but their son, a stanch and faithful Catholic leader, listened and asked many questions for over half an hour on the first call. Not all of his doubts were erased, so a back-call was made, on which occasion he subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Now he is a companion fighter for New World liberty. The parents called the priest in to help him recover his senses. With a few able questions the padre lost self-control and excommunicated the boy, showing he did not want a truth lover in his congregation; but this sheep is welcome with God’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Loving the law of Jehovah makes his people an orderly group. After a circuit assembly in an isolated territory, at one of the studies continued in the home of a good-will man, the session was thrown open for questions or comments. One of the more interested parties said: “I’m over fifty; I’m Catholic, and I’m not, because till today I know nothing of my religion and am not interested in doing so. But here in our city I’ve seen the Catholics and Protestants fighting through their loud-speakers for years. But when you Jehovah’s witnesses got here, the situation changed. Those old enemies became friends in a united attack against your work. From Catholic and Protestant came the same accusation. But I admired the way you took it. I waited for you to fight back and make a lot of noise, but no; you just went on quietly with your work without getting mad or worried or disturbed by what they said. Frankly, I felt as though you were really Christ’s followers. You can count on me for anything, I mean it.” There were 245 people who must have felt the same way, for they left their addresses for return calls at the assembly. Two special pioneers have been sent to take care of the interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This might be interesting enough, but how would you like to have the police chief and mayor of a town rent the theater for your public talk and help advertise it? Yes, just that happened. The police chief even introduced the circuit servant, listened to the talk and wants to know more. He was once treasurer for the local priest but now desires to be free by means of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have not spent precious space telling about the many obstacles to the peaceful carrying out of our work here in this vast land, for we all know that in the Devil’s world these will exist till the destruction at Armageddon. Now is the time for all mature ones to copy the example of the Mordecai class being &quot;delightsome to the multitude of his brothers, working for the good of his people and speaking peace to all their offspring.” This brings prosperity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">When one is asked to explain the Scriptures and give an answer for the belief that he has, he should be able to do it. Jehovah’s witnesses are able to give an answer, and that is why they are qualified ministers. The people in British Guiana are taking more notice of the New World society. This is due to the fact that there is now one publisher for every thousand persons in the country, and, as years go on, the publishers will increase and the population of British Guiana will get better Christian service. It is a very interesting point to notice when observing the report for British Guiana that more than ten per cent of their regular publishers are pioneers. The average publishers for the year was 441 and the average for pioneers was forty-six. This is probably one of the reasons for the good increase and their reaching out into new territory in that country. The branch servant gives some interesting experiences of what is going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The effectiveness of new publishers was pinpointed by a special pioneer sister in isolated territory who during the April campaign left a packet of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is &quot;the Light of the World” f </span><span class="font5">booklets for Mrs. B---- to distribute despite this</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">good-will person’s being sick. After a week she called back to find that sixteen had already been placed and later when she was passing another home a lady cried out, “Sister, Sister, I want to speak to you. I have one of your booklets from Mrs. B----■. She talked very</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">nicely to me and I have read it and now I want you to study with me too.” Both now attend meetings and a congregation of eight publishers has been formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Prepared sermons can work wonders at a back-call,&quot; says one youthful publisher who had originally been quickly dismissed by an old gentleman. But overhearing the sermon at the next home he could not resist hearing more; so a back-call was arranged. He being a pillar in the local church, there were some sharp differences on doctrine, but patient back-call sermons and studies especially on ‘trinity’ convinced him. He prepared a detailed written refutation on the trinity and met with the elders of his church, presented the truth and had two other elders join in with him. It is necessary to place literature for people to learn the truth; as one Lutheran minister said: “I take </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> because it gives me real Bible facts for my sermons.” But with some it takes a long time for the truth to sink in. A sister had long tried many things to get her husband interested and then, as if in defense, he became all the more conscious of his church. But he became so well acquainted with it and its unscriptural practices that he turned right about, studied </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font5"> and was soon a baptized publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a result of earlier work done in the interior a subscriber sent for tracts to distribute. Because of knowing of some interest in his area, it was arranged for a pioneer to visit there for two weeks and take the film. It turned out that this subscriber had not only read most of the recent publications but already taught himself the Kingdom songs and had well and truly advertised the arrival of the pioneer and film. He lost no time in getting two weeks’ thorough training, was baptized and is now writing in his own field experiences. At the eight different film showings there the effect was amazing; several Seventh-Day Adventists exclaimed on seeing the film: “We should have such unity . . . this is what we want.” The English manager of the mining company who helped with our transportation problem said, after seeing the film: “Jehovah’s witnesses are the only people who really want to live. ... I have seen them in Africa, too, and know they are genuine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To contend as right kind of soldiers means for obstacles to be overcome. Two days on the river, crossing rapids and a jungle trail is more than repaid to see scores of aboriginal Indians sit right out under the starry tropical sky watching “The New World Society in Action,” for many the first film they had ever seen. When called on next day they are ready to take literature to learn more; many subscribe and so are kept in constant contact with the New World society. At one hard-to-get-at mining place it was suggested to the shop owner who lived in the city that he take 100 magazines to place through his shop so that the workers could be edified. Being a subscriber for both magazines, he readily agreed, paid cash and suggested we make it a regular supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Finally, there was the gift of clothing from our brothers in New York. The majority of the publishers here received the benefits of this so that many needy cases can now better engage in the service, and for this they are most grateful to both Jehovah and their brothers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">75,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 125</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this small country with a small population not bigger than a normal-size city Jehovah’s witnesses are pushing back into the little villages and towns in the jungle, preaching the good news of the Kingdom. A great deal of educational work must be done here, but splendid progress has been made in the last few years in gathering together the other sheep. It is a joy to read the experiences that the branch servant relates and to observe how sincere these colored brothers of ours are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As we reflect on this activity we see that one of the greatest advances during the year was made in the pioneering field. The average number sharing in this work doubled over the previous year. The value of these individuals in the full-time ministry is plainly evident for, while the number of missionaries decreased during the year, the work went forward reaching many new territories. Entering the pioneer work and leaving home is not easy, but after realizing it is Jehovah’s will that all peoples be reached, then someone must do so. One of the new pioneer brothers was assigned to take the lead in a small congregation that had just been organized in a village about a hundred miles from his home. After a few months there he said: “Pioneering is harder than I ever felt it would be, but never before have I had the satisfaction in Jehovah’s service or realized the value of his spirit as much as I do now.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In all parts of the earth today it is evident that Satan has woven a tissue of lies and imposed it upon the minds of men. This veil only the pure light of truth can penetrate, whereas the failing lights of Christendom prove ineffective. This is seen in southern British Honduras where a large portion of the people are Carib Indians and these are so steeped in the traditions of the Catholic Church that Protestant groups have never made any progress among them. In February two special pioneers were assigned to work in this area and already the fine progress being made is causing many to take notice. The Carib people are studying with the brothers, attending meetings and telling others of the good news they are hearing. To aid them further it was arranged to show the film in the village of Punta Gorda, and over 2,000 persons came to see it, delighting to learn more of the new world where all inhabitants will be free and happy. So, true to his promise Jehovah, in His mountain, destroys the face of the covering that covers all peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One lady who was a Roman Catholic schoolteacher was very discouraged because God did not answer her prayers. It was at this time that she was contacted by one of the witnesses and the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> was placed. The next week a study was started and after three studies she was coming regularly to meetings. She then attended a meeting held by two Jesuit missionaries who were trying to revive lapsed Catholics. Remarking on this meeting, she said: “As I sat there listening to them I felt so happy to know how once I was right in with the Roman Catholics but now I am free. I could cry for joy!” After the fifth study she was engaging in the house-to-house work, desirous of helping other discouraged persons to learn the joy of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When a person learns the truth after years of searching for an understanding of the Bible it is cause for rejoicing. This was the experience of a man eighty-three years of age. He was studying with one of the brothers at the time it was announced that Brother Knorr would be in Belize for an assembly in December, 1954. This he attended and found it very enlightening. While in Belize for this assembly he met a minister of his former religion who took note of his lapel badge and began to scold him for “his foolishness.” He listened to him well, then finished the conversation by informing the minister that he was now past eighty years of age and that he had been hearing the Bible read to him since he was a baby and had heard it preached from the pulpit until now as well as having read it himself since he was old enough to do so, but not until Jehovah’s witnesses came to his town had he begun to understand what he had been reading and what he had been hearing preached all these years. This elderly man is now one of the most zealous publishers in the newly organized congregation in Stann Creek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After many years of struggle a New World society marriage in July climaxed the untiring efforts of the brothers to have a completely clean organization. In this particular case it was necessary for a man of good will to get a divorce so that he could marry the woman with whom he was living when she came into the truth. For more than three years and at the expense of hundreds of dollars this case was pushed through the court on the ground of adultery until it was legally granted. Though this sister was the mother of six children and had been a housewife for many years, she still assured us that no bride ever looked forward to her wedding day or experienced more joy over it than she did, for it was only then that she could be called one of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We do realize, Brother Knorr, that without the generous support from the Society through our brothers in other lands the missionary work could not be done here where the brothers are poor and contributions are low. We therefore want to express our appreciation for this loving gift that makes it possible for more persons to hear the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark195"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH ISLES Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">50,368,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 13,150 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 31,639</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year 1955 will be outstanding for Britain as far as theocratic events are concerned. The “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly closed the year and brought great joy and gladness to everyone. The great movement of Jehovah’s witnesses into London brought the New World society to the fore and captured the public eye, probably for the first time nationwide. Jehovah’s witnesses are not seeking publicity, but they are seeking the people of good will, and in this regard the brothers in Britain have a great responsibility still resting upon them. For a country so well educated it is rather difficult to understand why</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">there are not more associated with Jehovah’s witnesses, especially in view of the fact that the Church of England is so lax in its spiritual care of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The whole load of responsibility falls upon those who are in the truth now to see to it that this good news of the Kingdom is preached and the gathering of the other sheep is accomplished. For the past five years there has been a constant decline in the number of pioneers in the field, and Britain has shown only a three, four and five per cent increase in regular publishers during the past three years. Why? is the question that arises in the minds of many persons. Still the responsibility of getting the message preached in the British Isles rests with the British brothers. It is hoped the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly will give the work in Britain the stimulus it needs to reach out into every nook and corner of the British Isles to find those interested and of good will toward Jehovah so that they might come into a safe place, namely, the New World society, and gain life under God’s kingdom. The branch servant sends in very interesting items from the countries under the jurisdiction of the branch office, namely, the British Isles, Eire and Malta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without doubt the convention was the high light of the year. Contributing heavily to the joy of the British brothers was the presence of 5,000 brothers from other lands. They came from all directions, some 4,000 from across the Atlantic in two chartered ships, forty-two planes and by normal sea and air services. The Rugby Ground, Twickenham, was the convention site and there 41,970 persons heard Brother Knorr give the powerful talk, “World Conquest Soon—by God’s Kingdom.” An Anglican clergyman who was present said: “The talk was wonderful. The application of Scripture, the speaker’s courage and the enthusiasm of his hearers were thrilling.” At the baptism 1,183 were immersed. All the new English publications were released at Twickenham to the delight of the conventioners who marveled at the abundance of Jehovah’s blessings by print and microphone. In his closing remarks Brother Knorr’s announcement of plans for a new London Bethel brought resounding applause. It seemed to symbolize progress and expansion for Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having the conventioners stay in the homes of the people certainly was a power for good. When a brother called back on one landlady who had accommodated some American brothers, she said: “No need to thank me. I was about to write to your Society to thank them for sending me such wonderful people.” She had been a spiritualist but is now having a Bible study. This brother also started several other studies since the convention and concludes his letter with: “People just waiting for us; studies hanging like cherries waiting to be picked.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In April the campaign with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is “the Light of the World”? </span><span class="font5">booklet was launched at the special public meeting, which had a record combined attendance of 38,281. By mid-May all of the 1,300,000 booklets from Brooklyn were gone and the congregations were asking for more. The brothers enjoyed the campaign tremendously, for it was indeed an offensive for true worship. Later they were thrilled to take the battle still farther by sending the booklet to 26,808 clergymen and 1,225 editors. From the replies the brothers have sent in it is obvious that the “rich man” of the parable is howling in torment today just as in Jesus’ day. The spiritual prosperity and zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses are more than the clergy can bear. So they gnash their teeth in their parish magazines and pulpits, and sometimes in the press, but all they succeed in doing is to make the goats goatier and the sheep more curious. A few ministers wrote that they agreed with the indictment of Christendom and one Anglican vicar came to the home of the brother who wrote to him, asking what he should do. Humble, after many years in the pulpit, he himself is now having a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Realizing the need to put the Kingdom work first in these critical days, a detective sergeant at London’s famous Scotland Yard resigned after seventeen years’ service and took up the pioneer work. It caused some comment in the press and enabled him to give a good witness to many. Another young man, whose heart had been set on becoming a doctor and who was in the middle of his training, came into the truth, grasped the point that what man needed most of all was spiritual healing and became a pioneer just as soon as he could meet the qualifications. A similar example of the New World outlook concerns a couple who resisted the truth for some time and then realized they were being as foolish as their neighbors who were so very prejudiced. They wrote to the Society for literature, and a study was arranged. They progressed quickly, stopped smoking, shared in the meetings and soon were capable publishers. The wife quit her secular job so she could spend more time preaching with the pioneer sister who once had been sent away from her door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">EHtE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2,959,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1947: 52 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 182</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 1955 service year has been a difficult one for the brothers in Eire and, sad to say, the chief difficulty came from within. Just before the year began the Dublin congregation servant was disfellowshiped for immorality. This was a heavy blow. The time it takes to recover from a setback like that only emphasizes the seriousness of such defections. Apart from the violation of Jehovah’s righteous principles if a person would only think of all the harm that his evil course will do to tender sheep it would double his resistance. Although the unhappy incident cut down the number associating with us in Dublin it also strengthened the others, for they could see for themselves that Jehovah’s organization tolerates no uncleanness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The use of the Catholic Douay Bible at the doors and the distribution of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Way Is Love </span><span class="font5">have been very helpful in routing the vicious lie that we are Communists. Once it is possible to break that down, the people begin to accept us as another religion and we can talk with them.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark196"></a><span class="font5">The big problem in Eire is accommodation. The priests hold the people in such fear and exact such ruthless reprisals that they dare not give shelter to any of Jehovah’s witnesses. They even have the so-called “Protestants” in fear of boycott or of losing their jobs. The word of the priests has been law for a long time, resulting in the ignorance, fear, superstition and poverty that are the heritage of Catholic lands. But there are many people of good will among the lovable Irish. So, despite the problems, and by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, the witness work continues in Eire.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark197"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>MALTA</span></h2>

<p><span class="font5">During the year a congregation was established on the little island of Malta in the Mediterranean Sea. It is composed mainly of temporary residents, using the term in the literal sense. Most of the brothers are navy personnel who are just learning the truth of God’s Word but who show a commendable willingness to talk about what they learn to others. During their limited stay on the island they help with the work and support the meetings when they can. An indication of the zeal of the young congregation is seen in that they averaged fourteen hours, nine back-calls and one Bible study each per month for the year. They have responded well to the counsel and help of the circuit servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Malta is a British colony but is also solidly Roman Catholic. The administration will not allow anything to upset the priests, who are very allergic to Jehovah’s witnesses. During the year one of the sisters was asked to appear before the governor because the archbishop had complained about her activities. She was able to assure the governor that she was not guilty of the accusations, and that seemed to end the matter.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark199"></a>BULGARIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population 7,160,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Word still comes through from this country that the good news of the Kingdom is being preached, but from the latest word there are just about sixty publishers scattered in nine villages. These are living on collective farms and doing farming work. At one other place there are about ten to twelve persons, bringing the total to seventy, that have their hopes set on the new world of righteousness. They keep in communication with one -another through correspondence, and what truths they can gather they use to encourage those who are sick and weak, while those who are well and zealous take the lead. The principal publisher in Bulgaria has been serving the interests of the Kingdom since 1926, yet he says he has done little in Jehovah’s vineyard; but he prays that Jehovah will bless that labor so that it will all be to the honor and glory of His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Someday it may be possible for someone to visit these folks, when traveling conditions are better, to give them the encouragement and stimulus they need.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark200"></a>BURMA</span></h2>

<p><span class="font6">Our brothers in Burma have been faced with many difficulties during the year. A number of good publishers left the country, and then, too, it was hard to receive reports from the northern part of Burma where there is insurgent activity. While the report shows a decrease in the number of publishers, to compare with that of last year, the branch servant feels that there was really increase, but due to the fact that correspondence does not get through the troubled area not all the reports were received during the 1955 service year. He says that many new ones have joined the organization during the past twelve months, and the older ones have advanced to maturity. Some of the experiences that he reports are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Almost all publishers make good use of the Bible in the house-to-house work. This has enabled them to become much more familiar with the Word of God. Also the use of three- to eight-minute sermons has improved our witnessing. In many places where we were formerly known as “book sellers,” we are now known as “ministers of God.” In fact, we find that using the Bible with the three- to eight-minute sermons puts us on an altogether different footing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although there is only one congregation that is located in the capital, Rangoon, still the truth is spreading throughout the country. Three special pioneers were assigned to Mandalay in upper Burma, and already, after only five months of work, they have seven good-will persons attending the weekly </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Recently a Lushai brother went home on leave to the Lushai Hills, which are situated between India and Burma, carrying the good news of the Kingdom to that isolated country. We received this letter from him: “The very first day I reached our village I started preaching the truth. The news spread that I was preaching a new doctrine and this stirred up the church elders (Methodist mission). A committee meeting was held and there was a difference of opinion among the members. The majority were against me and said that I should be warned to stop my preaching as I was likely to mislead the members of the church. However, two of the members held the opinion that as Christians they should not oppose anyone who was preaching the gospel without being sure whether or not he was preaching the truth. They argued that since my arrival I had done a great deal of good in the village in that I had awakened the interest of the people in the Bible and that the Scriptures were now being discussed in most homes. Nevertheless, the majority continued to hold out against me and accordingly three elders were deputed to warn me that if I did not stop preaching my new doctrines I would be excommunicated, banned from marrying in the chapel and shunned for all time. I told them that it was futile to threaten me with excommunication because I had already, of my own accord, left the church since I found that its doctrines were contrary to the truth contained in the Bible. I told them that they could do as they wished, but that I would not stop my activity. When the news of this warning became known, it resulted in many more listening to the truth. In fact, several came to me and encouraged me to continue preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We were very grateful to Jehovah that three publishers were able to travel 9,000 miles to attend the British and European assemblies. We also thank him that two of these were able to go to Gilead School to attend the 26th class. We feel this will benefit the work here as our greatest need is for more mature brothers to take the lead in the service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">From one end of the country to the other the good news of the Kingdom is being preached, and of course the battle of Quebec continues. But the Catholic Hierarchy has subsided considerably. Jehovah’s witnesses have a grand time peacefully going about preaching the good news. The Quebec legislature put through a bill designed to ban the work in Quebec, but this has been of no effect. Quietly and peacefully Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to go from house to house and meet those people of good will and preach to those that want to hear. Canada was one of the countries that had the joy of arranging for one of the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies, and the influence of this assembly has been felt throughout all of western Canada. The work moves along very well, and the branch servant sets out some interesting items for us to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year has been filled beyond measure with evidences of Jehovah’s blessing upon the Kingdom ministry. Early in the service year we were privileged to have Brother Knorr visit us and provide us with constructive suggestions for further expansion in this part of the field. His visit to special pioneer groups in Quebec resulted in some beneficial changes’ being made in the method of preaching in territory where the French language is spoken. The Kingdom work in Quebec is progressing well and expansion there keeps pace with the growth in other parts of the country. The 218 pioneers now serving in that province make a large contribution to the spread of the good news. The clergy no longer find it easy to make the officials arrest and prosecute Jehovah’s witnesses, because during recent years we have won many cases. During the year 1,002 charges against us, some dating as far back as 1944, were dismissed, and thousands of dollars of bail money has been returned. Only eight arrests were made during the year. Four were withdrawn before trial and four were won at trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The decision to build a much larger branch headquarters for Canada is a marvelous indication of Jehovah’s blessing upon the past work of preaching the good news of the Kingdom, and it assures us of greater expansion yet to be accomplished. The general layout and many of the necessary details for the actual construction work were arranged by Brother Knorr when visiting the branch last autumn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Excavation for the new building began in April. At this time of writing the contractor has just finished the roof on both the factory and Bethel home and so it is expected that in another two or three months we shall be vacating these premises at 40 Irwin Avenue, which have been the headquarters for the work in Canada since 1924, and moving to the new building on Highway No. 401 just on the outskirts of Toronto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good work has been accomplished by those working unassigned territory. There were thousands of interested persons to be called on. Where it was not possible for pioneers or congregation publishers to visit these people, we arranged for the circuit servants to spend one week in areas where interest had been located. Effort was made to arrange a public meeting to bring these people together and establish an isolated publisher group or organize a congregation. This year fifty new congregations have been formed. The activity of the circuit servants has contributed largely to this increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The training program has proved a splendid means of aiding new ones as well as those brothers who are inexperienced in the field ministry. One pioneer reports that as a result of faithfully making return visits on interested people nine new publishers have been introduced into each branch of the service and two have advanced to the point of entering pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This report would not be complete without mentioning the wonderful provisions and instruction all of us received through the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies. We were privileged to nave the second one in Vancouver and space prevents our mentioning all that we should like to say. The publicity given to this assembly was outstanding, with day-by-day reports appearing in the major newspapers. One reporter who has covered many religious conventions said: “Seldom have so many healthy-looking people ever gathered in one group in the city of Vancouver and there was none of the somber tenseness usually found at religious conclaves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More and more all of us are realizing that we are identified with a triumphant kingdom that will go on “conquering, and to conquer.” As we reflect upon the marvelous new ministerial equipment released at the assemblies and the ever-constant flow of truths always available in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> we cannot but have full confidence that the year ahead will be a happy and a busy one, filled with theocratic blessings. Thousands of Canadians have seen the film “The New World Society in Action” and have marveled at it. What will they say and do as they observe the diligent forward movement of Jehovah’s witnesses under their triumphant King in the new service year now begun!</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Although outnumbered almost 100,000 to one the little group of Jehovah’s witnesses are going ahead announcing the Kingdom. When they look back over the past year they find it has been filled with deep pleasure because it has been a wonderful year of expansion for Ceylon. While there are not many publishers now, still the last year has gathered together a good group of local people and the missionaries and the congregations already established find great pleasure in the gathering in of the other sheep. The work has expanded to other parts of the island, and they have received rich blessings from the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly due to the many visitors that have traveled by there and stopped off and given reports. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences and shows us the progress of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the end of last service year there were publishers in just two places in the whole of Ceylon: in the capital city of Colombo, on the west coast, and in Kandy, some seventy miles inland. In December another missionary home was opened in the northern province and four of the missionaries from Colombo were sent to open up the work among the Tamil population. Later a local special pioneer and his general pioneer wife were sent to the eastern province. Next, another special pioneer and two congregation publishers went to the southern tip of the island, to the ancient sea port of Galle. Now in a very literal way the work is spreading over the length and breadth of the country, with the Kingdom message being preached at the northern and southern corners, the eastern and western sides and in the interior at the original capital of the Singhalese kings, Kandy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of the local brothers have made sterling progress toward maturity with the result that most of the servants’ positions are now filled by them. Many wondered, when some of those who were servants went to new territories as special pioneers, whether the missionaries would again have to take over these duties in the congregation, but, as each need arose, one by one other local brothers showed they were ready for responsibility and oversight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Beginning the witness work in new territories always brings unexpected and lively experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Salvation Army captain called to see a woman with whom only two chapters of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> had been studied. He attempted to bias her mind by saying that Jehovah’s witnesses have their own Bible to prove things, not the common Bible. But even the few seeds of truth sown in this mind of obvious “good soil” were sufficient to rebuff and put to shame such an outright lie and its voicer. “I pointed out to him that during my conversations with Jehovah’s witnesses I looked up the scriptures in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">my own</span><span class="font5"> Bible,” this lady told the publisher who visits her, and then continued eagerly: “From my own Bible I was able to convince him that man has no immortal soul.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the non-Christians are also seeing the difference between Christians and Christendom. “The New World Society in Action” film proves a telling means of emphasizing this contrast. At one Hindu college where the film was screened, an instructor seated alongside one of the missionaries commented: “My, but those are the people that really have the faith that can move mountains”—himself a Hindu, but using Jesus’ words. As this missionary explains it: In preaching to the Hindus, many of whom show deep respect for the Bible, it is our </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">different</span><span class="font5"> hope that appeals to them. One young Hindu lady said at the time of her third back-call: “Tell me more about the new world.” This sister has begun seven studies with Hindus and reports that all of them are showing very good interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The circuit servant sends in a report that demonstrates the positive and speedy flight those whom Jehovah knows as His are now making to the New World society. “A lady and her daughter listened very attentively to the sermon and took the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Means Everlasting Life’.</span><span class="font5"> On my next visit to this congregation, lo and behold, one of the field service contact points during the week was at this very same home. What had taken place between the two visits? As a result of proper follow-up work this lady soon began attending congregation meetings and then offered her home as a study center. The brother with whom I had made the first call became the group book-study conductor and the progress of the entire family was amazing. All left the Presbyterian church, much to the consternation of their clergyman, and in this short space of time four members of the family had commenced publishing. What a delight it was for me to go from house to house with this new sister, while my wife accompanied her elder daughter! Since my visit these four have symbolized their dedication to Jehovah and now one of the younger members of the family has started witnessing. The baby of the family—three years old—can name all sixty-six books of the Bible in order.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although only one brother from Ceylon was able to attend the London and European conventions this year, we have been blessed with visits from approximately one hundred brothers from other lands on their way. Already some have visited us on their return voyage and so have been able personally to pass on to us the love of all the brothers in attendance and to give us firsthand reports on the series of convention feasts Jehovah spread.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark203"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CHILE Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">6,000,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 83 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 1,172</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Back in 1930 one lone publisher began the work in Chile. For fifteen years the work gradually advanced until it reached eighty-three publishers in 1945. Today there are many witnesses giving the people of Chile the message of God’s kingdom. The questions can be asked of anyone: “What is your aim in life? Are you fruitlessly trying to find happiness in an old, unhappy world? Why not be different? Why not be a success in a new way?” Look at it the way the apostle Paul did, “In this way, indeed, I made it my aim not to declare the good news where Christ had already been named, in order that I might not be building on another man’s foundation.” (Rom. 15:20, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Pioneers can do that. Missionaries are continually doing that by going to the ends of the earth. There is a big field in Chile to carry on the missionary work, and the Society has seventy missionaries there now. They are a happy group, and Jehovah has richly blessed them. The branch servant writes about others who have missionary spirit and here are some excerpts from his report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Brother B---, who has come a long way to reach</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">maturity, is a fisherman by trade. Since learning the truth he likes to fish tor men rather than fish. He took a good supply of Bible literature on board during his trip along Chile’s northern coast. He fished nights and preached during the day at the various coves along the way. One month he placed 131 magazines and many other Bible aids with ‘those to whom no announcement had been made.’ It was the missionary’s joy that he expressed when he wrote: ‘Brother, I am happy in serving Jehovah in these parts.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What are you doing with your life? You may have worked many years looking in vain for satisfaction. For three years a lady had been a nun of the most sacrificial order but left with an empty heart. For fourteen years more she toured the country in the military uniform of the “Evangelical Army of Chile.” However, after a few months of Bible study with Jehovah’s witnesses she at last found true knowledge of God, began the witness work and has started eleven Bible studies with others. She happily commented: “Now I know that the true way to know Jehovah is by giving spiritual knowledge to others. God has been so patient with me while I have been searching for him that I want to do as much for others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For many years a businessman in Santiago has renewed his subscription for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine because he enjoys its variety of subjects. But the publisher taking the renewals was never able to have a good talk with him, his attitude being that any religious matter was to be left to the woman of the house. This year he was different, inviting the publisher in with genuine warmth and enthusiasm. The reason? For years he had been a slave to tobacco, until he read a recent article in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> that set forth suggestions on how to quit smoking. He put them into practice and rid himself of the habit. The effect on his nerves and general wellbeing was amazing, both to him and to his family. It gave opportunity for a lengthy discussion on the real purpose of the magazine and the hope it offers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following up showings of the Society’s film “The New World Society in Action” shows its effectiveness in new territories. In a very small southern town house-to-house invitations brought out 220 to fill the town hall for a showing. But would any of them come and listen to a one-hour Bible talk? The circuit servant writes that fifty attended and all showed very good attention. In a northern city over 500 saw the film and some months later forty-five persons attended the circuit servant’s talk. He reports unusual interest there and a very promising territory for missionaries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark204"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">601,912,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1946: 12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 56</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year’s text, “He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah,” has been a real comfort to our brothers in China. They are trusting in Jehovah and it has given them courage to go ahead and preach the good news, and they actually doubled the number of hours spent in witnessing when compared with the year before. The mature brothers, filled with zeal, set a very good example for the newer ones and weaker ones. This has helped them become regular ministers and efficient preachers of the good news. It certainly is a joy to see the work continuing to increase and they have even established a theocratic ministry school in Chinese, using </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Equipped for Every Good Work”.</span><span class="font6"> As the year progressed difficulty came too, but our brothers in China are determined to start the new year with more zeal, with more courage, than ever before. They know that this preaching of the good news must be done no matter what hindrances there are. The branch servant in Shanghai gives us some very interesting experiences, which all will enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During October we found it would be possible to hold our first assembly in Shanghai, and when announcing it we wondered just how the brothers would take to it, for there would be no brothers from outside Shanghai attending. But from the moment it was announced, the brothers took to it enthusiastically. Practically all the brothers arranged to be free for the three days. We had set a quota of forty publishers for October. This we reached and passed when forty-two shared in the witnessing effort at the assembly. Attendance rose from sixty-nine on the Friday to 122 on the Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the assembly on excellent progress was seen. Regular group witnessing was well supported, and soon the brothers were arranging group witnessing almost daily, with the mature ones taking along weaker ones and new ones to train in the field. In this way we were easily able to have “every publisher a regular house-to-house preacher of good news.” Much interest was located and many new Bible studies were started, reaching a peak of ninety-two home Bible studies for fifty-three congregation publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the year progressed it became more and more difficult to carry on with our house-to-house preaching, due to opposition from “progressive” lane committees and individuals. The insistent propaganda that religion is a cloak for subversive activities put the harmless preaching work of the brothers under constant suspicion. Many times brothers were stopped in preaching with the Bible, or taken to the police station where some were questioned for hours before being released. Yet despite this, new ones were taking up the work and a large section of the city was being thoroughly covered, with the result that we were becoming well known. We wondered just how much longer we should be able to carry on such activity. Then in June five sisters were taken off their witnessing work and detained for six hours, and, just three days later, three of them were again taken in and detained for four days, this time charged with breaking the peace by uninvited calling on the homes. Shortly after this we were ordered to stop all house-to-house preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the many new ones attending the Kingdom Hall meetings on Sundays, we soon reached our capacity of about 115 persons. With the heat of summer coming on we decided to hire a larger hall for the summer and succeeded in booking a fine, large, airy auditorium and began to announce the change of meeting place. Then the police stepped in and refused to allow us to use the hall. We interviewed the police official to find out the reason and were informed that we must continue to use our own church building even though it was too small. He said that there was freedom of religion but that this meant freedom to meet in your own church but not outside in any other building. In other words, there was to be no expansion. The only thing left for us was to divide our Sunday meeting into two, one half meeting in the early part of the morning and the other in the latter. So in this way we repeated the program each week and were able to provide reasonable, comfortable accommodation during the summer heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Memorial assembly gave us our largest attendance of 175. This is twice the attendance of the previous year and it gave us a good idea of the amount of interest that was developing from the home Bible study work. It has been our practice to hold an immersion each summer and usually about ten persons have been immersed. This year we anticipated that a larger number had progressed to the point of immersion, but imagine our joy when thirty-eight persons came forward and were immersed!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark205"></a>COLOMBIA</span></h2>

<p><span class="font6">The brothers in Colombia are overflowing with joy. Marvelous increases have been made in the gathering of the other sheep even though there is much opposition on the part of the religionists of that land to the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom. The New World society, however, has not been afraid, even though they have been run out of town, persecuted and put in prison. Still the brothers go ahead faithfully and with excellent results. The New World society in Colombia enjoyed a 28 per cent increase in publishers and we rejoice with them and are happy to read the experiences sent in by the branch servant, some of which are now related.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first month of the new year saw us off to a fine start with new peaks all around. However, the greatest stimulant was yet to come with your arrival, Brother Knorr. This took place in late December and was an occasion of double joy for all of us with your visit and a national assembly. Enthusiasm was great and attendance reached a new high. During the visit of the president plans were made to reorganize the branch office and arrangements to serve the brothers better in the future. All this produced immediate results, as the reports the following month indicated more new peaks plus ten new vacation pioneers. Soon, too, we were able to increase the special pioneers according to the president’s instructions and naturally this has been a great aid for 1955.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A circuit servant relates some interesting experiences. Five pioneers went into a city to aid a pioneer sister and two new publishers. Two days later they were in jail, the two men staying there for a week. They were released, but the entire group had to leave town. That would end the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in that city, thought the authorities. With no one except a twelveyear-old girl among them that was baptized, the people of good will overcame their fear and continued to meet together. One Sunday afternoon detectives broke in upon their </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study and the whole group, including small children, had to go to the mayor’s office. What a boost to their faith when they were released immediately and the detectives were severely reprimanded for disturbing the witnesses. Shortly thereafter I arrived with the Society’s film. The attendance was 170. One year after the pioneers were driven out of town we find ten publishers reporting and several awaiting baptism. In the meantime what were the five pioneers accomplishing? They began working in the next large city, about a hundred miles away, where opposers were also abundant. As a temporary residence they found a large room in a cheap hotel located in the heart of the city. The hotel owner was not opposed to the meetings. Hence these were held in the hotel room with the beds shoved behind curtains during meetings. Persecutors wonder where the witnesses meet, but the people of good will know just where to go. During my recent visit I found the year’s work fruitful. Thirteen publishers were reporting with over thirty attending the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study. For my public talk, advertised by word of mouth, sixty-five persons were present in the hotel room. Thus a new congregation was organized, one of the two organized here during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Barranquilla missionary revisiting his territory has excellent results now using short Bible sermons. One day, witnessing at a small store, he met a woman who showed interest and said it was wonderful but that the books would not serve her, since she could not read. She was informed that if she would take the time she could receive classes free. She offered to close the store for an hour a week to learn the “truth.” After a few lessons she came to the hall asking how she could help. Since she still lacked knowledge for preaching, the missionary replied she could help by cleaning the hall or giving a contribution for hall expense. Two more lessons and she asked the same question, How could she help? So she was told she could come along in the group and learn to preach to others. She gladly accepted and learned quickly. Now she is a regular publisher, wants to sell her store to have more time to preach and waits for baptism in the next assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An active fruit-producing pioneer sister lives with her family between a convent and a monastery. At noon one day a nun came to the window saying she had to see the sister. Within the house she asked how was it possible that, being raised with nuns, now she could be a “Protestant”? Did she not know she was doing much “harm” in the neighborhood? The sister reaching for two Catholic version Bibles in her library showed that all the “harm” she was doing consisted in preaching the truth of God’s Word to those wanting to listen. The nun rejected the Bible in all the discussion regarding church doctrines, and finally commanded the sister not to continue her house-to-house work, to which the sister naturally replied she would not go from house to house with lies, lottery or picture “saints” but she would continue house to house with God’s Word. The nun, feeling beat, left furious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the year finished, another home in Barranquilla was being put in order to accommodate the opening of the fourth unit. We find that new units can be started with forty or fifty publishers and they give better results. Also again we are able to say that special pioneers in isolated regions produce fruits for their hard labors. After ten months in such an assignment one couple now have eight publishers reporting.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark206"></a>COSTA RICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">942,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 253 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 2,078</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this little Central American country there is now one publisher of the Kingdom for every 450 people living in the land. Undoubtedly there are many more people who will take to the truth and come out of the organization of Christendom and serve Jehovah in the New World society. It is good to see the splendid increase in the organization during the year, and, of course, all the brothers are very happy because of the construction of a new branch home and Kingdom Hall in the capital city of Costa Rica. This has added stimulus to the work, and the branch servant gives us some interesting experiences of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first two months of the service year saw us just a little ahead of the previous year’s average, but the next two months were below. Then came Brother Knorr’s visit and the assembly in December. The excellent counsel brought to the attention of the publishers could only improve the work in all the congregations. Enthusiasm was very high over the announcement of the new building program. Then just when we felt that we were ready to move ahead, an invasion by armed forces started early in January. How comforting was our text for the year. Jehovah’s witnesses were determined to show that they were not afraid of evil tidings, that their hearts were fixed, trusting in Jehovah. In many towns and villages that were machine-gunned by planes they continued working from door to door, comforting the people with the message of God’s kingdom. And when the reports for the month got in to the branch office, the previous year’s peak had been passed and the ten per cent increase had almost been reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As is to be expected, all this activity brought many interesting experiences. One publisher had shared in the vacation pioneer service for two months of the previous year and at the end of her pioneer service was conducting ten home Bible studies. But as a congregation publisher she was unable to care for so many and they dropped to about five. This year she again sent in an application for two months’ vacation pioneer service. Then at the end of the first month she sent a letter stating that she did not wish to continue as a vacation pioneer, for again she had started many new studies and would just have to stay in the regular pioneer service in order to care for all the new interest. After several months’ work she now wonders why she did not take up the full-time service before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One isolated congregation had a very moving experience. Word came that someone wanted to see them in another village. It was a ninety-nine-year-old woman that had heard the truth and accepted it. Now she felt that she was about to die and, as her family opposed her, she wished to go where she could die among God’s people. Her family had tried to take her to a priest to confess, but she told them that she confessed to Jehovah, that he is the one that can forgive sins. As the only means of transportation is by horseback or on foot, several of the brothers walked through the jungle to this village and carried her to their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is becoming more and more difficult for the Catholic Church to dictate successfully to the people she claims to control. In a city long known for its fanaticism a congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses has been working for several years under great opposition. The circuit servant, during one of his visits, found that the local priests had installed loud-speakers on the church steeples so that they could be in constant contact with the people even though they were not inside the building. The church officials learned of the presence of the servant and his wife and of the proposed public meeting to be held on Sunday and made every effort publicly to ridicule the Kingdom effort during the week. On Sunday morning, while a large group of Kingdom publishers was scattered over the town working from door to door, two of the priests drove through the streets in a jeep equipped with loud-speakers telling the people that Jehovah’s witnesses were working in the neighborhood and not to talk to any of them. This activity had the opposite effect hoped for and it gave the witness work a considerable boost during the morning and an exceptionally large number of persons attended the afternoon discourse. Many good-will persons are being driven from Catholic bondage by the antics of the clergy and are thinking for themselves. Even some of the clergy may be starting to think. Recently one of the missionaries was in the street work with the magazines in San Jose and a priest came up and asked for a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> The missionary supposed that he wanted to tear it up, as had happened before, but, instead, he contributed for the magazine, stuck it in his “skirt” and walked contentedly down the street.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark207"></a>CUBA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">6,000,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 1,894 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 10,488</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The theocratic organization in Cuba has advanced during 1955, not spectacularly in the number of publishers, but certainly in improvement as to a mature organization. The brothers are getting better acquainted with the Word of God, and appreciate the responsibilities that fall upon them. Every effort is being made to get out into every part of Cuba with the message of the Kingdom, and many isolated sections have now been served through circuit servants’ visits. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences of what is going on in this beautiful island of the Caribbean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Particular stress was put on the need of circuit servants’ visiting isolated publishers and people of good will. Their efforts in this regard are having good results. One isolated group of three publishers joined the circuit servant and his wife in advertising a public talk. In the town square more than 300 heard the lecture by means of sound equipment, with about thirty-five remaining to ask several Bible questions. In another isolated area where the district servant had shown the film to 600 a few months previously, the circuit servant and a few publishers advertised a public talk in the same theater and 180 persons attended. Many humble and good-hearted individuals are yet to be gathered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Extreme poverty greatly affects literature placements in almost all of Cuba. The brothers are learning to exchange the literature for things besides money so that the good-will persons may get the publications. One circuit servant mentions that often his breakfast is obtained from booklet placements rather than from local brothers, as many brothers cannot even provide him breakfast. He says that often he trades for two eggs the first home or two in the morning. Soon thereafter one of good will may not be able to contribute for the literature but can fry those two eggs. Often this results in more placements, more testimonies and a good breakfast for the circuit servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another circuit servant says that the householders often “borrow” pennies from St. Lazaro, an image they have in their homes, with a few pennies often before it as offerings to this beggar ‘saint.’ “Borrowing” thus from St. Lazaro sometimes results in getting the lifegiving message in the homes of these poor people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the main high lights of this service year was the visit of the Society’s president to Cuba, thus climaxing his Central-South American tour. He being met at the international airport by more than 1,000 brothers a splendid publicity campaign was begun, resulting in many radio and newspaper interviews. Also the assembly site, the beautiful, well-kept race stadium called the Cin6dromo, lent dignity to the convention. Especially beneficial was Brother Knorr’s counsel to the district and circuit servants. Also, as a pleasant surprise, the Society’s vice-president, F. W. Franz, was present to give some very timely Scriptural counsel to the brothers as well as reporting on an important legal case in Scotland. More than 4,500 attended the Sunday public talk, “This Good News of the Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In April of this year a flag-salute case came up on the Isle of Pines involving a fifteen-year-old publisher. The local authorities also notified the congregation servant, a Gilead graduate, that he and the boy’s father must appear. It seemed wise to send an attorney there, so the branch made this provision, something apparently unexpected on the part of the school authorities. Six teachers were present to testify against the young publisher, after which testimonies the judge permitted their cross-examination by the Society’s attorney. This procedure lasted through the fourth teacher, then the judge asked the defense attorney to sum up his argument as the case had gone far enough. After this the judge dismissed the case in favor of the publisher. The teachers were exposed as being prejudiced, inconsistent and very ill-informed as to Cuba’s constitution regarding freedom of worship. It was a real victory. Though not even mentioned in any newspaper, it is very significant, being the first of such victories in Cuba.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During this service year eighty-three individuals were disfellowshiped from the New World society because the organization insists on maintaining the high Christian standards in the various 288 congregations that are taught in the Word of God. While this may have affected the service figures slightly, yet we have the inward satisfaction of knowing we are theocratic. This course is deepening the understanding and maturity of the brothers as well as their appreciation for the clean New World society.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark208"></a><span class="font6">Cyprus is an island in the Mediterranean Sea that in these days has attracted a great deal of attention. Jehovah’s witnesses on this island have witnessed much turmoil, political unrest and mob violence. An underground organization has been causing great disturbances, trying to overthrow the British authority. They have been responsible for numerous mob outrages and shootings. Our brothers there have had in mind the yeartext not to be afraid of evil tidings, so have gone ahead carrying a real message of hope and comfort to the people. The other sheep are still being gathered. The branch servant has a number of interesting items to relate showing the determination on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses in this troubled land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The film “The New World Society in Action” was scheduled to be shown in a village with some 1,500 inhabitants. The brothers in the village, about seventy in number, together with interested persons, were invited to the local cinema for the showing. Imagine our surprise to see the cinema packed to capacity long before we were due to commence. A count showed 450 people present! The cinema proprietor refused to take payment for the use of the cinema and has gladly offered to let us have its use again, free of charge. The local priest sent </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> villager to take down the names of all persons in the cinema. After the showing he asked for the list of names, but the villager replied: “Seeing that nearly the whole village was present, how could I write down all the names?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As in past years Jehovah’s servants have been the targets of the opposition of the Greek Orthodox Church. Certainly this is not due to the numerical strength of Jehovah’s witnesses but because of the exposure of false religion. Faithful brothers have been brought before the divorce courts because of their refusal to obey the orders of a marriage partner to forsake Jehovah’s organization. Other willing tools of false religion have used violence in an effort to hinder the preaching work. One missionary had only greeted </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> householder with “Good morning” when he had a chair brought down on his head and was chased from the house by this fanatic religionist. In another village, under the direction of a schoolteacher a mob of school children stoned the brothers out of the village. However, a local villager seated on a donkey came along and showed his disgust for the teacher and children by driving the mob before him back into the village. Because of this, other witnesses who were still in the village were able to leave without injury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year we lost a faithful pioneer brother who had spent many years in the pioneer service. During that time he had traveled on foot to almost all the island’s 650 villages, often having to sleep out in the open because of having no place to go. He was taken ill while working alone in his rural assignment and died shortly after. Even his burial was a mighty testimony to his fellow villagers. A brother conducted the burial service with upward of 150 persons present. They were so impressed with the Scriptural explanation about death and the resurrection hope that at the conclusion of the burial talk, one book, fifty booklets, fifteen magazines and dozens of leaflets were placed with the villagers attending the funeral. Surely such occasions can be used to good advantage in presenting our message of the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some four years ago when a publisher was engaging in street witnessing he obtained a subscription from a man who later left for the Belgian Congo. After reading the magazines he came to the conclusion that the message in the magazines was the truth and held this belief despite other religions’ telling him to the contrary. He recently returned to Cyprus and desired to get in contact with the organization, so he went to the street where he had met the witness four years previously in the hope of finding him, but without result. It so happened that this publisher while doing house-to-house work came across this man, and you can imagine his joy on seeing the witness. Through reading the magazine he had gained considerable knowledge of the truth and was ready for a home Bible study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The ruthless Communists, haters of Jehovah and his kingdom, are still persecuting our brothers in Czechoslovakia. The Communists are haters of God and destroyers of life. They do not want anyone to live at peace or to believe in the Bible, and certainly they do not want anyone to preach God’s kingdom. Anyone that does they are going to destroy. That is why Jehovah’s witnesses are marked in lands behind the iron curtain, but false religion compromises with communism and preaches communism, co-operates with communism and can exist. The New World society cannot coexist with communism and therefore Jehovah God will destroy communism. In these last days of the Devil’s organization Jehovah’s witnesses in Czechoslovakia are having a very hard time. Reports have come through of infiltration by Communist spies into the peaceful meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses who have been studying the Bible together and telling others the comforting words of Christ Jesus and the apostles, and, for this, they are put in concentration camps, uranium mines and work camps. They are trying to give Jehovah’s witnesses brain washings, trying to wash out of their minds the glorious principles of truth and righteousness and the true worship of the Sovereign Ruler and fill them with atheistic, hateful ideas of the communistic government. From reports that have come through from Czechoslovakia we know our brothers are faithful and true to their dedication to Jehovah. What we can do who have not been bound by such hateful propaganda as is handed out by the Communists is to pray and ask Jehovah to give these brothers of ours strength and courage to stand up under the persecution that is brought to bear against them. Conditions like this make us think of the persecution brought upon the early church, and how prayers were offered for those under oppression: “Consequently Peter was being kept in the prison; but prayer to God for him was being carried on intensely by the congregation.” (Acts 12:5, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Despite the persecution that our brothers are suffering, there are hundreds more publishers in Czechoslovakia today than a year ago. Let the Communists kill and destroy. Where one falls two will rise up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was in the fall of last year that Satan started his treacherous attack. A circuit servant became his willing tool for this purpose. He not only handed over to the secret state police the literature that the brothers had gotten from Berlin with much difficulty, but he gave them all possible information about the organization. The first victim of this treason was the branch servant. He was arrested and within a short time after him all the district and circuit servants except one were also arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Three Judases also manifested themselves among the Prague congregation; they let themselves be used by the authorities as willing tools. For this reason there is great distrust among the brothers there. Arrests were not limited to Prague but extended to all parts of the republic. Arrests are continuing and concern almost exclusively brothers who are servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Men of the secret police succeeded in penetrating into the most responsible positions of the organization, which has been smashed to a considerable extent. All of those who are not in prison are closely watched and followed, so that they cannot go anywhere without their “shadows.” The brothers are practically without any human leadership, but they try to do what they can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The situation in Prague is critical. We cannot contact one another from one corner to another. There are, however, a few small groups that can work without being disturbed. But in some villages we can do nothing at the moment because of the police action and surveillance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The New World society in Denmark, as in other parts of the world, is trying to give a thorough witness to the territory assigned to them. Many people are amazed, and, on the other hand, some are alarmed at the stability of Jehovah’s witnesses, their strength and their persistence in their purpose. Peoples of the world are surprised at the rapid growth and the straight course that is set for those that become Jehovah’s witnesses. Unless one has the spirit of Jehovah God he cannot appreciate the blessings of the New World society, nor can he appreciate the reverence that is given to Jehovah God by these members of that society, nor the respect they give to God’s Word. Jehovah’s witnesses keep silent before Jehovah, but before the nations they shout the praise of the Most High. As in other parts of the globe, Jehovah’s witnesses in Denmark did not do as much as they would have liked to do, even though they had an eight per cent increase. However, they will press on with greater activity, enjoying rich experiences. The branch servant gives us a report on the territory under the jurisdiction of that office, on Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister was showing a man the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> article, “Prepare Now to Live Forever,” while his wife listened to the discussion. After noting the many scriptures referred to, she said indignantly: “But you are one of Jehovah’s witnesses? We heard you never used the Bible! Why, even you [turning to her husband] told me that!” Thereafter several Bible questions were discussed and arrangements made for another call. These two hungrily took in all the points they could at each study. Quickly they began to tell others about the truth. Much diligent personal study had given them such a clear vision of the truth and the strength to apply it that on their own Initiative they soon gave up tobacco and the worldly celebrations of Christmas, New Year’s Day, birthdays, etc., thus giving a good example to some who have been associated many years but who still cling to many God-dishonoring practices of this old world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another brother who works in the post office placed a subscription with a delivery man. A few days later this postman came to him with Kr. 3.50 and said: “I obtained a subscription.” This postman had noticed that a certain man to whom he usually delivered </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> no longer received it, so he asked him why. The man did not know why it had stopped and asked how he could get it again. The postman said: “I will take care of it for you if you give me the money.” As it turned out, the publisher had called earlier to notify the man it had expired and get the renewal, but he saw only the man’s opposing wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year there were many court cases where young brothers were put in prison for holding fast to their neutrality. The clear and consistent position held by these brothers is not always understood by the world, but it is respected. Concerning the position of Jehovah’s witnesses and the state, in contrast with the vacilating position of the churches, one well-known playwright and author wrote the following in the newspaper </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Berlingske Aftenavis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jehovah’s witnesses are against participating in war in any form. They even refuse the substitute service in conscientious objectors’ camps. That certainly is to pinpoint the issue. It is radical indeed, and it is effective. It provides martyrs, and without martyrs the gospel is at a disadvantage. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jehovah’s witnesses do not take part in politics. That is not anything new. . . . but Jehovah’s witnesses even refuse to sing the national anthem or to rise for it. That is not new either; even politicians have refused that, but, unlike Jehovah’s witnesses, they have regretted it. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“There is always something wrong when church and state co-operate peacefully and cozily. . . . When the state in our times has become what it is, the church has come to the point where she must either betray the gospel or break with the state. The latter she cannot bring herself to do. It costs too much, it takes too much. By this weakness the sects grow in strength. ... In the eyes of the majority Jehovah’s witnesses are a ridiculous sect, but it is better to be ridiculed and mocked than to give up the spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This strength of spirit among Jehovah’s witnesses was well demonstrated at the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies this past summer. While some of the Danish publishers attended London, Paris, Rome or Nuremberg, most went to Stockholm. This was the first time that the majority of Danish publishers ever attended an international convention, and that outside their country. For the nearly 6,000 who were there from Denmark, the rich fellowship, the fine counsel and the new items of literature gave much strength for the work ahead. The fellowship within the New World society is a treasure of great value and the Danish brothers will long remember this experience, and especially the love demonstrated by the Swedish brothers who worked hard and long and put the comfort of their visiting brothers ahead of their own.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Often severity and sternness is manifest in the people’s religious life, and many persons are very set in their beliefs. There has been only a little response to the truth, though some witnessing has been done here periodically for more than twenty years. There has been regular witnessing since 1949, and since May of last year two special pioneers from Denmark have been working here. The results are encouraging and we hope the work continues to progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A great deal of tact is needed here. On one call a woman who was friendly invited the publishers in, but definitely stated she had her own ideas about religion and would not take any literature. The publishers noticed in the corner a large, new picture Bible and commended her for this. With glowing pride she showed them some of the pictures, and the publishers then began to show her some scriptures about the new world and discuss various Bible translations and how they helped clarify the theme of the Kingdom. When it was shown how the book being offered aided in understanding the Bible by the many scriptures assembled, she eagerly insisted on having the book. This had been her best “Bible hour.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Due to much fear of what the neighbors think, many persons of good will do not attend a public talk, yet these give a good witness. They provide many interesting subjects that soon become the talk of the town and open the way for good experiences in house-to-house work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religious opposition manifested itself in some unfavorable newspaper articles during the year, but our reply was printed and also an interview about our beliefs and activities. So the work goes ahead.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In the latter part of January two special pioneers arrived in Greenland from Denmark, supplied with some Danish literature and also three tracts and the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font5"> in the Green-landic language, a language akin to other Eskimo dialects, but with a written alphabet developed by Danish priests several generations ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After getting lodging in a guesthouse the brothers began to witness from house to house. Many Danish residents were surprised and often upset to find Jehovah’s witnesses had come to GodthSb as well, but others were friendly. One official said: “I won’t welcome you, but only ask when you leave for home.” But he became more tolerant when he learned the truth that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is not to tear down the social arrangement but to build respect for Bible principles. Another Danish teacher who at first opposed later admitted that Jehovah’s witnesses really have the Bible support, and stated that he would even tip his hat and say hello to them if he saw them on the road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The response of the Greenlanders was in accord with their happy, carefree, friendly and hospitable nature. They were glad to see them and anxious to ask questions. Though most of them like to attend church regularly, it is mainly because of their gregarious nature; they love to get together. They learned to read by using the Bible as a textbook, but now long to understand it, so they often come after the missionary in his house-to-house witnessing to ask questions. When the brothers come home at night they will often be visited by groups of two or three to fifteen or twenty persons, sometimes at ten o’clock in the evening, to ask questions. It would be most interesting to hear this talk given in some Danish and some Greenlandic with different ones in the audience helping to translate where necessary, and each one taking turns reading a scripture from a volume of the Greenlandic Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Holsteinsborg a telegram from the priest and another official resulted in the publishers’ being turned out of the barracks usually housing visitors. A Greenlandic policeman saw their difficulty in setting up a tent and invited them to his home because of the extreme cold. He resisted all pressure to turn the brothers out. Now there is much interest in this little town, both among Danish residents and Greenlanders.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Society has special representatives in the Dominican Republic, and they enjoy being with the people in that land and in telling them about the truths concerning God’s kingdom. They went there many years ago, graduates of Gilead, but in the meantime a ban was put on the work and no one is supposed to talk the Bible to other people, that is, Jehovah’s witnesses are not supposed to. However, when Jehovah God is doing a work through his Son it is done; the gathering of the other sheep must be accomplished and He can do it even in the Dominican Republic. For the past twelve months there has been a constant increase of ingathering. Many have taken their stand for the Kingdom and now there is an average of 425 publishers reporting every month. Man cannot stop the Kingdom message from being proclaimed, no matter how he bans the work of witnessing. The only way dictators and harsh rulers of the world can stop the proclamation of the truth is to kill off the witnesses. Jailing will not stop them, because even in the prisons where they are sent men are brought into the New World society. Some reports come through from the Dominican Republic, even though there is stiff censorship. The readers of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font6"> will be interested in the true story of what is going on in the Dominican Republic. Here are some interesting items.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It really gives you a thrill to see how these sincere simple countryfolk can identify the true ring of truth when they hear it and then in a few weeks or a month can stand up against persecution like veterans. One boy about fifteen years of age had his whole family against him and he finally had to leave home to find liberty to serve Jehovah the way his heart dictated. Now he is happy even if he did lose his goatish family. From the same neighborhood comes this news. One night at eleven o’clock the authorities came around to several homes in the country and picked up the brothers and sisters that they found. At one home they even kicked the door down to get in. At this late hour they hauled off women and small children to jail. Next day they were still locked up with no explanation given. After a week the sister with the children was released and told to go home. The rest stayed in jail a month before they got a hearing. At the hearing, for the first time, they found out they were charged with holding meetings. At the trial five were given three-month sentences and two were held over for a future trial. At this trial these were given six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whole secret of our strength is Jehovah’s spirit. We are not a people with stronger bodies or better schooled than others. In fact, we are weak vessels that the Lord is using to magnify His name. Even our theocratic knowledge is less than in many lands. For instance, the majority of our publishers have never seen a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> published by the Society. The majority have never seen an </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> or even know what it is. Many have never taken a book bag with literature and gone from door to door to preach. The average publisher has never been to a public meeting or an assembly of any kind. He does not sing or even know the songs, in fact, the meetings are so secret that he does not even stand for prayer because of attracting attention. He cannot use the mail to write to his friends because of censorship and persecution that attend the knowledge that he is a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With all this lack of material the spirit of Jehovah suffices. The brothers are unified and strong in faith and they go ahead with courage. It is so clear to honest-hearted ones how Jehovah uses the small Insignificant things to confound the mighty of this world. The six brothers in prison for refusing to participate in the obligatory military training program are a real pillar of testimony. Three prisoners have taken their stand for the truth. They had been studying for about six months, then made their decision. It caused quite a stir among the guards and other prisoners. One sergeant tried to browbeat one of the brothers by telling him that it would go hard with them if they continued preaching and proselyting the other prisoners like the three that they had converted. The brother answered him with a question. He said that these prisoners had been murderers and thieves when they had entered prison; and were they worse off now because they had become Christians? From the sergeant’s viewpoint there just was not any answer to that question, so he terminated the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then in July the Society from Brooklyn made arrangements to send down a brother to see the generalissimo. This brother was successful in seeing him and presented the petition that the Society had prepared asking for removal of the ban on our preaching work. Evidently the generalissimo saw the responsibility of answering to a higher heavenly court for his government’s action against the witness work, because he tried to sidestep the responsibility by saying that the secretary of State and Cults should be the one to see. It was called to his attention that he was the indisputable leader of the Dominican people and he was the only one that could help in this matter. There was another round of hand shaking and the interview was over. Since that time no action has been taken on his part even though about seven have been jailed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The political situation in a country can cause quite a disturbance to the preaching of the good news. But Jehovah’s witnesses must be patient and continue to preach regardless of the circumstances, in favorable season and in unfavorable season. The political situation changed in Ecuador during the past year, and it was found that much less pressure was brought to bear against Jehovah’s witnesses than in former times. The government is more for freedom of speech and freedom of worship. Jehovah’s witnesses are very grateful for this and have certainly taken advantage of it in pushing forward with the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom. They have enjoyed a sixteen per cent increase, eighty-three persons being baptized during the year. Some very interesting experiences were sent in, but there is one very long story that is quite typical of the country and of the people in Catholic-controlled nations. It should make all of us feel grateful that we have learned the truth, though probably not under such severe conditions, and, too, that we can preach without such punishment. Here is the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This year Riobamba becomes notable because it is the first congregation in the country to be left working without the aid of missionaries. It was at the time of the assembly in Ambato that the decision on this matter was made. The local brothers in Riobamba were fearful and felt as if they were being abandoned. But just a month later they were saying, “What a blessing!’’ Yes, they soon found out that it was not the missionaries who were holding them together and making them work. It was their love for Jehovah and for one another. Sleeping talents came to life and were improved upon to produce a completely capable servant body. And now that there was no missionary home in which to meet, they had to face the problem of maintaining a Kingdom Hall rented locally. How happy they were when they found enough for two months’ rent the first time the contribution box was opened! The congregation has continued to increase and Jehovah’s witnesses in Riobamba are now one to every thousand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The wife of the congregation servant in Riobamba spent considerable time thinking before she accepted the truth. Apparently, her husband’s words were of little effect. But one day her younger sister, Orffa, who, together with another yet younger, Yolanda, was already an “underground” witness of Jehovah, began to talk to her about this continued indifference, and to lend weight to her argument said, “Just look at what I have to go through for the truth,” with these words lowering the back of her dress to reveal weals and bruises, the result</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">of constant beatings of which she and Yolanda were constant victims at the hands of their Catholic parents. Since that time her sister Lucia made rapid progress in the witness work and was soon baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A short time before the date of her baptism the local priest had given instructions to the mother of the three sisters that unless she got rid of Orffa she would be excommunicated from the church. So the result was that Orffa was sent away from home, a blessing in disguise of punishment. In the next city she found secular employment with which to sustain herself and devoted the remainder of her time, about seventy hours a month, to the service. With her newly found freedom she, too, could now travel to the forthcoming assembly to be baptized with her sister Lucia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So it was that Lucia and Orffa found themselves among the immersion candidates in the front row of the assembly hall less than two months later. But as they listened to the baptism discourse, who should tiptoe in but sister Yolanda. What a smile on her face! Knowing that the assembly had begun in the far distance on the previous day her parents had thought it safe to let her leave the house. But Yolanda, without even a thought of how she would be received on her return, took the bus and traveled over 100 miles to the assembly city, arriving just in time to listen to the explanation of dedication and stand up alongside Lucia and Orffa to demonstrate her determination to do Jehovah’s will as a baptized witness, come what may.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now Lucia is one of the more experienced preachers in Riobamba and engages in training others weekly. Orffa has this privilege daily as she is now a full-time preacher of the good news. Yolanda still suffers valiantly but preaches regardless. Her desire is to follow the course of Orffa, and undoubtedly Jehovah will open the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The last few days of this service year we have spent in the happy “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly and this has certainly been an outstanding occasion for Jehovah’s people here. Traveling in Ecuador is not at all an easy experience and on previous occasions no more than fifty have been able to travel to the assemblies from outside the assembly city itself. But this time there were more than 180. These brothers did not have automobiles or other convenient means of travel; they traveled bundled together in freight trucks over unfinished roads from the snow-capped regions of the Andes to the tropical seaport of Guayaquil. One of the brothers who was due to give one of the opening discourses of the assembly had not slept for four days. It was a wonderful talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Finding accommodation for these brothers was a great problem. The brothers do not have the means to pay hotel bills, and here most families do not even have enough living space for themselves, so we do not have the facility of soliciting accommodation from those who have “guest rooms.” So it was a case of finding space for 180 in the homes of some thirty families of brothers and persons of good will. A typical example of the way it was done was where thirty-one slept in a brother’s home where the floor space is of some 150 square yards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yes, at this assembly we certainly had a fine representation of the entire country.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Egypt have had hard going during the past year. The good message of the Kingdom that they have been preaching in that land is, among those who are perishing, an odor issuing from death to death. The Catholic clergy certainly do not like the sweet fragrance of the Kingdom message that Jehovah’s witnesses have been heralding forth. They have fought desperately through slanderous articles, have tried to get the government to ban the work and disorganize it completely so that the lies of the Catholic Church can no longer be exposed. It is good to announce, though, that at the time of writing the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font6"> word has come through from Egypt that the government has instructed our branch office to go ahead with their work as usual, and all restrictions have been lifted. The story of the pressure against Jehovah’s witnesses is interestingly told by the branch servant, who also has something to say about the work in the Sudan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The triumphant message of the Kingdom has been like a scorching Are to the clergy of Christendom in this country and it filled their hearts with hatred and fury, causing them to wail publicly from their pulpits and in their magazines. Unable to suppress the preaching of the good news with their continual warnings against the witnesses, their misrepresentations of our beliefs, their insults and threats and even their mob actions, they resorted to slander and libel. In March a secular news magazine widely circulated in Egypt and the Middle East carried a two-page article accusing Jehovah’s witnesses of being agents for Zionism and the state of Israel, giving as its main source of material a Catholic bishop who took the shameful fame of having “discovered” this “dangerous Zionistic conspiracy in the heart of Cairo.” Later on, many of the so-called Christian clergy joined in this campaign of libel by issuing a flood of articles in their religious magazines calling Jehovah’s witnesses Zionists and shouting that their organization must be banned because they are dangerous to the country’s security. One of these religious magazines published a special 66-page issue carrying articles written by clergymen of various denominations to vilify us and our work. This campaign of hatred caused quite a stir and it was not long before the authorities prevented the brothers from meeting together in their Kingdom Halls. This, however, did not cool off their zeal and they kept on faithfully proclaiming the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A study was regularly held with a landlady whose son never showed interest. On reading the article calling us spies for the state of Israel he wanted to show it personally to the pioneer when she called for the weekly study. This started a discussion that amazed the young man, as he realized what lies the Catholic bishop had published. So he took a book and began attending regularly the home Bible study, always having questions to ask. Next he took two more books and some booklets. He continued to study carefully and before a month had elapsed he was preaching what he had learned to his married sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The false accusations of the clergy boomeranged and served in the opening of the eyes of the sincere ones of their flock, as the following experience shows. A missionary found a young lady in the house-to-house work and soon a study was organized and many doctrines discussed. Yet she could not understand why, in her opinion, we persecute the Catholic Church. All the explanations given to her were unsuccessful until she read about the malicious attack of the Catholic bishop. Then she was able to see that “it is the Catholic Church that persecutes the witnesses of Jehovah, and not Jehovah’s witnesses that persecute the church.” She has progressed since then and is now thinking of being baptized. Many are her experiences, as she does not refrain from telling others what she has learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Special pioneers working in isolated towns and villages have to contend with many hardships and show much perseverance to remain in their assigned territory and continue feeding the sheep. To start with, they find great difficulties in locating a lodging place, due to the religious misrepresentation and hatred raised by the clergy. When they do find a place they are never sure of remaining there, as it happens that the landlord is directed by the town priest or bishop to put them out of his home. If it is a woman doing ministerial work it is not strange for the clergy to accuse her of being a harlot, thereby causing her much trouble. It is a common thing for the clergy to demand that the pioneer leave the town and, as he stays, he is threatened with violence. It is no unusual thing for a bishop or a priest to send students after the pioneer to swear at him, call him names in the most obscene speech, throw stones at his room window, hit or kick him in the streets, take his literature by force and destroy it and even prevent him through physical interference from meeting the people and talking to them. As one priest put it in his Sunday sermon: “The Church authorizes everyone to beat the witness of Jehovah who is in town and you should consequently beat him whenever you see him.” This witness faithfully stuck to his assignment and when, after eight months, he had to leave under police supervision a little group of good-will persons had been formed. These are doing some incidental preaching and receive help through another minister who visits them periodically, and there is reason to believe they will join soon the ranks of the regular Kingdom announcers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a blessing to see the newcomers exercising a complete trust in Jehovah and rapidly advancing to maturity. Several ones among them offered their homes for congregational use and a good many of them joined in to make up a group of thirty-four Egyptian delegates to attend three or more of the European “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies. They returned more determined to promote pure worship. A tremendous witness has been given in the governmental sphere in connection with the fight for freedom of worship and the name of Jehovah was made known throughout the country more than ever before in modern history. It is hoped we shall be granted again the privilege to meet together in our Kingdom Halls.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Most of the work in the Sudan is done in the capital city of Khartoum and there we find the only congregation in the country, with an average number of ten publishers. They are in need of mature help to aid them in organization and service. It was possible to give them such help for a period of six months during the past service year by sending a missionary there. There is no doubt that he did a good work, but it is obvious that the publishers there need more help. We hope to supply it by sending them a missionary shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many are those who know the truth without taking their stand for it because of their love of pleasure. Leading an unclean life is not a strange thing. However, the clean life of Jehovah’s witnesses cannot be unnoticed. A strong opposer, who is also the son of a priest, happened to live with some of Jehovah’s witnesses for several months, during which time he observed their high moral standard and their great interest in Bible study. During his stay with the witnesses he asked all kinds of questions and became aware of the fact that all his questions were answered from the Bible. Before long he was spreading the truth around, telling his friends and relatives the good things he had learned, thereby paving the way for many interesting and successful back-calls and home Bible studies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark217"></a>EL SALVADOR</span></h2>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2,150,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 357</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The training program has produced good results in El Salvador, so the branch servant reports. The ordained ministers going from house to house are better qualified to present the message of the Kingdom. The 1955 service year was an exciting one for all of the New World society in this country because of the new branch home and Kingdom Hall that was being built in the capital city. It is now completed and in use, and it is the belief of all that this new addition will aid greatly in the expansion work. The branch servant gives us an interesting report of an event in connection with the building and also other items of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">First I want to report on our new building. You will remember the civil engineer whom you met when you were here in El Salvador. He spent a whole year coming and going in his home without noticing the missionary who, during that time, was conducting studies with his wife. Finally one day he insisted that his wife ask the missionary to give him English lessons. He was not Interested in religion, because he had become disgusted with the unfair political practices of the Catholic Church. The missionary agreed to the English lessons as a favor to the wife, but since he was an unusually curious man, they were soon talking English about the Bible and the true religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the idea of building a new branch home here came into being, the engineer offered to design it, build it and follow through on all features of the undertaking without any professional charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He became a friend of the whole branch family, and in the course of the many evenings that he spent with the missionaries designing the lighting, bathrooms and miscellanous other features of the home, he was able to absorb much more than his normal quota of truth radiation; but he did not show it. We all wondered whether he would take his stand or just become another person of good will. But when the time came, June 18, for the inauguration of the building, he bowled us over in his ten-minute talk by saying that “Jehovah God was responsible for this building.” This was the first time he had acknowledged a belief in Jehovah as having supreme authority and we were all thrilled, but he left immediately by air for Washington on official business. Before returning he extended his visit one week longer, to include the New York convention. When he returned and placed all the New York newspapers into the laps of the news-hungry stay-at-homes at the branch home, we were really happy, but when—unable to contain the news any longer—he blurted out that he had been baptized at Yankee Stadium, we were overjoyed beyond words. Our engineer was no longer “the engineer’’ but Brother P----.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At your direction a missionary home was set up in the city of Sonsonate, which we thought would be a “quiet” assignment, but no sooner had the missionaries settled down to work than four resident, Italian-American priests started a campaign of hate and bitter opposition toward the missionaries. The leader of the group especially put on a considerable amount of noisy, unchristian behavior by scorching Jehovah’s witnesses nightly over his fifteen-minute radio program, in the hope of drying them up and arousing public opinion against them; but the missionaries stood their ground and endured. The priests had won the friendship of the people because they were from Brooklyn and much more liberal than the local priests; they would fraternize with the people eating, drinking and smoking with them, but when they started their hate campaign against Jehovah’s witnesses, some of their best friends and also the most prominent people in Sonsonate told them to “lay off.” The priests went so far as to excommunicate the landlord of the missionary home because he did not expel the missionaries from his house. This action cost them much prestige with the people—prestige that they will not be able ever to gain back. Persecution in Sonsonate has been defeated, and the persons of good will who want a new world and who yearn for it with all their hearts are one by one taking their stand for the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We experimented with the Society’s film in our largest congregation by showing the film at the service centers in an effort to build up attendance and to locate new interest. Each Tuesday the film was shown at a different congregation study until all had seen it. Small groups had been expected and planned for, but attendance figures varied from eighty to 170 at these home showings. The service centers have greatly improved as to attendance and as to the number of new ones who attend Kingdom Hall meetings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Opposition from the outside is bad enough, but when rebellion comes from some individuals within the organization it really causes problems. This is to be expected sometimes from newly interested persons. They become proud and want to take the lead their own way, rather than follow the instructions of Jehovah and follow the organization. However, internal trouble when properly dealt with passes away and those whose hearts are fixed on Jehovah are not disturbed at evil tidings, but continue to preach the good news of the Kingdom. Ethiopia is a difficult territory in which to work, but the missionaries and associates with them are doing well and the branch servant gives us some interesting items on Ethiopia and Eritrea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Can you imagine working from house to house and making back-calls with no literature to work with? Until the past service year we did just that. With that in mind you can well realize what a joy it was to all of us when, after the special talk on April 3, the Society’s first Amharic-language publication, the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Way Is Love,</span><span class="font5"> was released. Having something to place with people in service and in which to conduct Bible studies has proved a real stimulus to the work. Later in the service year we were again thrilled to receive our first Amharic-language tract, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For about three years the Society’s branch office in Addis Ababa had been receiving regular correspondence from several interior villages. In some of these villages there were small groups of interested persons and one or two publishers. Desiring to assist those who seemed to have a definite interest in serving Jehovah God, the Society decided to send local special pioneers to organize them for regular meetings and service. One little village populated by about 15,000 Orthodox Amharas, Moslem Arabs and pagan Gallas proved to be a very interesting assignment. In a short time a congregation was established with the special pioneer acting as congregation servant. At the end of the year not only did a small congregation there report eight publishers but two of them had made application to enter pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As was to be expected, the preaching by Jehovah’s witnesses proved to be a “thorn in the side” to a little group of Protestant missionaries who were already working in the small village, so much so that one of their number went to visit the special pioneer to show him how and why he was wrong. His first effort was to prove that our brother was connected with a very new religion, one which was hardly old enough to be considered as Christ’s true church. But the witness of Jehovah quickly pointed out that Jehovah’s witnesses had been in existence since the days of Abel and that the name of Jehovah’s witnesses was from the Bible. When questioned on the point the Protestant missionary admitted that the name of his religion was not mentioned in the Bible at all and that his religion had been established at the time of the Reformation, which made it a rather new religion. Next the missionary told the pioneer brother that he was following C. T. Russell and Judge Rutherford, to which he answered that he had never heard of these people and hence could not very well follow them. The amusing thing about the experience was that our brother really had not heard of the names of the former presidents of the Watch Tower Society. Though not knowing much about the Watch Tower Society’s history he did know the truths of God’s Word upon which his solid faith was based.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the Memorial talk and special public meeting a missionary was sent to this new congregation from Addis Ababa, and to his joy about fifty people packed the little Kingdom Hall to hear. The missionary watched his outline and read from the Amharic Bible by candlelight while the audience listened in semidarkness inside the mud-and-straw building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From this small congregation a newly dedicated couple expressed the desire to expand the work farther into the interior and moved deep into the Galla country for that purpose. After three months of work there a report came to the branch office that a little group of three publishers had been organized and that weekly meetings in the Gallina language were being attended by an average of twenty-five interested people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A little over a year ago two publishers from Ethiopia moved to Eritrea for their secular work and took with them the message of Jehovah’s established kingdom. Reports of their activity have been received throughout the year and it is good to see that some are showing interest in the message proclaimed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the port town of Assab, where some preaching was done, a false shepherd became very much disturbed when one of his students began studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. Calling for a “showdown,” this false shepherd arranged a meeting with the student and our brother to show the “error” of this new doctrine. In the discussion that followed this man became so angry when he was unable to successfully refute the scriptures quoted by the witness that he resorted to shouting and condemning Jehovah’s witnesses as false prophets. The student then spoke up saying that he had heard enough and that he preferred to follow Bible instruction rather than shouting, after which he studied with Jehovah’s witnesses only.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Here in the far north in a country right next to the Russian border the people have taken to the truth. At the present time there are 633 people for every one witness of Jehovah in the country and these witnesses are thoroughly covering the territory, preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. The brothers are having very many extraordinary experiences. Some of the witnessing work is being done within the Arctic Circle, but wherever people can be found in Finland the publishers are making efforts to reach them. Some of the interesting experiences are set out below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A friendly store owner invited a pioneer inside to converse. He seemed rather reluctant to take any literature and acted as if he doubted what the witness said. Since the pioneer sensed a spark of interest in the merchant, he sat down and wrote off a few scriptures that applied to the subject of their discussion and sent them to the man. The next day he got a phone call from the merchant asking him to come right over. Afterward followed a long discussion that ended in placing two </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazines. A back-call was arranged and later a study started. The man showed keen interest and after only a few studies asked to go out with the pioneer in the house-to-house work. So rapidly did he advance with the training given him by the pioneer that he was a thirty-hour-a-month publisher before he was immersed. His enthusiasm broke down the prejudice and opposition of his wife and children and he started a home Bible study with them. This last winter his wife and two boys took a forward step and were immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The importance of attending meetings regularly cannot be overemphasized. Last December one business director was sighing and crying for the corruption in the land. He was searching for the truth. He noticed a witness on the street with a placard advertising the circuit assembly talk “Does God Really Care?” That was his question too! He came to the lecture and met an old business friend. The two sat together listening to the public meeting. They were so impressed that they stayed for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> summary and final talks by the circuit and district servants. A few days later he phoned the branch office and asked for more information. A brother talked to him and made arrangements for back-calls. He was exhorted to attend the area book study and congregational meetings. At once he started to attend and has attended regularly ever since. His family, wife and four children, as well as his two sisters, now also attend meetings. In just two months after starting to study and coming to meetings this man was baptized and asked for his own personal territory. Immediately a more mature publisher was assigned to train him and after only a few months he had matured so much that he was conducting his own home Bible study and is now able to help others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But how about the business associate who attended the same public meeting with him? Two of Jehovah’s witnesses called at his door shortly after the assembly. His wife at first showed prejudice but the tactful witness broke this down and the man invited them inside. The result was two books, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font5"> placed in Swedish and Finnish, as this man spoke Swedish and his wife Finnish. After a few back-calls a home Bible study was started in both the Swedish and the Finnish language. This man’s hundreds of questions were answered by the Bible study and by the witness who called on them. Soon the man’s brother and his wife joined them in the study. When news came of the Stockholm convention, all of them decided to go! The man was immersed at the Helsinki convention at the close of this service year. Every Sunday morning he has set aside to go from house to house with the mature publisher who is giving him training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For twelve years one woman had been a Sunday School teacher and a zealous church worker. Many times the priest had warned against Jehovah’s witnesses. One day as one of Jehovah’s witnesses called at her home, she surprised herself and her family by asking him in. One question after another was fired at the witness by the woman but each time she received a satisfying Scriptural answer. Later as she continued her discussions with Jehovah’s witnesses and began to see the truth, her conscience bothered her. One of her students had some time ago admitted that she was studying the truth with Jehovah’s witnesses. The Sunday School teacher had strictly warned her not to have anything to do with them. Now she herself found out that Jehovah’s witnesses have the truth! Imagine her joy and relief when she received a letter from the same girl saying that she had ignored her counsel and had continued to study with Jehovah’s witnesses and was now in the truth. This woman quit church, much to the dismay of her superiors. On the same day, however, she attended a social event held by the church for the youth. Many priests and even the bishop were present. In private conversation with the bishop she got him to admit that infant baptism was not Scriptural. “Then why does the church teach it?” “We have become so accustomed to it and if we changed it now according to the Bible it would just result in greater confusion.” Before she left she gave a talk to the youth about the soul, trinity and infant baptism and exhorted them not to believe with credulity but to be open-minded and accept the Bible truth and prove it from the Holy Scriptures. This meant giving up a $200-a-month job, but she rejoices that she does not have to be a slave to lies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The climax of theocratic activity came at the very close of the service year with a visit from the Society’s president, Brother Knorr, and his secretary, Brother Henschel. Both Messuhalli halls were rented for the occasion, which proved to be the largest ever held in Finland. Brothers were alert at the meetings, took notes, and afterward were heard to say that this was the most informative assembly held in Finland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We appreciated the visit from these brothers for they gave us counsel and help that will no doubt result in increase of theocratic activities, improvement of the work and more praise to Jehovah’s name in Finland.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The publishers in France had their hearts and minds turned toward the wonderful series of “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies. For them it meant Paris and the meeting of many brothers from different parts of the world. Five hundred brothers had a big job trying to find accommodations for all the brothers who would be moving into that city during the convention. They knew that the convention would be the climax of the year’s activity and a feast for everyone. Throughout the year the brothers energetically worked and communicated with people of good will and tried to bring them on to a mature understanding of Jehovah’s arrangements for life in His new world of righteousness. The branch servant sends in some very interesting reports on the territory handled by the branch office. These reports are on France, Algeria, Morocco, the Saar, Senegal and Tunisia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister seventy-one years old, completely isolated, who came into the truth only this year, writes as follows: “I am sending you herewith my report for August together with a list of the clergy and editors to whom I have sent the special booklet. The list contains seventy-four names. I wrote all the letters myself. Up to the present I have not received a single reply. Last Sunday I was visited by a young man who was holding in his hand a booklet that I had placed at a home. He asked me if I could get him the two books </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Kingdom Is at Hand’</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’.</span><span class="font5"> Having procured these books while at the Paris assembly [Paris is 250 miles from her home], I was able to supply him with them. He said that the message interested him very much and that he would like to become a witness of Jehovah. I told him he would need to study the Bible. He is just ready for it.” Then she adds a P.S.: “I have just had another visit from this young man and we have studied the Bible together. How grateful I am to Jehovah! I am very happy indeed. This is the second person I have found who is seriously interested. What a pity I am so old! If I were younger I could go to Africa. Being here so isolated I can scarcely work. If I were in a town I could work three or four hours each day. Since being baptized I have worked about forty villages. But this isn’t much and soon the time will come when the roads here in the moorlands will be impassable for two months. I have now been going from house to house for three months. Jehovah gives me strength, for I am well for my seventy-one years and sometimes when I have walked about nine miles in the service I recite the Psalms as I go. I know some of them by heart.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following is an experience that was given at the Paris “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly by a sister who was a nun for thirty-three years. “At the age of seventeen I entered a Catholic convent believing that God had called me there. When I was thirty-one I was sent to work as housekeeper for a bishop. There for the first time I had the opportunity to read the Gospels. It was then that I noticed that the high clergy among whom I worked did not practice what Jesus taught. I began to ask myself: ‘Why do these men allow themselves to be called &quot;Father” seeing that Jesus said, “You have only one Father, for you are all brothers”? Why do they like people to bow down to them?’ The answer I got to such questions was: ‘It’s the correct thing to do,’ and ‘People owe them respect—they are the visible representatives of Christ.’ ‘And the pope? Jesus did not have a palace!’ The priests would reply: ‘That is to attract the crowds—it is necessary to put on a show.’ These things troubled me very much. However, I resigned myself to the situation and tried not to complain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Then came my vacation and, as usual, I went to stay with my aunt. There it was that I met Jehovah’s witnesses for the first time. For some months one of my nephews had been studying the Bible with one of them. At the end of the week I returned to the bishop’s house taking with me a Bible and the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True<sup>1</sup>.</span><span class="font5"> These I read secretly in my room, for I would have been forbidden even the reading of the Bible. Due to lack of spiritual discernment the matter lay there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Two years later I was called to my aunt’s home to take care of my niece who had fallen ill. My nephew and two of my nieces were now dedicated to Jehovah. Naturally we had long discussions on the Bible. I also attended studies in the congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses. Three weeks of study were sufficient to make me lose completely what little confidence I had in the Catholic Church. However, I was now fifty years of age, and in view of my health I hesitated to throw everything over and start afresh, for I did not want to become a burden to my relatives. I was convinced that I had found the pure Christianity but thought that in the eyes of God my good will would suffice, that I could be with Jehovah’s witnesses in heart and at the same time stay in the Catholic institution. But soon that false idea fell, for I was shown that to believe with the heart was not sufficient; it was necessary to confess with the mouth in order to have salvation. The choice was thus before me—to choose life or death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I decided to return to the bishop’s house until my aunt could find me some work. I was again obliged to repeat the usual gestures, the confession, communion, etc. But I soon realized that I could not keep up this comedy for long. I no longer believed in the presence of Christ in the host; the confession became an awful burden. I could no longer pray to the ‘Holy Virgin,’ since she is no longer virgin and is not the mother of God; I could stay no longer! I wrote to my aunt asking her to come and fetch me away. Six months have passed since I left that religious community where for thirty-three years I had been held in spiritual captivity. It was with great joy that I symbolized my dedication to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah by water immersion at this ‘Triumphant Kingdom’ Assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This report would not be complete without a word about the wonderful “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly held in Paris from August 3 to 7. What a joy it was for us to have among us Brother Knorr and Brother Franz and so many brothers from Brooklyn and from more than fifty countries during this unforgettable feast! How grateful to Jehovah we are that such an assembly was possible! And how thrilled we were to see the news cameramen filming the immersion service and also the vast audience for the public talk! Hundreds of thousands of people were able to see these films throughout France the week following the assembly. Jehovah’s witnesses were in the news. But the assembly thrills were not yet over. Radiodiffusion et Television Francaises telephoned the Society asking for a television interview for the Tuesday evening following the assembly. This afforded a unique occasion for the branch servant to give a fine witness before the television audience throughout France. Again they telephoned the Society asking for a witness to give a radio report on the assembly in English. This report was broadcast on the Thursday night and lasted for five minutes and was heard in England, France and Belgium. In all, a good witness was given, greater than for any previous assembly, all to the honor of Jehovah’s name and kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The work of Jehovah’s witnesses in Algeria is comparatively new, for in this vast territory there is only one congregation and it is located in Algiers. With the help of four special pioneers (two married couples), this congregation is going ahead in the preaching work. Persons of good will have been found, instructed and trained In the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer writes: “I received from the Society the address of a young lady who possessed the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">'Let God Be True&quot;.</span><span class="font5"> She lived 950 miles from my home. One day, however, I had occasion to be going in the region where she lived and I went along to try to contact her. I found the young lady at home. She greeted me very warmly and invited me to dine with the family. A bedroom was also prepared for me, in spite of the fact that her mother is a Catholic and her father is a Jew. She showed keen interest in the message and a very pleasant evening was spent with the family. Her interest was such that she did not take the night train that she had planned to take, but arranged so that she could spend the rest of the evening with me and also the next day. The following morning as I packed my bag in preparation for field service, she asked if she could accompany me. She took me along to see some of her friends and neighbors. At each visit she gave a good witness and soon I had placed all my literature. When the time came for me to leave, she expressed much appreciation for my visit and proved this when later she applied to be a vacation pioneer. All this brought me much joy. But more was to come. During the ‘Triumphant Kingdom’ Assembly in Paris a young lady asked if she could speak to me—it was this same young lady I had visited 950 miles from my home in Algiers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The congregation servant writes: “Two years ago I contacted a family that showed fair interest in the truth, but due to certain obligations and sectarian associations the father remained lukewarm and I decided to eliminate him from my list of interested persons. One day I learned that one of his daughters aged fourteen had died. I had a certain esteem for this family and so I went to their home to try to give them a message of comfort. The result of this visit was far more than I had expected. For more than two hours I was questioned on the condition of the dead and on the resurrection. They were eager to know the truth. Their tears soon dried up giving way to enlightened happy faces expressing a real hope. At their invitation I again took up the weekly visits and now they are studying the truth more than ever. The sectarian associates of this family also came to present their sympathy, but none were able to give the required comfort. They did not know how to ‘comfort those that mourn.’ This family has now accepted the truth after having rejected the sectarian ideas for good.

<p><span class="font5">In spite of continued bloody riots and unrest in this French protectorate, four isolated publishers are not fearful, because their hearts are fixed, trusting in Jehovah. One of these publishers, a sister, writes: “As you know, the situation here is very bad and we have been ordered to stay in our homes except for necessary business. Needless to say, I consider preaching necessary business. I have attempted witnessing to Arabs and French, but with my limited ability I have not had much success but hope to redouble my efforts in the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A person with whom I hold a home Bible study said she has learned more about the Bible in a few studies with me than all her lifetime in Sunday School and is continuing her study in spite of her husband’s disapproval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In August I had the great joy of attending the Nuremberg ‘Triumphant Kingdom’ Assembly with my husband. He was greatly impressed by the peace and orderliness he saw among the witnesses of sixty-two nations. He has now accepted the truth. We have studies twice a week and he is making plans to arrange his affairs so that he can take part in the preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I am not discouraged here as there are always opportunities to witness. My husband and daughter and I have become very closely attached to one another because of our wonderful sharing of the truth. My prayer is that pioneers will be able to come here soon so that I may share with them in the work.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“During our last circuit assembly held in Puttlingen, the Catholic priest announced from the pulpit that ‘no Catholic should ever again set foot in the restaurant where Jehovah’s witnesses are now holding their assembly.’ As for the owner of the restaurant, he was quite impressed with the conduct of Jehovah’s witnesses and said they could have the hall any time they want it. During the holidays that followed very few people used this restaurant as a result of the priest’s announcement. Pressure was also put on other hall proprietors so that it is becoming increasingly difficult for us to obtain halls for the assemblies.” The circuit servant’s report goes on to say: “The special activity for April was well organized throughout the Saar. By means of the press, handbills and posters very fine publicity was given to the public meeting talk ‘Christendom or Christianity —Which One Is “the Light of the World”?’ resulting in peak attendances at all meetings. It also produced a new all-time peak of publishers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the visit of the circuit servant to a congregation five persons made application to be struck off the list of the Catholic Church. The astonished official, recognizing one of them as one of his acquaintances, asked: &quot;What’s happening? You are the fifth in three days!” The witness replied: “It is easy to understand; we are now Jehovah’s witnesses!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers in the Saar were greatly thrilled when they learned that they were invited to attend the Nuremberg “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly. A special train was reserved and practically every publisher in the Saar boarded this train together with persons of good will and a few German-speaking brothers from France. There were fourteen coaches in addition to two restaurant cars on this special train that transported 806 conventioners from the Saar. The train bore the streamer “Jehovah’s Witnesses—Saarebruck-Nuremberg.” During that great assembly in Nuremberg fifty-two brothers from the Saar symbolized their dedication by water immersion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“In Senegal the work is progressing slowly but surely,” writes one of the special pioneers. “With Jehovah’s help and protection we have succeeded in forming a small group of publishers that we hope will produce much fruit, for the field is vast and the persons of good will are numerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The small amount of literature placed is beginning to ravage the pastures of Christendom here in Senegal. When working a territory for the first time we are often amazed to see how much we are known, for people will show us tracts, magazines or booklets of the Society that their friends have loaned to them. In the offices and workshops we are often discussed. It is encouraging to note that in spite of the groanings of the clergy the truth is doing its work more than ever. Just recently we bought the necessary wood in order to make seats for the thirty brothers and persons of good will who will be attending the Memorial service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Since the special campaign the clergy are crying out against us, telling their flocks that they are now menaced by ‘a new religion which puts forth subtle arguments to destroy the faith of Christians.’ They exhort Catholics to ‘beware of persons who try to put out literature which is extremely dangerous to the faith.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“On Sunday, May 15, I had the joy of giving the baptismal discourse in the presence of fourteen brothers and persons of good will. How thrilled we all were when six out of the fourteen presented themselves for immersion! What is very encouraging is the spirit of good will shown by the new publishers who accompany me and my wife each week in the field service and who are doing all they can to become mature publishers.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The training program in Tunisia is bringing good results. What is interesting is the fact that the majority of those new other sheep who have joined the New World society are Jews. The following experience shows how the work is progressing among the Jewish population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young Jewish couple, disgusted with religion after being two years in the “Kiboutz” or collective farms of Palestine, was contacted in Tunis. They soon became very much interested in the truth. They felt that the Zionist movement was purely political. A Bible study in their home soon convinced them of this, and showed them who were the real Israel of God. A study of the prophecies and of Bible chronology showed them also that Jesus is indeed the royal heir, the Seed of God’s woman. Their joy was great and they quickly made this known to all their family, thus raising the number attending the home Bible study from three to seven. This news soon spread to other relatives and to friends who were traditionalists. In order to settle the question of the Messiah a discussion with one of the chief rabbis of the town was arranged. Fifteen Jews attended this discussion and the majority of them were greatly shaken by the truths revealed during the course of the thrilling expose. The result of this meeting was that the attendance at the home Bible study still remains at seven and, of these, four are now publishers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">50,672,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1946: 7,030 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 54,635</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year 1955 has been an outstanding one for all the brothers in Germany, East and West. This was the year of the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses and the blessings of this assembly reached into every nook and corner of the land. In Western Germany the work goes along without any hindrance and there have been wonderful increases in the gathering of the other sheep. In Eastern Germany the pressure continues hard against the preaching of the good news and the Communists are trying to break the back of the New World society there. In this they will not succeed. Jehovah is able to preserve his people and he will continue to feed them and guide them with his spirit no matter where they are upon the earth. The branch servant sends in some very interesting experiences and an excellent report on the Nuremberg convention. Excerpts from his writings will be greatly enjoyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sweet strains of joy from Nuremberg are still in our ears—that blessed assembly, which really topped anything that we might have expected. Our hearts are overflowing with the precious gifts that Jehovah poured out on the assembled partakers of his feast. As on no previous occasion we were able to see what deep love unites Jehovah’s true worshipers of the present day, a love that reaches out beyond all race and nationality barriers and conquers all distances, a love that ties those possessing it together in the closest possible bonds. These men and women of all nations have dedicated all that they have to the great Sovereign Jehovah and his King. The convention in Nuremberg from August 10 to 14 was more magnificent and wonderful than human minds can comprehend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each day the huge throng of people in the audience increased, assembled to avidly absorb the interesting discourses into heart and mind. On Sunday morning 80,415 persons were counted in the audience and at the afternoon public meeting the number boomed on up to 107,423. For the first time more than 100,000 Jehovah’s witnesses and people of good will gathered at a European convention, these from sixty-three nations and lands of the earth! What an exhilarating surprise! Does not this number alone show the truth of the expression “Triumphant Kingdom”? The program at Nuremberg was the same as at the other large assemblies this year and offered a fill of timely, vital instruction, teaching, warning, encouragement and much, much joy and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Simultaneously another assembly was being held in Berlin, that is, from August 12 to 14, in the interests of the brothers in the East Zone of Germany. The Waldbuehne (Forest Stage) was again a very suitable Kingdom Hall. Attending were 17,729 persons who heard about the world conquest soon to come by the “Triumphant Kingdom.” Brother F. W. Franz, vicepresident of the Society, delivered this message to the enthused audience on Sunday afternoon. A telephone call between the conventions made it possible for Brother Knorr to announce to the mammoth crowd of people assembled at that one location before the close of his public talk in Nuremberg that at that very moment no less than 125,152 persons were assembled in Germany to direct their hearts and minds toward the wonderful message of God’s kingdom. A thunderous ovation ran through the stadium like wildfire at that happifying statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The number immersed in Nuremberg was 4,333 and in Berlin 870, which makes a grand total of 5,203! What exuberance welled up in the guests at Jehovah’s feast upon being able to greet these many people of good will as new associates in true worship of God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the call of the Society to work also from house to house with magazines on Christendom’s holidays had echoed through the land, strong prejudice was due to be toppled from its perch. Thousands of willing publishers had unusually wonderful experiences during those service days. Through wind and rain one circuit servant worked with a group of publishers on the first Christmas holiday from house to house, much to the astonishment of the Catholic inhabitants. “A person has to give you credit,” they said, “none of us would do that.” And as a brother excused himself for having gotten some rainwater on the literature in his book bag someone said: “Certainly, let me have those magazines; those are just the ones that I would like to have, and I shall read them carefully.” And he reached for the magazines that had become wet. A publisher from the country writes us: “We were the happiest people of all at Christmas.” Another congregation, of which 50 per cent of the publishers moved out into the field service on the special Magazine Day, the 30th of May, placed a total of 450 magazines and 385 booklets, which means an average of thirteen magazines and eleven booklets for each publisher. How easy it is to reach the magazine quota when one listens to the admonition of Jehovah and attentively keeps on the watch for service opportunities!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A teacher of religion in a secondary school for girls wrote in to the office with the request to send her some easy-to-understand reading matter for her religion classes. She received the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font5"> with the comment that we should be glad to send more if that were desired. A few days later she sent in a word of thanks and ordered one booklet for each of her thirty-five pupils, because these had “expressly requested them.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark232"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark233"></a>EASTERN GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">18,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Five years have now passed since the ban was put on the theocratic activity by the Communist authorities in East Germany. Despite all avowals regarding their peaceful intentions, the Communists continue to persecute the publishers of the good news cruelly. Hundreds of ministers were forced to leave the East Zone during the course of the past year and seek safety in West Berlin, while countless others transferred directly to West Germany to continue carrying on their ministerial activities. That means that each one of these “refugees” lost his means of existence, for all had to forsake home and job in order to remain free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers need continual encouragement and instruction if they are to bear up under the heat of battle from year to year and not let their hands droop into inactivity. They have to be shown how they can carry on in spite of persecution ‘as sheep amid wolves’ preaching the good news to those who are of good will. For this reason our brothers of Eastern Germany show great appreciation for the spiritual food. They might be compared to the earth in a drouth-parched land, which thirstily longs for the rain and then anxiously soaks it in when it arrives. In such periods of singeing fury the mature brothers have ample opportunity to prove that they are of those “princes,” who “rule in justice” and are a “hiding-place from the wind” to extend their fellows good, sincere advice and assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Despite all difficulties and persecution the labors of the faithful are being richly blessed by Jehovah, and again and again our brothers there have experiences that testify to the protection of Jehovah in the ministerial work. One publisher reports: “In Y----</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">we ran across a people’s policeman in the door-to-door work, who immediately saw that we were arrested. We were taken to the state security service. As we defended our ministerial commission with a long witness, we were offered the opportunity to work for the so-called ‘National Front’ (a Communist-controlled organization); then we could work openly and even obtain halls and autos. They worked on us hard for three hours. As they saw that they could not persuade us, they threatened us with long terms in jail. After they then saw that we would make no compromises, to our great surprise they returned our credentials and let us go free.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From another report: “At one home a man in civilian clothes who proved to be a policeman opened the door after we had already given him a lengthy witness. But to our astonishment he wished us much success and even warned us about another person living in the same house, who was a 100 per cent Communist functionary.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The steadfastness of the witnesses works to the benefit of favorably-minded people in prison, too. With the approval of the justice administration a Catholic priest held a talk against Jehovah’s witnesses in one of the larger penitentiaries. His discourse was so full of lies that various inmates of the penal institution became irritated and openly protested. One has to take into consideration here what this really means in face of the severe penalties and hard discipline in a Communist penitentiary. Boldly they shouted: “That is not the truth! We know Jehovah’s witnesses better!” Several even demanded a discussion, which request was turned down, however. So such misrepresentation of the true ministers of God only served to expose the clergy of false religion and to spread out the good news of the Kingdom that much more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many fellow witnesses from the East Zone assembled with brothers and friends from West Berlin to the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly in the beautiful Waldbuehne from August 12 to 14. Others wended their way by many different routes to Nuremberg to be recipients of the flood of blessings shared by the convention-ers there. Richly strengthened, yes, really enthused, they returned from the conventions to their home congregations to pass on the good things heard to others.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark234"></a>GOLD COAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population Highest Number of Ministers Preaching 3,989,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945 : 346 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955 : 6,466</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Gold Coast is one of the most advanced countries in Africa and is moving steadily toward self-government. It is hoped that Jehovah’s witnesses will enjoy the primary rights that all of the people of that land want, especially the rights of freedom of religion and freedom of speech. In times past the preaching of the Word of God has been hampered to some extent by restrictions on literature, but the government has changed and the African officials look upon our work more favorably. With new officials in office visas have been granted now for some more missionaries to come into the country, and we know that this will be a blessing to the people of the land. The branch sends us an interesting report, and excerpts are taken from the report on the happenings in the Gold Coast, Gambia, Ivory Coast and French Togoland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A big feature of the service year has been the showing of the film “The New World Society in Action.” Considerable expense was required for the showing of the film here. Only the larger towns have electricity, and even in towns where they have it, it is seldom available at locations where the film is shown. This made it necessary to purchase a generator as well as a projector for the showing of the film and a jeep to transport it all. But with this equipment we have been able to show the film from one end of the country to the other. In some places the people had never seen a motion picture before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The film has done a good work in this country. In an eastern section of the country, which is predominantly Catholic, several chiefs had banned all house-to-house preaching in their villages; and it was primarily due to the showing of the film to the paramount chief and in villages neighboring the places where the work was banned that the ban was lifted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our first public showing of the film was in October, and since then it has been shown fifty-nine times to a total attendance of 109,496, or an average attendance of over 1,800. Many of the people showed keen interest in the film and many favorable remarks were heard. One man said: “There is no organization in the world doing such a marvelous work as your Society. You carry on; we are coming.” Another said: “The amount we pay for the books you bring us does not cover the amount of labor and expense you go to in producing them.” A leader in a Methodist church remarked: “I had never thought very much of your church until I saw the film. I have ever since been telling my members to listen to what Jehovah’s witnesses teach.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most of the opposition experienced by the brothers here comes from members of the Catholic Church, though sometimes members of other religions show the same spirit of the Devil. In a village where several good-will people were beginning to take an interest in the good news of the Kingdom, the chief, a Roman Catholic, made a determined effort to stop the people from associating with Jehovah’s witnesses. His first effort was made by ordering all the people of the village to attend the Catholic church on Sunday. All who failed to do so would be fined two shillings and six pence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This effort of the chief failed to keep the good-will people from studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. In desperation the chief ordered by a gong-gong proclamation that no inhabitant of his village should receive in his house any of Jehovah’s witnesses and that the house-to-house preaching in the village was banned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Just a week later the very man that beat the gonggong for the banning of the work also associated himself with the New World society. He told the brothers: “This is the true church, for I made comparison of all the churches the night after I beat the gonggong to ban the work of Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chief, more furious than ever, threatened to eject the good-will people from his village, but even this threat failed to dampen their zeal for the truth. This was one of the villages where the film played a part in eventually having the ban lifted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Northern Territories a pioneer has been working in a village with a small group of isolated brothers. Month by month their report showed from one to four publishers in the service. Then one month they reported twenty-two. The next month forty-six publishers were reported. Thinking something was wrong with the report, the branch office wrote to the pioneer for an explanation. The following is his reply:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Apart from my daily Kingdom preaching, in order to keep in proper touch with the natives I am conducting a night school; and out of over eighty boys and girls on roll, over half of them now have started preaching about Jehovah’s new world to their friends and parents in the various towns and villages. This accounts for the increase on both the March and April report cards.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The circuit servant recently visited this group and sent in a very favorable report along with a congregation application. He reports that as a result of the pioneer’s night school many of the young publishers are now able to read the Bible bit by bit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Gambia is the oldest, northernmost and smallest British territory in Africa and perhaps the most unresponsive to the Kingdom message. The brother in charge of the work is trying hard to keep the work alive and he has not become discouraged because of the lack of interest shown by the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a ray of hope, though, for more magazines were placed this year, and for the first time in three years the report shows some booklets placed. The special booklet campaign in July encouraged the brothers to make an effort to present the booklet and they placed nearly all of their consignment. This should encourage the use of literature more consistently in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brother in charge of the work makes the following report of the work in this little country:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“While there are yet oppositions and difficulties to encounter in Gambia, nevertheless we are thankful for the undeserved kindness of Jehovah that we are still able to raise a voice in proclaiming the Kingdom. Superstition, tradition and the fear of man form great obstacles in this land, but there is still hope for a better change in Jehovah’s own time.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Among the high lights of the year are two Methodist pillars in the local church who have taken a strong stand for the truth. Not without opposition, however. Both white and colored pastors of the Methodist Church loudly registered their disapproval. When these two brothers were called by the pastors to know why they abandoned their former church and joined Jehovah’s witnesses, the first brother said: “You, the pastors, do not understand the Bible so as to teach others.” “Why do you say so?” asked the pastor. “Because you knew I was having more than one wife,” said the brother, “and you appointed me as an adviser of the church and a member of the executive committee, which is not Scriptural. Jehovah’s witnesses would not have baptized me if I had not set in order my ways.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The other brother who had been president of the local Methodist church said to the pastor: “My reason for taking off the veil of your church is that I do not want to serve man but God. In your church the laymen serve and obey the clergy rather than God, while Jehovah’s witnesses, all, young and old, without eminence of rank, serve and obey Jehovah by preaching the good news as His servants.” Then the pastor said: “If because of the preaching you left the church, come back and we will let you preach.” “What will I preach?” asked the brother, “not the same stuff? immortality of the soul, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a fiery</span><span class="font5"> hell, the mysterious trinity? No, I do not want it. I know from the teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses that these doctrines are false, pagan-drawn beliefs.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer and another brother went to an isolated village for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> week of field service. One morning while working the village they came to a small swish building used as a church. They entered the building and sat down. The twenty-five people present were quite surprised to see the brothers come in and sit with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the close of the church service this special pioneer asked permission to talk to the group </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a few </span><span class="font5">minutes. The minister agreed and asked the people to wait and listen to the talk. After </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> half-hour talk many interesting questions were put to the pioneer, and the two brothers were then escorted to the minister’s home with the whole congregation following. More questions were answered by the brothers, and so great was the surprise of the people at the answers given that they asked them if they were angels sent to them by God. The people insisted that the brothers must not leave them but stay with them several days longer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Quoting Joshua 24:15 the minister declared that he would continue to learn all the Bible instruction that the brothers would give him. The others agreed but said: “Only preaching from house to house is difficult for us.” The brothers encouraged them to continue studying until they acquired more knowledge of the truth, and things concerning the Kingdom would gradually be made plain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the people came to know that the truth is not in harmony with fornication, adultery, stealing and going to false gods, as they were accustomed to do, many of them began to draw back, but the minister again repeated Joshua 24:15, and said that, if the others turned back, he alone with his house would serve Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometime later when the special pioneer went back to the village he was about to be beaten by the people when the good-will minister came to his aid. Now the minister is reporting time as a true minister of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">One of the big events in Greece this past year was when the brothers moved into their new Bethel home and printing plant. This was accomplished after great opposition to the building program. Everyone rejoices that now we have a fine building from which to direct the Kingdom interests, all to the honor and glory of Jehovah. The Greek brothers still meet tremendous persecution on the part of the orthodox clergy, and the people that are under their influence. But they valiantly press on preaching the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Turkey comes under the direction of the Greek office, and here, too, a good increase was made during the year, and some very happify-ing experiences are related.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers’ endurance in persecutions, sufferings and imprisonments really brings about rich fruit, and the pains taken in finding and nourishing the other sheep do not prove to be vain. The set quota of 10 per cent increase in December and 20 per cent in April was exceeded by far and thus during the Memorial month we attained a new peak of 5,573 publishers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The application of the training program has yielded very good results. Mature brothers appreciate the privilege assigned them to assist their new brothers and train them in properly presenting the message at the people’s doors. In those congregations where this training program was put in practice, the number of publishers has been increased, and the number of nonregular publishers in field service has been reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of the clergymen who received the special booklet many returned it as unacceptable, others replied admonishing the senders to quit the “delusion” wherein they are ensnared by the Devil, others answered with insults and expressions full of hatred and passion, again others sent the booket on to the police authorities and laid charges for &quot;proselytism” on the brothers! Up to the moment, over sixty charges have been laid in various parts of the country on brothers who mailed these booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Projection of the film “The New World Society in Action” was resumed after several months of discontinuance, at the end of a fine victory gained in the law courts. The projector and films that were seized were returned to us, and we therefore resumed projections, to the joy of the brothers. We had a nice experience: The U.S. Information Service in Athens has courteously and altogether freely granted us their own hall and even had our film projected by their operator with a projector of their own. Already five times has this projection been effected and each time about 150 brothers and friends of the truth attended projection of our nice film showing the New World society’s activity. Unspeakable is the brothers’ joy, as a rare opportunity is thus provided for so many brothers to gather together and comfortably behold a theocratic film!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a small village of Macedonia twelve brothers were gathered in a house singing songs. At about 11 p.m. they prepared to leave for their homes, when they noticed a squad of thirty armed gendarmes standing on guard outside the house with the object of arresting them on departure. The brothers stayed within the house overnight. So as not to trespass in the house, the gendarmes stayed outside the house overnight, but next morning they arrested the brothers and took them to the police station. The next day in the law court the brothers were sentenced to four months in prison for this song singing! They appealed the case, however, and the court of appeals discharged them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a village of eastern Thrace a Mohammedan came to know the truth, and he immediately started witnessing to his fellow countrymen. He was called by the police and was forbidden to speak for Jehovah. But this young witness of Jehovah asked the police officer what his name was. The police officer responded. Then the young publisher told the police officer: “Just as you could not avoid replying to my query, so can I not avoid replying when asked why have I changed my religion.” The police officer had nothing further to say and set him free.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A great many took the blessed step of dedicating their lives to Jehovah God. In fact, so far this year twenty-nine brothers and sisters have been baptized, and there are three more who will probably follow this month. At least fifteen of this number started studying the truth ten, eight and four months ago, and one lady one and a half months ago. Very interesting are the experiences of how some of them got into the truth. Our new Turkish brother, for example, first heard of the truth last January, when he came back from his military service. His mother, formerly a Catholic, informed him that she no longer belongs to the Catholic Church but is now studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses and attending their congregational meetings. The son was very much pleased and expressed his desire to attend one of these meetings, and so he did. He has never missed any meeting since and he has become a very good and regular publisher, engaging in all features of the field service and giving nice talks at the service meetings and the theocratic ministry school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Patience and theocratic tact are greatly rewarded in Jehovah’s service, especially here in Turkey. An Armenian lady and her two daughters were contacted by a brother in the door-to-door work. The return call was assigned to an Armenian pioneer sister. The latter did not find any great interest shown, but she tactfully kept calling on them from time to time. As they admitted later, it was because they were ashamed to turn her out that they were receiving her every time. But after some calls, the older daughter realized that the information given them from the Bible was really interesting and thus, when the suggestion was made for a regular Bible study, she did not decline. Soon the younger sister and the mother too started progressing, despite the accusations they were hearing from the world. All three were happy to dedicate their lives in doing God’s will, now so dear to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although most of the brothers here in Turkey engage in the door-to-door work, no one forgets the occasional work either, which brought very good results during last year. Outstanding is the case of a dentist brother and his wife. He witnesses to all his customers without exception, no matter what religion or nationality they belong to. He is sowing in abundance, so he is also reaping in abundance. His wife, who became interested in the truth just a year ago and was baptized last summer, also shares in friendly giving with him the best remedy for all pains, the Kingdom message. Thus Jehovah has blessed them richly, as seven of the persons to whom they originally witnessed (among whom two are Jews) have taken their stand with the New World society and dedicated their lives to Jehovah through immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Twelve brothers and sisters of four different nationalities had the privilege of attending some of the European “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies. With the exception of one, all the others had for the first time in their life the opportunity to attend a Christian assembly and they were overjoyed by the happy experience they had to associate with brothers and sisters from all over the world and notice the spirit of love and unity predominating in the New World society.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">On the island of Guadeloupe there has been a splendid increase in the gathering together of the other sheep. It is certainly a wonderful privilege to gather together those who will have the opportunity of living in the new world. To see the gradual growth of the New World society on these small islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique is encouraging to every one of Jehovah’s witnesses. There is a graduate of Gilead looking after the work in these two places and he sends in some interesting experiences of what is going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year efforts were made to reach parts of the island where the good news had not been preached for years. There are no fruits yet, but we know that the laborer must persevere before reaping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Visiting a small congregation in the country, I was invited to call on a girl showing good interest in the truth. She was a Catholic ‘child of Mary,’ but spiritual famine is great in Christendom and she conceived the desire to know more of God by going to the Bible. She asked the priest for his own Bible and she started reading. When I visited her the questions were many. First, what about the burning hell? Reading for herself </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">the Catholic Bible, she was really astonished to learn that there is no such place like that, even to the point that the thought of burning sons and daughters by fire never came into Jehovah’s mind. And now, is not St. Peter Jesus’ successor? Should the Christians observe a particular day? What do you say on the matter of cross worship? Soon the day was over, but not her questions. Three more hours the next day were spent with good results in establishing that Mary had other children besides Jesus, that there is but one mediator between God and men, and some other elementary truths, the whole discussion being rounded out by dealing with the destiny of the earth and the hope of a new world of righteousness. She gladly accepted the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font5"> and since then continues to receive the waters of truth, having stopped attending the mass but begun to share in the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine has been a very good help in the work. People usually dislike reading, but </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">appeals to them. Some already have the same appreciation as that man who exclaimed: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazine? but that is my favorite paper!” A subscriber made compliments for the reliable and interesting news published under the “Watching the World” heading. On Magazine Day a man told a publisher he had no interest in religion, but that good articles on distant lands and morals matters as published in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">were his delight. He added: “Your magazine is truly wonderful. Would it be possible to subscribe?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">People here love the Bible and often when they know that one of Jehovah’s witnesses is in the neighborhood they long for his visit. They will usually invite the publisher in and when he leaves they will say: “Don’t lose the way!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Almost everyone cares for religion here. But sometimes it will perplex one to see several organizations claiming to be the true religion; still no reason to give up, one has to find out! A lady called a sister on the street and arranged with her to visit her daughter who heard about Jehovah’s witnesses at the lyceum. The daughter showed good interest and at once acquired a Bible and three bound books. She requested too an interview between the publisher and a “father” in order to find out why the church teachings are different from the ones set forth in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A marked event was the first assembly held at the end of May. Fifteen brothers came over from Guadeloupe and a full week of theocratic activities was enjoyed to the full with fifty-five attending the public discourse on Sunday afternoon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It was just eleven years ago that reports began to come to the Society from Guatemala. Then there were two congregational publishers and one pioneer. Since then a number of missionaries have been sent to the country. Now there are twenty-one working in various cities, and these along with the congregation publishers are having very happifying experiences. Jehovah’s witnesses still have a great deal to do in Guatemala and they are trying hard to accomplish the work. The branch servant tells us some of the interesting experiences that have taken place, and which warm the hearts of the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many times Jehovah’s witnesses have gone from door to door seeking Jehovah’s other sheep, but sometimes it also works the other way around. An elderly pioneer sister in Tiquisate was busy with her morning house cleaning when a knock came at the door. On answering, a woman with a baby in her arms asked: “I beg your pardon, do Jehovah’s witnesses live here?” &quot;Yes,” the pioneer answered, “may I help you?” “At last,” the woman smiled, “I have been going from door to door looking for you.” It seems a man loaned her a booklet and a copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(La Atalaya)</span><span class="font5"> and she wanted to learn more about the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. She did not even live in the same town, but she had heard that there were some of Jehovah’s witnesses in Tiquisate and so made the journey there to find them. The pioneer started a home Bible study with her, and in about a month the woman was baptized and became a regular publisher. Though she is the only publisher in her town, she regularly goes from house to house offering the Kingdom message. She has two babies to care for, but, with one on her back and the other in her arms, she still goes in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Guatemala City a guard at the national penitentiary on his day off one Sunday happened to wander into the Palmita Unit Kingdom Hall while a public lecture was being presented. He was warmly greeted and listened with interest to the information being presented. An alert brother, noting that he was newly interested, after the meeting arranged to start a study with him. For the guard to have the study and attend the local meetings was a bit difficult, however, for guards get only one day off a month, but whenever it was possible he attended. Because his work in the penitentiary did not permit him to attend meetings, he quit his job, even though this meant that he would have to learn another trade. The brother who studied with him taught him the trade of a cobbler, and in about six months’ time after hearing his first lecture the newly found sheep began publishing. The profession of a cobbler is perhaps one of the poorest paid jobs in Guatemala, but the brother began saving what meager earnings he could for a definite goal. Finally he was ready, and with great joy he filled out a vacation pioneer application, requesting to go into one of the northern states and witness to his family and friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While working a small village a pioneer learned that two Pentecostal ministers were reading the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font5"> Looking about, he soon discovered the two preachers. He gave them an explanation on how they could study the book with their Bibles. They listened eagerly and were so pleased with the explanation that they invited the pioneer to give a talk that night at the church. A short while later the people met in the small building and the two preachers said: “You have the church at your disposition.” Several weeks later the pioneer got a letter from the two preachers asking him to visit them again, because they wanted to learn some more. On returning the pioneer found a new chapel, because some of the local “patriots” thought some Communists were using the building to hold subversive meetings, so they burned it to the ground. That night arrangements were made for the talk, “Will Christ Come Again?” One of the preachers got up and addressed the people saying: “Brothers, please listen very closely to what the speaker is about to say.” After the talk was over, he arose and said, “You have heard how Christ returns, and so clear that it couldn’t be made any simpler. In the past I have been with you, but in the future I shall be with Jehovah’s witnesses.” This courageous stand of course brought opposition to them but the two express their desire to learn more and be good witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The day after the Memorial a Protestant pastor who had taught in an evangelical seminary said: “I was at your meeting last night. I know that many people say that you Jehovah’s witnesses deny Christ, but I know now that those who say that are mistaken. You preach Christ as it is in the Bible, and the Lord’s supper was very impressive.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark245"></a>HAITI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">3,304,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 232</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brothers in Haiti were very grateful for the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is “the Light of the World”?</span><span class="font6"> It gave them a wonderful opportunity to get the message of the Kingdom distributed all over the island with great haste and with very good results. The missionaries and the mature congregational publishers have a real task in helping new ones come into the truth. The righteous principles set down in God’s Word for all of his faithful servants to follow are truly a high standard, and it takes real courage on the part of anyone, and especially Haitians, to take such a stand and come into Jehovah’s organization. But progress is being made, the witness is being given and the branch servant reports some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One brother took twenty-one </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is “the Light of the World&quot;?</span><span class="font5"> booklets to his job at the sugar mill and placed them all on contributions before he got to the entry gate. In the next two days he placed thirty more similarly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An Arab, who had just legalized his marriage, said his isolated town was the hardest territory in Haiti. We explained the booklet work. “Like to start preaching right here in town?” He was ready in fifteen minutes and placed twenty. A formerly negligent publisher got swept in on the campaign, placed thirty in a day and has been regular ever since. One sister placed forty and asked for one hundred more. “You never published anything like that,” said a Protestant, “give me six more.” In some houses five and more copies were placed. Local publishers placed more booklets during the campaign than they generally place in a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The special pioneer at Gonaives had a new publisher who desired to marry, but his Baptist friends threatened not to attend if it was a witness’ ceremony. The pioneer sent out an S.O.S. to Port-au-Prince, calling the brothers to support the wedding. A local brother was to take his station wagon full of publishers along with the projection equipment. A Cap-Haltien missionary was to come down to perform the marriage and deliver a public talk. A torrential downpour hit him en route. He churned through water for sixteen kilometers on his motorcycle, seeing cactus plants and other debris carried along by the flood. He arrived on time for the ceremony. The publishers held a miniature assembly, with forty-eight persons attending the afternoon lecture. On seeing all the brothers present, even the Baptists came to the wedding, increasing the attendance to 200. By this time the film showing had been well advertised. A sound truck gave us free publicity. The car driver had to put on the film himself after a brief lesson in the capital. At Gonaives he handled both the script and projector, something that a missionary had not yet done. This open-air showing was attended by 1,127! The pioneer now requests congregation organization. In August he reported seven publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How many have heard how howling hurricane “Hazel” had hit Haiti leaving hundreds of helpless Haitians hurt, hopeless, hungry and homeless? We report that no brothers suffered loss. Two of us packed to sail to Jeremie, a town hard hit by the cyclone. Nearly all roofs were damaged and many buildings destroyed. Especially pitiful were the peasants who roamed the streets begging. We planned two showings of “The New World Society in Action.” The whole town came to our aid. Sound equipment, generator current, police aid, authorization and many other things necessary to successful showings were offered free of charge. The main street of Jeremie was closed so that the film could be seen right in the middle of town. One thousand people flooded the street and fifteen hundred came to the second showing at the military post. After seven eight-hour days in the service, we placed 500 magazines, thirty subscriptions but only eight books. A Catholic doctor and his family received us at their home, keeping us in a room that had a new roof since the hurricane, giving us meals fit for kings and, when offered reimbursement, they said: “No thanks, we have not been ‘Hazeled.’ ” We gave them the latest literature along with a copy of the Catholic Crampon Bible. May Jehovah bless them with a knowledge of the truth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this very moment, while typing this report in final form, radio station P.B.S., Petionville, is broadcasting the chapter on “Satan the Devil” from the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font5"> The voice is none other than that of the manager of the station. Since the publisher caring for the program fell sick, he still broadcasts the truth, reading from the publications himself.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark246"></a>HAWAII</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population Highest Number of Ministers Preaching 490,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 102 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955 : 948</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The greatest treasure that anyone could possess now or in the future is that of serving the Most High God of the universe. Now we can do it as one of Jehovah’s witnesses in these last days. In Hawaii there are many who are going forth serving Jehovah faithfully, and when they have seen difficulty or uncleanness within the organization they have been strong enough to clean it out, and Jehovah has blessed them. There is greater maturity in the New World society in Hawaii now, and this has been helped greatly by the fulltime circuit servant who continually moves from congregation to congregation. The brothers look forward to these regular visits of the Society’s representative, because all of them want to be truly theocratic and preach the good news in the very best way they can. They want to be adequately qualified ministers. The branch servant sends in some very interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While our average number of publishers did not show the high increase as in previous years it is felt that it really presents a truer picture of publishers. The practice of the assistant congregation servant’s telephoning each publisher on the last day of the month and saying, “Didn’t you put in at least one hour this month?” and then making out a report slip for the publisher on the other end of the line has been stopped and now we have the reports of the publishers who actually go in the field and report their own time. Thus, each one is bearing his own load of responsibility, and is learning that being a part of Jehovah’s organization is not like being a member of just any religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Isolated territory was opened up this past year with the adding of special pioneers to our ranks. Being a special pioneer in isolated territory requires much faith and reliance on Jehovah. However, it is not without his blessing, as is noted in a letter from two special pioneer brothers who accepted an assignment on an isolated island. “While working from house to house we met a member of a family who manifested so much interest that a study was arranged on the first visit. After finishing that territory we went on to another and there we met an entire family that showed equal interest and we arranged for a discussion. During the discussion we answered their many questions and when we finished we were thrilled beyond words when one of them said, ‘Do you mean that we can learn the Bible like you two?’ It certainly made our hearts glad. A happiness that cannot be expressed in words, a happiness that only Jehovah can give. We really can say that this work is one that we will never trade with anyone for the work he might have outside Jehovah’s organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During eight months of the service year reports were received from a brother in the armed forces stationed on Midway Island. This island is a part of the Hawaiian chain located about 1,200 miles northwest of the main group of Hawaiian islands, thus making it very isolated. Each month as he would send in his report, the branch office would write him a few lines of encouragement and send the latest </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. </span><span class="font5">When one is isolated from the New World society, contact with the organization is appreciated, as expressed by this brother in a recent letter to the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Dear Brothers: It was very nice to hear from you once again, as it always is. I always look forward to your letters for I feel so much closer to the Society when I receive them.” During the year this brother was able to conduct two studies with the transit personnel by using the “out of season” method of preaching, which is the only way one can preach within a military establishment. He enjoyed many interesting discussions with men of all rank in the military, especially his commanding officer, who commended him for sticking to his faith and saluting neither the flag nor him. His concluding paragraph in this letter leaves us with a most wonderful thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“All in all I can now have a better understanding of how our brothers and sisters feel by being able to do pioneer work all over the world, and what a joyous life they live by being able to devote their complete time to Jehovah God and his wonderful work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Keeping the organization clean certainly has the blessing of Jehovah as shown in the case of a newly formed congregation of twenty-six publishers. Two months after this congregation was formed it was found that the congregation servant and a sister were not conducting themselves properly. We felt that dis-fellowshiping them would certainly impede the progress of the congregation. However, as we realized that chasteness was of utmost importance, both were dis-fellowshiped. Instead of slowing the congregation down It is one congregation that made steady increases each month of one to two publishers, finally reaching a peak for the year of forty-one publishers, or a fifty-eight per cent increase.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark247"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HONDURAS Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1,608,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1946: 29 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 447</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus made the statement that the harvest is great but the workers are few. This is true concerning the country of Honduras. Jehovah’s spirit, however, makes up for so much because it is the active force of God that acts upon his people to make them do things that one would think impossible otherwise. With fewer publishers in the field this year the brothers put in 15,000 more hours, gained more subscriptions, placed more individual magazines, and there was a splendid increase in back-calls and Bible studies. The faithful brothers in Honduras had something to overcome. It was the bad name that the former branch servant brought upon the work and the corruption he tried to bring into Jehovah’s organization. While this disturbance kept the work at a standstill, with a slight decrease in the number of those going out in the work, those who were faithful to God depended on his spirit to give them strength to aid them to give even a greater witness to overcome the harm done by one man. The present branch servant’s report is very interesting and all will enjoy it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The past service year saw many changes in organization here in Honduras, and at the same time a spreading of the work in other areas. Something was wrong here, as the country was in a troubled condition politically speaking and many people were without work. Amid all this a visit from Brother Knorr was anticipated, and plans were set forth for three grand assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other trouble was brewing and about to boil over, and this within Jehovah’s organization. It was an unclean, immoral condition at the top level of the organization here in Honduras. The branch servant was committing fornication with a known prostitute. This was going on for many months, as he later confessed. He was disfellowshiped and returned to the States. This was just before Brother Knorr’s visit here to Honduras.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Brother Knorr arrived political trouble developed, and the government in control banned all public meetings. But they allowed us to have meetings in our Kingdom Halls, so the assemblies planned were carried on, but not many attended the meetings. Much wonderful counsel and instruction was given to us by Brother Knorr. He had to appoint a new branch servant. Also he authorized putting on more native special pioneers and opening a new missionary home in new territory. Good counsel was given to continue on faithfully no matter what others may do. This was greatly appreciated, and the missionaries were determined to continue on faithfully and to push clean worship here in Honduras.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another missionary reports how a young man learned the truth, but was bitterly opposed by his father. Not wanting to make trouble, he dropped the studies and attending meetings. But the truth is too strong and fiery just to be dropped by a sincere person. The patience of the missionaries paid off. An assembly in that city saw the need of a large sign. They went to his father’s store to purchase the cloth. He waited on them though the father tried to take over the sale when he saw whom he was waiting on. The son refused to let him do so and even said he would paint the sign for them. At the missionary home he made the statement that he knew who his real friends were. He told them he was going to New York, where he could serve Jehovah without so much interference, even making the statement that he looked forward to pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They have since received letters from him that he is doing well and hopes soon to enter the pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another missionary writes: “After trying to secure time on the radio for our programs without success, we gave up. Then suddenly we had a regular program without our knowledge. It happened like this. The radio station manager put on an hour program called ‘The Catholic Hour’ at noontime each day; fifteen minutes of this was to be devoted to religious instruction from the Bible or Bible literature. When he sent for the local priest to take part, he refused, saying he was busy. Another try was made this time to secure a Catholic Bible to be read for that time. The priest refused, saying that he was not interested in Bible education and if they wanted to know about the Bible they would have to come to him. This made the station manager angry and he said that if the priest did not care he knew who did. He secured some literature from the witnesses and began to read it over the air. When told about it, the missionaries contacted him and gave him material to use, ‘Things People Are Thinking About.’ The priest soon objected to this, but the man said: ‘You had your chance and refused.’ He is determined to continue the programs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good use is being made of the film “The New World Society in Action.” In one town after only two hours of giving out the leaflets and with the local priest telling the people that it was a prohibited film for Catholics we still had 417 who came to see the film and there was much talk the following few days by the people in this isolated place. This trip took nine hours by train and no witnesses at all live in the town. It is being worked only by the circuit servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This year saw us branching out into smaller towns with our circuit assemblies, into towns where publishers are few and congregations small. The people are amazed at the size of the organization, one remark being that the witnesses are all over the place. Others said: “You people should come back real soon.” One coming up to a witness in street work asked: “Can you come to my house and study with me?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HONG KONG</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2,500,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1949: 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 104</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark248"></a><span class="font6">Hong Kong is a beehive of activity. Great masses of people are coming into the country. This territory has turned into an industrial center, as well as a great port for the crossroads of shipping. In this Chinese community ten missionaries and other graduates of Gilead looking after branch activity are diligently serving the interests of the Kingdom and gathering together the people of good will. Now they have a number of congregation publishers, and their message is being felt in this land. It is a pleasure to set out here some of the experiences of our brothers in Hong Kong where all kinds of religions have settled to gain converts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the first Gilead graduates landed here in 1949 a big building program was getting under way, but six years later building activity is stronger than ever. Persons who were familiar with Kowloon a few short years ago cannot find their way around in some parts today. Perhaps the most amazing advance has been made by the government in housing thousands of former squatters in massive six- and seven-story blocks; true, the accommodation is a mere concrete room per family, but it is an enormous advance over the unhygienic and squalid squatter areas where the terrifying fire hazard hung overhead day and night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hong Kong is well known as a hive of activity, but recently it was described as a hive of evangelism. All of Christendom’s missionary organizations have a foothold here, being denied access to the mainland. Many different Bible correspondence courses are on offer and youth is appealed to in many ways, particularly through the lure of a good education at school. To solve the problem of the dearth of schools, the government makes liberal grants of money and land to religious bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the midst of all the bustle Jehovah’s witnesses during this past service year have come to the forefront and are now well known in the community. This was because of the vigorous drive spurred by the Society during April when, for the first time, we had a new pubheation released in Chinese and English at the same time. It was a busy time for us, as we had the big April 3 talk, the Memorial and a circuit assembly all following one another. One paper gave us big headlines and a full-column summary of the talk on the main local-news page; indeed the press was very kind to us in covering the Memorial and the circuit assembly. It was a joy to us to be right in line with the brothers worldwide, and the impetus landed us a new peak—one above our goal of a hundred publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Five hundred and five letters were sent out by the brothers to the local clergy, and twenty-four editors also received copies of the special booklet and a letter. One Chinese pastor wrote back to say he recognized he was backing the false kind of religion and wanted to quit, but posed the problem of what to do for a living in the meantime. A brother furnished him with more spiritual food to strengthen him and we await the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The local brand of Chinese religion remains much of a puzzle. The normal family just follows the sequence of festivals and performs a perfunctory routine of joss burning and pouring out an occasional drink offering, but it is more of an ingrained habit than any knowledge of principles or doctrine. Only very occasionally do you come across a person who professes any ability to expound the tenets of Buddhism. Most householders brand us as “Jesus” or “preachers” and associate us with some church or other. More and more we associate ourselves with the announcement of the new world, and the booklets </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Basis for Belief in a New World</span><span class="font5"> and also the one on Evolution have proved a great aid in switching attention to this engrossing subject. Publishers have found it much easier to build up a sermon on these publications, and so our booklet placements soared this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the course of witnessing we have on occasions been able to testify at Buddhist temples and institutes. It is difficult to establish any down-to-earth contact as a basis for discussing the truth. One of the missionary sisters visited a Buddhist nunnery and tried hard to get some concrete explanation of belief and ritual as a means of making an opening for presenting the Kingdom message and its New World hopes. She was directed to one of the heads of the Hong Kong Buddhist movement and was able to have two good discussions with him. He was kindly and rather taken with the demeanor of Jehovah’s witnesses in their approach. He accepted a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font5"> One of the candidates for immersion at one assembly in August came from a Buddhist family; and a young man, formerly a Buddhist, was a vacation pioneer this summer,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is rather sobering to note that, while we have again made an advance, our records exhibit a considerable turnover in publishers; quite a number, including young dedicated publishers, have given up, seemingly unable to stand under the strain of sustained witnessing and attendance at meetings while facing opposition or keeping up with a secular job. We were confident that some of these would by now have taken a good part of the load of duties, but it seems that the missionaries must still be heavily depended upon in carrying the congregations. Happily the tough core continues to grow, minds are turning to the pioneer call and three more have launched out as general pioneers beginning this new service year. Our hearts are with them and we shall aid all we can.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark249"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HUNGARY Population 9,500,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pressure has been great upon Jehovah’s witnesses in Hungary during the past year. The charge is laid against them that they are working for Wall Street in the United States, that we teach that it is wrong for anyone to give a blood transfusion, and, therefore, we are working against the state in case of war when soldiers need blood. It is reported that the Communists made the offer that we could publish the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> magazine in Hungary if we would publish two pages of Communist propaganda. Of course, false religion gets along with communism because they will do such things. They would be happy to make a deal with the Devil in order to keep alive, but their reward will be death. The New World society in Hungary, it is joyful to report, has had an increase in the number of publishers during the year. There are so many persons in that country sighing and crying because of the abominations that rest upon them that when the truth comes along they want to hear it. But it certainly takes determination to stand for it because they know in time they will end up in prison or a work camp. Many of our brothers are suffering torture at the hands of the Communists; some having served terms in work camps have been let free, only to be soon rounded up again and given another sentence. The reports that have come out of Hungary are interesting, and they will give you a little idea of the joy the brothers have and the zeal they show despite the hard times they endure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The service year began with much joy and activity. We received the yeartext and understood that we were ‘not to be afraid of evil tidings,’ but that we could ‘trust in Jehovah’ at all times. Then we received the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font5"> and you can imagine what great joy it was for us to read about the activity and the increase going on throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We also introduced the new program for the ministry school (reading the Bible) and the brothers welcomed this with great enthusiasm, for we work only with the Bible. All this was a great encouragement for the brothers and they began to preach again from house to house and from door to door. The number of publishers increased from month to month. How happy were our eyes to see that Jehovah so richly blessed our work and gave us such increase so that we could report for April: “We made it!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the brothers who had been imprisoned reports that every morning, before they would go down into the mine, they discussed the daily text, prayed together and had breakfast together. After working eight hours they could move freely within the camp. They always reported their activity every month. Every brother had his Bible and some literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the larger cities the brothers were able to meet in their Kingdom Halls, these meetings being always attended by spies of the secret police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Imre Nagy was prime minister in Hungary from June, 1953, till the beginning of 1955. Under his government the sorely oppressed Hungarian people got a little relief, but this was not to the liking of the Devil and so Nagy had to quit and the Communist iron hand got as heavy as it had been before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This reverse is regrettable after the work had progressed so well during the first seven months of the service year. But then we know that Satan is making war against Jehovah’s witnesses and “will keep on throwing some of you into prison that you may be fully put to the test.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark250"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">357,000,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 445 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 973</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In ten years’ time the Society has doubled its publishers in India. This has been hard going. But as long as there are people of good will there it is the determination of Jehovah’s witnesses to find them. Recently there has been a ban placed on one of our books, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font6"> This book is not suitable to the government for general distribution. Other restrictions have been placed on foreign missionaries coming into the country. They do not object too much to social education and medical work being done, but coming in and speaking to the Hindus about Christianity is not at all pleasing to the officials there. But the government stands by its constitutional guarantee and allows freedom of worship for all. We are glad of this and our work continues. Some Hindus and others are finding that the truth is the only hope for mankind, but in taking a stand they meet up with much local opposition. The branch servant’s report is very interesting in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We much enjoyed seeing the film “The New World Society in Action.” We received our copy only at the beginning of the service year, but it has been widely shown to an aggregate audience of more than 15,000. The brothers certainly benefited by it. It enlarged their vision and appreciation of the Society’s activities and efficient organization. It is difficult to estimate the effect it had upon the general public who saw it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The December 25 holiday campaign was something worthy of note. Some had planned on making it a day’s outing and picnic, but when the letter was circulated suggesting tnat the day be devoted to Kingdom preaching the response was immediate, and most of them had a most enjoyable time. One congregation servant wrote: “We had more than a usual turn out for the ‘holiday drive’ and excellent success in the field. During the whole of September we placed 163 magazines, but on December 25 we placed 161 in one day! A girl of thirteen, who had not been very successful in the field, was rejoicing at having placed twelve magazines and taken one subscription on December 25.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year we had an outstanding case of a young Hindu man of a quite influential family suffering the bitterest persecution from his parents because of his stand for Jehovah and true Christianity. He had been invited to a tea party. There he met one of our publishers, a schoolteacher. She talked to him about the New World hope of life. He was thrilled and began to study the Bible. He attended the meetings at the local Kingdom Hall and it was not long before he was active in the field. One day his father spotted him on the street wearing a placard advertising a public meeting. When the young man got home that night his father said nothing until he went to bed. In the bedroom his father demanded an apology for having disgraced the family. The son upheld his beliefs and his desire to serve Jehovah, whereupon his father told him to get out of the house at once! At eleven o’clock at night, clad only in his pajamas, the lad went out into the street. The night was chilly, for It was March, and the lad wondered what to do. He made his way to the home of a brother and found his car left outside in the back garden with the doors unlocked. He was afraid of rousing the family, for it was now 2 a.m., so he crept inside the car and tried to go to sleep. He waited there until someone opened the door the next morning and he told his story. The brother took him in, gave him some clothes to wear and something to eat and allowed him to stay there until he found his own shelter. All that was six months ago and now, having completed six months from the date of his baptism, he has applied for enrollment as a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We now have seven pioneers who previously were Hindus. The fact remains, however, that the majority of Jehovah’s witnesses in India were previously affiliated with nominal Christianity. Pride is the great barrier to the mass of the non-Christian communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The most substantial progress of the year has been in the vernacular field, and that in spite of our not having much literature to offer the people in their own languages. Groups are being organized within several of the congregations, where studies are held in their local tongue if they have no knowledge of English. The largest congregation in India is the Kanarese-speaking unit in Bombay city. They have </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> published in Kanarese, but as this is only a monthly publication they naturally miss many of the articles published in the English magazine. In order to keep as up to date as possible their congregation servant meets with his group once a week in a motor garage owned by one of the brothers and gives them the main points of all the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> articles not published in their Kanarese </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the congregations in India are now getting into line with the training program. The use of the Bible at the doors in giving short sermons is being practiced to an ever-increasing degree, even to the Hindu communities, and we find this approach generally satisfactory. We find it best to let the Hindus know from the start that we are engaged in a Bible-education work, making it clear that it is not &quot;religious propaganda” but rather a message of hope for people who love right principles and want to know more concerning God and his purpose for mankind. There is not much difficulty in getting Hindus to listen to that. It is when they see that the message conflicts with their philosophies that they stumble and lose interest.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark251"></a>INDONESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">“This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations,” and that includes Indonesia. The work has made good advance in this section of the world, in the various islands of the Indonesian territory. It is a pleasure to report on the islands of Java, Sulawesi, Sumatra and Timor. The missionaries and publishers are having very interesting experiences, and what they are doing to advance Kingdom interests our brothers can do in all parts of the world, since all of the New World society work alike. The branch servant in Djakarta sends in an interesting report and excerpts are taken from what he writes on each of the islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">JAVA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">50,000,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1047: 13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 218</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The congregation publishers of the well-established Surabaja congregation are making organized efforts to care for the isolated interest that is springing up in many villages of East. In one group of villages, where the main feature of social life seems to center around divided Pentecostal groups, the Chinese temple and the religion of Islam, considerable interest has been sifted out and regular study groups established. Every Saturday afternoon several brothers leave by car and travel fifty miles over rough road to conduct these studies, the car driver dropping them off at their respective study groups and picking them up again in the evening. Often they arrive back home at midnight. Missionaries, Bible lectures and film showings attract multitudes of people in the villages, but eventually the sharp truths of the living Word cut off those who are seeking only sensation or something new, isolating those who really love Jehovah into compact groups, where concentrated study will enable them to make their minds over for New World living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work throughout these islands has been greatly aided by our new printed edition of the Indonesian </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> that replaces our previous mimeographed issue. Although it has been printed for only the last three months of the service year, the results have been excellent, as shown by the greatly increased distribution of magazines and by our obtaining 2,309 subscriptions for all Indonesia, to compare with 1,443 subscriptions last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One brother who works in a government ministry in Djakarta has had good success in speaking to persons he meets in the course of his work. By never missing an opportunity to give a witness, he has acquainted many persons, including many from other islands, with the truth. In the last five years eight persons have become publishers as a result of his casual witnessing to fellow employees and business contacts. One day, when assisting a woman to put her bicycle in a rack, the brother offered her a booklet that, he told her, contained a comforting message. From this brief contact her interest was aroused, and after subsequent back-calls a study was arranged, and the person eventually became a publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Indonesia, as in other parts of the world, there is a great need for more pioneers. Some allow small obstacles to prevent their beginning or continuing in this treasured service. One sister in Djakarta, a housewife pioneer, had a baby at the beginning of the service year, but was determined to stay in the pioneer service. While not able to reach her hour quota for the first few months, she was able to reach almost the annual quota by the end of the service year. Co-operation between husband and wife makes it possible for the sister to share in the house-to-house work, and when it comes to home Bible studies, well, the baby just goes right along with her mother. It certainly shows that many more could pioneer if thought and planning were given the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SULAWESI</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark252"></a><span class="font5">Sulawesi is that island lying south of the Philippines between Borneo and New Guinea, previously known as Celebes, and looking like a starfish with one tentacle missing. It is on the northern arm of this island, near the extreme tip, that we find the Minahasa district of about 500,000 people, all of whom claim to be Christian. Here it is that Jehovah’s witnesses have been working for the last five years, and, although progress has been slow, some brothers are demonstrating that with zeal and faith they can accomplish a work as good as or better than the missionaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through good management and the co-operation of his wife, the congregation servant at Manado has remained in the pioneer work for many years. Now that their child has finished school, his wife joined him in full-time service, and both were very happy to receive the privilege of becoming special pioneers this year. The Manado congregation is becoming stronger and soon this brother will be able to move out into other places that so badly need attention in Sulawesi. They show the typical pioneer spirit in offering to accept assignments in other territories to open up the work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark253"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark254"></a>SUMATRA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">8,000,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1954: 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The preaching of the good news has progressed well in Sumatra over the last year. In the city of Palembang in South Sumatra, it is drawing not only the wrath of the clergy but also men of good will from all ranks. The secretary of the regency was immediately attracted by the message and he with his family embraced the truth. That a person in such a responsible position has become one of Jehovah’s witnesses commands a respectful hearing ear and arouses investigation, as he engages in the house-to-house work. His home now serves as the Kingdom Hall for the Palembang congregation. The clergy and elders of the Protestant church were so enraged over the progress of the work there that they wrote the congregation servant, advising him to confine his activities to the heathen and threatening him that, if he did not cease visiting Protestants, something would happen to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even in Padang, where people are strongly Islamic, appreciation is shown by many. The director of a school, a Moslem, remarked to the circuit servant: “You are the first Christian who has called on me to present his religion frankly. I appreciate your call and want to investigate your literature.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Pentecostal lay preacher in Padang, after several contacts with Jehovah’s witnesses, closed his hall to Pentecostal meetings and took down the name board because the members and elders were always quarreling. When the elders protested he said: “The Bible does not teach us to belong to some sect, it just tells us to witness to Jehovah.” There are indications he may soon reopen his hall for Bible meetings with a different name board this time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark255"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark256"></a>TIMOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population Highest Number of Ministers Preaching 400,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1953: 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955 : 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the last month of the service year the circuit servant visited the island for a month and was able to strengthen and encourage the interested persons there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most of the Timorese are “Christian” and have a sect of their own called “Masehi Tulen” or “True Christianity.” In reality it is an offshoot of the Protestant church, and the people find it hard to break away from the church as it is an essential part of their society and way of life. Nevertheless, Jehovah’s sheep are being located here and helped to learn the way to life. We pray that Jehovah will bless with increase the seed that has been sown in Timor during this past year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark257"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population Highest Number of Ministers Preaching 47,220,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1946: 120 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955 : 3,238</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Vatican has long insisted that Italy belongs to her. She has never liked any other religion to come in there and preach to her Catholic population. In order for Jehovah’s witnesses to continue with their service they must be as wise as serpents, and, of course, they are as harmless as doves. They do not carry on street work, distribute handbills or cause any outward demonstration, but they do go from house to house preaching privately to the people and showing them what the Bible teaches. They use the Catholic Bible in doing this. There have been some arrests, but on the whole the average policeman does not bother one preaching the good news unless he is instigated to do so by the clergy. In the meantime the work goes ahead by leaps and bounds and Italy reached five peaks during the year. The climax of the year came in the wonderful “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly held in Rome itself. While the enemies of Jehovah may be strongly entrenched in Rome and all of Italy, and though they did try to stop the assembly, the invincible power of Jehovah was forcefully shown and the assembly majestically went on as planned. Truly, it was the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. The branch servant gives us a report on the progress of the work in Italy and in Libya. Excerpts from his report are printed here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have much interest in isolated areas and joyfully we report that seventeen new congregations were formed. But we are only scratching the surface. To care better for this interest Brother Knorr authorized us to have twenty-five special pioneers and at the end of the service year the number was to be increased to fifty. We are trying to take care of the isolated interest as well as possible by sending letters from the branch office and arranging to have the circuit servants visit them. Many have started to preach as a result of this attention. Yet we are constantly receiving letters from the isolated pleading with us not to abandon them and to visit or write them more often. Four more circuit servants have been added in order to care for this interest, so that now the isolated ones and the congregations are being visited by a circuit servant every four months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An idea of the prospects in regard to the isolated interest is given by a letter received from a group of such isolated, that they had built a Kingdom Hall to accommodate sixty persons and that they had requested permission from the police to use it as a church! Another letter from a group of isolated asked about information on building a hall. As a result of caring for still another group of isolated a new congregation was formed and they have reached a peak of forty-one publishers! These now have another group of interested persons that they are caring for, and even these will shortly be organized as a congregation. Though we have done well this year the word from the circuit servants is, “Wait till next year!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These increases and blessings have been realized by much hard work and perseverance on the part of the brothers. An example is that of a twenty-two-year-old sister who was beaten on her arms, legs and back by her mother with a rolling pin. So furious was her mother that she pulled out three clumps of hair from the back of the sister’s head! All this because she had attended an assembly. The mother screamed: “You are not even crying for the beating you are getting.” The sister replied: “I was never so happy in my life as when I attended the assembly, for I received the spiritual strength and joy that has helped me to stand this beating!” She was then forbidden to have the Bible and Bible literature and to attend meetings. Her answer was: “If this would have happened a year ago, probably I would have done as you say, but now I see things differently and I am going to serve Jehovah all the more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One missionary expresses the joy of serving in Italy this way: “Many are the experiences a pioneer missionary could relate. But most of the interested ones we find do not come into the truth through spectacular ways but rather through the regular house-to-house work and Bible study method, helping them with their problems till maturity. Our joy is then faithfully serving Jehovah together. At the Rome assembly we were happy to meet the fourth generation. That is, we had a study with a young man who began to publish. He in turn studied with another young man who readily accepted the truth. This second one studied with a third young man who was baptized in Rome. This third young man is now studying with a fourth young man who was also at the Rome assembly. All are happy publishers and so are we.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The outstanding event of the year and in modern Italian theocratic history was without a doubt the successful international assembly of August 5-7 held in Rome. We had one of the most beautiful convention buildings of Italy, if not of all Europe. Of white marble and very modernistic design with surrounding parks for the brothers to use, the grounds were ideal for an assembly. Outsiders were amazed to see so many in attendance every day, as during worldly international assemblies held in this building this is never the case after the first day. The peak attendance was 4,531 for the public talk and 387 were baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Five special trains brought mostly American brothers from Paris. Their arrival created much interest in the assembly as this was the largest group of American tourists ever to arrive in Italy at one time. The presence of these brothers and other factors caused the newspapers to give us a good coverage on the assembly. In fact it was the first time we had so much publicity. Very noticeable all over Rome were the badges worn by the brothers, as this was the first time badges have been worn by us in Italy. As a result of the publicity many letters have been received in the branch office from people of good will desiring information about our work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The enthusiasm of the Italian brothers was very noticeable as they thoroughly enjoyed the rare opportunity they had of listening to Brothers Knorr, Franz and other directors of the Society and members of the New York Bethel family. Many were in tears as Brother Franz concluded the assembly with a few words in Italian! This assembly will long be remembered in the hearts of the Italian brothers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This has been a year of great spiritual blessings and also much opposition to the work in Libya. The Catholic clergy have carried on a terrific campaign against the brothers from the pulpits and in the newspapers seeking to arouse opposition to the work. Fearlessly the brothers went ahead with the work taking to heart the words of the yeartext: “He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The police started raiding the homes of the brothers in the city of Tripoli. All Bibles and Bible literature were confiscated. The brothers were given the choice of either stopping the preaching work and being free or facing arrest and trial if they continued to preach. The brothers’ answer to the head of the police was: “We ought to obey God rather than man.” It has also been made known that the executive council has declared “The Society of Jehovah’s Witnesses” illegal in Libya. AJ1 Bibles and Bible literature were confiscated. At this writing none of the brothers have been charged with anything and no legal action has been taken against them in the courts. The police are openly admitting that they have nothing against us and that it is the Catholic clergy who are putting pressure on them to act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though the future is very uncertain in Libya, the brothers are trusting firmly in Jehovah, determined to continue gathering the Lord’s other sheep into the spiritual paradise land of the New World society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark260"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population Highest Number of Ministers Preaching 1,532,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 1,014 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955 : 3,751</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this beautiful island of Jamaica it seems that almost everyone living on the island has heard about Jehovah’s kingdom. On the average there is one publisher for every 400 people living there, and so they are witnessed to quite often. Still hundreds of thousands of them are yet steeped in pagan beliefs, even though they belong to Christendom’s religious organizations. One often wonders just what Christendom has done during all of these years in trying to raise the standard of morality of their congregations or to remove pagan worship. When you analyze Christendom you find she is still pagan. She has not absorbed paganism into Christianity and made it Christian, but the pagans have absorbed so-called “Christendom” and made it pagan. The lives of people in Jamaica prove this point very clearly. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses in Jamaica rejoice in being a part of the New World society. Showings of the film “The New World Society in Action” have helped all to appreciate the unity and harmony of Jehovah’s people regardless of race or color, and many were happily surprised to see the extent and prosperity of the organization. Thousands of brothers as well as many more thousands of persons of good will have been able to see this film and certainly it is doing a good work. At one of the circuit assemblies a woman was attracted by the crowd and came to see what was going on. She came in as the film was being shown and was really impressed with what she saw, for here she saw love in action. Sunday she came back to hear the talk by the district servant. She was sure she had found the truth and joyfully went home to tell her family of her good fortune, but there she met with disappointment, for members of her family, even her own children, ridiculed and made many false charges against Jehovah’s witnesses. It was then that she decided to speak to Jehovah’s witnesses personally and have these charges answered, so back to the assembly grounds she came on Monday morning only to find that the witnesses had gone. She noticed, however, that some men were busily engaged in cleaning and she approached them. Perhaps they could tell her where to find them. She was happy to find that these men were all Jehovah’s witnesses and were anxious to answer her questions. She was jubilant with the answers and said that she was thankful to Jehovah that the new world could be her world, too. A study was arranged and this person of good will is being well looked after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We were certainly happy during the year to receive instructions to appoint more special pioneer ministers. A number were taken from the ranks of the regular pioneers and these are all doing fine work. One congregation has developed and grown rapidly to sixteen publishers through the work of two special pioneer sisters. And these new ones are being trained as mature publishers, really being taught to appreciate Jehovah and his service. One new publisher in this congregation has averaged sixty-one hours and sixteen Bible studies for the service year! She is following the fine example of the special pioneers who have brought her the truth. The circuit servant writes the following: “I greeted this woman who was busily cleaning and she invited us into her home. Our mission was called to her attention and then a witness concerning the Kingdom hope was given. During the course of the discussion the matter of Baal worship was thoroughly covered and it was shown her how the Devil can appear as an angel of light, and was going around the world trying to devour people. She saw that she had really been ensnared and that her Baptist parson had not been able to tell her of these things. She was informed that her only defense was accurate knowledge and the true worship of Jehovah God. Literature was placed with her and a study was arranged for. “But what about these Baal symbols?’’ I asked her. “Do whatever your spirit tells you,” she said, and this I joyfully did. I tore down the “sacred poles” and broke them in pieces, throwing away the “drink offerings” and removing every trace of Baalism from that home.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The small group of Jehovah’s witnesses in Japan still have a very great work to do in order to reach the millions of people living on those islands. Japan today is recovering some of her national pride. It is looking after its own affairs again to a greater extent, and these past years have given the people an opportunity to do a great deal of thinking and many are now reasoning along the lines of the truth. As the ministers of God reach them and talk to them, this change is taking place. For many to break away from their old Buddhist beliefs and ancestor worship is hard and brings many trials. To observe the determination on the part of our Japanese brothers to take their stand brings joy to our hearts and should make every one of Jehovah’s witnesses more zealous. The report of the branch servant covers the islands of Japan, Okinawa and Taiwan, and all of it is joyful news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each autumn brings </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">higan,</span><span class="font5"> a special week for worshiping the ancestors and visiting the ancestral tombs. All Buddhists, the “good” and the “not-so-good,” are supposed to join the ancestral procession. However, one new publisher chose the occasion to gather up all the images in the house and make a bonfire of them. Would she have courage to meet the family wrath to follow? Just then the mailman called. A new </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower!</span><span class="font5"> On opening it, her eyes fell on the article, “Ancestor Worship—Its Folly.” Here indeed was timely encouragement from her Father in heaven, “food at the proper time!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A newly interested person wrote the branch: “Nothing has given me more happiness than knowing the true value of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> by Jehovah’s witnesses. As soon as I met the special pioneers, I realized that they belonged to neither the Catholic nor Protestant churches, but rely solely on the Bible for their teachings. This is what I had been seeking truly, and I could not help but rejoice. Seven years have passed since I graduated from a Bible college, and I have been preaching as their preacher. But the churches’ conflicting doctrines worried me. I resigned from that work last year. I feel so happy now to know the people who base everything on the Bible that I take the liberty of sending this letter to you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among those immersed at recent assemblies have been some Japanese brothers over seventy years old, one of whom heard Brother Rutherford speak at Madison Square Garden in 1939. Also a number of young publishers, ten and twelve years old, have been immersed. It is thrilling to talk with these young people, and hear them explain extemporaneously in Japanese their thoughts on dedication, with references to scriptures. Young minds can certainly absorb and understand many deep points of the truth. One sevenyear-old attends the theocratic ministry school and also accompanies her mother to a home Bible study. Here a question came up on the ark of the covenant. While mother explained, daughter got busy with pencil and paper, and look! Here to help the explanation was a fine drawing of the ark, complete with cherubim. Going still farther down the “age” scale, we find two regular meeting attenders, sisters four and two and a half years old. After a disagreement at home, one apologized, saying: “We shouldn’t fight, it’s just Satan getting into us, trying to keep us from getting into the new world.” When the man came round the neighborhood with the children’s theater, they were heard saying: “Instead of giving our money to him, let’s put it in the contribution box on Sunday.” Though only a half a cent each, Jehovah would surely bless this children’s “mite.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of our young publishers have had to overcome great obstacles at home. With one of these the issue came to the point of “give up preaching, Bible study, meetings; marry a Buddhist, stay at home and raise a family,” to quote the old lady who ruled the family. No compromise! So late that night the sister found her belongings and herself dumped out on the street. But now she has a better home among friends, has been a pioneer for five months, and is happier than she has ever been in her whole life. Another sister, supporting herself by tailoring and pioneering from home, was ordered by her parents to give up preaching or leave home. She left home, took a room at another publisher’s house, and found she could get along much better than before. As a result her young brother started to study. He also was ordered out of the home. But this only strengthened him, so that now he is a baptized publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Japanese special pioneers are opening up new cities, with fine results. A deaf widow, with four children, was making a bare existence by doing piecework at home. She wanted to live right and started to church, but, being deaf, could learn nothing and no one would teach her. A special pioneer, working from house to house, placed a booklet with her and started a home Bible study. Though very poor, she contributed week by week for booklets, a book, magazines. Impressed by her zeal, the pioneer made her a gift of a Bible. In appreciation she wrote him a letter that moved him greatly. It said that ever since she had started the Bible study she had gone without breakfast, to save money for Bible literature. Even so, she now felt healthier than ever for her work, and looked forward eagerly to continuing her study. Truly such zeal to get the spiritual food must be pleasing to Jehovah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two missionaries were working a narrow, crooked street, with small shops on both sides. Starting at the far end, they worked back, each day obtaining many subscriptions, till the total stood near forty for this one street. The last block of eight market places always seemed busy, and so was left till later. Finally, entering one of these, the missionary was greeted excitedly by the lady, who called her husband to come downstairs. “I saw you passing each day,” he said, “and wondered when you would call on me.” He immediately subscribed, arranged to study, and attended the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study from the next Sunday on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The missionary’s advice: “Don’t pass up the shops!”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark262"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark263"></a>OKINAWA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Prior to World War II the people of Okinawa never locked their houses, and were never put in prison, for there was never any crime. The police were there only to keep records. War brought some changes, but the hearts of the people remained basically the same. They are a people very receptive to the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the last year the general pioneers increased to two. Many of the studies of these Okinawan sisters have now become publishers, thus contributing to a big increase in the work. The pioneers say they have so much interest that it will not permit them to stop working, so that they averaged over 148 hours each for the service year. The Okinawan, Filipino and American congregation publishers have also done good work, their magazine placements for the year averaging thirty-five a publisher a month. The Filipinos and Americans are strangers to the Japanese tongue, but they learn simple testimonies, and this zeal in tackling the language barrier makes a fine impression with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the high lights of the year was Okinawa’s first circuit assembly. This brought many of the newly interested ones together for the week end, and they gained much benefit from the association, the talks and the “New World Society” movie, so that, with better appreciation of the organization, they are now assembling regularly in the congregation meetings.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark264"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark265"></a>TAIWAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">8,500,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1951: 417 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 1,785</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tribulation, distress, persecution, hunger, nakedness, danger, sword—our Taiwan brothers have known all these through the eighteen years that they have fought for recognition of the Society. However, nothing has been able to separate them from God’s love, and now God in His great love has rewarded them with that for which they have been striving. At last the brothers have registered the International Bible Students Association of Taiwan, and are able to meet in hastily, but well-constructed Kingdom Halls of bamboo and earth. They are free to preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The privilege of assembly will be very precious to these, our brothers in Taiwan. Due to language obstacles, and many not being able to read, it is often necessary to conduct the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study continuing over four evenings of the week. But they come every night! No longer will it be necessary to go a long trek into the mountains to observe such important occasions as the Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The screenings of the Society’s motion picture, which were shown while the brothers were still under official ban, was undoubtedly a major high light of the year. First it was necessary to get official approval for the screenings. Officials viewed the movie and pronounced it excellent! Permission granted!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The movie was then shown in the city nearest the brothers’ territory. Over a period of four days 2,864 attended. What a marvelous blessing was this! The brothers had been denied the privilege of assembly throughout eighteen years. Even now, no assembly was permitted, no talks, no Kingdom songs—just the screening of the movie, with commentary in the native dialect. For these tribes people it was the first movie they had ever seen, and what a story it told—a story that has been retold and retold among their neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These brothers had had no experience in assembly organization, but it was amazing to see their efficiency. One evening the screening was shown in a school hall, but the principal requested that we be out of the hall by 10:30 p.m. The movie program ended at 10:22. Then an army moved into action! As the audience of 400 melted into the night, platoons of volunteers moved in, sisters with babies strapped on their backs, brothers young and old, swarming over the hall each with his assigned task. Seating was moved outside, the floor was swept, mopped, seats and cafeteria tables brought back in, and lights were out in an empty hall—yes, by 10:30. The amazed principal said: “Come back again tomorrow!” We kept coming back for several days, as the two-foot-gauge railway kept puffing up the valley, bringing in all twenty-seven congregations in their turn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some religious people regard our Taiwan brothers as mountain savages. However, they are no longer head-hunters, but “fishers and hunters of men,” the Bible way. Their efficient organization makes their critics seem savages by comparison. They are well qualified to share in reconstruction both now and after Armageddon, for they have all the zeal and love and spirit of Jehovah’s great organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark266"></a>KOREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">22,000,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1949: 16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 1,407</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Korea have had a most fruitful year. The windows of heaven have opened up and Jehovah has poured out a blessing that there was not room enough for them to receive. So it has been in all parts of the world for Jehovah’s witnesses. The ingathering of the other sheep has been tremendous. Korea is now showing signs of rehabilitation following the long and tragic war; but we are still in the old world and the Devil is doing everything he can through his wicked organization to turn the minds and hearts of those who come into Jehovah’s organization away from the Sovereign Ruler. Despite pressures the work goes on grandly, all to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The branch servant makes some very interesting observations of what is happening and he sets them out in his report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No circuit assemblies had ever been held in Korea before, but this year five were held. The Society’s programs, designed to emphasize training in organizational functions, proved to be very timely and most helpful. The Korean brothers have shown themselves able to shoulder the many responsibilities required to make an assembly run smoothly. Then, too, your instructions to serve the brothers every four months instead of the usual six, together with the special serving of the brothers in isolated places, have resulted in two full-time circuits. The special attention to the isolated groups brought about an effect immediately obvious. This arrangement has served to tighten up the circuit organization considerably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By concentrating on the less conspicuous means of witnessing, namely, house-to-house and store-to-store witnessing with the literature and magazines, almost 100 per cent of the brothers are to be classified as house-to-house preachers. There has almost always been a literature shortage in Korea and consequently our Korean brothers have developed </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> surprising degree of skillfulness in using the Bible and three- to eight-minute sermons. Though they do not understand English, more than 800 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font5"> are being used in the service. How? They have translated the headings and subheadings and written these in the margins and they have learned how to identify the English names of the Bible books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This activity has brought the wrath of those who foolishly seek to oppose the proclamation of Jehovah’s kingdom by his witnesses. Investigations of our work by the authorities have been almost continuous. They are constantly being agitated by false charges directed against us by influential false religionists. These efforts reached a climax in the winter when the foreign ministry revoked the visas already granted to eight Gilead missionaries on their way to Korea. With the timely assistance of a brother in a high government position opportunity was provided to file documentary evidence showing the false charges of irresponsible religious leaders to be absolutely without foundation. The missionaries were subsequently cleared for entry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The additional assistance offered by these Gilead-trained missionaries has been very strengthening to the congregations, particularly in the Seoul area. In a city with a population of a million and a half one would not ordinarily expect a territory problem. Actually the area is quite small, because the houses are adjacent to one another and because ten to fifteen persons usually occupy one small dwelling. Now seven congregations are flourishing in Seoul and four of the Kingdom Halls are only a twenty-minute walk from one to the other. Some territories are being worked once a month. Hardly a soul in the city has not heard of Jehovah’s witnesses from one of the 625 publishers now preaching. And it was just a few short months ago, the publishers observed, that when they introduced themselves as Jehovah’s witnesses no one knew who they were. Not so now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The New World Society in Action” film was received at the beginning of the service year. We were able to get the public information office’s streamer to attach to the film, thus authorizing it to be shown anywhere. Several times it has been shown to government offices where several hundred officials viewed it. The minister of rehabilitation arranged for one of the missionaries to show the film to a farming community in Kyonggi-do province. A lecture was given in the evening out of doors after the farmers had come in from their rice paddies. All the village officials were on hand and more than 500 of the community folk. There was no electricity, but arrangements had been made for a United States information service mobile unit to go along on the trip supplying the generator and amplifier. The film has drawn capacity crowds everywhere it has been shown. In most cases the showings have gone unadvertised because the halls would have been unable to hold the people. In Korea the audience is not the problem in showing the movie; rather it is finding a place and electricity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been most encouraging to observe the congregations making arrangements for Kingdom Halls. Some have purchased their own halls, others have built, others are building and securing lots, all at a very great sacrifice to themselves. One congregation is now using a private school as its meeting place. One of the owners had lived in the U.S. some years back, but had not heard of the witnesses until recently. When the circuit servant visited, she had quite a session with him to clear up some remaining doubts and then she was promptly baptized. In addition to giving the congregation the use of her schoolrooms she also has one hour each week in the school curriculum for teaching the Bible. One of the missionaries assists her in teaching these high school students. They are showing much interest, as is the headmaster, who is this sister’s husband. After many years of associating with the Methodist Church she is rejoicing over the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It is very difficult for Jehovah’s witnesses to go in among the Moslems and preach the truth, the good news of God’s kingdom. They dislike very much having an outside religion try to convert them to the belief in Christ Jesus and in Jehovah God. They look upon Jehovah’s witnesses as having the same God as the Jews, and, of course, the Israelis and the Arabs have had grave misunderstandings. There are many persons, however, in the Arab states who listen to the truth and are glad to hear the message. This is especially true of those who have taken up so-called Christian religions, which have a stronghold in these countries. But like Christendom everywhere, they are willing to compromise with the state and do not stand for the true teachings of Jehovah God. The branch servant sends in reports on Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Syria, and a number of experiences are set out under the different countries, which the reader will find very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to reach the hundreds of mountain villages, the brothers in one of the congregations rent a bus each Sunday during the summer months and spend the entire day in the field service. At one mountain village that was known for its fanaticism, thirty publishers were scattered there giving the Kingdom message, when a priest entered one of the homes and found two publishers explaining about the new world to about fifteen persons. When the priest heard this and saw the Bible, he began to shout, cursing Jehovah and the brothers and those listening, saying: “We do not need you here, this is my flock, I do my duty perfectly well, so get out of here!” But when he saw that the house owner did not order the two publishers out he asked the ones there to follow him as he wanted to ring the church bell and gather the whole village and put the witnesses out by force and have them arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Half of them followed him after he threatened to excommunicate them and report them to the bishop. When the bell began to ring, as it was not the time</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">of mass, everyone in the village began rushing to the church to find out what the trouble was. The brothers likewise could see that there might be trouble; so they too gathered together in the center of the village where their bus was parked. The people, being stirred up by the priest, gathered around them with angry faces and some with clubs. The brothers began to tactfully tell them the purpose of their visit and the good news of the Kingdom. Bit by bit their faces began to change and they opened their ears to what was being said. With the audience listening attentively, one of the brothers then went into an impromptu talk for over an hour, showing why Satan the Devil is angry with this message and why his representatives try to block it, not entering the Kingdom themselves or allowing anyone else to enter. At the conclusion much literature was placed and some exclaimed: “Really you are true Christians, more so than we and our priest.” So here, for the first time, Jehovah’s witnesses used the church bell to call people to a public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the special talk on April 3 the brothers advertised it well and over 200 of the village people crowded into their little Kingdom Hall. The following Sunday the local priest rang the bell for mass and was waiting for the people outside, but no one showed up except a few old folks, crippled, blind and aged. He began his sermon by saying that “life in this village had become unbearable. Exactly one hour the bell has been ringing and nobody came except a few old persons. I wished you would die so I could resign from this position and close the church. The other day Jehovah’s witnesses had a meeting in the heat of the day and in a little room and more than 200 attended it. Really I cannot bear this any longer.&quot; So the April 3 talk aroused much interest and made many realize how dead their religion was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year much work was accomplished among the large Armenian population residing in Lebanon. Two missionaries have been working among them and some interest is being found. A man was contacted in the store-to-store work. After several back-calls, a study was arranged for in his home. It was soon observed that his wife was the one who was showing real interest in the truth. At a surprise meeting with about twenty Pentecostals, when asked if she was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, she readily agreed that she was —and this after only two or three studies. She immediately began to attend the meetings and expressed her joy at associating with Jehovah’s people and hearing the many wonderful truths from God’s Word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It has been just a little over two years since the truth first entered this country, when the Society sent two missionaries into the capital city of Baghdad. During the service year two more were sent over and much literature is being placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Iraq is 95 per cent Moslem. And its capital city Baghdad has stood for years at the crossroads of great world highways of trade, and in its glory could brag of a population of two million. But the city suffered its long decline beginning in the thirteenth century with the overrunning of Mesopotamia by the Mongol hordes and repeated sackings by the Turks and Persians. Since 1930, with the gaining of independence for the state of Iraq, Baghdad is fast recapturing its former position of importance. The traveler who wishes to see a purely Eastern city will not find it in Baghdad except in the byways. A fast expanding new city is replacing the old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The special talk in April went off with fine success with twenty-three in attendance. Also for the Memorial there were twenty-six in attendance, to compare with three the previous year. Weekly meetings have been started during the year as well as public meetings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In November a two-day circuit assembly was arranged in Ramallah at the home of one of the brothers. A carload of brothers from Lebanon went down to attend it. At the border one of the brothers was stopped because they had his name there as being one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and they would not allow him in the country. The police officer never thought to ask if the others in the car were Jehovah’s witnesses, so the rest went on to attend the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the assembly the secret police came and, immediately spotting the district servant because of his being an American, took his passport, and next day he had to report to the local police headquarters. A good witness was given to them. Since the district servant was “visiting*’ and merely sitting in the audience at the time of the policeman’s visit, he was released, but two detectives were put on his trail to follow him. Through the aid of a lawyer, appointment was arranged with the minister of interior and protest was made for the unjust action by the officials in the Jordan against Jehovah’s witnesses. The minister promised to investigate the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Also during the year the police raided the houses of the brothers in the village of Beit-Sahour near Bethlehem and confiscated all the books, taking two of the brothers to the police station. Finding no fault with them, they released them. The second day, when one of them returned to give his evidence,the books were given back to him. This brother said: “They are helping us to stick to the truth and to get rid of any fear of men.” Certainly the brothers in Jordan have been mindful of our yeartext and have looked to Jehovah for strength to carry on their preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Previously most of the service work was carried on in and around Jerusalem, but in March two special pioneers were transferred to Amman in East Jordan, which is the capital city. They have contacted many persons of good will and before the end of the service year had reported new publishers in that area.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Qatar is a small Sheikhdom on the Persian Gulf. During the year two brothers from Jordan obtained work in this country. They were able to place some literature and gave a witness as much as they could.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They write that they are finding some good-will persons, but they have to use great tact and wisdom in speaking. One of the brothers just recently returned to his home, but the other one is still there. We trust that what seed has been planted will bear some fruit during the months to come.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During the year a good-will slip was received from the Brooklyn office concerning an American who had gone to Arabia to work in the oil fields. Since he was a subscriber for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine, the branch wrote him an encouraging letter. In reply he was thankful that we had taken an interest in him and mentioned how he was studying a great deal and requested more literature. We continued to keep in contact with him by correspondence and in each letter we could see his progress in the truth. He began wanting literature for others and related to us his interesting discussions and asked us to supply him with Scriptural answers to his many questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the European conventions were drawing near, we encouraged him to attend, and to our surprise he got a two-week vacation and wrote back, saying: “I will see you in London.” After hearing the baptismal talk at the convention he was one among the hundreds that were immersed at the London convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In talking to the brother about his activities he said: “Brother, our studies do not run just an hour, but sometimes two and three hours, and since we are in a desert and have nothing to do we have a study almost every night.” He has been able to contact other subscribers in Arabia and is conducting studies with them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark274"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark275"></a>SYRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">3,535,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1949: 28 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 114</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers in Syria are very happy for the greater freedom that they now enjoy in their preaching work, and they have shown their gratefulness to Jehovah God by greater activity. Special pioneers were sent into the two largest cities in Syria and are doing excellent work, which is one of the main contributing factors toward the 48 per cent increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shortly after World War II a Syrian-American brother from Detroit, Michigan, came to Syria to visit his relatives in a small village in the Syrian mountains. Being a pioneer, he zealously preached to the inhabitants of his village and a congregation was established during his short stay. This congregation became the largest and strongest in Syria and, as a result, suffered the greatest persecution. The brothers on the whole were young and energetic and zealous in spreading the truth to surrounding villages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This summer following the European conventions this Syrian-American pioneer brother came over again to his village and was well received by his entire village. While there, he was taken ill and was operated on, but died two days later. His death was the greatest witness ever given to that village, as 1,200 persons attended his funeral conducted by the witnesses. After the sermon some members of a political party testified before that large audience how this brother spoke of the truth and preached about a kingdom of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus we see faithfulness to Jehovah and his service always has its rewards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two publishers while working from store to store in Beirut, Lebanon, contacted a young man who said: “You are two out of thousands who talk about religion, and everyone says he has the right religion. I have looked into all these religions, but could not find the truth.” A book was placed with him, a back-call was arranged and a study started on the first call. Having a fleshly sister living in Damascus, Syria, he sent her a letter by means of the two special pioneers there to call on her and talk to her about God’s kingdom. She was so pleased to know that her brother was interested in the Bible and began asking the two pioneers all about this “new religion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> was placed with her and the next week a study was started. As a result she began proclaiming what she is learning and became a publisher within a month. She plans on being immersed at the first assembly and she herself at present is conducting a Bible study in the Armenian language with another lady of good will.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark276"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark277"></a>LEEWARD ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There are seven islands under the direction of the branch servant in the Leeward Islands group, and he sends reports in on each one. We recall the scripture, “Let them give glory unto Jehovah, and declare his praise in the islands.” (Isa. 42:12, .48) Jehovah’s witnesses certainly have been busy in these islands, carrying out the divine command to preach this good news of the Kingdom. The circuit servant sees to it that the training program is carried on, and during the year a. new peak of 246 publishers was reached. In this all rejoice, and it certainly should stimulate zeal for the 1956 service year. Here are some of their experiences.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark278"></a>ANTIGUA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population Highest Number of Ministers Preaching 49,700 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1946: 12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955 : 60</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More and more the people of this island are getting to see the scope and magnitude of the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses, and as a result are giving a hearing ear to the Kingdom message. The recent “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies have played a vital role in this as well as the showing of the Society’s film. To illustrate: One person migrated to the States, became a publisher, attended the assemblies there and in Europe. Writing her friend in Antigua, in glowing terms she described the assemblies and the work of the New World society. Since then this friend has shown real interest and is being called on regularly. Another person writing a friend and commenting on the assemblies put it this way: “Jehovah’s witnesses are a big organization; they are not just a mere handful of people of little significance as I thought when I was back home.” Still another, a tourist from America, while visiting the island rushed up to several missionaries and said: “Are you Jehovah’s witnesses? I have just been to the Chicago assembly. My, it was wonderful. The love, unity and organization I saw there impressed me. I am a Methodist, but I don’t think I will be much longer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The special booklet campaign was a real success and resulted in the starting of six new publishers in the field. Unique was the method of one publisher to reach his quota. He, working among a large group of men, informed them that a special lecture was to be given and a special booklet to be released. He said: “Boys, I want you to be ready Monday morning to obtain your copy as you come in the gate to work. Any contribution will be acceptable.” The result: eighty copies placed the first morning. Why not try this method with magazines?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At a time when many in these parts are setting their minds on supposed Utopia’s in other lands, it does one’s heart good to see those who set as their purpose in life pioneering. What creates the desire to serve full time? Study! A young local publisher entertained this goal for some time, but at the time it was not possible. Diligently he applied himself to study and making plans. Talking the matter over with his family, he finally found the way was possible and did not hesitate. His joys today are many and doubtless many future blessings are in store for him. Said his mother: “He is the happiest boy in the house, now that his goal has been achieved.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Two young sisters mainly have held high the truth to the people of this island for the past several years. They have been assisted by regular visits from the brothers on the Society’s missionary boat, which have been greatly appreciated, except by the clergy who desperately fight the work with their usual weapon of misrepresentation. This only causes a sharper division of the people, and without doubt the time is ripe here for increase. The determination of these two sisters to press on in service is now being rewarded and others are joining with them. Many studies have been started with the simple but powerful study aid </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark280"></a>DOMINICA</span></h2>

<p><span class="font5">Fine progress is being made in this Catholic isle over the years and the truth is rapidly spreading to all parts of the island, there now being three well-established congregations. Dominicans are known for their ability to talk, and when they have the truth to talk about they readily and zealously give it out to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister who is a regular publisher talked the truth to her son who lives in an isolated village. He obtained a book, a Catholic Bible and began to read. Later while making a visit to Roseau he visited the missionary home. The book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font5"> was shown to him with its uses. “Just what I need to talk to the people in my village,” he said. Talk he did, and put to rout a minister of false religion. Said the minister to him: “Jehovah’s witnesses preach nothing about repentance.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font5"> was immediately brought into action, the definition of repentance read and many scriptures. The false shepherd was routed and avoids any more encounters with this newly interested person. Because of the use of this aid in preaching, this person is recognized in the village for his knowledge of the Bible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Just one lone family of eight, together with another sister, continue to make known the good news to the many people of Montserrat. They have been diligently working with the magazines, and these two fine journals are highly appreciated by the people. Many of the business people as well as police officers look forward regularly to their copies. The work is well respected, but needs to be organized more in the main town of the island, the congregation being situated in the country. All are in need of help here and it is our aim to have pioneers come in and work to establish a congregation in the city.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark283"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark284"></a>NEVIS</span></h2>

<p><span class="font5">The past service year has been a very happy one for the publishers in Nevis. With the improved quality of service resulting from the training program, greater magazine distribution, a fine special booklet campaign and the coverage of the island thoroughly for the year, increase has come and its resultant joy to all. For the first time an assembly was held on this island, creating much interest by the people and much opposition and dismay by the clergy. Five hundred people saw the showing of the film.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who like to display their worldly knowledge and to ridicule Jehovah’s witnesses often find their ridicule turned to consternation. Proudly one of these rode his ass up to an elderly, zealous, studious pioneer and asked questions on the date of 1914. When given a Bible answer he only ridiculed and said: “I can’t see that.” Kindly but firmly replied the brother: “Sir, remember this, Balaam’s ass saw things that even Balaam didn’t see, so watch out.” Now he is learning to respect Jehovah’s servants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s servants have been very busy on this island during the service year of 1955. There is now one publisher to every 528 people. Every section of the island has been thoroughly covered. Two young local brothers have answered the call for pioneer service and are experiencing many joys, as they pursue their purpose in life. People of good standing in the community notice the difference the truth makes in the lives of the people and comment favorably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good results are always obtained when congregations carry out the Society’s suggestions in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font5">and are positive. Taking to heart the suggestion to have special group efforts during the December festivities, the local congregation arranged for such on the night of December 24. No magazines were available, so booklets were used. The result: Fifteen publishers in the field including two new ones, 113 booklets placed, four magazines, a Bible and fifty hours of service. Another publisher remarked to the circuit servant that she could not place nine magazines a month. But, when invited to try on Magazine Day, she placed ten the first day! Now she is convinced she can, is positive and places as many as thirty a month.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark287"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark288"></a>ST. MARTIN, F.W.I.</span></h2>

<p><span class="font5">The high light of the year was the showing of the film “The New World Society in Action” for the first time here. The circuit servant reports that this was greatly appreciated by the brothers and people of good will. A theater was given free for our use on the French side and 360 persons came along. On the Dutch side permission was given for a public showing in the town square, a screen was provided and a businessman gave the use of a projector and sound equipment. In a beautiful open-air setting 650 people gathered and were favorably impressed with what they saw. Doubtless many here will yet join in the glorious work of declaring Jehovah’s praise in the islands, together with the New World society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark289"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark290"></a>LIBERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2,500,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1946: 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 160</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the few years that Jehovah’s witnesses have been in Liberia it has not been possible to reach all parts of the country. But as the organization grows and they are able to get into new sections, there to bring the light of the new world to the people, more will come to an understanding of Jehovah’s wonderful purposes. Many of the people are illiterate and inclined toward emotional religions, which carry on praying and singing and dancing sometimes until dawn arrives. They think people must be filled with the spirit to be religious. People do notice a big difference between the way Jehovah’s witnesses act in their daily lives, to compare with those of other so-called “Christian” religions. They are beginning to see the cleanness of the New World society and its devotion to truth and righteousness. The branch servant sends in some very interesting reports, and excerpts are taken from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After completing a Bible study with an interested group a full-time worker was asked when he was going farther on down the road, because the people were looking for Jehovah’s witnesses. Although it meant much additional walking, the next week he decided to find some of these people. At one house he was asked in and politely scolded: “We were wondering when you would come and study with us. How is it you do us this way and take so long?” Literature was obtained and the first study was held right then and there. Farther on a woman greeted the brother: “At last you’ve come our way!” In appreciation of the message lunch was set out. Then to the next home, and imagine the joy of hearing the lady say: “You’re not a stranger to me. I know the nature of your work, and we have been expecting you. Our friend with whom you study told us all about you.” All the family gathered round to listen to the sermon. On leaving they requested a return visit regularly so that they may be taught Jehovah’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Maintaining integrity on the home front pays off. A new sister was a relative of a leading candidate in an election. The custom on election day is for every family member to march with the band to the polls. When the day came the sister marched along with Jehovah’s witnesses preaching from house-to-house instead. Enraged at this, the sister’s mother and uncle went to the husband, who was not in the truth. Said the uncle: “If I had a wife of this kind I would put her out right away.” The mother chimed in with, “And that is just what we are going to do!” The sister resorted to the Bible to show why she should not be divided from her husband and ended by saying: “When my father and mother forsake me, then Jehovah will take me.” Seeing the reluctance of the husband to take their advice, the angry relatives left. A few days later the sister started reading the Scriptures to her husband at night and he became interested to the extent of asking one of the brothers to have regular Bible studies with him. He also now allows his children to attend the meetings at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One man with several wives complained that the law of Jehovah’s witnesses was too strict for him and so he was not interested. Whenever one of the brothers would come he would get his catechism and start reading it. One day at church the preaching about the collection brought to his mind the discussions had with the witnesses and he became disturbed. Later he met this money-loving preacher in a cafe. Testing him, he treated him to some drinks, which were readily accepted. Then the preacher tried to become friendly with a young girl. At this the churchgoer decided that he had enough and that Jehovah’s witnesses were preaching the truth. How delighted the brothers were when he asked to be baptized as soon as he straightened out his marital affairs!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of special interest to one community was the wedding of a newly interested person. He had been living in common-law marriage, but this did not prevent him from holding down the position of secretary in the Baptist church. On coming to a knowledge of Jehovah’s Word and wanting to be a witness, he arranged for a wedding ceremony to be performed by the visiting circuit minister. Many were curious, wondering if Jehovah’s witnesses really performed marriage ceremonies and just how. Eighty persons assembled to see for themselves. They were surprised and very much pleased at what they witnessed. Some remarked: “You take marriage very seriously, certainly more so than we.” “It was different from ours; you have a fine talk explaining marriage. I’ve never heard the like and can say I’m well pleased.” “The Baptists couldn’t get him to marry, but you did!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young brother attending high school received a threatening note because he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He straightforwardly replied, stating the awful judgment opposers will receive at Armageddon. Perhaps this threw fear into his antagonists, as nothing happened. Later he was asked to join a school club, which he did, as it would give him opportunities to deliver the witness. At one meeting he was picked on because he did not have a &quot;girl friend” as all the churchgoing boys did. Realizing that such friendships often lead to immoralities he pointed out what Paul said at First Corinthians, chapters 6 and 7. So powerful was his testimony that he was appointed soon afterward to be the school “chaplain,” and was warmly greeted by the son of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> local minister, who expressed his desire to have the brother continue to preach to the students from God’s Word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The New World society film has had a telling effect upon the people of Mexico. While there are millions more that may yet have the opportunity to see it, still those that have seen it have been impressed and it has shown them what the New World society is like. The work in Mexico has gone along very well, and with some recent reorganizations that have taken place the growth of the New World society should move on even better. The brothers in Mexico are just like those everywhere else: zealous, joyful in service and willing to go through all kinds of trials and difficulties in order to get the message of the Kingdom preached. The branch servant sends some most unusual experiences for the readers of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font6"> but not necessarily unusual for the brothers in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In November the Society’s president, Brother Knorr, visited Mexico for the first time in five years. During his visit two district assemblies were held at which he had the opportunity to address 7,356 publishers and persons of good will. His counsel and instructions were very much appreciated as well as the new arrangements made to organize the work better. The country was divided into two districts with forty-five circuits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shortly after Brother Knorr’s visit arrangements were made to start a new series of circuit assemblies. The outstanding feature of these assemblies was the New World society film shown to most of them for the first time. A total of 27,101 persons saw the film in this round of circuit assemblies. One district servant reports that in a town that had only 1,552 inhabitants, including children, and where the entire circuit had only 214 publishers, those in attendance to see the film on Saturday night was 1,627. Most business places in town, Including the two theaters, were closed, because almost everybody went to see the New World society film.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another district servant reports that a high government state official was interviewed on Sunday morning after he had seen the film on Saturday night. He was so impressed with the film that he said: “I couldn’t sleep last night because scenes of the New World society film kept passing through my mind all the time. I kept thinking of the orderliness of everyone in the organization, especially of those in Africa, and the way it operates and compared It with the politicians [with whom he associates], who look after only their own interests, but there is no comparison. I am glad that there is an organization that unselfishly is helping the people the way you are doing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A schoolteacher who had been very much opposed to the truth for many years is now a publisher. What made her come into the truth? She says: “An eightminute sermon I heard.” It was so convincing she invited the published into her house. When the publisher made the back-call he gave another sermon and invited her to a meeting. Her daughter went but she had to stay home and by the time her daughter came home from the meeting she had read almost half of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font5"> She said: “As I read the book the first sermon I heard kept ringing in my mind.” She went to the next meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses and since then has become an active publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Persecution was felt heavily in some parts of the country and in every instance the Catholic Church was behind it. The purpose was to stop the witnesses but, instead of stopping them, they have been scattered to new territories where they find hearing ears. A circuit servant reports that in his circuit “the brothers have been mobbed, beaten until unconscious, their teeth have been knocked out, their property destroyed and their animals killed.” Some publishers have moved away to new territories while others remain in their home town but work other territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Durango state groups of publishers are formed in order to go out to work isolated territory in the high Sierra Madre Mountains, which are infested with rattlesnakes, mountain lions, wolves and other wild animals. The circuit servant whose circuit is located in this area reports that six new congregations have been organized in his circuit in the past six months, some of which are in the very heart of the Sierra Madres. The Sierra Madres in this part of the country are over 10,000 feet high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Serving congregations in territories like this is very hard on the circuit servants, some of whom have to spend as long as two months up in the hills before they return to a town. During the rainy season they travel on horseback or walk on muddy roads or paths and cross flooded creeks and rivers. A circuit servant relates an experience that he and his wife had while visiting congregations in territory like this: “After serving the Jocuixtita congregation, where we got soaking wet every day, we went to a town near the river that had been flooded for three days. While waiting for the river to come down we worked the town and after working it I gave two public talks with attendances of 136 and ninety-six. Then when we crossed this river and the other rivers and creeks we got completely wet, because when the horses swim all that is above the water is their head.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10,609,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 3,125 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 9,854</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A year of activity on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses in the country of the Netherlands is bound to heap up a mountain of testimony to Jehovah’s name. It would cause a stir, and has. Tens of thousands of people of good will are turning their backs on this old world and its false religion, and the clergy gnash their teeth. On the other hand, the press takes notice and reports what is going on. In fact, the world in general watches the theatrical spectacle to see how it will turn out, as the religious and political fanatics kindle fires of persecution. But no matter where we turn in the world we find the New World society happy and moving ahead with great zeal. So the story is in the Netherlands. There is a fine, fast-growing organization in this country, and the branch servant there gives us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The activity, unity and zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses are ever-present testimony to a legion of honest observers. One of these, an elderly member of the Dutch governmental advisory staff, told one of our publishers: “I see it in the eyes of every one of you calling at my door, namely, that inimitable joy. This has persuaded me to make a personal analysis of you people and I would appreciate telling you what my conclusions are. You people are happy because you have torn yourselves free from the suppressive convention of orthodox religions. To be a member of one of those religions you do not need to think or exert yourself. But in your religion all of you have something to say and all are doing their best to do this intelligibly. What I like about Jehovah’s witnesses is that they dare to come out for their convictions. Another reason for your permeating joy is, I think, that you all go out in all kinds of weather trying to bring happiness to others.” We hope this elderly gentleman sees the whole sum of the truth and tears himself free from this world’s ‘religious conventionalism.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fear that acceptance of the truth will affect job or business stands in the way of many about to dedicate themselves to Jehovah. A story related by a sister in the Netherlands shows otherwise. This sister has a large home and three children to look after as well as a husband not in the truth. To make ends meet, she works part time at home as a chiropodist. Her report showed five hours a week, but she longed to do more. That meant cutting down on her medical practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But which of her thirty-five patients would she send away? That was hard to decide. With Matthew 25:32 in mind she decided to do a sort of separation work. Every patient coming in for treatment first got treated to a three- to eight-minute sermon. The sister hoped that those opposed to the truth would go away and look for a new chiropodist in the world while a small number of more righteously disposed ones would remain as her customers. No success! They responded well to the Scriptural as well as the medical treatment and they continued coming back for more chiropody and preaching. Long before the sister had made the full round she had placed seven books, eight booklets and twelve magazines. She has improved her hour total and very soon hopes to conduct additional Bible studies while the coms wait their turn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our cup of joy already filled to the brim overflowed freely when August 17, the first day of the international convention, rolled around. At this glorious assembly 15,360 heard the public talk and 451 were immersed to bring our annual total immersed to 795. One could not begin to give an account of the assembly in this report, but one experience should suffice to encourage those who think they know too little and therefore should study much longer before they begin preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A brother who recently began preaching was not able to attend the convention the first couple of days, as he had to work. The manager of the factory and most of the eighty men working there were good Catholics, but it did not scare this brother from going to the boss and asking him for fifteen minutes off to listen to a fifteen-minute radio program Thursday afternoon reporting on the assembly. Loud-speakers fed by a central receiver were located throughout the factory, but to be able to hear anything all machines would have to be brought to a standstill. Whatever led the Catholic manager to have the entire plant stopped for the brother to hear the program we do not know, but the brother heard the program along with his eighty fellows, who could do nothing but listen. After the program a Catholic youth who had been nasty to this brother previously came up and apologized. Thereafter the factory hummed with discussions on Jehovah’s witnesses and many said: ‘Why not let us go to The Hague and see and hear what this is all about?’ On Sunday thirty-five of them biked the thirty-three miles and were much impressed by what they saw and heard on this day of association with the New World society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark295"></a>DUTCH NEW GUINEA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Dutch New Guinea is a land that the Dutch were able to hold onto after Indonesia grouped a series of islands into a stable government. However, Dutch New Guinea remained as part of the possession of the Netherlands, and while it is in a bad state of undevelopment, people do live there. The Amsterdam office recently had some correspondence from an individual in Dutch New Guinea who is preaching the truth. He says there is some fine interest, and very likely during the year of 1956 a real organization will be started and the preaching work begun in earnest. There are fourteen native persons, Papuans, who are now studying the truth, and the office in the Netherlands is going to keep them supplied with literature, and the one person who is truly interested in our work will continue as the instructor. Undoubtedly, some publishers will be coming forth within the next twelve months.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark296"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark297"></a>NETHERLANDS ANTILLES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The publishers in the three islands in the Caribbean under the branch office of the Netherlands Antilles are certainly magazine-minded. They have done very well in the distribution of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> not only on Magazine Day, but in house-to-house witnessing, as they take every opportunity they come across to place magazines. The branch servant sets out some very interesting experiences for the three islands, Curasao, Aruba and Bonaire and shows us what joys the brothers are having. Here are some of the experiences.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark298"></a>CURASAO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">110,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1946: 14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 113</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One missionary in the group here placed 3,382 magazines for the year, but he also obtained ninety-nine new subscriptions, placed 160 bound books and conducted an average of eight studies a month. He averages less than thirty magazines on Magazine Day, which is Saturday, but scarcely a day passes that he does not place some magazines. This publisher is a diligent house-to-house preacher and, after giving the sermon and presenting the current offer, makes a practice of offering the latest magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of the congregation publishers are doing well placing magazines, too, with some of them averaging more magazines than the full-time workers. One night after a congregation meeting a local brother and his wife, on their way home, stopped at a bakery to buy bread. While the brother was inside buying bread, the sister stood by the door outside and placed twelve magazines in a few minutes. “Man shall not live by bread alone.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another congregation publisher took his usual quota of thirty-five magazines one week, but was unable to get out in the service on his regular Magazine Day. However, when he got home from his secular job one afternoon he found that his little ten-year-old son had gone out with the magazines on his own accord and placed twenty-eight of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a result of using the Bible and giving short sermons at the doors the publishers we have are becoming more mature ministers and their placements continue to be good. In fact, when many people hear the scriptures being read from the Bible they want the Bible itself. In Catholic territory, as we have here, we have found that one of the best ways to get on common ground is by reading the Lord’s prayer from the Bible. More than one person has exclaimed: “Why, you believe just as I do.” By then rereading the first line of the Lord’s prayer, it makes a nice introduction to a short talk on the importance of our Father’s name, Jehovah. The second line can be used to introduce a nice talk on the Kingdom and the third to introduce a talk on the fact that we need spiritual food as well as material food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the Protestant clergy of Curacao put on an exhibition of the Bible and they were pleased to have us loan them many Bibles, which they used in the display. Thousands of people came to the exhibition and they had to keep it open longer than they had planned so all the people could get to see it. As a result of this, there was much talk about the Bible and we were able to place some Bibles. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Emphatic Diaglott</span><span class="font5"> was especially popular, as most people did not realize that such a Bible existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The high light of the year was Brother Knorr’s visit from December 31 to January 3. This was reported on in the September 15 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> which the brothers and people of good will are now enjoying. Recently, we announced that we shall be having an assembly in November and some of the native friends asked: “Will Brother Knorr be here again?” They do not realize how big the world is and how many places Brother Knorr has to visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One local brother that works for the KLM airlines was given free transportation to Europe. When he returned he gave a wonderful account of the different conventions he attended, which was an inspiration to all the friends that heard his reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ARC BA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A recent baptism was of all Arubans. At this baptism while a brother was going under the water his wife told the children: “Watch Papa now and see what he is doing, because we must all follow his example and do what he is doing after we learn a little more.” The mother Intends to be immersed at the next assembly. A new Kingdom Hall was opened in Oranjestad and many brothers are showing more maturity as they have higher averages in back-calls, Bible studies and hours as well as giving effective sermons at the doors. The children’s sermons are appreciated by adults upon whom they call. When a circuit servant took along a very young publisher who could not read but had memorized the scriptures to be used, a lady remarked, “A little Samuel, eh?” and took a bound book. Another brother had the following experience along this line.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark299"></a><span class="font5">“I called at a certain home and introduced myself as a minister visiting people at their homes to stimulate interest in God’s Word. I was cautious at this home because the householder always appeared negative and previous calls ended without a proper witness' being given. When I had delivered about half of my eightminute sermon a neighbor called. The householder promptly invited her in, saying, ‘Come! Come in and hear a nice sermon!’ I was surprised to hear this, because I had not mentioned the word ‘sermon’ nor introduced my message as such. The householder and guest listened intently to the remainder of my talk. I spent about twenty minutes in that home that I had never before succeeded in entering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A local newspaper started a religious column entitled “Thoughts for the Week.” Our public relations servant heard that different clergymen were invited to contribute to it, so he went to see the editor and asked if he would like us to do likewise. When several of the clergy failed to contribute an article on their week, our brother contributed all the articles used for several weeks. Since then they have been going in regularly. Sometimes the editor accepts other items from the brother on such things as advances made in blood substitutes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark300"></a>BONAIRE</span></h2>

<p><span class="font5">When the circuit servant visited Bonaire in October he took the film “The New World Society in Action” with him and, after showing it at the Kingdom Hall to about eighteen brothers and people of good will as sort of an appetizer, the local theater was packed out with 135 a few nights later to see the film. The owner of the theater let us have it free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a special pioneer working in Bonaire and he is doing a good job of breaking down prejudice to the truth and getting the strong Catholic population to listen to the good news of the Kingdom. The people as a whole like this brother and the old and young alike hail him from afar when he passes on his bicycle.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark301"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark302"></a>NEWFOUNDLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">415,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 52 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 323</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If we are faithful in fulfilling our commission to Jehovah God, he will grant us his favor by pouring out an increase. While Newfoundland is hard territory in many respects, still it is interesting to see how the brothers get around, and how anxious people in isolated territories are to hear the message and to study God’s Word with Jehovah’s witnesses. The branch servant in Newfoundland gives us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Upon arriving on his assignment a special pioneer found the people in such a befuddled and starved spiritual condition that they knew little or nothing of the fundamental truths of God’s Word and had no conception of Jehovah’s theocratic organization as the place they must flee to for protection. In just one short month by diligent house-to-house, back-call and Bible study work and being familiar with organization instructions this faithful special pioneer was able to organize a thriving congregation, with seven publishers reporting. The congregation is now nine months old and continues to have seven regular publishers with a peak of eleven. In addition, twenty-three regularly attend the congregational meetings. Certainly there is grand potential for further increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The floating missionary home, the motor vessel Hope continued to battle the heavy seas and the Newfoundland fog, hunting and fishing for men of good will. (Jer. 16:16) Since the majority of the people are blinded by the spiritual fog spread by unfaithful Christendom the missionaries are not always welcome. The lack of hospitality on the part of the majority is soon overshadowed when even one hospitable person is found. At one port of call threats were made not to permit the boat Hope to dock, but dock she did. Upon hearing this a person of good will dropped her planned work, rushed over to her neighbor and, fairly screaming with excitement, said: “Those are Jehovah’s witnesses; we must go over and see them before they go away from us.” She later remarked to the missionaries: “If they would not have permitted you to dock, I would have swum out to you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At another port of call another lady interested in God’s Word was found. She informed the missionaries that she had tried going to church for a while, but after attending two services where the clergyman made continual demands for greater financial support she decided that she would not attend any church service again. So all winter long she and her husband have been studying the Bible to find out whether they were wrong in attending church or whether the church was wrong. The missionaries had an enjoyable time explaining Bible truth to them and answering their many questions. No doubt many more such sheep are scattered over the territory. It remains our obligation to search for and feed the sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Approximately seventy of the Newfoundland publishers had the joy and privilege of attending the rich spiritual feast prepared by Jehovah’s organization at Yankee Stadium, New York. Upon their return to Newfoundland another feast awaited them. Arrangements had been completed to hold a “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly at Corner Brook, Newfoundland, to be served by two brothers from the Brooklyn Bethel. Being so close to the New York assembly we wondered how many would be able to take advantage of this provision. During the past service year we had 262 average publishers. However, Saturday’s sessions saw an attendance of 270, and twenty-three symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by water immersion. Then on Sunday to hear the talk “World Conquest Soon—by God’s Kingdom” we had an all-time high of 475 present, truly a grand climax to a busy service year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark303"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark304"></a>NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population Highest Number of Ministers Preaching 2,131,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945 : 536 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955 : 2,519</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is abundant evidence that the New World society is growing in New Zealand. There is abundant evidence of Jehovah’s blessing on the service being performed, for there is a great ingathering and many of the other sheep are now associating with the organization. The responsibility is great upon Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere in the world, and that is to bring the new ones to maturity. This, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, will be done. The work done during the past year in New Zealand has been outstanding. They increased on the average seventeen per cent in average publishers, and we rejoice with them. The branch servant gives some very interesting experiences to meditate upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good husband-and-wife co-operation enabled one sister with five children to become a pioneer, and she is joyful for the many rewarding blessings from Jehovah. A study was arranged with an interested man. First his mother, then the whole family of four sons and a daughter were sitting in. Neighbors, too, were invited and as many as ten attended. Then the young man was immersed, and later his mother and another son. The rest of the family are considering the same step at the next circuit assembly. Seven months after the first Bible study the whole family had become regular publishers and the original person contacted plans to become a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young woman in business arranged to add half an hour to her lunch break to study with this same pioneer. Then, conscious of her spiritual need, she took the whole afternoon to get more spiritual food. Her many wonderful questions, asked and answered, brought great happiness to the pioneer. She now witnesses to her friends and customers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The tempo of the work in the locality stirred the Anglican preacher to the attack. He told his parishioners that if they could copy the enthusiasm and zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses their church would become a living force. (Can it be dead?) One Anglican resented this attack and wants to have a study on </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A study was started with a Catholic Tongan woman, who manifested interest in the talk “Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is ‘the Light of the World’?” She told of the bad treatment received in a convent where, as a child, her parents left her while they were on an extended tour. When later she married a Protestant, the priest insisted that she go through a form of marriage in the Catholic church. When her child died she was told that God had taken it because she was not a good Catholic and he would be able to look after it better in heaven. “I am still a Catholic,” said she, “and I don’t want to waste time studying with Jehovah’s witnesses unless they can show from the Bible that Peter is not the rock of the church.” After two hours’ study she was convinced and said: “From now on I’m finished with the Catholic Church and I’m going to be a witness of Jehovah.” With beaming face she happily received a copy of the Society’s No. 10 Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young vacation pioneer witnessed to her music teacher and invited her to the group book study to meet the circuit servant. Accepting the invitation, she said she agreed with most of the teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses and admired their courageous stand, but could not see our viewpoint on the trinity. The young sister pointed out the importance of using the Bible as our guide, and the teacher agreed to bring her Bible and discuss the trinity doctrine at a future date. She remarked that she had never before had a pupil discuss the Bible and prayed that she would get the right understanding. She started in the right way by taking a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens and a New Earth”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">In Nicaragua, where the heat is really hot, the message must also be preached. There has been an improvement in the work during the year, and a number of persons have been brought to maturity and have a greater appreciation of the truth. There was good success with the special booklet campaign in April, and this stimulated the whole organization to greater activity. The field service report showed a very healthy increase in subscriptions obtained, placement of individual magazines and back-calls. The branch servant gives us a number of interesting experiences, real-life stories of Nicaragua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your visit here in December was greatly appreciated by all the brothers and we have tried to put to work the good counsel given. In the case of magazine work we have made good improvement. The publishers when going from house to house in the magazine work often hear such comments as the following: “I’m glad you called on me, I know I should be studying this magazine.” As one publisher approached a house, the man came running out and said: “I haven’t got time right now, I’m going to work, but if you come Saturday I’ll subscribe for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s film “The New World Society in Action” has greatly helped and encouraged the brothers. As soon as the picture is over nearly everyone wishes to know when he can see it again. It was shown in a village of about 1,200 population where there is a congregation of about twenty publishers. They obtained the use of an open-air theater and invited everyone in the village to come. On the outside of the theater were two large loud-speakers through which the owner made announcements and played music. For the showing of the picture he forgot to disconnect these from the amplifier, so standing inside the theater were about 800 persons, but the rest of the village heard the whole two-hour explanation of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. The New World society was the main topic of conversation in that village for days thereafter. It shows that all in Jehovah’s organization are workers, happy workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An elderly publisher with great effort got out of his sick bed to attend a circuit assembly and be baptized. Soon thereafter he died, and, though his last words were a witness to Jehovah, his family did not respect his wishes to be buried by Jehovah’s witnesses, but they obtained the services of a Protestant clergyman. While the witnesses could not preach the funeral sermon they could attend. The clergyman was greatly upset at their presence and very unconvincingly preached the dead brother up into heaven. Later, on the way to the cemetery, as the witnesses walked along they comforted those with hearing ears with the Scriptural truth concerning the dead and the hope of a resurrection. Three members of this man’s family began to study with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">“Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.”—Isa. 65:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No matter where one goes, Jehovah’s servants in the earth are joyful. Those who are opposing the New World society are saying: “Cannot something be done to stop these Jehovah’s witnesses? They are spoiling our work all over the country.” So the wail of the clergy arises. That is the way it is in Nigeria. It has been reported that some clergymen have asked the government authorities to stop Jehovah’s witnesses. The government authorities have told the clergy: “You have only your own laziness to blame. It’s your own fault.” The African people can see the difference between truth and righteousness and lies and wickedness, and those persons who love righteousness and who hate the abominations that exist in the earth are going to be gathered together just the same as other sheep in other lands, and so a great crowd has made itself manifest and they sing for joy of heart. The branch servant in Nigeria sends in reports on the countries of Nigeria, Cameroun and Dahomey. Our brothers there have had some very interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The past year’s activities have been bursting with happy experiences as thousands of publishers have advanced into new territories. Everywhere they have been met with joyful expressions of interest on the one hand and bitter wails of protest on the other. One brother undergoing treatment in a leper colony had, by the time of his discharge, brought fourteen inmates into the truth and baptized them all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one experience a catechist ran into the house and locked the door when a publisher approached. He had been warned by the bishop. Challenged by the neighbors, he sneaked off to the church committee in a desperate attempt to stop the lecture advertised for the next day. The committee won over the village chief who made a proclamation that everybody was to leave the village an hour before the lecture. When the time came, the chief’s messenger went around clanging a big bell to warn the people to go. Everybody cleared out to another village— including the publishers. Of course, the lecture was given. It only meant a change of location.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christian conduct under trying conditions often brings unexpected fruitage. In one isolated territory mobsters came in force to break up a public talk. They set up a terrific din and drowned out the speaker. Next night they repeated the process, even more so. Undaunted, a third talk was put on. This time, silence. What had happened? The mobsters were quietly sitting in the audience. “You have won,” the brothers were told.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For a circuit assembly, application was made to the chief of the town for land on which to erect a large bamboo booth to house the assembly. Overreached by the local religionists, he refused permission. So a move was made to the next village, where permission was obtained to build on the Methodist school playing field. News quickly spread and the clergyman came rushing down. “Let Jehovah’s witnesses build on that field and I will deprive you of all your church offices,” said the clergyman to the chiefs. No effect, so off to the bishop. The bishop sent a letter to the chiefs threatening to close the Methodist school if they allowed the use of the field. The bishop’s letter was read to the assembled village. The circuit servant was present and asked to address the gathering. Permission granted, he took the bishop’s false charges one by one and disproved them before the gathering. To avoid any ill feeling, the circuit servant suggested that the booth (now completed) be moved to another location. Immediate response! Eighty-six townspeople came forward and volunteered to do the work. When the brothers tried to help they were told: &quot;Go and rest.” The townspeople did the entire work. Maddened, the clergyman called a big opposition meeting at the church. Alas for him, it only backfired! As soon as the sound equipment started most of the crowd left the church and came over to the assembly. There were 1,460 gathered. That was just too much. The clergyman took to his heels and fled the village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As an example of the high esteem in which Jehovah’s witnesses are held comes this experience. A certain youth organization had planned to stage a riot against the chiefs and local council over certain uncorrected grievances. Before starting, however, they decided to go to the local congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses and ask for advice. Bibles were brought out and Scriptural examples presented and explained. Heated tempers soon cooled off and the projected riot never came off. Instead, a peaceful delegation went to the chiefs and satisfaction was obtained.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During the year wonderful progress has been made in this French African territory. Everything is on the upgrade. The year’s activities have been outstanding in several ways. For instance, this past year has been the first time the brothers have enjoyed circuit assemblies within the country. Police and government authorities have shown a spirit of tolerance and good will, granting the brothers freedom of worship throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a certain town, the center of a very extensive territory, there is a small congregation of only nine publishers, whose activities are constantly harassed by the opposition of one of the “evil slave” class. On visiting the congregation the circuit servant saw the need for drastic action to combat the opposition and put the congregation on its feet. Surrounding congregations were asked to help and an intensive campaign lasting six days was held. Almost every house within a ten-kilometer radius was visited and between Tuesday and Sunday evening no less than eighteen public talks were given. At the congregation </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study, service meeting and book study, the attendances that week were ninety-three, sixty-three and eighty-five respectively, mostly local interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Both the circuit servants were able to attend the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly in Paris, and undoubtedly the experience and instruction received will be put to good use in the coming year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark310"></a>DAHOMEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population Highest Number of Ministers Preaching 1,523,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1948: 106 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955 : 796</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The past service year has seen good progress in this French African colony; it has also seen mounting opposition. A party of more than fifty Nigerian publishers crossed the border to work isolated territory in Dahomey. They joined a special pioneer in Dahomey, but had not worked long before the entire party was rounded up and taken to the local prison. The prison being too small, all the sisters and a few brothers were released, while twenty-seven brothers, including the special pioneer, who was regarded as the ringleader, were detained. Later they were transferred to another prison deep in the interior of the country to await trial on the charge of distributing forbidden publications. All the time they were held these brothers were busy preaching and at least eighteen persons became interested among other prisoners and the prison officers, including the prison doctor. On August 25 they were brought to trial. News of the affair had spread tar and wide and when they were brought to the court more than 1,600 people had assembled, including Catholic “Fathers” from a wide area, who had been telling the people that the brothers would each be getting twelveyear sentences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The judge was very favorable and allowed a good witness to be given in court. He likened them to Jesus, who was brought to trial although he had never committed any offense. Three-month sentences were passed on the majority, but these would count from the time of their arrest, meaning that all will very shortly be released. The judge expressed his regrets at having to pass sentence. During the month of August the imprisoned brothers sent in a report of more than 100 hours’ witnessing for each one, altogether more than 3,000 hours. This incident has brought the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses into the public eye in a manner that could never have been accomplished otherwise.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark311"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark312"></a>NORTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population Highest Number of Ministers Preaching 3,132,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945 : 4,953 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955 : 26,951</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The branch servant in this country looks after quite a bit of territory: Northern Rhodesia, Belgian Congo, Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda. Reports have come in from these different countries showing how the work is reaching out into all sections and to all kinds of people, and Jehovah’s witnesses are bringing joy and gladness to their hearts. It is truly wonderful how the New World society spreads itself over all of these lands. Such could only be accomplished by the spirit of Jehovah God, for all of these people are interested in preaching the good news of the Kingdom and helping people to prepare themselves for life in the new world of righteousness. There is a unity and oneness even though they come from many tribes and speak many different tongues. The branch servant gives us many interesting experiences pertaining to these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Advancement is in large measure due to the training program and the using of three- to eight-minute sermons. With the limited territory available in this country the publishers do not need to hurry to cover it. Time has been spent talking to householders; but now publishers are learning to make that time really count, with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">prepared</span><span class="font5"> sermons, backed up with Scriptural proof. It has resulted in more literature being placed in the field. Over the Christmas holiday period the brothers put this training to good use. One congregation found the people in a questioning mood, asking why Jehovah’s witnesses do not believe in Christmas. They not only answered the questions in house-to-house work, but arranged for a special public talk. The fifty publishers were thrilled to see 395 persons attend this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where the literacy program has been pushed, this continues to be a great blessing. The new </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Reading Aid</span><span class="font5"> has been a big help. One congregation of 148 publishers now has 138 able to read, with nineteen having learned in the last six months, using the new reading aid. About 1,000 associated with the New World society were taught to read during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without doubt the film “The New World Society in Action” has been a powerful instrument in the expansion in this land. So far we have not been able to show it to all the brothers, but where it has been shown it has “revolutionized many minds,” to quote one of the circuit servants. He further reported: “While the brothers were working on circuit assembly preparations and demolition afterward, they had this watchword, ‘Let us work like the New World society in action.' They would remind one another, ‘Are we following that pattern?’ So among the brothers it has become a watchword and a pattern.” A publisher remarked: “Surely if one is lazy he cannot be found among such hard-working people; this should be our standard for working for the new world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The tactful conduct of the brothers and their not “returning evil for evil” have caused even opposers to be ashamed and look into the truth. A violent opposer came before a local court and was found guilty, and it was decided to fine and perhaps imprison him. The brothers said they did not want the man to go to prison, they just wanted him to be warned not to continue interfering with Jehovah’s witnesses. When the opposer heard this he was ashamed, expressed his sorrow, and asked for literature and for calls to be made at his home so that he could learn more about the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a headman who always opposed the truth, preferring to spend his time at “beer drinks” and in hunting than listening to the Kingdom message. One day a “beer drink” was broken up in disorder —by a lion! And this man found himself in his grass hut with the lion trying to break down the flimsy door. His worldly “friends” deserted him to his fate. But his calls for help were heard by a pioneer and a group of publishers, who managed to scare off the lion and rescue him. This headman now attends the local Kingdom Hall, and, following a public talk shortly after the incident, another headman and seven villagers gave their names to be called on for Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year there have been some industrial upsets, with large strikes of African labor on the copper mines. An African political organization was apparently back of much of the disturbance and it stirred up much persecution against the African witnesses, because of their neutral attitude during the agitations. There were some cases of violence. One brother was attacked by four assailants in the dark. In the desperate struggle that followed, one of the assailants was fatally injured. The brother took him to the hospital, then reported the whole matter to the police. At the subsequent hearing he was absolved of any responsibility. Under cover of this wave of antagonism two of the largest Kingdom Halls were burned to the ground. The brothers were not dismayed, but continued on in an orderly and peaceable way in their Christian work. They are planning to rebuild their Kingdom Halls, this time as more permanent structures. The brothers’ calm conduct and refusal to take sides in such disputes have had a powerful impression on the minds of thinking persons up and down the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are some who associate with the New World society who do not appreciate </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">theocratic</span><span class="font5"> organization. In some congregations individuals, trying to follow the worldly political way of doing things, have caused some unrest. Last year one congregation was badly disrupted by a group of such men who challenged the theocratic organization. They were disfellowshiped. For a time the publishers were unsettled; but then they got to see that they were dealing with Jehovah’s organization, and they ceased looking to individuals and got back to the preaching work. Jehovah blessed them, and now a year later this congregation has been divided into three! Certainly only in submission to Jehovah and his theocratic organization is the way of New World prosperity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The ban continues against the work of Jehovah’s witnesses and the Society in the Congo. The work is much misrepresented and the purpose of the Society misunderstood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Honest and faithful work in their secular occupations is a way in which the brothers overcome prejudice. A brother worked in a library run by a religious organization. His fellow workers complained about him to the European pastor in charge. He in turn made things more difficult for the brother, assigning him to the heaviest work, and to longer hours on occasions. After several weeks the pastor confessed: “I understand that you worship the true God, because if I had given the same work as I had given you to those who accused you they would have been impertinent. You are not alone. There are many back home in my country in America. I am sorry that the Congo government will not permit you to worship Him.” The next morning when the others arrived for work, the pastor took the office keys from their hands and gave them to the brother, saying: “Now I have confidence in you.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The meetings are small and there are no dedicated brothers who can handle them, so we have a sister serving as congregation servant at Nairobi. But the new ones who attend find one advantage in the small meetings, since they feel they can share in the commenting. Some attending for the first time have raised their hands and asked: “May I try?” Of course they may, for in such way they learn to express themselves about the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers are anxious to see the work progress and wish they could have some mature assistance. But in the meantime they make use of all the ways they can to further the Kingdom interests. For instance, though without any brother to give a public talk, a special meeting was held on April 3 at the time of the release of the new booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is “the Light of the World”?</span><span class="font5"> and this was read over among those gathered. They were very happy to have an attendance of eighteen for this meeting. It is not possible to have advertised public talks, and there are also other problems facing the publishers in the face of the continued disturbed conditions due to the Mau Mau.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The work in this land continues to make good progress and during the year two new congregations were enrolled. In addition a special pioneer moved into the capital toward the end of the service year. When he arrived there he found ten persons already meeting together and he is organizing them for study and service. We hope that another congregation will be formed there during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At one estate the circuit servant was invited to the home of the manager for a discussion and had the opportunity of witnessing to him and two visitors, one of whom was a doctor. The subject of eating blood was raised, and they were astonished to get the scriptures cited that gave the answer. Two bound books and six magazines were placed in this home. It certainly must have been an eye opener for Europeans to have such Bible questions answered for them in this way. All three sharing in the discussion with the circuit servant were of the Catholic faith, and it was encouraging to find such alert interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brothers in Tanganyika are continuing to mature in New World living and seek to conform to the theocratic standards in their personal lives. When the matter of marriage registration was brought to their attention, one congregation immediately made strenuous efforts to get all their marriages registered. However, the chief would not co-operate at first. The branch office contacted the district commissioner and he has made arrangements for the chief to issue certificates to the brothers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There has been good progress in Uganda, during the year some publishers from other lands came into the territory to swell the few publishers already there. An Indian brother arrived to take up employment on a tea plantation. Though isolated, he immediately began to publish and is sending in regular reports of his preaching activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sister started a study with a Catholic and had the thrill of seeing her begin to grasp the truth, finally leading her to casting aside her crucifix. This goodwill person soon remarked that ‘there was a noticeable improvement in her two children, for they were learning obedience and had even begun to talk about the truth.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The importance of regular back-calling is shown in the following experience. After accepting the truth, the new “sheep” told the publisher who had made the calls on her that ‘she used to dread the sister’s calling, and thought of all sorts of excuses to avoid her!’ But despite herself she began to get interested through the regular calls of the publisher. She began to talk to her children and finally to her husband, who had been not at all interested. Finally, all four of the family accepted the truth. Unfortunately, their taking their stand did not swell the number of publishers in Uganda, for they shortly returned to England. But they now had the truth and would continue to preach it along with the New World society wherever they went. The publishers in Uganda were happy that they had the privilege of helping this family thus far along the road to life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Another year has gone by with happy service on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses in this rugged country. Here, like in all parts of the world, they could use more pioneers, but to do pioneer work by some of their fiords really requires a hardworking man. The territory is mountainous and scattered and there are all kinds of weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the people are interested, for when a circuit servant or pioneer does get to meet them, he finds people with hearing ears. Individuals in this world who are isolated like to hear something that brings them great comfort, and the truth is the most wholesome message that could be given to anyone. The branch servant relates some interesting experiences that have taken place in Norway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the conclusion of the year climaxed our blessings with the great convention in Stockholm, Sweden. Over 2,000 of the Norwegian brothers were able to attend this convention. Many had not attended a convention larger than with 100 in attendance and they were indeed impressed with the many thousands at Johanneshov Sports Place. The Society arranged for one extra train from Bergen to Oslo and then two extra trains from Oslo to Stockholm with 1,600 brothers. From Trondheim and Narvik extra coaches were coupled to the regular trains. Many traveled by private cars and buses. At the convention we received a new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font5"> This we will have to start the new service year with and surely many new ones will be helped to an understanding of Jehovah’s will and purpose and to serving him by its use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here are a few of the many blessed experiences our brothers have had in this country as they have gone forth preaching: A pioneer reports that as he was going from house to house he was told by a man he witnessed to not to go to the home of Mr. S—— living down the street, as he always got worked up over religious questions. The brother did not pay particular attention to this admonition but called on all the homes on the street. When he came to the home of Mr. S---- he found a man seriously interested in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bible and its teachings. He had tried to get a better Bible understanding by attending different religious organizations, but never could get satisfied, and this troubled him. His questions to the pioneer were answered from the Bible. A study was started and it was not long till he started to bear faithful witness of Jehovah’s purposes to others. The neighbors as well as the man who advised our pioneer about Mr. S---</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">commented later that the teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses had had a good effect on Mr. S---. He had</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">become a different man; now he was happy and contented. Yes, but that was because he had gotten all his religious questions answered from the Bible in a way no one had been able to do before. A study was also started with the man advising the pioneer not to call on Mr. S----.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The use of the Bible in giving three- to eight-minute sermons at the doors is most effective. A congregation publisher in door-to-door work met a lady. She listened very attentively to his sermon and meekly asked if he would come in. She believed that it was enough to study the Greek Scriptures and not the Hebrew. The publisher showed her from the Bible how the Greek Scriptures often refer to and quote from the Hebrew. She decided to investigate more. This she has done and also attended public meetings held by the congregation as well as other meetings. She has resigned from the State church and takes part in the service as much as she can, in spite of the fact she is to have a baby in about a month. She commented that what impressed her when called on by the publisher was that he used the Bible. She had attended church a whole year hoping to learn something about the Bible but found out nothing. She had prayed that God might send some one to her to help her learn more about the Bible. She is most happy to have found Jehovah’s witnesses, and we are equally happy to have found her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We need many more pioneers,” writes a circuit servant. “I gave a public talk in a private home here on this island with only twenty houses on it. There were thirteen in attendance. After the talk the people were not content with just that but had many questions, so we talked together for two more hours. The rest of the week I visited two other isolated places across the fiord. It is about twenty years since they have heard anything about the truth. In the first hour I placed seven books in six homes. All wanted literature. One was so impressed with the message that he wanted to help advertise the public talk. He brought several along with him to the talk also. Studies can be started with dozens of people in this section. There are thousands along these fiords who have never or seldom heard of Jehovah’s witnesses and the New World society. I get pains in my stomach when I think of all these people and their crying need to hear the truth. There is room for fifty pioneers in this circuit. But where shall we get them? I try with all my might to get more pioneers. I am glad we got two in Bron-noysund. There will soon be results there. Thank you for now.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">There is yet much work to be done among Jehovah’s witnesses in Nyasaland and the training program is an aid to that end. The brothers have been very slow, though, in starting it and fully appreciating the value of it. The branch servant says that now the circuit servants are keeping themselves very busy in the congregations, showing the brothers the right course to take in instructing others to preach the sermons as they go from place to place. Our brothers in Nyasaland and also in Portuguese East Africa have their problems, and while the work moves along in Nyasaland it does not go so well in Portuguese East Africa because of the opposition and persecution to the work in that land. There is a great dislike to the preaching of the good news in that part of the world. The branch servant sets out some of the experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Looking at the country as a whole we seem to be getting past the shaking that has followed “Keeping the Organization Clean,” and putting an end to common-law marriages, establishing the legal and recognized form of marriage in its stead, and the reorganization of the congregations in 1954.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer tells how six young schoolboys made a right decision. “The six young brothers who went to school have returned to their homes because the mission-run school refused to allow them to continue with their preaching work. They were given the choice of stopping witnessing or of leaving school. They left school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“When twenty-eight interested friends heard of this their own interest in the truth increased and six of them also became active witnesses, thus bringing the number in the congregation up to thirty-one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;In retaliation, as it were, the elder of the local ‘church’ gave orders to his flock that if any of Jehovah’s witnesses go around preaching they were to be beaten up. The result was that on the following day while we were out preaching we were surrounded by a gang and knocked about. But instead of this incident’s frightening the people it merely served to stimulate their interest in the message and, much to the despair and vexation of the elder, his two sons decided to join us. The news of these happenings has gotten around and now when I go to buy fish on the lake shore the vendors insist upon giving me the fish free.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A circuit servant explains how a subchief reacted to the request made to him by members of a certain mission that he should not permit Jehovah’s witnesses to preach in his area. He said to them: “I am surprised that you are trying to influence me to keep Jehovah’s witnesses out of my area. I find them a quiet and well-behaved people. When your mission came here and I was told that you wanted to teach the people about God I thought that the number of court cases would begin to decline, but that has not been the case. My court records are full of the names of your followers for drunkenness, stealing, assault and immorality. I am a heathen and have eight wives, but all of them are known as my wives and my children are by them, but you pick up pregnancies anywhere. So I would much rather see all of my people become Jehovah’s witnesses, who have a better way of life.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The decrease in publishers in this country is not because there is lack of interest among the people but rather because of the government’s attitude toward our work and organization. They have seized all servants in various parts of the country and deported them; some of these brothers have been away since 1946.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We know that there is interest in many centers, but there is no one to bring them together and to show them how to engage in the service. Some of these talk to their friends but do not report, because they do not know how to do so. Still they preach and others get to hear, and if the way is ever opened up to the work we should be able to contact many, many friends all over the place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the district officials where there are quite a number of publishers has satisfied himself that they are a law-abiding group and makes no move to stop them from witnessing excepting to caution them to be careful in what they say and do. The country needs many more such liberal-minded men to bring to the people more of a semblance of freedom than they have under the present conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another official called in a number of the brothers and asked them many questions, some of which were on the Bible itself. They must have given him satisfactory answers because he let them return to their homes but with the caution ‘not to preach any more.’ They are of course doing what the apostles did in their day under similiar circumstances.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">For twelve months there was an average of eleven pioneers and fifty-three congregational publishers going through the land of Pakistan to find people of good will. To do this in a country that is practically 100 per cent Moslem places upon the servants of God a real task. Some of the parts of the territory that have been worked steadily for two years have not produced any results, but those of the New World society still have hope that some will be found who will take to the Christian faith and gain life in the new world. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences that will be enjoyed by all the readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most of our village work has been done by a single missionary who spends all his time in the villages. Unlike the regular sectarian missionary who travels in cars and merely directs the preaching of native catechists, this brother braves the Punjab’s terrific heat on a pedal cycle, covering hundreds of miles. Loaded in front, behind and on both sides, he looks more like some world tourist! Everything is carried with him: literature, clothing, Bible and, yes, even his bedding! He sleeps where he can, with Christians, with Moslems, with cattle, in houses, native </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">bazaars,</span><span class="font5"> huts or bams or out in the field under the stars. He eats what comes his way, generally things offered by appreciative contacts or purchased from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">bazaar.</span><span class="font5"> The folk just love this brother with his simple ways, and he has found many responsive hearts in these villages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The response has been that they have opened up schools and churches and invited him to preach to them. Afterward they have gladly taken literature and then, to disprove the allegation that all are “rice” Christians, offered financial aid out of their meager resources. In preaching he has found that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things” </span><span class="font5">helps bridge the language barrier, for he will select a subject in that and just get one of the audience to read the text cited from their Punjabi Bible. A few words of comment, then on to the next citation. This method he has found very effective. Just as this report is being typed a letter arrives from him in which he says: “Today I contacted a man who was associated with the I.B.S.A. long years ago, and he told me he had just been praying to God to send those truth people once again when I arrived. The whole village turned out to hear me preach and everybody rejoiced.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We had another Moslem dedicate himself during the year. Such can do so only in the face of much persecution and opposition. This one, elderly and frail, has shown younger good-will persons that when the mind is set it can be done. He was attacked in his most vulnerable point—through his young daughters, the persecutors taunting them, abusing them and threatening them with worse. Fearing but not wavering, he sought a way of escape, which meant his scant income was cut to half to provide. He put them in a school where they would have protection through the day. So now each day he leaves them at school personally at seven in the morning, and then proceeds to his office, where he lies on a stretch of grass in the pleasant morning sun reading his beloved </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures</span><span class="font5"> in the full stare of passing Moslems, undaunted. An old man, but the spirit of youth within.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An opportunity came for two missionaries to present the teachings of Christianity to the Islamia section of the Punjab University. The students, all Moslems, came prepared to attack the doctrine of the “trinity,” but were disarmed because the speaker himself exposed the falseness of that pagan teaching and instead exalted the true God, Jehovah. In the second talk of the series the truths on the ransom by Jesus Christ were logically presented, a teaching that is repugnant to Islam. This the students tried to attack by claiming the Bible had been changed, which is the regular refuge of the cornered Moslem. So that opened up the way for the next of the series, which was the authenticity of the Bible. Here an array of proof was submitted that neither students nor professor could refute, and we left them with the feeling that it had been a great victory for Jehovah’s organization and that the opposers had been left with the uncomfortable alternative choice of either admitting these facts, thus denying their Quran, or else proving them false, which they cannot do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">News of this soon got around among the local “Christians.” Were they glad to see the Bible vindicated? Not at all. They called a special meeting and decided that Watch Tower missionaries should not be allowed entry into the country!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year there was much publicity in the English and vernacular papers against the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font5"> These letters were mostly from Moslems, but supported also by a leading “Christian.” The outcome was that because it “contains matter which outrages the religious feelings of Muslims throughout Pakistan” it has been proscribed by the government.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The past year was one of the most prosperous years the New World society has had in Panama in the Canal Zone and they are delighted with the privileges of service they have during these last days of the Devil’s organization. They rejoice in preaching the good news. Even though the Panama Canal would be a strategic spot for an atomic war to break forth in order to cripple world traffic and movement, still Jehovah’s witnesses are not afraid of any evil tidings. They have a work to do and people to talk to and the people they talk to live in Panama. So they rejoice and look forward to the grand day when righteousness will fill the earth. The branch servant gives us a number of interesting experiences and we print them here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in the service year the publishers were given high hopes of continued increase when they learned of the intended visit of Brother Knorr in December when English and Spanish assemblies would be held. With ever-increasing enthusiasm preparations were made for the biggest assemblies yet. New publishers who had never attended such spiritual feasts, and mature publishers who remembered previous visits of the Society’s president, were looking forward to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The announcement by the Society of a new booklet to be left with everyone during the month of April was startling to many because of the possibility it afforded those with whom studies were being conducted to have part in the ministry. The servants of each congregation made arrangements for action and on each service meeting further information was brought out, with demonstrations showing how to aid the new and irregular ones to share in distribution, of the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The circuit work has done much toward finding and building up isolated interest. While traveling from one congregation to another in the interior one circuit servant found an interested family and wrote: “Since they had no money we accepted a chicken in exchange for the three books. The father of the young married man kept insisting that they were Catholic and should not accept any other literature, but due to the younger man’s determination they kept it. Six months later we found the father a changed person. The son had read all three books and it was astounding to note the knowledge he had gained without any other help. The father had the wife to make coffee for us and paid very close attention as we started a study and Introduced them to the use of the Bible. They were already convinced that this is the truth and had been telling their neighbors that God’s name is Jehovah, at the same time explaining that this religion was not </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cuadrada</span><span class="font5"> (Four Square Gospel), but that this was the truth. The young man wants a Bible and wanted to know what he should do to ‘continue with this Society.’ We are anxiously awaiting our next opportunity to visit there and help them more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in the Canal Zone presents special problems but is not a whit behind the rest of the country in theocratic advancement, as a missionary there writes: “Several military posts are included in our assignment and although we nave not been able to do door-to-door work there, nevertheless the truth is reaching honest ears. The dedicated wife of an officer on one of the posts by her excellent example of preaching, training her children and attending all the congregation meetings had a good influence on her husband. He began attending the meetings, started talking among his associates, placed literature with some and invited them to the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses. One young man responded wholeheartedly, but thought his wife would not like to attend as she was very Catholic. However, April 3 she heard the public talk, liked it and agreed to have a home Bible study. The progress of this young couple has been remarkable, and the Bible, so recently a closed book, especially to the wife, has become their guide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That same month of April both of them started in the field service and have been sharing in it regularly since.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">There is still much work to be done in this land, and even though the witness has been given there by publishers for many, many years, we do not find any outstanding growth or ingathering of the other sheep. Still there are interested people and they must be talked to and the missionaries along with the congregational publishers and pioneers have been doing it very well during the past year. Undoubtedly there are many more people of good will to be gathered, for there are hundreds of small towns throughout the country where no publishers have ever been. If we could reach them, the brothers feel sure there would be a greater growth. The branch servant sets out some of their experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in the service year we had our district assembly. After months of searching and making applications we finally obtained an outside hall, which is the first we have been able to use for some years, owing to Catholic pressure on the hall owners and the police. During the assembly the importance of the training program, back-call and Bible study activity was stressed, also the need for increased distribution of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines. Many of the congregations worked hard on these points during the service year and have shown good improvement. One missionary made it his goal to place at least some magazines each day. In this way he placed over 500 magazines in one month and during the entire service year he placed over 2,500. Other brothers have found that by making wise use of the time while traveling many magazines can be placed. During one train journey one brother and sister placed over twenty magazines. When one applies the counsel from Jehovah’s theocratic organization results are always gained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The film “The New World Society in Action” was used extensively during the first part of the service year with excellent success. This made an impression on the brothers and the good-will persons alike and helped them appreciate the vastness and the unity of the New World society. In just a two-week period over 1,700 people saw the film in the rural districts. In most of the places electricity was not available, so it was necessary to take along a generator in order to produce our own power. At times transportation was difficult; many times we had to travel for many hours by horses and wagon or oxcart. In one German-speaking colony where there is a family of good will we were given the local hall free of charge for the showing of the film. The problem then presented itself of how to let all the people know about it. The person of good will had the answer. He took some of the handbills over to the school and gave each of the children one to take home. In this way and with just half a day’s advertising by one of the missionaries 227 were present for the film.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many times after heavy rains the roads are closed to all traffic here in Paraguay. This happened just before one of our circuit assemblies; so when Friday arrived, there were only eight or nine brothers present. It was decided to change the program until Saturday when more of the brothers were expected by train. But when the time drew near for the evening program to start, the assembly hall began to fill up, not with brothers but with strangers of good will from the local town. These listened very intently as a public talk was given explaining the work of Jehovah’s witnesses and the prospects that were set before all lovers of righteousness. Literature was placed with many after the talk and quite a number were present for all the assembly sessions thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was decided that the hall would be too small for the film on the following evening, so a place was prepared in the open air, where 350 attended. This was too much for the local priest. An endeavor was made by him to break up the meeting by having some of the town hooligans throw stones among the crowd. The police were sent for and were soon there to give us protection. This action of the priest caused a great division to take place in the town, many coming to us to apologize for his bad actions.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark330"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark331"></a>PERU</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population Highest Number of Ministers Preaching 8,493,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1947 : 30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955 : 563</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in this pleasant land are thankful to Jehovah for his kindness in providing so many wonderful opportunities to preach the good news of the Kingdom and to have such grand experiences with people who are happy to know God’s Word. There is still plenty of territory to work in this land, and scarcely enough to cover it as far as publishers are concerned. However, excellent progress was made during the year, and it is hoped as more people take to the truth in Peru a reaching-out work can be done systematically in order to proclaim the good news in all of that country. The branch servant sent in a number of experiences, but two of them are outstanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Increased Kingdom work very often brings more opposition out into the open. Nine months ago a special pioneer went to work in the territory of a small congregation not far from Lima. There were three or four publishers at the time. He soon found others who were interested in Jehovah’s purposes and was able to establish studies with them. This activity began to arouse the ire of the local priest, but the climax came about this way:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He contacted a young man who professed to be a Communist. Not having a right basis in the proper principles of living, he led a life in line with this world, living loosely and having very little regard for the feelings of others, even his own family. This young man listened to the truth and accepted it. He began to preach, and in his own family he met with trouble. His father was a spiritist, his brother an altar boy, his sister an instructor in the Catholic church, and his mother had lost faith in everything. They almost threw him out of the house when he preached to them, but, acting under the good counsel of the pioneer, the boy exercised patience, and naturally changed his life, becoming kind and considerate. This impressed the family, who began to listen to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They naturally talked about him to the priest, who, being unable to answer his arguments from the Bible, resorted to abuse, and this helped the entire family to see the truth. In about three months the family came along in the truth, and at a recent assembly all were baptized—all due to the soundness of the Word of life and to the change that it wrought in the boy. All participate in the service regularly, and the mother now has a route of fifteen persons to whom she delivers the magazines as they come out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Now</span><span class="font5"> the priest is very irate. He denounces them publicly, has torn up magazines in the street, has openly told others of his flock that they should not read the Bible because “it is of the Devil,’’ but at the same time he is advertising the work of Jehovah's witnesses. The pioneer brother says: “Sometimes when I think of what is going on I feel awed by it. We never used to have many at the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study, but now we have about fifty. Our small service meetings have grown to over thirty in attendance, and last month we had the great joy of reaching a new peak in publishers—twenty-four in all. We know now how opposition is defeated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The tracts are being used in this country to good advantage, as the following experience shows. Some missionaries in the north, in a place swamped by various Protestant religions, left a tract on the trinity with a young boy who works on a large </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">hacienda</span><span class="font5"> (farm). He realized the truth of the matter and talked about it with some neighbors, who were members of the Pilgrim Holiness church. They took the tract and looked up all the scriptures, and were amazed to see that the Bible does not teach a trinity. Naturally they took the point up with their “pastor,” who was shaken to his pagan foundations, and, being unable to answer, he disfellow-shiped them from the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, that did not disanimate these good people. They procured some other literature of the Society and continued studying, and when the missionaries went out there again they were warmly welcomed as brothers. They were also invited to stay for the study that night, but as it would be rather late the missionaries asked if it would be possible to have the study a little earlier. The husband left to advise the study group, and soon they began to come in, in twos and threes with their Bibles under their arms. Soon seventeen persons were present, and this group had been studying </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> for some time. They had left all that they were doing in order to come to the study. As the missionary said: “We were so overcome by the sincerity of these people that our throats got lumpy.” In all, twenty people have so far come out of the Pilgrim Holiness church because of one tract on the trinity. How wonderful it is to see the operation of Jehovah’s spirit on those of good will toward him!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark332"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark333"></a>PHILIPPINES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population Highest Number of Ministers Preaching 20,246,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945 : 2,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955 : 24,169</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s undeserved kindness was very manifest in the Philippines during the past year, for through his goodness he has gathered together thousands of persons of good will into his New World society. It is interesting to observe how the pioneer work has increased in the Philippines during the last years. This undoubtedly has much to do with the splendid increase in the number of new publishers associating themselves with the organization. The experiences that the branch servant relates in his report are very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fifty pioneers who showed the best qualifications were selected and appointed to the special pioneer service in unassigned territories. They have worked hard and done well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One missionary was standing in front of a shop to check some scriptures in his Bible while working In a business area. In succession, two men came up to him inquiring whether that was the Bible he was reading and if they could have a copy for themselves. He placed two Bibles on the spot. Another writes: “A man of good will watched us going from house to house and knew his place was the next to be called on the following day. He stayed home from work purposely so he would not miss us. This was quite a sacrifice considering the scarcity of employment here. The result was a Bible study with his two sisters and his brother-in-law. They are all learning the truth together.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A publisher spoke to a man selling books at a sidewalk stand. The man was interested. Week after week he called back and conducted a Bible study while standing in the shade of a telephone pole for protection from the blazing heat of the tropical sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A congressman’s wife obtained subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> and took four </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font5"> books for her friends. A study was arranged. When the publisher called back, she had a circle of chairs arranged, obviously expecting others to join in the study. They did. Excusing herself for a few minutes, she went out and gathered her friends. A lively study followed and many Bible questions were answered. Later the witness met her husband, who said that his mother had been a Catholic all her life but for the last four years she had learned the truth and became one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He said: “Jehovah’s witnesses are the only people who really live up to the principles of the Bible. If you convince my wife to become a witness I shall be very happy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A brother was invited to discuss the Bible with a factory worker and ten of his fellow employees. They were intelligent and well-educated young men who were filled with the doctrines of their Catholic religion but open-minded enough to consider what the Bible had to say. After several studies on subjects such as the “trinity” and the “soul,” a systematic study of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font5"> was started with about six of the most interested ones. On its completion they began to study </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Recently four of them came to visit the branch office. They were all very much impressed with what they saw as an example of the New World society in action. One remarked: “More people should see this place for themselves and they would certainly change their attitude toward Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A lady received a copy of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Way Is Love.</span><span class="font5"> She inquired about a Tagalog Bible and obtained one on the next call together with a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font5"> The publisher showed her how she could study her Bible with the aid of the book. The first week she read through Genesis and Exodus and found out that it was wrong to use images in worship. Some time later a young man for whom she was ^‘godmother” visited her and told her that she would have to give up studying with Jehovah’s witnesses or he would no longer recognize her as his godmother. Her reply? “You can do as you wish, but I will continue to study with Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The same lady remarked to a publisher: “All my life I had been a Catholic and when I went to church no one ever greeted me or looked at me. The first time I attended one of your gatherings someone I never met before bought me a soda drink, found me a seat and did everything to make me welcome and comfortable. What a wonderful organization!”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark334"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark335"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">26,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Word comes through from Poland that they would like to express themselves in the words of the apostle Paul: “We are pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement; we are perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out; we are persecuted, but not left in the lurch; we are thrown down, but not destroyed.” (2 Cor. 4: 8, 9, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> The authorities in government have tried to break up Jehovah’s witnesses, but they have found them to be the “most stubborn opponents.” All other religions in the country are controlled by the state, but the state does not know how to make Jehovah’s witnesses submit to Communist belief. Every effort is put forth by the government and their police to find what they call the “leaders” and have them arrested, thinking that this will stop the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work has gone on wonderfully during the year, and there are more qualified, ordained ministers in Poland today than ever before. At the close of the year there were 155 brothers and thirty sisters in prison camps because of their preaching the good news. There are 169 brothers that have been put into prison for refusal to take up military service. A brother in making inquiry of a court official who handles many of the cases of Jehovah’s witnesses asked whether any of Jehovah’s witnesses were ever sentenced because of murder or theft, and the reply was: “No, these people are in prison only because they stick to the principles of their faith.” We are proud of our brothers in Poland and our prayers ascend to Jehovah God continually for his guidance and blessing to be upon them. In many parts of the world Jehovah’s witnesses are going through tremendous trials and hardships. But where one part of the body suffers all feel the effect, and certainly it makes everyone of the New World society want to do more in praising Jehovah’s name when they see the persecution that befalls some of our brothers who live behind the iron curtain. The report from that country is excellent and some of the experiences can be published in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook. </span><span class="font6">These should bring real joy and happiness to Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere, and will make them more determined than ever to preach the good news in their assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one city of the territory served by a district servant there are so many people of good will that the publishers are not able to serve them regularly. A publisher worked a part of the street assigned to him and was about to go home, when at the end of the street he passed a four-story house and noticed someone waving his hand to him from a window. He thought it was a ruse at first, but as he passed the gate of the building he heard the reproachful remark: “Are we worse than those living at the beginning of the street? Please don’t pass us by, come up and see us too.” Upon this friendly invitation, the brother went upstairs. The flat was full of people who had already been called together from the whole house. Immediately the brother gave them a Bible talk. When he noted the addresses of those wanting further information, it was seen that almost the whole house was interested in the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In another village a circuit servant, intending to borrow a bicycle, called at one home after another of the brothers, only to find all the doors locked. Eventually he found one door open and noticed that the apartment was full of children. The brothers had brought their children to this one home, and were all busy witnessing from house to house. There are circuits now in which more than ninety per cent of the publishers have resumed this most important method of preaching the good news. Many publishers were stirred to action by the example of the circuit servants, who were the first to go from house to house although the danger of being arrested was great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one congregation a seventy-four-year-old sister was left out when the assignments were made because of her high age and the distance to travel; but although she had been a publisher only a month she firmly stated her willingness to go to the territory with other publishers. Of course ner wish was granted. There are many congregations in which the average number of hours a publisher is thirty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We would not want to leave out our youngest publishers from this report, who are still children, but who contribute to increase the heap of witness in our country. They actively engage in field service and cause wonder by the firm attitude that they show in school for Jehovah and his kingdom, and this despite the fact that they are often exposed to heavy pressure on the part of the school authorities. A thirteen-year-old boy was sent by his parents to work for a family that is being visited by Kingdom publishers. The youth listened attentively on the occasion of these visits. Soon after, he contacted a schoolboy who is one of Jehovah's witnesses and asked him many questions regarding the new world. One day he asked his mother: &quot;What would you say if I were one of Jehovah’s witnesses?” The mother did not take his words seriously and replied that she would not object. Whereupon he stated: “So, as from today I am a witness of Jehovah.” The next day in school he did not participate in the prayer concerning preparatory training. Asked why, he said he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. When the school class had an outing in the forest, he sat down with the young brother already mentioned and they read the gospel. The teacher saw it and took the book away from them, but when he saw what it was he returned it and asked them to lend it to him, as he wanted to read it too. The teacher asked the father afterward to forbid his son to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. When the father tried this, the boy stated before the teacher and the whole class: “I want to live and will therefore be one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and if you do not want to be Jehovah’s witnesses you will perish. Nobody will be able to tear out of my heart what I have taken in.” To this the father replied: “Believe, my son, what you want to believe.” He does believe now and is an exemplary publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many experiences show that a great part of the public is favorably inclined toward Jehovah’s witnesses. Here are some such experiences: In a city they called a meeting of the political, economic and administrative Activists for the purpose of unifying the fighting methods against the increased activity of the local congregation. To the question as to what to do, representatives of the party suggested dismissing Jehovah’s witnesses from employment. This was firmly opposed by representatives of the factories and works, who explained that Jehovah’s witnesses are the best and most conscientious workmen, that their dismissal would work great damage to production, the other workmen being “dull and shallow,” getting drunk and causing losses. After a long discussion the meeting was closed without a decision being reached; In another city the party organized a public meeting in a street on a Sunday. As the speaker was to talk about the atom bomb, many people came to listen. He asked the audience whether they knew that two families lived in that street who had not signed the “Peace Appeal.” Then he represented our brothers as spies, warmongers, “atom worshipers,” etc., and asked whether anyone wanted to say anything regarding this matter. Two persons standing in the front ranks, who had been hired for this, came forward and stated that they knew these two families, that they were leading an immoral life and had quarrels among themselves. Immediately a woman announced herself and remarked loudly, how one could lie so terribly. She had lived opposite these families for eight years and had never seen or heard anything of the sort. She got the support of further indignant voices and this led to such confusion that the speaker and his “witnesses” simply disappeared without a further word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a similar reaction to the slanderous reports in the press and over the radio after the trial that took place in Lodz in March. Some brothers feared that this might frighten the newly interested ones away, but there is evidence that they were strengthened thereby. A brother reports that when he and his wife, full of apprehension, went to see interested persons soon after, they immediately dispelled their fears by saying: “We could hardly wait for you to come again. We thought you had been influenced by what the papers said and would not come. Don’t worry. Jesus was persecuted too. Our faith has not weakened but grown.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Excellent progress has been made in this country during the past year. There have been many difficulties to overcome, and Jehovah’s witnesses have been diligent in looking well to the interests of the Kingdom. Portugal is a strong Catholic country and the power of the church is unquestionable. It is reported that illiteracy in Portugal is the highest of any country in Europe. And with strong Catholic influence and illiteracy our brothers have quite a problem on their hands in order to help the people get a clear understanding of Jehovah’s purposes. But good progress has been made and the following report has to do with Portugal, the Azores and Madeira.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The outstanding event of the year was the series of European assemblies, particularly those in London and Paris. For the first time ever, brothers were able to leave Portugal and attend these assemblies. A few of these brothers traveled to London, and thirteen attended the Paris assembly, indeed a wonderful experience for them in spite of not knowing the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Recently a gentleman called at the branch office to obtain all the Society’s literature in Portuguese, and to take out subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">It appears that this gentleman purchased the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life </span><span class="font5">when it was first published, but owing to his secular work that took him to many different countries of the world he never had any contact with Jehovah’s witnesses. However, he always carried this book around with him, and as soon as he retired and came to live in Lisbon he made efforts to contact the Society. Now he is very happily studying the latest literature and has expressed a desire to associate with us and help with our work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At one house a publisher placed a booklet with the maid, only to find on making the back-call that the maid had left. On the publisher’s explaining her mission to the lady of the house the latter accused her of being a Communist. After some explanation the lady realized differently, and obtained some literature herself. As a true child of the Catholic Church she took the literature to the priest to ask his opinion of the books, but on being told that she should burn them she refused, telling the priest that she would not have anyone dictate to her what she should or should not read in her own house. After studying for some time the lady began marking her Bible so that she could show her Catholic friends where their doctrines are wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another young man received a call from a publisher and immediately negatived all the publisher was saying by declaring that he was a believer in evolution and that nothing would make him alter his views. He was persuaded to take </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution versus The New World, </span><span class="font5">with the result that he too is now studying with the New World society, having obtained all the other publications.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark338"></a>AZORES</span></h2>

<p><span class="font5">There are now two organized congregations on the islands, with an additional group on another island and several isolated publishers. Organized activity is somewhat difficult owing to the scattered nature of the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From reports received, the publishers are diligently engaged in advancing the Kingdom interests, and many home Bible studies are being held in the homes of interested people. In spite of their isolated position the publishers are all standing firm against opposition, and it would seem that there are many more of the Lord’s other sheep yet to take their stand for the theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Efforts are being made to keep these isolated groups in regular contact with the Society through visits from a representative of the Society, and this will do much to strengthen and encourage these publishers for the work that yet lies ahead. The rocky islands of the Azores will yet bear much fruit and yield a good harvest of truth-hungry sheep.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During the year the one full-time pioneer who had been on Madeira about one year returned to the United States, but the local publishers whom he had helped to get started in the service continued their activities. A congregation was formed with local brothers taking the responsibility, and during the year one of the Society’s representatives from Portugal was able to make a visit and help them to organize their service activity and their meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An immersion service was held, with eight persons symbolizing their dedication by water immersion. There was also a peak of twelve publishers reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prospects on the island are therefore very good, and Jehovah’s blessing is undoubtedly with the little band of publishers who will certainly find many more people of good will during the coming year. The vineyards of Madeira are yielding much fruit to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark341"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark342"></a>PUERTO RICO</span></h2>

<p><span class="font6">The hot tropical sun shines on this beautiful island the year around, and it causes most of the people to slow down and take things easy. This is not true, however, of Jehovah’s witnesses. They realize that there is a great work to be done now that Jehovah is in his holy temple, and that while they must keep silent before him they certainly have a responsibility to make known their presence in this old world even though they are not a part of it. Wonderful progress was made in the witness work on the island of Puerto Rico itself, and the branch servant there sends in some interesting reports along with reports on the islands of St. Croix, St. John’s, St. Thomas and Tortola.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Puerto Rican brothers are not one whit behind their brothers in other parts of the earth when it comes to assemblies. Four circuit assemblies were held in different parts of the island with good witnesses being given in each place. At one assembly more persons attended than we had anticipated, through the aid of a Catholic priest. He had one of the members of his church pass through the streets with a sound car shouting invectives against the witnesses and counseling the people to have nothing to do with those “false prophets.” The number that attended soared from 178 on Friday night to 570 on Saturday night and 607 on Sunday. In one home the priest met one of the witnesses and arrogantly ordered her out of the house. The householder indignantly told him if anyone would be leaving the home it would be he.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The instructions sent out by the Society concerning the April activity were eagerly seized upon by the brothers and a tremendous witness was given from one corner of the island to the other. Seventy-five public lectures were given during the one month although there are only twenty-two congregations. The public lecture “Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is ‘the Light of the World’?” was broadcast over eight radio stations. Over 50,000 copies of the same message were placed in the hands of the public during April and May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We might mention that among the numerous activities that have kept Jehovah’s witnesses so busy in Puerto Rico the past year was the continued showing of the film. It was shown fifty-three times to 11,171 interested observers of the New World society in action.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A good witness has been given on this small island where only 12,000 people live. The thirty-seven publishers have found considerable interest with the magazines, and everyone there knows Jehovah’s witnesses. For this little island it now means going over the same territory again and again. And as time goes on, undoubtedly many more will give hearing ears.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Witnessing has been done on this island before, but now there are four regular publishers. The population of the island is so very small, only 747 reported as living there, that it hardly gives these witnesses enough to do. But it will be their task to continue to preach the good news regularly and it appears they are doing it by the amount of literature they are placing and individual magazines that are being distributed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Before 1946 there were no witnesses of Jehovah on any of the Virgin Islands. Missionaries were sent in and now we have thirty-two publishers on this particular island. A goodly number of Bible studies are in progress, taking into consideration the population. The people certainly know that Jehovah’s witnesses are around. A lawyer commenting on the popularity of Jehovah’s witnesses said the growth of Jehovah’s witnesses in the Virgin Islands has been phenomenal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The work here has gone along very well. The year started out with nine publishers and in April a new peak of fifteen was reached. And there are only 5,000 people on the island. The Society has a boat called “Light” that visits these islands from time to time, as well as smaller islands in the vicinity. All of them are under the supervision of the Puerto Rican branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the boat called at one of these islands, a householder invited a missionary into her home. On entering, the missionary found that the local minister had preceded him. This made no difference and he went ahead with his testimony, but this infuriated the clergyman. He accused Jehovah’s witnesses of being false prophets. Finally the subject of the trinity was introduced, but when it came to producing scripture the clergyman could only say, “It is a mystery.” The missionary, however, did not give up and pressed the point, indicating that it was not logical that Jehovah God and Christ Jesus were the same person, but people should accept the Bible explanation as it really is. However, the minister exploded, telling the missionary to get out of the house. Naturally, the householder was not in accord with such high-handed antics, and she expressed herself so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That same evening the clergyman was going to conduct his services at the same time and place as the missionaries. His opening remarks were: “If you want to you can listen to these heretics after I have finished.” He then proceeded to defame Jehovah’s witnesses for about an hour and a quarter. There were about forty persons present there. The missionaries were scheduled to stay two days to talk to these people, but they decided to stay four to help as many as they could. Every night they had Bible lectures, and the last night they were there fifty persons were present. The people were certainly sorry to see the missionaries leave. There is a great difference between their quiet and peaceful way of presenting God’s message of the Kingdom, to compare with the way of the clergy who want people to believe just what they think even though they are not able to prove it from God’s Word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Our faithful brothers here are forced to go underground in order to preach the good news of the Kingdom, but this has not retarded them, for they have had wonderful increases during the year. Their harvest has been good, but much pressure has been put upon them, and up to the present time there are approximately 528 of our brothers in prison. There are many people there sighing and crying because of the abominations that are done in the land. It is strictly under communistic rule. Despite this, the brothers know how to carry on the work and reach those who want to hear the joyful message of God’s new world. It has been good to learn that our brothers there received information about the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies all the way from Chicago to Nuremberg and it certainly delighted their hearts. They rejoice to know the magnitude of the New World society, and they are certainly glad that they are a part of that wonderful organization that Jehovah God has built up in these last days. They can read the Word of God in the Romanian Bible and they know it says that this good news of the Kingdom must be preached, and they are determined by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness to do it. Our prayers ascend to Jehovah God to give them protection and keep them hidden in this day of trouble so that they may continue on in their work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark351"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark352"></a>RUSSIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population 193,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">News comes through once in a while from behind the heavy walls of the iron curtain around Russia itself indicating that Jehovah’s witnesses are active and preaching the good news. But while Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching, the Soviet government is also on a rampage trying to keep them quiet, and whenever they find any of the witnesses in Russia they are immediately sent to work camps in Siberia and different parts of the vast Russian country. In talking to some recently released prisoners from Russia we learned that Jehovah’s witnesses in these various camps are in good spirits and stick close to the Bible teachings. When inquiry is made as to how many hundreds are in these camps, we are told that you should not talk about Jehovah’s witnesses in terms of hundreds, but in terms of thousands. It has been reported from one prisoner that had been transferred from one camp to another over a period of years that he found Jehovah’s witnesses in every one of the camps. While life is miserable for them, and it is terrible to be always a prisoner of the state and never have freedom to live like normal people, still wherever Jehovah’s witnesses find themselves they do preach the good news of the Kingdom, and they still remain a part of Jehovah’s New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our hearts are very warm toward these brothers of ours in Russia, and in all places throughout the world where persecution and trials befall them, but it makes us proud, too, to know that they are standing so firm that only death itself can separate them from their preaching work. One newspaper reported that an entire village was made up of Jehovah’s witnesses, and when the Communists learned of this they arrested all of them and took them away to concentration camps. So it must be that there are many of Jehovah’s witnesses both inside the camps and outside the camps scattered throughout all of Russia. No matter where they are they preach and tell the good news. It has been said, too, that the religion of Jehovah’s witnesses is the only “living” religion in Russia. All the other religions are looked upon by the people as dead. This “living religion,” as it is termed by some, attracts people, and they want to hear more. But in talking about it, both persons, the witness and the one listening, know that the talking must be done in great secrecy. The Russian government has put many spies in its land, not trusting anyone. They filter into every organization, keeping their eyes and ears open for any of Jehovah’s witnesses, for these they want to silence. God’s servants in the earth are the only ones who are proclaiming a righteous government that will bring peace and happiness to mankind, and the Communists do not want such a government. They do not want freedom of thought, freedom of press, freedom of religion. They want all mankind under the dictatorial reign of a communistic organization that serves the Devil and his demons very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one circuit the police entered the homes of all the brothers and carried them away without allowing them to take clothes and food with them. They were carried off to the vast taiga, the forest region of Siberia, and settled in a camp for the purpose of having them cut wood. The brothers left behind have great difficulties to take care of things, yet they do all they can to go ahead. There is great distrust among the brothers, for many strangers have sneaked into the organization and often betray the brothers. Those who are free do not have much more freedom of movement than those in the camps. Their every step is being watched. In daylight no brother can go to another without risking the danger of an investigation. For several years the brothers have come together for study only under the protection of the night. The meetings are held exclusively in cellars and caves. The homes of the brothers are often searched by the police. If a brother sends a letter abroad or receives one from abroad he is summoned to the police and thoroughly questioned. Generally the brothers are accused of treason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Despite these difficult circumstances the brothers continue publishing the good news and so they are known everywhere. Far in the interior of the country a woman stated, after having been witnessed to,, that a woman told her the same thing in the bus. The brothers are also working from house to house. The publisher goes into a flat, gives the message and when leaving asks the householder not to accompany him to the door and not to tell anyone else that someone called.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Many people in Sierra Leone believe as Jehovah’s witnesses do, but as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> pointed out they need help to come out of Satan’s old system and associate themselves with the New World society. This takes steady work on the part of God’s servants. Back-calls must be made, Bible studies arranged for and exclusive devotion must be given to God on the part of his slaves. If they do this, an increase is brought about, and those who believe like Jehovah’s witnesses will soon be in the truth too. There are some interesting experiences that were sent in by the branch servant, and these are printed here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the new brothers are showing a fine spirit and have expressed the desire to return to their native villages to preach the “good news” there too. We often receive letters from isolated good-will people in villages who, having received literature through the mail from their relatives in Freetown, want to know more about Jehovah’s witnesses and the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one small town a missionary in his house-to-house ministry encountered an ardent Moslem and explained to him Jehovah’s purposes and the blessings of eternal life through Jesus Christ in a righteous new world. To Mohammedans Jesus Christ is merely a prophet and not the Son of God. When the sermon was finished, the young Moslem began heatedly to contradict and say: “It is contrary to reason and justice to call Jesus Christ the Son of God and to say that through him life can be gained.” (Acts 4:11, 12) At that time the man could be described as a fanatic opposer. However, with patience the brother tactfully explained what Moses, David, Isaiah and others prophesied about Jesus Christ as the Son of God. Upon being asked if he believed in the prophets and their writings he replied “yes.” The brother started with Genesis 3:15, about the seed of God’s woman, and continued to Genesis, chapters 12,13 and 17, tracing the seed through Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to Deuteronomy 18:18, 19 concerning the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">greater prophet </span><span class="font5">of whom Moses prophesied and which prophecy Peter quoted in Acts 3:21-23. Then as a clincher the prophecy of Isaiah 7:14 that says a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child was shown to be fulfilled in the account of Matthew 1:18-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The young Moslem was so convinced that he obtained </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”,</span><span class="font5"> a book, a Bible and a magazine. He then invited the brother to call back to answer more questions. Three days later at the back-call a long Bible discussion followed and more interest developed; the Moslem subscribed for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and asked the brother to visit him the following Sunday. When the brother called back the next Sunday, to his surprise he was greeted by nearly a dozen people that the Moslem invited to listen to the Bible discussion. A ha if-hour talk was given and at the conclusion four books and a Bible were placed and another subscription was obtained, with a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font5"> to be delivered later. A Bible study is now in progress with the former Moslem opposer, and many of his friends have joined in the study. The Moslem has now expressed his desire to change his religion to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. By using tact and returning good for evil, even strong opposers may become other sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two brothers doing preaching work in a town in the interior met many Lebanese traders who read Arabic only. The brothers were out of Arabic </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font5"> and felt that a good opportunity to pick up Arabic subscriptions over 150 miles from home was lost. Then one remembered a trader that subscribed for the Arabic </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower some</span><span class="font5"> time ago but did not renew his subscription. So a back-call was made on him and after placing some booklets with him they asked if he had an Arabic </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> they could borrow or exchange something for. After looking around his shop the trader finally located an old Arabic copy. The brother gladly took it and prepared to call on the other traders. Many wanted to obtain the single Arabic copy but the brothers would not part with it. One brother would call on a shop and give his three- to eight-minute sermon, which included the subscription offer, and then would pass </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> in Arabic to the other brother to use in the next shop. By working with this lone Arabic </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> the two brothers secured fourteen Arabic subscriptions in about two hours. The Arabic copy now looked battered and worn but it had accomplished the purpose, because without it the Arabic subscriptions could not have been obtained. The brothers felt Jehovah blessed their efforts in making use of the provision at hand.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">A visitor coming into the Kingdom Hall in Singapore remarked that it was the only place in Singapore where he saw a smiling face. He wanted to know what the secret formula for happiness was that Jehovah’s witnesses held. All around him there were grim, sad faces and perplexed faces, but the faces of such kind do not disturb Jehovah’s witnesses, for “he shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.” It is the joy that fills the heart of the witness that is reflected in his face. The branch servant gives us some very good experiences for Singapore and Malaya as well as North Borneo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> received a wider distribution this past year. House-to-house distribution of the magazines has proved very successful. This feature of work also offers an excellent opportunity to start new ones in the service. The only drawback has been that many householders are non-English speaking. consequently only booklets at best can be placed. For years we have keenly felt the need of the magazines in the Chinese language. You can imagine with what joy the news was received at our assembly that the first copies of the Chinese </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> would roll off the press starting with the issue of January 1, 1956.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The two young sisters in Penang have been doing wonderful work, having averaged ten back-calls and over three home Bible studies every month. They also had a peak of five publishers out in the work with them. Their amazing experience in coming into the truth should inspire us to continue scattering the seed of truth in our territories. Let Sister L tell us:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“One day Y--- showed me a bound book with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">words ‘The Truth Shall Make You Free’ stamped on it. She said she had gotten it from two people who came to her house offering the books and that she could not understand it when she read the first chapter. I was very much interested in the word ‘Truth’ and both Y---- and I had several discussions on its</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">meaning. Before I was half through the book I was already bubbling with joy over it, for no other religious book I had read ever explained the Bible so clearly. We were so enthusiastic over it that, after we had finished it, we wanted more copies of it for our friends. But where did the book come from? A look at the end page showed us the old Singapore address, but we delayed writing because we heard that publishers of the book were not allowed to come into this country and, besides, the book was published in 1943 (during the Japanese occupation) and how would we know the address had not changed? Finally we decided to make copies of it between us two. How? By typing! And so we got a bundle of typing sheets and carbon papers and started typing six copies at a time. In the meantime we went over the book again a couple of times, each time understanding a bit more. We thought that Jehovah’s witnesses were all Jews (after the flesh), because we did not understand the term ‘spiritual Israelites.’ Then came a burning desire to know these wonderful people who know the Bible so well. But where on earth were they? (Zech. 8:21-23) So we wrote to Singapore, but a week later our letter came back with the words ‘not there’ on the envelope. (It was the old address.) We went on typing, studying and praying (all done in secret) for a while. Then one day Y---said she had seen a girl with a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine with the Brooklyn address on it. It being a magazine of recent date we concluded that the Society was still in existence. Overjoyed at the discovery we sent a letter to Brooklyn. After eight weeks a letter came from Singapore. Jehovah is merciful and so full of love. If he had not made provisions for the good news to be preached I wonder where we would all be now. Out of His great love Jehovah has now arranged to gather together the lost sheep on the Isle of Penang.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The brother and sister who have been looking after the work in Jesselton were away on leave during the greater part of the service year. While returning home from Australia the sister became paralyzed and died a few days later. This has been a great loss to the Kingdom work in Jesselton. However, the brother is back there and is able to take care of the small group of interested persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The vast territory in this country has never been touched by the Kingdom message. It presents a problem and stands as a challenge to those who will take up real missionary work, go from village to village and from house to house, “make disciples of people of all the nations, . . . teaching them to observe all the things.” (Matt. 28:19, 20, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW;</span><span class="font5"> Luke 8:1; Acts 20:20) The native people are generally meek and humble and there must be many of the Lord’s other sheep here waiting to hear the Right Shepherd’s voice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in the southern part of Africa certainly appreciated the rich spiritual provisions that were made for them during the year. They were grateful for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and all the blessings that were released in the form of new publications. An outstanding witness was given with the use of the Society’s film “The New World Society in Action.” It certainly is wonderful how the truth can be taken into all nations, kindreds and tongues, with no distinction as to color of skin, since Jehovah is no respecter of persons. The truth is there for everyone. All they need to do is receive it, believe it and preach it. The branch servant in South Africa gives us some very interesting experiences on the work done in South Africa, Angola, Basutoland, Bechuanaland, Mauritius, St. Helena, South-West Africa and Swaziland. This is a big field and there is a lot of witnessing being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were 437 public meetings on April 3 with a total attendance of 24,632. Considering the fact that there are just about 14,000 publishers in the Union, the attendance indicates the interest aroused by the title of the talk and the preliminary advertising. The following Sunday there were 463 public meetings with an attendance of 20,590.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At an assembly public talk a minister of religion attended and found plenty to think about. He had a short discussion with some brothers and decided to come along to the showing of the film in the area the next week. As the film continued he expressed great amazement because of the great love and joy that were manifested by the brothers gathered together at Yankee Stadium. He said to the congregation servant sitting alongside him: “Why can’t we have that sort of thing here in South Africa too?” He was told to wait and see that there is the same spirit to be found in this country. And indeed he did see it manifested at the assemblies held in this country and in the Rhodesias. After the film he said he had never in his life seen such a manifestation of love and happiness as he had seen on the screen that afternoon. He ordered all the Bibles and books that he had seen depicted on the screen that afternoon. He also asked for someone to help him in his study of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That perseverance pays was the experience of two special pioneers. When making back-calls and conducting studies with the wife of an opposed farmer they found the gates leading to the farm barricaded with barbed wire week after week. Several times, as they tore their hands and clothes, they wondered if it was worthwhile. But they carried on and eventually their perseverance won the admiration of the farmer and he consented to sit in on the study with his wife. Both the farmer and his wife have now symbolized their dedication and are sharing in the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A minister of the New Jerusalem church attended a public meeting and stayed for the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study. He heard the announcement about the circuit servant’s visit and attended the service meeting and school on Tuesday evening. On Sunday morning he accompanied the circuit servant from house to house. Two weeks later he requested his wife to convert his long white robes, which he formerly wore at church, into shirts for his use as he engages in the field service. He now attends the meetings and shares in Kingdom activity regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in the printery continues to increase. We are now printing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> in eight languages and also an issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font5"> is printed in nine languages each month, six of which are used in the Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year reached a grand climax with between seventy and eighty brothers, twenty more than on any previous occasion, attending the international assemblies in Europe. At these assemblies their cup was filled to overflowing. Some were attending overseas assemblies for the first time, and what they saw and heard has been an unforgettable experience.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark361"></a>ANGOLA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population Highest Number of Ministers Preaching 4,145,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1950: 14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955 : 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Last year’s report told briefly of a certain African choir leader in the Belgian Congo who taught his choir members from the Society’s publications, began to preach in public, was arrested and deported with 500 others to Angola. There they were dispersed throughout the country, the leader being separated from the others. Early this past year a missionary was sent to contact and help the group. When he arrived he found that differing opinions existed concerning them. The authorities considered them to have political backing, probably of Mau Mau or Communist origin, whereas the employers usually considered them to be “Protestants,” but unusually clean, honest and hard-working. The first conversations with a few members were disappointing. They were very cautious in their replies and appeared to know nothing of the Society. (Later the missionary found out that they had been very much frightened by his questioning and thought he was a spy!)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This puzzling situation could only be cleared up by those who had written in to the Society. But as they</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">were under close supervision in an isolated place, to contact them it was necessary to approach the government at Luanda. The high-ranking official who granted a long interview at first tried to discourage the missionary by saying that the ones he wished to visit were considered to be Mau Mau and were located in a distant and very rough place. But the missionary insisted. Imagine his amazement when the official finally agreed to the trip and said that the government would pay for the round trip by plane!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The visit lasted a week and was exceptionally interesting. The ones who had written to the Society showed a good grasp of the truth, considering they had never had any personal contact with the Society. They described how Toco, the leader, had first gotten in contact with the message. Many years previously he had been a member of a Baptist mission in Angola. One of the missionaries threw away two booklets in Portuguese, including </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope of the World.</span><span class="font5"> Toco picked them up and got the truth. In proof, these Africans produced a notebook that contained a handwritten translation into their language (Kongo) of the booklets Toco had found many years ago. Copies had been made, which for years were their only textbooks of the Kingdom, enabling them to resist all efforts of the authorities and clergy to break them up. It recalls the Lollards and their handwritten pamphlets, and also the proverb: “Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.” (Eccl. 11:1) During the visit a good witness was given, concluding with a public meeting attended by eighty people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few are now reporting and in the whole colony there are hundreds just waiting to be fed with the truth. May Jehovah soon open the way for the many, many hungry “sheep” of Angola to be brought right into the New World fold.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In a mountainous country with few roads and only transport by donkey or on foot, it has entailed much effort on the part of the publishers to care for the people of good will, but this work has been gladly undertaken, with ever-increasing joy to the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The officials have been kindly disposed and there has been little opposition. Halls have been put at the disposal of the brothers for public meetings in the towns. In the villages the chief of the village usually arranges for a suitable place for the public meeting and in some cases invites the people himself. This he does by sending out his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">indunas</span><span class="font5"> (headmen) to inform the people and then, when the witnesses get around to extend their invitations, they find the people already know all about it and make it known that the chief has already invited them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Probably the high light of the year was the showing of the film “The New World Society in Action.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A circuit servant was due to give a public talk in an isolated part of the country one Sunday afternoon. However, a villager died on Saturday and was to be buried at the same time as the public talk. The whole village of 205 turned out for the funeral, arriving about three hours early. The circuit servant, knowing that no one would be free to come to the public talk, seized the opportunity to ask the chief and the father of the deceased to address some words of comfort to the villagers. In spite of protests from the minister who was to conduct the funeral service several hours later, permission was granted and the circuit servant’s talk on the cause of death and the hope for the dead was much appreciated. At the end several of the villagers invited the local publishers to conduct Bible studies with them. When the minister’s turn came at 2 p.m. he had little to say and one of the crowd went up to him with a Bible and said: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Rera monna”</span><span class="font5"> (“Man, preach”), but he had no message of comfort to give.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The father of the deceased then addressed the crowd and pointing to the several witnesses present said: “You see these people—they are hated, and it is considered they are misleading the people, but from today I am not afraid to say that these people are the real light of this country.”</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark364"></a><span class="font5">Mauritius is surely one of the most isolated spots on the entire surface of the globe. But on this lonely island in the Indian Ocean four missionaries and some twenty-four congregation publishers continue to point to the Signal raised on high and encourage those with a hearing ear to associate with the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the outstanding events of the year was the April campaign. There was little time to prepare. The campaign was such a stimulus to the Port Louis congregation that they doubled their average hours in April and have kept it up ever since. The brothers on the island were thrilled to see how the organization can make such well-prepared plans for world-wide united action on such a big scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another theocratic landmark was a circuit assembly held at Port Louis, July 1 to 3. Seven of the local brothers were able to share with the missionaries in caring for the various program assignments. The training program was highlighted, and the effort of the three male missionaries in each putting over a thirty-minute talk in French was much appreciated by those in attendance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The work on this small island in the South Atlantic of less than 5,000 inhabitants has made steady progress during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One should be careful not to conclude too hastily that a person has “had his chance” and then neglect him. One woman had studies in her home and then asked that they be discontinued. During the year the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens and a New Earth”</span><span class="font5"> was placed with her by a pioneer. A study was started and after a few months she was attending the meetings. She worked with the circuit servant's wife during her visit and she is now sharing in the house-to-house work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another noteworthy experience was with an old woman of eighty years. She had been a lifelong Baptist and was always under the impression that she was “saved.” Previously she was indifferent when the truth was presented to her. This year she agreed to having a regular study in her home and it was not long before she saw and appreciated the truth. She was one of those immersed during the circuit servant’s visit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Excellent progress has been made In South-West Africa during the 1955 service year. The missionaries at Windhoek concentrated on strengthening and stabilizing the new interest. Elsewhere in the territory, both north and south of Windhoek, missionaries and congregation publishers have done good work and there was an all-time high in April of forty publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one experience the wife quickly accepted the truth but the husband at first refused to have anything to do with it. “How could the churches all be wrong?” he argued. Eventually the man began to sit in on studies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font5"> Week after week he vigorously tried to prove the truth wrong, the discussion becoming quite heated at times. Gradually his protests became feebler and feebler, eventually to die away altogether. Again and again he would say: “I would like to prove you wrong, but the trouble is I cannot!” He has now accepted the truth, is a preacher of the good news together with his wife, is a student speaker in the ministry school and both he and his wife attended the international assemblies at London and The Hague.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The various showings of “The New World Society in Action” brought great joy to the brothers and to many persons of good will. At one large compound the European manager stated he wished to see the film before giving permission for it to be shown. Seven, including the manager, witnessed this private showing. The manager was very much impressed. He remarked: “This is different and most interesting. This is a very big organization and it is well organized too.” He expressed thanks for having had the opportunity to see the film and told the district servant: “You may show it in the compound hall tonight and I will tell the police boys to assist you.” He was satisfied that Jehovah’s witnesses stand for clean worship and that they are not mixed up with politics or worldly affairs. There was an attendance of 902 that night in the compound hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In view of the exemplary conduct of the brothers it is more than surprising that restrictions continue to be imposed in an effort to hamper the work. However, notwithstanding the obstacles, the brothers in Swaziland are determined to push the battle to the gate and to carry the message of the Kingdom to all the inhabitants in their territory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Many new special pioneers were added to the list during the past year in Southern Rhodesia and they reaped a rich harvest. With more adequately qualified ministers to go out into isolated fields a greater witness can be accomplished. It is not just a matter of gathering in people to the organization to call them Jehovah’s witnesses. It is a matter of their truly being ordained ministers of God, keeping themselves clean for New World living. One of such experiences along these lines is related in the report from Southern Rhodesia along with many other interesting items that the reader will enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The African brothers had been counseled at the district assemblies in 1954 to have their marriages legalized by January 1, 1955, in order to conform to the laws of the country. As the date approached it became obvious that some would not comply with this righteous requirement and in the early months of 1955 many were disfellowshiped. There was a great shaking in the African congregations and in February the publishers dropped to the lowest figures in two years. The tide turned at last, and with a cleansed organization all looked forward to April and the special booklet campaign. With Jehovah’s spirit again flowing freely the 10 per cent quota was met for the first time in April, a new peak reached in May, and finally another new peak to end the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All this activity has not been without opposition from those who do not want to hear the Kingdom message preached. One young special pioneer, aged eighteen years, was attacked and beaten up by a member of the Catholic Church while working in a village in the reserve. He reported the matter to the police, but the individual concerned fled the district. The police traced him and brought him back for trial. Attempts were made at the trial to discredit the work of the young pioneer and have him stopped from preaching, but he defended himself ably, giving a forty-five minute testimony, which greatly impressed all who heard. The man was convicted and the pioneer now has freedom to preach anywhere in the district. In this reserve, a Catholic stronghold, a year ago there were no publishers. Now, as a result of the work of the special pioneers there are three flourishing congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many European farmers in isolated districts, long prejudiced through ignorance against what they called the “Watchtower movement,” have become interested in the message of salvation to life in God’s new world as the result of the Christian conduct and activities of their African employees who are Jehovah’s witnesses. Kingdom Halls have been built and given to local congregations, and publishers given the most responsible positions on the farms as overseers, storekeepers, houseboys, etc. One farmer has two compounds on his farm, one for Jehovah’s witnesses and the other for those who are not witnesses. If the police ever come to seek permission to search the compounds for thieves he directs them to the other compound saying they will not find any lawbreakers among Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The wife of a European farmer complained to a district servant working in the area while serving an African congregation: “The only trouble I have with the boys is that when you people have an assembly they all want to go and I have to do all the work myself. I have tried to overcome this by engaging </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font5">cook boy who is not one of Jehovah’s witnesses, but he is never here long before he is converted by the rest!” Reports have come in of farmers offering their land for the public meetings of the local congregations and even preparing refreshments for them. On one occasion a farmer invited friends to hear </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> public talk that was translated into English for their benefit by the African brothers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Wonderful progress was made in this country during the past twelve months. Fine new peaks in publishers were reached, and the brothers themselves have advanced toward maturity. We have had difficulties, too, because one of the brothers who was taking the lead in the work in Spain was expelled. But this did not disturb those able to remain, and as they have put their shoulders to the wheel we see a resulting increase in publishers and in good organization. Some of the experiences that have been sent in from Spain are most interesting, and a few are here published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A new publisher wrote: “In 1931, first year of the Republic, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society was selling books and booklets in Aragon Square, Zaragoza, at a traveling bookstall, a thing which was not permitted during the monarchy. I bought two booklets; one was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Where Are the Dead? I</span><span class="font5"> was fifty-six and stored them away. Five years later came the civil war, then three years later Franco’s government. One day, searching through my papers, I came across them, read them again and realized that they were better than ours (Roman Catholic). I wrote to Madrid, but no answer. Next a registered letter that was returned, saying that the address no longer existed. Next a registered letter to Brooklyn, and after a few days they replied to me from Barcelona sending magazines and booklets and a pleasant letter. ... I see the theocratic religion so clearly and am so contented and say unequivocally that I have been misled for seventy-nine years and five months by those who teach and rule. No human can calculate the millions that have died through their fault. ... In my childhood in the village I never heard even once the name of Jehovah, neither is it heard in the cities. So that every day and night I give infinite thanks to Jehovah God Almighty for having shown me the pure religion at eighty years of age that I reach today.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two young brothers, pioneers, made individual stands regarding their military service, refusing to take up arms or salute the flag. One is in military prison but has contacted many good-will persons and is in very good spirits. He has obtained as many subscriptions as the pioneers outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here is an extract from his letters: “Three weeks ago they set me apart from the others to give me time to ‘reflect’ upon my refusal and so that I could not talk to anyone about the ‘truth.’ Each week a lieutenant has visited me to counsel me to ‘think well’ about what I am doing. He also visited the boys where I was before to ask them if I was propagating my beliefs. They said no, but I doubt if he believed them because there are few who have not received the witness, and half the Castle already knows why I am here. On seeing me in solitary confinement their curiosity is aroused and as my cell is next to the guard’s room they ask me why I am here and I give them a witness, although they are prohibited from speaking to me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Barcelona about half the publishers saw the film before it fell into the hands of the police. On later occasions the social investigation brigade of the secret police showed that they had studied in detail the film and one said “the most perfect organization in the earth is the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the middle of August we experienced a great forward surge in appreciation and enthusiasm. It was occasioned by the return of the delegates from the Paris assembly. Twenty-five from Spain attended and truly they returned breathing the spirit of the “Triumphant Kingdom.”</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark373"></a><span class="font6">Surinam has heard about the truth for many, many years, but it has not been until recently that good progress has been made to gather together the other sheep and organize them into a working body. The people here want the truth just as they do in any part of the earth, but sometimes it takes longer to build up a stable organization to care for them. They have had some very wonderful experiences during the year, and the branch servant writes of one, particularly, where the work pushed back into the jungle. He tells of some experiences with the bush Negroes. Here is his story along with other experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This year we made our second attempt to work among some of the 15,000 bush Negroes living in small villages along the many beautiful rivers of Surinam. The only way you can reach them is by boat. The first attempt was made six years ago, when a local pioneer tried to go ashore at Ganse, one of the so-called Christian villages. However, the Protestant evangelist, being warned in advance of his coming, prejudiced the villagers against him, and the whole village of 1,300 people forced him back in his boat again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This time, when the two missionaries arrived, all four captains were waiting for them and gave them a hearty welcome. That evening the captains left the brothers all by themselves, and promised that the next morning they would show them around the village. The following morning all four captains took them on a tour through the village. Afterward, they all sat down under a huge tree, and now the door to witness was wide open. How they listened! They had never heard this good news in all their life. Amazed they were to see how the brothers were able to find all the scriptures in the Bible. In these two hours the two parties became good friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This second night when the brothers got to bed, they could not sleep. With tears in their eyes they talked to each other about this joyful experience. “Yes,” one of them said, “such an experience I would never have had if I had not gone out into the missionary work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What just one publication of the Society can accomplish is clearly shown by the following: A brother worked isolated territory and met a man who said: “I belong to your organization.” What had happened? More than twenty years ago he had bought a book from a secondhand store. Right away he recognized the voice of the Good Shepherd, left the Roman Catholic church and started talking the truth to his friends. Later he obtained a copy of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Truth Shall Make You Free”. </span><span class="font5">Every evening he used to study for an hour, reading the book five times over. When the brother started a study with this man, he did not have to explain subjects as the 144,000 or the other sheep, Armageddon, etc. He had quite a good knowledge of the truth already. The fruits of his incidental preaching can be seen, too, in that two other families are making good progress in the truth. In his neighborhood there are about twenty persons of good will studying regularly. When a person of good will was questioned about her religion, she answered boldly: “I belong to the Watch Tower study.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">When one looks back over the past year he sees how many wonderful blessings were poured out on Jehovah’s people. In Sweden they are talking about the film “The New World Society in Action,” a new publication, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”,</span><span class="font6"> to be used in the theocratic ministry school, the special “Christmas” effort, the campaign with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is “the Light of the World”?</span><span class="font6"> and the wonderful convention held in Stockholm with delegates from twenty-five nations. All of this has had a telling effect on the spreading of the good news in Sweden. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences of what is happening there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The New World Society in Action” has been very much appreciated here also and the brothers in the congregations are quite pleased that they may now put on public meetings with this film at various places. Besides, at the circuit assemblies the film has already been shown on two occasions at rather odd localities, once in a prison and again in a labor camp for “less dangerous” prisoners, with practically all the inmates and most of the wardens being present and with very good results. Public lectures were given by incarcerated brothers and quite a number of studies were started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “Christmas” effort was a great blessing. Since reporting on it the following experience came to our attention: A circuit servant went from door to door with a local sister in a rural congregation. At one place the housewife said to the sister: “You who go and preach to people will not have had much time to bake bread for the holidays, I suppose? May I give you some loaves to take home with you?” Another “Christmas” experience had to do with a circuit assembly that convened in a small town that is mostly a railway junction and so has proportionately more hotels than private homes. At that season the hotels there generally close down, because very few people are out traveling, but this time they stayed open to hand over the hotels to our brothers who could stay there and use all of their facilities, without any of the staff’s being at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In other parts, however, where the so-called “free churches” prevail, the witnesses are now sometimes invited in for a peculiar reason: One of the religious magazines had a story of a witness of Jehovah who had become converted to “the true faith,” and the article concluded with the exhortation to the readers no longer to try to push the witnesses off but rather invite them in and try to convert them. There is, however, as yet no record of any witness’ having become “converted,&quot; but this increased opportunity of giving the witness inside peoples’ doors instead of outside is, of course, gladly used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This country’s being so sparsely populated, especially in the northern half of it, makes it a real problem to get all of the people properly witnessed to and the interested ones cared for. In one such territory where a father, a mother and two daughters are assigned as special pioneers not less than fifty people gathered for the Memorial celebration. In order to get them there the father had to run his motorcar 240 miles to pick up most of the interested ones and take them home again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From another, somewhat more populous place comes the following example of how a motorcar is used to make witnessing possible: An old, lame brother who weighs around 250 pounds hires a taxi, into which two men have to lift him, and takes a good-sized bag of literature along. So they go from village to village, from farm to farm, stopping outside the houses and tooting the horn to get people to come out, and then the brother gives them a sermon. He places considerable literature in this way, whereas back-call work, of course, is not so easy to carry on. But when people get sufficiently interested they come to his home and he studies with them while he himself is resting in bed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the concluding month of the service year came the long-looked-for convention with the big crowds of “Triumphant Kingdom” announcers from many lands, which gave not only Jehovah’s Swedish witnesses themselves, but the people of Stockholm and the population of Sweden as a whole, a strong impression of both the world-wide scope of this New World society and the wonderful oneness and unity existing within it. At the time this report is being written there is already much evidence at hand that people have become interested in knowing more about the truth and the organization as a result of the convention, and many studies have been started. This not only in the Stockholm area but all over the country. We are surely very grateful to Jehovah for this great “lift” to the work here and to our brothers from abroad who came here to help us, and especially so to the “mother” Society and the governing body of the present-day church, for all the care and work entailed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark376"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark377"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population Highest Number of Ministers Preaching 4,800,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 1,644 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955 : 3,980</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The small country of Switzerland felt the full force of Jehovah’s witnesses this year as thousands of them passed through the country and left a lasting impression. They were truly a strong support to those who work there regularly preaching the good news of the Kingdom, and undoubtedly it will open up the way for the local publishers to enter new homes to bring them the glad news of the Kingdom. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences of what has occurred there during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As an example of the individual blessings of the past year, take the brother who had to go to prison because of his conscience. Here he met a man who had spent many, many years behind prison walls because of having committed a major crime. This man accepted the truth and the following is part of a letter he wrote to the brother when the latter had returned home:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Dear W---, I am using every free hour for study</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">now. Have read to page 155.1 had thought to study with G----, but we are now ten men taking part in the study</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">together. . . . Last visiting day I had a talk with several witnesses from G----’s congregation. I received</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">fresh hope and comfort from these brothers; it is wonderful for these people to give me such support. Dear W----, as much as I heartily rejoice with you in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">your regained freedom, I miss you very much here; it is quiet around me and I have returned to the loneliness of my cell. My great comfort for the lonely hours is the Bible and that other book. Isaiah 61: 1, 2 are beautiful words that just apply to me and give me comfort. I have found so many other wonderful passages. Oh, if I had only known them earlier, how much sorrow and misery I could have spared myself! . . . I hope I may soon regain my freedom, not only because of myself, because you know exactly what my aim is now. ... I shall never lose my confidence in the Creator and I thank him every evening in prayer that he has forgiven my sins that were so serious and has raised me up to a new life. . . . Greet the brothers for me even though I am not personally known to them, but we are all one in Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After this the prisoner seized an opportunity to be immersed as a sign of his dedication to do Jehovah’s will henceforth, so you can never know what good it may do to yourself and to others if you suffer for righteousness’ sake. Surely the brother’s time in prison was not wasted, for he was a preacher of good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One blessing Jehovah gave us as an organization was the share we had in the world-wide witness in connection with the distribution of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is “the Light of the World”? </span><span class="font5">One clergyman who read the booklet wrote: “Especially due to their courageous and unforgettable resistance to Hitler, they [Jehovah’s witnesses] have won my deepest respect and esteem.” Another clergyman wrote: “I have read it attentively and was pleased about many things I found therein. To be sure, I have to say No very firmly to other things. But this does not prevent me from wishing you God’s blessing upon your work and to hope that you may indeed lead many people to God and his Son, Jesus Christ.” As a rule, however, the comments from the clergy were unfavorable and abusive. Especially our claim to be the only true Christians today was branded as Pharisaical and presumptuous. One of this “rich man” class wrote literally: “I suffer pain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The big events of the year for the brothers in Switzerland as elsewhere were the international assemblies. Two thousand German-speaking Swiss brothers went to Nuremberg on three special trains. For the great majority this was the first mammoth assembly they had ever attended and it left a deep impression on all of us to witness the New World society in action on such a grand scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Three thousand six hundred brothers from overseas, all wearing their badges, passed through this country on the Society’s special trains. They spent two nights and one day in the country and gave a fine example of preaching by conduct, which has had an excellent effect upon the population. In Berne the private accommodations were paid through the Tourist Office, whose secretary stated: “We have now paid for more than 1,200 beds, and it is extraordinary that from the hundreds of housewives we have not had a single complaint, but only praise for the behavior of these guests.” Many housewives expressed themselves to us personally in the same way, and mentioned especially our colored sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are indeed thankful to our brothers for leaving such a good impression with the people here, for it will make it easier for us to witness to them in the future. It was God’s spirit demonstrated in daily New World living; it has given honor to our “Father” and “mother,” and we are proud to be called your brothers.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark378"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THAILAND Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">18,000,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 213</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Thailand moves steadily forward and more and more persons of good will are learning about Jehovah’s New World society. Their blessings are many, and it is a joy to see a 13 per cent increase in the number of publishers. There is still much to do, but the newly baptized ones along with those who have been in the truth for longer periods of time are desirous of seeing this good news preached. There have been some very interesting experiences that the branch servant reports in his annual letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the film was shown extensively in many parts of the country to a total audience of 60,000! In the north requests kept pouring in for showing it at fairs, school celebrations, etc. The outstanding invitation came from a foremost Buddhist temple in Chieng-mai, and there it was watched by an audience that included 300 Buddhist priests seated in their yellow robes; at the end of the show the head priest voiced his thanks over the sound equipment and commended the Society on its amazing activity. Another time, at a Buddhist society’s pavilion in the same town, the local leader announced afterward: “If anybody here becomes one of Jehovah’s witnesses I will only be too glad another person has found peace in the New World society.” Nearly one thousand were present that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes many difficulties have to be faced, such as climbing up to villages in mountain areas, but the results are often rewarding. In one such village, a missionary from Chiengmai reports a lecture was given and afterward some nominal Christians who were present asked questions and then invited the missionary to speak in their church next day. So a forty-minute witness was given and questions were answered before their church service, and when they met for their “prayer meeting” further doctrinal points were explained. It appears that subsequently the Presbyterian Church leader for the area wrote and asked that church to prohibit the villagers from receiving Jehovah’s witnesses at their homes in future. But next time we were even more welcome, as the people resented the mission board’s attitude. This time one of their missionaries happened to be there, and Brother Pajasalmi reports: “We went to meet him and he appeared friendly and said: ‘We are actually all brothers because we all believe in the same Bible and we have the same God.’ I asked him what was the name of his God and he replied, ‘Jesus, of course.’ We took our Bibles, but he said that it was not necessary to talk any more about the Bible since we were ‘brothers anyway.’ It was easy to see that he did not wish to open up a real discussion, as there were many people listening. Next morning, however, he had forgotten the brotherhood he was declaring the day before. When he got up in the church he denounced us as ‘false prophets’ and said that nobody should listen to us or receive us into his home. That was his mistake; after he had left the village the local leader invited us to go to their ‘prayer meeting’ to give another talk and answer their many questions. This we did, and it was 11:30 p.m. before we left that meeting. When we went away next day many people were discussing the message Jehovah’s witnesses had brought them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An old man who could not read and whose wife was blind used to listen while their two granddaughters received a Bible study, and that is how they learned about the truth. The study was then held for his and his wife’s benefit, and the old man’s interest in what he was learning induced him to learn to read. Soon he could read to his blind wife, an accomplishment that surprised the whole neighborhood. They both learned enough to understand the need of full dedication and they have asked to be baptized. The man is crippled and unable to leave his home, but whenever his neighbors drop in he offers </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to them, and he is the best magazine placer in the congregation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark379"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark380"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There are seven islands in the Caribbean Sea that come under the branch office of Port of Spain, Trinidad. A wonderful work has been accomplished in these islands during the year, which can be readily observed by examining the chart. However, these increases did not come through easy work, but by diligent effort on the part of the congregation publishers, the pioneers and the special pioneers. The Society’s boat Light makes visits to all of these islands, but during the past year it was forbidden entry into Trinidad, as the acting governor looked upon the Christian missionaries as undesirable visitors. The boat is still visiting all the other islands, and the missionaries are still in Trinidad. Brief experiences are set out here for Trinidad, Barbados, Carriacou, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Tobago.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark381"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark382"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">645,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 300 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 1,454</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two things mainly are responsible for this fine increase: (1) Increased special pioneer work, and (2) the training program. We cannot say enough about the splendid work accomplished during the year by the special pioneers. Used especially in isolated areas or to build up extremely weak congregations they have accomplished wonderful things in spite of unbelievable obstacles and hardships. Battling the elements, rugged and scattered territory, religious opposition, ignorance and superstition and enduring personal hardships that tax the imagination, they have set a splendid example of meeting their quotas under all conditions. All together they averaged 159.2 hours, 67.9 back-calls and 11.7 home Bible studies, thus proving that proper planning makes it possible for pioneers to meet and exceed the quotas, even in tropical countries. Effort like this has not gone unnoticed by Jehovah, who grants the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reporting on the training program, one circuit servant notes fewer are irregular in every congregation, presentations are improved and more literature is placed. “Before the training program,” remarked one publisher, “I had difficulty placing one magazine. Now I surpass my quota every month.” An East Indian brother who was helped and now assists someone said: “The training program is really great. Formerly I feared to go in the service because I did not know what to say. Now I can preach to anyone.” Reporting on his congregation a missionary says: “In checking the record cards of the publishers in those study groups where the study conductors are alive to the training program we find nearly all are regular. . . . Compared with other groups who have not pushed the training, this becomes marked.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s film “The New World Society in Action” has proved invaluable in advertising Jehovah’s witnesses and their organization. A total audience of 46,512 on all islands with the exception of one where electricity is unavailable saw the film, as it was shown 89 times. In launching the protest folder distribution in Trinidad we held our first outdoor showing in one of the Port of Spain public parks and an amazingly attentive and receptive audience of 5,271 repeatedly showed their delight with spontaneous bursts of enthusiasm and hand clapping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before concluding this report I am compelled to make mention of the splendid support given the work in a financial way during the past year. There was over a seven-fold increase in donations over the previous year, for which we rejoice. Circuits, congregations and individuals are beginning to realize the sum total of the widow’s mite soon adds up to substantial support of this grand work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark383"></a>BARBADOS</span></h2>

<p><span class="font5">This tiny sugar-producing island stands as the easterly outpost of the Indies in the Atlantic. It is a tourist paradise with white, sandy beaches and coral-green waters for bathing. It is the most densely populated land area in the Western Hemisphere, having 1,332 persons for each of its 166 square miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Till this year official opposition was unknown as our representatives came and went unmolested for eight years. However, at the beginning of the service year alien missionaries of our organization were suddenly forbidden to participate on the program of the district assembly held in Bridgetown, September 23 to 26, 1954. The crew of the Society’s boat were also forbidden to preach as it was contended they were ship’s crew and not missionaries. In all, eight missionaries were affected by this sudden reversal of matters. Immediate representations were made to the chief secretary and the governor for relief and to have these visiting ministers accorded the same cordial treatment they had always received. The result? Three crew members were allowed to speak at once, but we had to wait until nearly three days of the assembly were gone before the other five were granted permission. The local brothers who filled in on the program on short notice did a splendid job and not one morsel of spiritual food was missed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our Barbadian brothers are enterprising and resourceful as shown by the arrangement of six small nearby congregations for the Christmas and New Year’s holidays. They arranged to get together for one day in one another’s territory beginning December 25, 26 and 27 and continuing January 1, 2 and 9. After discussion of the daily text and prayer three hours of service work was accomplished and then lunch together. After lunch there was a quiz on </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things” </span><span class="font5">and experiences. Each day’s activity was to be climaxed with a public lecture advertised during the day.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">That there are still some of the Lord’s other sheep hungering for truth and righteousness is evident from the experiences enjoyed by the special pioneers. A man and his wife and fifteen children were contacted in the door-to-door work and a study was started. “On my third study with him,” writes the special pioneer, “I asked his advice about a site for a public lecture. ‘Miss,’ he replied, ‘what we need is not just one talk and one study but two or three meetings a week so that our interest will be kept up and that we may grow strong. Then you won’t have to spend so much time here, but only come now and again to see if we are still going right.’ The attendance at the talk was 146, bringing the total for the week to 430. The public is asking for a repeat performance.” In advertising the public talk this person was asked if he would like to have a share. “What do you think we have been doing all week?” he replied. “That’s our work.” Coaching them in their presentations was all we did.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">That Jehovah’s approval and blessing is with those who stick to their assignment through thick and thin is amply demonstrated in Grenada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early in February the special pioneer in Grenville gave a public talk with 156 in attendance. A second and a third lecture were given because of the interest. After the third lecture he asked who would like to volunteer their place for a regular Bible study. A person attending said he had material for a house and he volunteered some of it. A tent covered with galvanize was erected with seats made from bamboo and boards. Now a regular study is conducted there with an average weekly attendance of fifty, of whom four have started publishing regularly. One of these planned to legalize his marriage toward the end of the year, but was impelled to move it ahead to April so that he could get immersed at the circuit assembly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A special pioneer has been doing yeoman service at Vieux Fort in the extreme south of the island, where Beane Field, the U.S. air base, is. It is heavy, backbreaking spade work in rocky soil, as immorality is rampant. “Today, on my magazine route,” he reported, “many stopped taking their issues because the priest warned them to have nothing to do with ‘that man’ who says priests cannot forgive sins. The majority live on church lands or in Catholic-owned homes. If any are seen listening to my talks they are given notice to vacate or remove from the land. I had an average attendance of nine at the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study and seven at a Bible study, but today the average is three. ... I have studied with all our subscribers and persons of good will, but when it comes to taking a stand they were found to be living in sin. This has been one of our greatest troubles.” And so it goes. The church claims to forgive sins on earth, but has never taught the people what it means to live in sin. Divorce is forbidden and the poor people are driven to take the only alternative there is, but that is all right with the church.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Here as everywhere else the film “The New World Society in Action” has been a great success in breaking down prejudice in many parts of the district. Many were the expressions of wonder at the size of Jehovah’s organization and the scope of its activity. By seeing as well as hearing, the common people grasp more readily the good news of the Kingdom. At the last circuit assembly the picture was shown in the market square to accommodate those wishing to see it. Several showers of rain fell during the showing, but that did not dampen their enthusiasm. When the showers came they ran for shelter, saying they would be back. So the film was obligingly stopped until the shower was over and then the people would come back and the film would continue. By waiting on the people several times some 250 saw the film.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Much time and effort have been spent In cultivating and watering the interest in this island ward of Trinidad. At one time a peak of sixty-nine publishers reported in 1951; but many moved away, some died physically and some spiritually, others went back to wallowing in the morass of immorality like a sow returning to her mire. At the beginning of the service year the prospects did not look encouraging at all, but two special pioneers were assigned. As a result of their long and hard labors they rejoiced along with the two congregations and four general pioneers at the close of the year over a 21 per cent average increase and a 58 per cent peak increase!</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Uruguay are making good use of the freedom that they now have, and they are preaching the good news everywhere possible. In the branch servant’s report for the year he pointed out that the big event was the district assembly and the showing of the film “The New World Society in Action.” This received much newspaper publicity, and it caused a considerable number of people to inquire about the truth. The Falkland Islands, away to the south of Uruguay, also come under the jurisdiction of the branch office at Montevideo. This past year a second visit was made to these islands with excellent success. The branch servant reports on both Uruguay and the Falkland Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is always good to call people’s attention to special articles of interest in the magazines. One sister stressed the article “Uruguay Goes to the Polls” in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">When returning with the next issue two weeks later she found everyone extra friendly and pleased with the article. One government employee said he was “really surprised at the exactness of the information on the elections of the country. There was absolutely no prejudice or partiality shown. It was truth.” He passed the magazine around to other office workers and all received the same impression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The opposed husband of one sister repeatedly refused to take her along with him to his work of cutting trees in an isolated area, as he feared she would preach to the other workers and their families. She kept insisting until finally he took her. What did she do while he worked? With a bag of literature, her Bible and a large stick to defend herself against animals and poisonous snakes found in that area, she set out to visit the wives of the men who worked with her husband. Imagine her joy when they gladly accepted her and the Kingdom message and took magazines, books, booklets and Bibles. She began studies with them. The joy of this sister was so great, and the interest of the people so keen that her husband agreed to take her along periodically so she could continue conducting the studies. As a result of this preaching two of those studies have now become Kingdom publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One missionary sister found a lady who listened patiently to her Bible sermon in broken Spanish. The lady confessed that she had always been a Catholic but was disappointed in the church, as they never tried to teach her to read, so she could study her Bible. This missionary offered to teach her to read and arranged to give weekly lessons, using as the textbook </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font5"> In one year the lady learned to read her Bible, and has gotten much comfort and joy from the things she has learned. Now she regularly attends meetings, and is a Kingdom preacher from door to door. Recently, she began to teach another less mature sister to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another subscriber who lived far out in the country heard that the brother and his wife were working an isolated town, so she decided to walk to town and find them. While the brothers were trying to locate this same subscriber in order to visit her, she appeared at the hotel desk with Bible and magazines in hand inquiring for them. She was so anxious to study and learn that she insisted on having a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study that same day. Arrangements were made to continue studying with her daily as long as the missionaries could remain. She had twelve studies in twelve days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After a few studies the brother mentioned the importance of the preaching work, and immediately she manifested her desire to participate. The nearest territory was four kilometers away (two and a half miles), but next day she walked to it, carrying a small baby and leading her three other small children. After this she wanted to preach again. The second time she prepared and delivered her own sermon and placed a couple of magazines, and continued to progress.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Falkland Islands had the distinction of being the most southern missionary assignment on the earth, as two missionaries arrived by a small freighter to cultivate and water the seed that had been planted the previous year by two other missionaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The clergy, as usual, did everything possible to hinder their work. They applied pressure to prevent their landing, then published lies from the pulpit and distributed pamphlets against Jehovah’s witnesses. While some timid ones closed their doors on the missionaries, the real sheep did not scare so easily. Within two weeks twelve families were having regular Bible studies. By the second month this number grew to twenty studies with more than thirty-five different persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During their stay in the islands the missionaries arranged for a trip to some of the other islands. On this 500-mile trip the clergy sent along an evangelist chaperon to intimidate and deceive the people. His presence, however, did not hinder the preaching, even though many times he accompanied the missionaries to the homes of the residents. While he talked to the people about their families, sheep and chickens, the missionaries made more important conversation. Bible sermons were given, subscriptions obtained and books placed, all in the presence of this false shepherd. People who have genuine love for truth can easily distinguish between the false shepherds and the true servants of Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Highest Number of Ministers Preaching</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">5,522,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 1,025</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The publishers in Venezuela have been using their time wisely, the congregation publishers averaging 13.4 hours. They are enjoying the training program, and this has resulted in a great increase in the number of back-calls being made and in Bible studies conducted. They are following the good advice that Paul gave to the Ephesians (5:15, 16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6">: “So keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, buying out the opportune time for yourselves, because the days are wicked.” It is truly marvelous the way the truth reaches out into places that one may think could never be reached regularly. However, the interesting experiences that the branch servant in Venezuela sends in show how it is done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A circuit servant from the western part of the country writes the following experience. “Sometimes when flying over the apparently trackless wilderness between Maracaibo and San Cristobal I have wondered how those people who live out there are ever going to learn of the truth, as many little farms and small villages can be seen from the air. The only way they can be reached is by boat down the lake and then up a river and then by ‘burro,’ as the natives say, along a trail. Recently when I was serving the congregation at Maracaibo I found out how even out there they were learning the truth! A sister who lives in Maracaibo has a daughter whose husband had some business on a farm two full days’ travel by boat down Lake Maracaibo and up one of the rivers that empties into the lake. The daughter accompanied her husband. She had a little interest in the truth, but not enough to explain it very well. At any rate she got into a conversation with a man who also was working on a farm back in the bush and placed her copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font5"> with him, as he manifested an interest in the Bible. The man read the book and came to her with many questions, but she did not know how to answer fully, so she suggested that he write to her mother in Maracaibo. Shortly she herself returned to Maracaibo. The man did write to the mother. However, the mother can neither read nor write; so, as the daughter was again with her in Maracaibo, the daughter is doing the reading and writing. Now they carry on a weekly study of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font5"> by mail. Recently the man came to Maracaibo with some rice to sell and while there took the opportunity to look up the mother and daughter. He attended the meetings while in town and took some more literature back with him. He is very happy with what he is learning and said he was going to try to attend the next circuit assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The circuit servant from the eastern part tells the following, which occurred while working an isolated village. “The first house I knocked at happened to be the priest’s. He didn’t know what to say but finally exploded, shouting for me to get out of his house. So I did, and knocked at the next house, but the priest began to yell and tell his neighbors not to listen or take anything. The more the priest yelled, the more the people were interested to see what I had. After three hours, despite the priest and children he used to make noise, I had placed twelve books and several magazines and booklets. That afternoon I met some Protestants or evangelists and they wanted to know about the doctrines of Jehovah’s witnesses; so a meeting was arranged for that night. Twenty-five were in attendance and a Bible discussion was started. Trinity, soul, hell-fire, etc., were explained. When one of the pastors tried to ridicule the message of truth, he was asked to prove his stand with the Bible. He was requested to explain about Lazarus and the rich man and, not being able to give any details, he soon was reproved by his own flock. A true explanation was given of the parable, and an older man said, ‘Truly I never heard such an explanation before, but it is so clear I guess everyone can understand it.’ All agreed and even the pastor changed his attitude. Several took publications and were pleased to have met a witness of Jehovah. They asked me to conclude with prayer, which I gladly did. It will be a pleasure to meet again these humble Venezuelans that showed such love for righteousness and wanted to be fed with Jehovah’s holy Word instead of man-made traditions.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It is a real pleasure to report that the work in Yugoslavia has moved ahead at a very rapid rate. The brothers who were released from prison about the time that the government recognized Jehovah’s witnesses in 1953 have all been zealously engaged in the work and they have been building up the broken-down walls. All of the brothers together have been blessed, and their efforts have borne great results. While there have been difficulties, we find here in Yugoslavia that Jehovah’s people are standing shoulder to shoulder and with great joy they are moving ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yugoslavia is divided up into six republics and the four main languages are Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian and Macedonian. We have also a great mixture of religions: Roman Catholic, Serbian Orthodox, the evangelical and reformed churches. We have practically all the sects except the Mormons. There are great differences in the habits of life among the people according to the province in which they live, and so we have to act according to 1 Corinthians 9:20-22 in order to approach the people with the truth and instruct them in the unifying theocratic principles. Having but little literature, we must do much oral preaching. It is now more than twenty years that bound books were printed in our languages, namely, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God, Creation</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font5"> in editions of 10,000 copies each. They have been the first and the last bound books that we have had till now. Some publishers still have a few copies; these they lend out to interested people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A great help in the service work are the public lectures. We are now able to organize more of these, thanks to the fact that speakers have been trained in special courses. We have now qualified speakers for the main languages, Croatian and Slovenian, and some of them are traveling every Sunday to congregations in the province that has Kingdom Halls in order to give a series of lectures. This can be done only where congregations have their own halls. This lack of halls is one of our main difficulties. Many of our congregations are fighting hard to get a hall, and those that have one have to fight to keep it. We still have some larger congregations that have no hall.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark398"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark399"></a>A YEAR OF BLESSING</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">World Population Highest Number of Ministers Preaching 2,400,000,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1945: 141,606 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1955: 642,929</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our reading of the 1956 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span><span class="font5"> takes our minds back over one year’s activity of Jehovah’s witnesses. We can only say that it has been a year of blessing. When we take a fleeting glimpse back over ten years we can see how Jehovah God through his visible organization has fed and gathered together one-half million people of good will, all of whom have taken their stand and proved themselves to be qualified ministers of Jehovah God. A half million is the growth of the New World society in but ten years’ time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To all of those who have dedicated themselves to Jehovah God and have lived these years, they have been years of blessing. All of them have taken Jehovah at his word, for they have brought tithes into the storehouse that there may be food in the house of Jehovah, and they believe their God when he says: “Prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.” (Mal. 3:10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">AS)</span><span class="font5"> That is the way Jehovah’s witnesses feel. We have set out here a few of the wonderful things that have happened, but words will not be able to express the true, inward satisfaction that each qualified minister of Jehovah God has in having done his work all to the honor and glory of the Sovereign Ruler of the universe. It makes every one of us more determined than ever before to render to Jehovah exclusive devotion, knowing that this is proper. For by giving Jehovah all of our love, love that comes from the heart, the mind, the soul and the strength, we are able to receive blessings beyond measure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Outstanding during the 1955 service year was the campaign with the magazines. The publishers in the field turned in 1,008,221 new subscriptions in all languages. They have seen the importance of distributing these two magazines, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">weekly from store to store, house to house and on the street corners. Here are two magazines that the people of the world need, and millions of them want to read these magazines. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> in 1955 was in great demand, because the Society had to print more than 50,000,000 copies. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> production was more than 35,000,000. We see that, to compare with ten years ago, the demand has increased at the rate of 6,000,000 copies a year, for in 1945 it was necessary to print 25,793,031 copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> magazines, to compare with the 1955 printing schedule of 86,590,360. This is 60,000,000 more copies that were needed in the 1955 service year than were required ten years ago. At this fast-moving pace the Society will be printing over 100,000,000 copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">magazines in 1957, in just two more years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What joy it is to us to know that people want these magazines and what responsibility is ours to help gather together those who love truth and righteousness into the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the midst of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign there was the release of a new booklet, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is “the Light of the World”? </span><span class="font5">This stirred Jehovah’s witnesses into an active service such as they had never before been aroused to. It brought out a new all-time peak in publishers, 625,256 engaging in the field service. But before the year ended even more than that were praising Jehovah’s name, for at the close of the year there were 642,929 publishers preaching the good news. These zealous publishers of the Kingdom during the year put out 22,000,000 copies of this booklet in thirty languages. They made a special effort to get this booklet into the hands of the clergy, and thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses wrote personal letters to Christendom’s religious leaders and to the ministers in Pagandom, and it is reported that 241,550 leaders of religion received personally, through the mails, a copy of this wonderful booklet. Additionally, 15,574 editors of principal magazines and newspapers have received copies of it. This is not a complete report, but information that has been gathered indicates that at least this number have been given the opportunity of seeing the distinction between Christianity and Christendom, and they can either continue the way they have been going or change their minds and truly represent Jehovah God and his Son, Christ Jesus. The responsibility is theirs. Jehovah’s witnesses have not withheld the truth from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Climaxing the year was the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. In all parts of the world, in magazines, newspapers and in the Society’s own publications much has been written about the glories of this convention. We can only say that we are very thankful to Jehovah for arranging it and for blessing his people in such a wonderful way. This “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly puts us in a mood to look to 1956 and the opportunities of expanding the work, and living to the future wherein we can bless more people by preaching the good news of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness to all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society is making plans to put many hundreds more in the special pioneer work during 1956, so as to get out into isolated parts of the different countries where the Kingdom message is already preached. It is arranging to establish more congregations wherever there are isolated persons, and where groups of persons will come together. It is arranging to send out more missionaries into fields where they are needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past year it was the good pleasure of the Society to spend upward of $850,000 on foreign service, assisting these missionaries, special pioneers and small branches in faraway places. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness in putting it into the minds of his people to bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, we believe without question that even larger funds may be spent to advance the Kingdom interests in other lands during 1956. The contributions, we know, are not the “whole tithe,” but it is also the service rendered by the publisher himself in praising Jehovah’s name. It is not the money that brings about the expansion. It is you, the publisher, preaching the good news that gathers together the other sheep. But, as the publishers have been favored with earthly blessings and prosperity financially, these publishers nave supported the Society wonderfully in contributions, so that those in turn who are responsible to look after the work could direct attention to other fields, new lands, the islands of the sea, and for this the Society is very grateful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The film “The New World Society in Action” will continue in use during 1956. Up to this time reports show that 2,379,549 persons have seen how Jehovah’s witnesses carry on their work in all parts of the world, and this film has stimulated many to take a stand for the Kingdom, preparing them for ministerial work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What a joy it is to be in Jehovah’s organization, a part of the New World society, an individual who can bring to Jehovah exclusive devotion, a person who can praise Jehovah’s name and bring comfort to those who are weeping and sighing because of the abominations that exist! And there is a oneness in this feeling. That is why it was that at all of the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assemblies Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere asked that their love and greetings be carried to the ends of the earth, and this was done by messengers from sixty-three lands. At the close of every one of the year’s reports that came in from the branch servants it was their request that their love and greetings be extended to their brothers far and wide. It is indeed an honor and a privilege to do this and to send the love of the brothers to everyone else within the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And, now, as we enter a new year may Jehovah’s rich blessing abide with every one of you, and may His name be honored by your praise. Joyfully we go forward together in the “Triumphant Kingdom” work all to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark400"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark401"></a>Annual Meeting</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">Each year on October 1 the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania holds its annual meeting in Pittsburgh in its own offices. Hie location is 4100 Bigelow Boulevard, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This year the main auditorium was packed to overflowing and all were delighted to hear the reports of the officers of the Society on the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses. They also elected the necessary directors to keep the board members to the total of seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the last day of the month, October 31, the members of the board met and elected N. H. Knorr as president, F. W. Franz as vice-president, Grant Suiter, secretary and treasurer, H. H. Riemer, assistant secretary and treasurer. The other members of the board of directors are T. J. Sullivan, L. A. Swingle and M. G. Henschel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All of the members of the board of directors were able to attend the European assemblies of the “Triumphant Kingdom” Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses, and all of them were grateful for the opportunity of meeting with their brothers in all these other lands and in inspecting the offices of the Society in the countries where they visited. It was a joyful year for them, and they are grateful for their privileges of service, and, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, will continue on faithfully doing their work at the headquarters office at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All of the board of directors are of the anointed class and rejoice in the fact that they can give to Jehovah God now exclusive devotion and have a share in the great work of preaching the good news of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark402"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark403"></a>Yeartext for 1956</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing.”—Malachi 3:10, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is true to his word. He says “prove me” and he means just that. If his servants bring their tithes into the storehouse, then Jehovah says he will open up the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it. If we want to make sure that God will pour out such a blessing, then all we have to do is bring the tithe into the storehouse. Jehovah’s word never returns to him void. He means what he says, and if we follow his direction we are the ones that are going to be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses today do not bring tithes into the temple in the same way that the Israelites did back there in their day. Our bringing in the antitypical tithe to Jehovah’s temple storehouse is a token of the fact that we have dedicated all we have to Jehovah God. It is done in memorial of our dedication. Every year Jehovah’s people must give proof to Jehovah God that they are dedicated to him through his Son, Christ Jesus. This yearly contribution is a token of the fact that we have given all that we are and have to the Most High God. When the Israelite brought his tithe into the temple it was to support Jehovah’s temple service, and, therefore, our tithe brought into the temple must be in support of Jehovah’s temple service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What could this be? Individually we can give material gifts to promote Jehovah’s worship at his spiritual temple. Whether it is exactly a tenth or more or less, is not the important thing. Today we must give cheerfully to Jehovah’s service. Gifts may be given to the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society so that it can carry on the expansion work world-wide. Gifts can be given to the local congregation to help care for the temple service in their own vicinity. But contributing materially is only part of tithe-giving. Individually we must participate personally in temple worship. We must meet with the congregation of Jehovah’s people, there sing his praises and take in spiritual knowledge, preparing ourselves for greater activity. Worshiping Jehovah with his congregation must be a weekly, regular thing. We must be willing to help others by assisting them in the meeting, speaking up and making expression of our belief. We must be friendly to newcomers and help the newly</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">interested ones in getting to the meetings and in getting a clearer understanding of Jehovah’s purposes. Coming to Jehovah’s place of worship with the whole congregation will mean preparing ourselves in advance for field service. This, too, is tithe-giving. We must go out in the field along with others, and by ourselves, preaching the good news. If we are able to give instructions to others we must be helpful in this regard. Preaching the good news of Jehovah’s established “Triumphant Kingdom” is putting our worship at the topmost position in our lives. It is high above everything else in the world. Jesus said the world is our field in which to work. Therefore, Jehovah’s witnesses have gone everywhere in the earth preaching the good news. Their tithe-giving must include preaching from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But even further, we must show love to our brothers. We must pray to our heavenly Father to bless those in other places that are not so well favored as we are, such as our brothers in Russia and behind the iron curtain. It is not only the rich who can give in tithes in this day, but everyone within Jehovah’s organization can give a spiritual tenth to temple worship by directly doing witness work according to the opportunity that comes to him. A money gift does not excuse one from the spiritual contribution that can be given by everyone by his preaching the good news and making public declaration of his faith at the meeting place and from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And what happens when one does this? If we bring our tithes into the storehouse, then Jehovah God will open to us the windows of heaven and pour upon us a great blessing. The Sovereign Ruler of the universe has been doing this year after year, ever since 1919. Look at the feast of spiritual food that Jehovah has placed upon his table during these past years. Regularly, every year, he feeds us with abundance through </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and then through many publications in addition. He has built up his organization until now it reaches out to the ends of the earth. He has helped us in the construction of great buildings that are used to the honor and glory of his name. He has set up branch offices, printing plants. He has directed his people to build many new Kingdom Halls. He has gathered thousands into the pioneer work, special pioneer work, missionary service. He has given us special training through the theocratic ministry school, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> study, service meetings. Everything has been to our benefit and to our blessing. He has given us spiritual prosperity that has never been enjoyed by any people as it is now enjoyed by Jehovah’s witnesses. We are certainly in a delightsome land and hundreds of thousands of other sheep have joined themselves to the spiritually prosperous remnant, for they now come to the exalted mountain of Jehovah, there to worship in the temple courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Are you under this shower of blessings from heaven? Have the windows of heaven been flung open to you? If so, continue to bring your tithe into the storehouse, and for eternity the blessings of Jehovah God will be poured upon you. Look at the hundreds of thousands of persons coming from every nation, kindred and tongue to the highways that lead up to Jehovah’s temple. There they are bringing their tithes so as to promote true worship. Bring your tithe and be blessed. Assuredly there will not be room enough to receive it all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">13:5, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is not just a matter of saying, ‘I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses.’ It really is a matter of inspecting yourself, testing or proving yourself by answering questions in public, voluntarily or when called upon. How can anyone say he is one of Jehovah’s witnesses if he does not attend and participate in the meetings of the true worshipers of Jehovah? How can he say, even to himself, that he believes the truth of God’s Word if he never expresses that truth to his brothers? Just as each one must make a personal dedication of himself to Jehovah, so each one must personally prove that he is one of Jehovah’s witnesses through public expression of his faith and hope in Jehovah’s new tvorld before the congregation of Jehovah’s people. It is your active belief that will incite others to greater activity ; therefore the knowledge you have gained should be expressed aloud before the congregation for the benefit of all. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 14</span></p>

Scientists tell us that “through its incredible ability to hook together thousands of reverberating circuits in a fraction of a second—each representing a memory or an idea—the brain is able to bring together into one grand circuit the data needed to think and make decisions.” We are also told that every experience of our life is recorded and preserved and that even the most brilliant man does not in a lifetime use more than a tiny part of the capacity of his brain. The marvels of the human mind heavily underline the grateful words of David as noted above.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 16:2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As all share in some part of the preaching program all make an effort to share in charitable giving as well. As the time spent by each servant is voluntary, so is his giving of material funds a matter for his own decision. Time is gladly bought out by the new theocratic minister and devoted to God’s service. Money also, often given in excess to satisfy self or clerical greed, is now freely dedicated to the support of God's organization. It is his spirit that has come upon them that makes them cheerful givers ! And as an effort is made toward regularity in the field, so the regular setting aside of money to be used in support of the organization is also advised by the apostle. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font3"> 35, 36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he must stick to his wife and they must become one flesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Gen. 2:24, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah uses the symbol of marriage to show the close relationship between himself and his womanlike universal organization. Again, the figure of marriage is used to illustrate the close bond between Christ and his church, he being spoken of as the Bridegroom and the church as his bride, with the marriage being consummated in heaven. In Eden the man and the woman were spoken of as being “one flesh,” and the same is said about human marriage partners today. Similarly, there is a oneness existing between Jehovah and the chief one of the universal organization, Christ Jesus. Also, Christ and his bride, the church, are referred to as being one. In none of these cases, however, is it a literal organic oneness, but in all of them it is a oneness in aim, purpose, goal, desire and direction of effort. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span><span class="font3"> 3</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Ao, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">rather, Happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it!—Luke 11: 28, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is the happy God. (1 Tim. 1: 11, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> His happiness comes from being completely devoted to righteousness and to bringing happiness to his creatures in his loving way. Unselfishly he has provided for people to hear the good news of the Kingdom. Those who “sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done” hear this message and come out of the afflicted old system of things. They begin to make their minds over and undergo a change of personality to God’s happy state. Thus when a person comes to understand and appreciate the truth of God's Word, his viewpoint on life completely changes. He becomes very joyful. He now has new associates, Jehovah’s witnesses, a society of happy people. They are spiritually prosperous and growing. Continually they learn more and more about the principles of New World living, which they strive to apply to their own lives. They radiate optimism and enthusiasm. Certainly they have every reason to be happy !</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Give us more faith.—Luke 11:5, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To gain faith we need a meek and teachable heart attitude. Our faith is not in the wisdom of men, for this is far surpassed by the limitless knowledge of our Creator. The wisdom of the world is foolishness in God’s sight. Faith comes, not through human wisdom, but by a study of the Bible, God's Word of truth. This is the foundation of true faith. However, knowledge in itself does not necessarily give a person faith. It must be supplemented with understanding that comes through God’s organization and by means of his spirit. To establish the faith of his apostles, Jesus told the meaning of events of his day. (Luke 24:27) His apostles needed such instruction and correction, for they were still expecting an earthly kingdom. Today our faith is built up by a hearing of the Word of God with an open mind coupled with instruction from those of like precious faith. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 3</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">28:19, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scripturally enjoined baptism of Christians signifies their dedication to Jehovah; it gives evidence that they have made a dedication. In itself the immersion is not the dedication. It is a symbol of the dedication or stands for it and tells observers that the one immersed has made a dedication. The dedication must have been made prior to the immersion ; otherwise there would be nothing for the immersion to symbolize. The immersion stands as a vivid reminder of the dedication. Christian water baptism is an outward symbol, as a testimony before witnesses, of the baptized one’s complete, unreserved and unconditional dedication and agreement to do the will of God, through Christ his King. It means his past course of life is buried (as by the immersion in water) and he comes up from the water to do only God’s will and walk in newness of life thereafter. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 8</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you. Take my yoke upon you and become my disciples, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for your souls.—Matt. 11: 28, 29, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do we visualize Jesus as a leader, striding ahead, the last word in efficiency and organization, impatient of the shortcomings of others? Hardly. While there was no question about his perfect abilities, his followers were not overawed by his personality, feeling that he was far ahead of them, as if in a separate category. On the contrary, both in spirit and in action he was very close to his followers, friendly and approachable, except when now and again the occasion demanded otherwise. And this thought of close proximity is one of the main ideas connected with leadership, as when a father leads a child, or a dog leads a blind man. When inviting others to become his disciples Jesus used gracious words. So should we. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font3"> 19a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">What doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with thy God?—Mic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">6:8, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The course of dedication is a blessed one and leads to everlasting life. It was well pictured in what the starving Egyptians said to Joseph: “Buy us and our land for bread . . . that we may live.” Faith, based on knowledge obtained from God’s word of truth, the Bible, must draw us to Jehovah. Appropriate, therefore, are Jesus’ words: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” Humility is also required. It takes a humble person, conscious of his spiritual needs, to come to Jehovah in dedication. It requires a humble recognition of inherited sin and weaknesses and a repentance that is sincere. These good essentials were evident in certain early converts to Christianity who, stabbed to the heart at what they heard, “said to Peter and the rest of the apostles: ‘Brothers, what shall we do?’”—Acts 2:37, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW. W 6/15</span><span class="font3"> 12, 13a</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">If, now, . . . you are persuaded that you are a guide of the blind, a light for those in darkness, a corrector of the unreasonable ones, a teacher of babes, and having the framework of the knowledge and of the truth . . . do you, however, the one teaching someone else, not teach yourself?—Rom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2:17, 19-21, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the matter of gossip we should be on guard. Be on guard against whom? Against ourselves. As you read this, think. Think how it applies to you, not to your neighbor. True, it applies to your neighbor. Ue admits it. But the important thing is for you to admit it applies to you, for you to apply it to yourself. You can change yourself. You may not be able to change your neighbor. Concentrate on yourself. Then when you have become faultless in this matter, help your neighbor to become that way also. When you have removed the rafter from your own eye you may then try to extract the straw in your neighbor’s. We are prone to be easy on ourselves and hard on others. For our own safety, reverse it and let us be hard on ourselves and easy on others. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font3"> 1, 2</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 10:24, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Daily reading and study of the Bible are needful. Bible study aids, such as the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine and books distributed by the Society, should be studied in private. But that is not all. After the private study you must meet with the congregation and make a public declaration of what you have learned. If one tries to go alone, it will be only a matter of time until he will be in want; and if he stays away from the congregation too long he will die of starvation for spiritual food. We cannot get out of line with New World living and survive for the new world. After one has made his day-by-day and week-by-week private study he should make his ‘advancement manifest to all persons’ by expressing before the congregation what he believes, so that the other members of the congregation may thereby be incited to love and right works and encouraged to greater activity.

<p><span class="font3">Appreciating the fact that man’s power cannot even be compared with God’s and that God knows what is going on and does not overlook anything will help us not to be overly worried about the wicked. Practically all mankind, like many angels, have left the place assigned to them by Jehovah, stubbornly refusing to obey his counsel, and so are steadily going downward, reaping their wicked harvest of delinquency and corruption. Imperfect man, even when trying to stamp out corruption, commits evil himself. The man of God does not get unduly excited about the activities of the wicked and invent in his mind places of eternal torment after this life as punishment for the wicked. He knows that God will take care of the wicked, leaving them absolutely no place for existence anywhere. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font3"> 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This is my Son, the Beloved, whom I have approved; listen to him.—Matt. 17: 5, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No one should be offended to learn that God has made the eternal welfare of all mankind dependent upon this faithful and worthy Son, and has wrapped up everything in him. What is at fault with this divine arrangement? Where is it incapable of producing the desired results? Why should Almighty God have to call upon many to help, in order to allow each to put his personal religious favorite into the picture? The numerous religions may each have its own favorite, so that to please them all it would be necessary to establish a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">pantheon</span><span class="font3"> of all gods. But the only living and true God has his own choice, and it is the proper one, his only-begotten Son, whom he gave in sacrifice. That act expresses love, the highest degree of divine love, to give his most beloved Son to die at the hands of sinners, for those who are in no way deserving of it but who were condemned sinners. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font3"> 19</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in mine integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 26:1, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To all who would be his children Jehovah commands: “You must prove yourselves holy, because I am holy.” That means that his true worshipers must strive to emulate his uprightness ; they must display integrity in all their relationships with him and with their fellow creatures. But what is integrity? It is described as uprightness of deportment; soundness of moral principle; honesty, probity, state of being entire, unimpaired, unbroken; completeness. Delving deeper into the structure of the word we discover that its component parts are </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">in,</span><span class="font3"> referring to the negative, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tegrity,</span><span class="font3"> a form of the Latin verb </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tangcrc, </span><span class="font3">meaning “to touch.” So integrity is a state of being untouched, uncorrupted, unimpaired by divisive and corrupt influences. How wonderfully, then, our God Jehovah stands forth as the God of integrity! How' essential for us to cultivate that quality if we would be like him and prove worthy to be his children!

And in addition to the printing of literature, there arc many other expenses necessary to maintain the expansion program, and these can be and are being shared by the brothers also.

<p><span class="font3">A gossiper is not a true friend. If he gossips to you he will gossip about you. By gossiping he may nudge you toward gossiping and “when he goes out, he tells it abroad.” This is sly hypocrisy. He will gossip to whomever he is with, because it is an entrenched habit that controls him. If by refusing to listen you can halt the tongue he cannot, you help him, and he may appreciate it later. But whether he later appreciates it or not, as a follower of Jehovah you must register disapproval and meet his gossip with a frown: “The north wind brings forth rain, and a slandering tongue an angry face.” (Prov. 25:23, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">AT)</span><span class="font3"> If he does not reform and replace his foolish words with those of wisdom and knowledge, do as the Bible says, leave his presence.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 1,: 12,</span><span class="font3"> iVW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah's words have power. This being so we should want to know what Jehovah says at any time, if it is within our finding out. We should certainly want to study his sayings. When God says something we should listen, because what he says has a tremendous effect on animate and inanimate things. David, a man after God’s own heart, appreciated the power of Jehovah’s word, for he stated: “By the word of Jehovah were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.” Man eannot conceive the power in the Creator’s words. With all the power in heaven and earth as Sovereign Ruler, he ean certainly make his Word to stand and never return to him unfulfilled. Henee he himself says: “So shall my word be ... it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.” Words so powerful we should study. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 2</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Faith can also be tested by little things, a gentle pulling that is hardly noticeable, but dangerous. Instead of being tried by opposition, one may be smothered by worldly opportunities. Soon he finds the faith he has built up is collapsing because of neglect. Perhaps he has a promotion and must spend more time at work. This means less time for meetings and service and his spiritual welfare. Because of not being motivated by strong faith he is not putting the important things first in his life. He is prospering materially but dying spiritually. The importance of Jehovah’s service should always be kept in mind, for by doing so we prove our devotion to Him. Faith, like love, can grow cold. If we continue to manifest real love toward God, then our faith will also remain strong. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 21</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Today, for the most part, a wonderful spirit prevails in the congregations. And especially where the brothers are loving and kind to one another, where they do not complain and ridicule and deride, Jehovah has given them many blessings. Since the brothers will follow the right example, it is so important for those who have the oversight to set the right example of building up their brothers without murmuring. People of good will who come into the Christian congregation readily learn to practice the noncomplaining attitude. But if one complains he soon gets others started and usually all such do no preaching or very little. Instead of complaining, let us willingly accept responsibilities Jehovah places upon us. Putting our trust in him we strive for contentment, living and serving as he intends for us. In this way we shall have complete satisfaction, knowing that God’s will is being done. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font3"> 13-15a</span></p>

These, and all uniting with them, now add their own personal support to the organization by their individual dedication vows and by their faithfulness in field service, maintaining the purpose of the organization. Their primary support of the organization is with their words of preaching. It is a spiritual giving of charitable works. For this reason their primary attention is given to spiritual matters, as it was with Mary, who “sat down at the feet of the Master and kept listening to his word.” They refuse to be distracted from the main purpose of their work by the many material problems with which they must deal but, like Mary, ‘choose the good portion.’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font3"> 5, 6</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We know it is dedication that Paul referred to respecting Jesus because both the fortieth Psalm that he quotes and the tenth chapter of Hebrews so state. It was a matter of Jesus’ coming to do God’s will, having God’s law in his heart. That God recognized the baptism as a symbol of that dedication is shown by the fact that he sent his spirit upon Christ and a voice was heard from the heavens that said: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.” (Matt. 3:17, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font3">These words were not spoken of Jesus when he was born a babe or when he was twelve years old, a lad, nor while he was a carpenter for the eighteen years between until he was thirty years of age. Jesus’ dedication was accepted. It was recognized by Jehovah as was his baptism. His baptism was also observed by John who administered it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 12, 13</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">To be rich toward God, to hold fast your hope, you must study God’s Word and continuously make public declaration of it. Faith in the true God on the part of any individual comes by hearing the words of God. One who knows the words of eternal life must teach them so that others can hear and so that those who do hear can have faith. Then these in turn will study God’s Word like the teacher. “Preach the word,” said Paul, who knew that faith is built on accurate knowledge. To live in the new world one must be filled with the knowledge of God. If you could not be filled with the knowledge of God, then you would have to say that God is not a good Teacher. True Christians realize, however, that they will “all be taught of Jehovah.” Learning from such a wonderful Teacher you will not want to keep the knowledge to yourself but will want to make it known to others.

<p><span class="font3">In view of the fact that Jehovah carried the nation of Israel as a man carries his son, and safeguarded them as the pupil of his eye, did they, like a responsive child, appreciate all that he did for them? No, they did not. From Mount Sinai onward they proved to be “a generation crooked and twisted.” Though that generation died off in the wilderness, by no means did Jehovah relinquish his original purpose. Instead, he kept on leading Israel just the same and successfully brought the sons of that original generation into the Promised Land and gave them possession of it. This highlights two qualities in Jehovah’s leadership of his people. It reveals his abundant mercy, balanced by his righteous judgments brought upon those who, though they had seen his glory and many miracles, yet did not listen to his voice and treated him without respect. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font3"> 4-6</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has made wonderful provisions—the ransom sacrifice, a theocratic organization with a “faithful and discreet slave” class, one after another of his truths revealed to his people, etc.—all giving a hope with a sure basis for spiritual curing today that will lead to everlasting life. God will make no special provisions for a person who might think he is different or better than others; he will not pick out some individual and give him special revelations or extra outpouring of his spirit, but he is dealing with people as a group in an organizational way, giving copious counsel in his Word, the Bible, on how the group is to work together.

The sinful tendency is to speak sinfully, but minds educated by Jehovah’s Word strive to follow Jehovah’s law. So a conflict ensues between God’s law in the mind and sin’s law in the flesh. After we have gossiped we repent and wish we had stilled our tongue. We regret our weakness. We must strengthen our mind in Jehovah’s law and pray for his healing of our heart to help us crush sin’s law in our flesh and gain victory over it.

As good soldiers we must keep awake, alert to the attack, and with boldness and freeness of speech announce the good news that we have received. We must keep our faith strong by using the means provided: being refreshed in knowledge by attending meetings and speaking the truth to others, following the course of righteousness and good works, being active in the service by preaching, and being built up in the spirit of God by calling on Him in prayer. Doing these things, you will be able to stand firm against the onslaughts of Satan, protected by an impenetrable shield of faith that gives not only protection to you but courage to those who behold it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1 8</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3:21, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The law under which the dedicated nation of Israel served ended with Christ. He was baptized at the age of thirty in symbol of his dedication to Jehovah. The meaning of the baptism of Jesus shows the meaning and the purpose of Christian baptism today. Jesus made a solemn decision to serve God, and came to John at the river Jordan requesting John to baptize him. Jesus hud no sins to be forgiven, because he was “guileless, undefiled, separated from the sinners.” (Heb. 7:26, AW) The baptism performed today in obedience to Jesus’ command is also in imitation of the example he set. Therefore the meaning of his baptism adheres to the baptism of his followers today. It was a symbol that was enacted openly, showing to John that he had dedicated himself to the doing of his Father's will as that will was revealed to him in his Father’s Word. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 9-11</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s only preparatory work for Armageddon is to have a warning given for the benefit of men. Those of good will toward God can “flee to the mountains.” Armageddon comes as no sneak attack, yet it comes upon worldly men as a thief in the night. How can that be? The warning is being given. It is being preached earth-wide by word of mouth and distributed in hundreds of millions of books and booklets and magazines in more than a hundred languages. Why should such a widely publicized battle come upon this old world like a thief? Because the men of this world have eyes that do not see, ears that do not hear, minds that do not discern. Their eyes are shut, their ears are shut, their minds are closed, but their mouths are open to scoff and ridicule the warning message Jehovah is now having his witnesses declare. This is itself a foretold evidence that we are in the last days of this old world. —2 Pet. 3: 3-5. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span><span class="font3"> 17</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Just as physical waters in the skies reach needy sections of land by means of a set channel, so similar principles are found to exist to bring spiritual waters of truth to men. And as literal lightning follows a set pathway to thunder to earth, we likewise note a conduit-like course for the lightning judgments of Jehovah to come earthward to shake the nations. In connection with literal water the word “channel” is used to refer to a waterway or an established stream of water. In a larger sense the word “channel” is used to describe a means of conduction, a course into which something may be directed. In this latter, larger way the word “channel” is properly used with reference to Jehovah’s age-old method of communicating to his servants his spiritual truths and vital judgments. Facts show that now the Society is that channel. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5/15</span><span class="font3"> 3, 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Today Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere are a united congregation of God. Unitedly, jointly they preach to all the world, showing all lovers of righteousness the way to life. Every one of them must keep alive to the truth, because it is necessary for every individual in the theocratic organization to think as Jehovah thinks. He being their Teacher and his Word being their textbook, they will think alike, work alike and worship alike. Hence their sticking together in Jehovah’s theocratic organization means their everlasting life. Were any individual in this New World society to try to go alone, he would soon see that he never could realize his hope in life. That individual never would get into the new world. So individually each one of us must stay in Jehovah’s New World society and at the same time be an active part of it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 8</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Sometimes a secret must be told even though someone is injured thereby. When you know someone is secretly sinning and jeopardizing his standing with Jehovah and marring the purity of the congregation, you must speak. In some cases it may be sufficient to speak to the individual involved; more often it will be necessary to talk to the servant committee. To make such a report may result in what seems injurious to the guilty person, but actually the ultimate result will be good if he submits. When such a secret is revealed it should be to those able or delegated to correct the matter, and not to gossips. Those of the house of Chloe were not gossiping about the brothers at Corinth. Rather, they made the report to Paul, to one who could remedy matters by authoritatively correcting them and putting their feet back on the path of life and in the footsteps of Jesus. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font3"> 4</span></p>

This is their prosperity and they rejoice in the part each one has had in the generous support of the program that makes it possible. They do not amass great sums to enrich themselves, nor do they allow the need of money, or the necessary expenditure of it, to deflect them from the real purpose of their organization. Neither do they contribute as ‘pay’ for the blessings they receive at the Kingdom Halls. Truth, more precious than gold and silver, cannot be bought. And truth brings love of God and love is manifested in generous giving. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1 27</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Our primary work now is to preach the good news of the Kingdom. Our preaching should be of as high a quality as possible for us, so that we can have a standing before the Kings Jehovah and Christ. For necessary instruction and training the Bible is provided, in order that we “may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.” So by private and group study, by regular attendance at congregational meetings, and by participating in the training program “do your utmost to present yourself approved to God, a workman . . . handling the word of the truth aright.” Satan has woven a gigantic tissue of lies and spreads it like a veil over the nations. But Jehovah’s Word is like a two-edged sword and Christians must be skilled in wielding it to slash to shreds the blinding veil and let the light shine into the honest minds and hearts of sheeplike ones. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font3"> 5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Yes, parental discipline and advice should be given in a firm and loving way. Parents are not to view their children as a burden, as something to be relieved of at every opportunity. They will not think they should be seen and never heard. They need to be allowed to develop as talkers, instructed to speak the praises of Jehovah. He has a place for them in his service and has commanded parents to be constantly alert to teach them Bible truth. Parents will look after their own children at home, at the meetings and in Kingdom service, though others may assist at times. Adults will deal with youngsters in the same understanding way that Jehovah does with his earthly children, and youths should show the same dutiful obedience to dedicated adults that approved men accord the heavenly Father. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font3"> 4/1 18, 19</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Sometimes gossip is deliberate and malicious, designed to run one person down while elevating the gossiper. The slanderer may be undermining another to get his job or steal his friends or get his position of service. He may be trying to build up feeling or opposition against a person because he dislikes that one. Frequently there is a spirit of envy or jealousy in back of talebearing. The gossiper may envy his victim’s prominence or reputation or good works. So he tries to raise himself by lowering others. Any who thus seek to exalt themselves will certainly be humbled and brought low, and likewise those who forward the schemes of such ones by spreading their envious slanders. Also for sake of advantage and to ingratiate oneself with a certain person the schemer might gossip about one he knows this person dislikes. Truly gossip reveals the heart's condition. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font3"> 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">When one begins missing meetings one is withdrawing from Jehovah’s organization, and that is when one begins to become weak. He ceases to express himself or make a public declaration of his hope. In these last days this is no time to take chances. All must be strong in powers of understanding, and the only way we can remain strong is to study Jehovah’s Word and meet with his people. The godly advice is that, as far as the wicked things of this old system of things are concerned, be like children, innocent toward such things and knowing only very partly or incompletely about the evil things, so as to avoid such. Do not associate in such company. But, on the other hand, when it comes to powers of understanding, do not be children; be full grown, mature. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> Ta</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Show love and mercy. Do not take yourself too seriously, have a sense of humor, and you not only can keep molehills from becoming mountains but can reduce mountains to molehills. Many rules could be given, but to give enough rules to cover all cases would be to compile a voluminous talmud. Rather than needing talmudlike rules to follow, we need to inculcate principles to guide and, in the matter of family unity, primarily the principle of love: Loving others as you love yourself; being as kind and considerate of others as you are of yourself ; overlooking their weaknesses as readily as you do your own. Our many faults and sins can make it hard for others, just as theirs make it hard for us. But love docs not keep count of the injuries, the sins and the shortcomings but covers them over, though they be many. Do you have such a love for others to cover their sins as you do for yourself to hide your own? 17 4/f 21</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Gossip is talk that works injury. It may be done maliciously and with intent to injure, but often it is done innocently with no desire to hurt anyone. A harmless statement upon repetition becomes harmful because it is colored or twisted or exaggerated. Without malice a person may do this to make the tale more enticing, more acceptable to hearers, capable of causing a more gratifying reaction of surprise or dismay or shock, and in his zeal the gossiper never thinks of the harm he inflicts on the one involved in it. His mouth becomes a snare in which he puts his own foot and he is caught violating Jehovah’s command. Even though an untrue report is repeated by many, we do not have to follow them and join in slandering our brother. If we are not sure the report is true we should not repeat it.

<p><span class="font3">We need not pity our lot as sharers in Christ's sufferings. Complainers are always unhappy. It is Jehovah’s promise that those who worship him will be happy, and he has not lied. What if we must endure hardships, overcome difficult problems, bear up under persecution? Does suffering hardship mean loss of happiness? Experience has demonstrated beyond argument the answer is an emphatic No! Have you attended one of our assemblies recently? Doing so involves considerable inconvenience and often great expense. It may require a long, hazardous trip. Frequently the conventioners camp in an open field with very few conveniences. Then while attending the daily sessions there may be a trip of many miles in crowded buses or subways to sit for hours in a packed stadium. But who will say that attending a convention of Jehovah’s people is not one of the most unforgettable and joyful experiences of one’s life? </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font3"> 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah gave man this work to do for man’s good, because man was equipped to work and would find happiness in doing this work that was within his capacities. It was for man’s enjoyment and satisfaction that God assigned him suitable work. The work would fill his life, rout any possibility of boredom and give him the satisfying feeling of being useful. In this way the divine attributes of wisdom, justice, love and power would find a proper outlet for full expression. Recent scientific studies have shown that the majority of elderly persons in good health do not want to retire and that “to maintain mental health a man must feel that he is doing work which serves a useful purpose.” So Jehovah aeted for man’s good when he gave man an assignment of work and it is for our good also that we share in the work he has given to the New World society to accomplish.

<p><span class="font3">The holy spirit is the active force of God, through which he accomplishes his purposes. God’s Word itself was provided under inspiration of his spirit and has been preserved as such. This we must recognize. Being baptized in the name of the holy spirit, therefore, is in recognition of the function and purpose of God's holy, righteous active force. This acts upon his people, and | walking in accordance with it means walking in accordance with righteousness, because it is truly a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">holy</span><span class="font3"> spirit. Only if we sow with a view to the spirit can we expect to reap everlasting life from the spirit. We must engage in Christian warfare faithfully, loyally, without throwing down the weapons, without seeking furlough or release, joyful in the opportunity to uphold Jehovah’s side of every controversy.

<p><span class="font3">No Christian will let disaster, hard times, accident, sickness or death break his faith with God. In the Bible record we can see that similar things happened to Job. He lost home, property, children; and finally his wife turned against him, urging him to curse God and die. These things were not acts brought by God. but rather were actions of Satan to destroy the faith of Job, if possible. Job was content to wait upon Jehovah for deliverance, and his faith was rewarded. He was not tested beyond his endurance, though he cried for deliverance. Just as Job was faithful, so Christ, whom he pictured, was faithful even to death. Is our faith of like quality? It will be if it is based on accurate knowledge. If we are willing to follow Jehovah’s counsel, then we shall receive his protection and guidance.

Why, then, should the one who is able to contribute only a small amount compare his offering with the total expenses of the congregation or with the vast amount spent each month by the branch? Those who are able to spend only a few hours in the service do not stay at home because 'the pioneers are able to give much more time.’ Neither should material support of the organization, and the blessings that go with such giving, be limited to those with more funds.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4:13, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our concern should be with making ourselves a group of good preachers. That is why Paul urged: “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.” Wisely, then, each one of us determines to study God’s Word, thus paying attention to ourselves and assuring ourselves of everlasting life. At the same time, by studying the Bible diligently we are able to pay constant attention to our teaching; we can be sure that what we tell others is the truth. As Christians we must follow the above instructions of Jehovah. How much more clearly can it be stated? There it says instruction is our life! Better, then, that we pay attention to instruction, learning how to live. That means sharing in the work of “announcing Jehovah’s kingdom.” Will you share? You can, and you will want to make it your business to heed instruction from God’s Word and hold fast to that instruction. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 6, 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah . . . will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.—Isa. 2: 3, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Who is to do all this teaching and training? Only those appointed by the Society as servants in specific positions together with its traveling representatives? If so, then, in view of the large numbers of the Lord’s other sheep now responding to his voice in every land, it would inevitably mean that the majority of these would have to wait a very long time before they could receive the necessary personal help and training to enable them to become reliable and regular ministers. Besides, is it not true that even among those who have been associated with the organization for quite some time there are many who yet need much assistance? It follows, therefore, that everyone who is established in the truth, whether male or female, can have some part in this vital work of training others who are not so far advanced as himself.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4:12, 14, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here is laid down the fundamental reason and necessity for Christians to keep integrity with the right mental outlook. Consequently a struggle to keep integrity must be expected. Jesus gave u like warning: “Men will expel you from the congregation.” (John 16: 1-4, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">jVW)</span><span class="font3"> Let none therefore become so self-centered, unreasonable or forgetful about the reasons for keeping integrity to Jehovah as to complain or even go to the extreme of rebelling against burdens and hardships. Rather, pause to reason about the matter: when you dedicated yourself to a life of service to Jehovah did you expect a life of luxury, ease and idleness? One who wishes a vacation does not seek employment. Nor does one who enlists in an army expect a furlough. And Christians have volunteered for spiritual warfare.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Let each one of you individually so love his wife as he does himself—Eph. 5:33, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is extremely difficult for a man truly to love and cherish and protect a woman who is not submissive, for by her independence she proclaims that she does not need him. She steals from him, robbing him of the position that is rightfully his. How can he love such a woman as his own flesh, when she is not one with him but is divided against him? Why should he provide bountifully for an unappreciative competitor? He may let her have her way to keep down quarreling, but in gaining the household she will lose his love. And both would lose Jehovah’s approval, the woman for usurping the man’s position and the man for letting her do it. If a husband lets his wife take over, she will lose her deep respect for him and he will lose his selfrespect, and this loss will cause his love for her to give way to resentment. Only in homes where the husband is the proper head do contentment and deep joy exist. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span><span class="font3"> 15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The generous man will be enriched; and he who waters will himself be watered.—Prov.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">11: 25, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Material goods are needed, and can be used in God’s service also; but when pursued beyond our needs they cost too much. The cost of materialism is spirituality, and to pay over spirituality is eventually to pay over your life. Do Jehovah’s work, not your belly’s bidding! All who know Jehovah and serve him—whether rich or poor, young or old, healthy or sickly, famous or obscure, popular or unpopular, talented or mediocre—all of them are happy and contented and hopeful. To take in knowledge of Jehovah and Christ and then give out the truth water to others means life everlasting. Such happy persons now study Jehovah’s Word, tell it to others, obey his commands, live clean lives, systematically preach, become rich in right works, and thereby get a firm grip on the real life that will be filled to overflowing with satisfying works to the everlasting praise of the great Creator God, Jehovah. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1 </span><span class="font3">13, 14a</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I shall show you my faith by my works.—Jas. 2:18, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You can show faith by coming regularly to meetings; and you protect your spiritual health by so doing, strengthening the weaknesses in your knowledge. Faithfulness is shown by diligently performing small assignments and by carrying out in a joyful way the responsibilities given through Jehovah’s organization. This is being faithful in what is little, and, as a result, more privileges will be added. We also show faith by not becoming discouraged when some oppose the truth we bring to them. We patiently and tactfully continue bringing the message to those who desire to hear. We show faith by telling our friends and business acquaintances our hope. Scriptural examples show preaching was done by men of all kinds and even to those who mocked and opposed, by such as Noah, Joseph, Daniel and Christ. Today Jehovah’s witnesses are known for their sincerity and zealousness in talking about the Kingdom as they make their faith known from the housetops. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 23</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">21: 8, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To see gossip for what it is helps us to stop it from going out of our mouth. It is cowardly talk and much of it is lying talk. Who likes a coward and a liar? Not Jehovah. To say behind the back what one fears to say to the face is cowardly. We should not shoot others in the back with words. Do you object to the accused one’s hearing the accusation? Are you not willing to give him a chance to defend himself, to tell his side, to clarify matters? How can he if you do not face him? Are you being fair and honest with your brother? When you start to say something about someone, ask yourself, Am </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">willing to say this to his face? If it is gossip you will probably answer No, and if you are a gossiper you will probably say it anyway.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">28:8, 10, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses have always been and are now a forward-looking people. Just as great prosperity had been foretold for faithful fleshly Israel, so spiritual Israel can expect real blessings. Now that Jehovah has brought forth his people and conferred nationhood upon them they can rely with confidence on Jehovah’s promise of prosperity in their organizational land. Wise provision for the future and continual forward vision will make them like the ant ‘which though having no ruler (on earth), provides her bread in the summer and gathers her food in the harvest.’ Anticipating the needs of the harvest the Society plans the work accordingly, looking to Jehovah to incite the hearts of his people to provide what is needed. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font3"> 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">~Job 32:8, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The creation of Jehovah with which we are acquainted and which is lower than man never fails in its purpose, testifying to his power. But integrity, love, uprightness, these and other related qualities, do not apply below man. They apply to man and on up in the scale of God’s creation. They are qualities of worship. Worship, pure religion, is exclusively possible for that part of God’s creation that is intelligent. The worship of Jehovah is proof of real intelligence. A refusal by a creature to worship God is a failure on the creature’s part. Back to the earth such useless human creature will go. That is good, because it is better that there be a beast or flower or rock than a human deficient in intelligence. The understanding that God gave man means intelligence, discernment, perception, prudence, wisdom, to take the proper course of action. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font3"> 6, 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Does the Christ exist divided? . . . were you baptized in the name of Paul?—1 Cor,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1:13, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A Christian cannot be baptized in the name of any man, nor in the name of any organization, but in the name of the Father, the Son and the holy spirit. This shows, among other things, that Christianity is not a denominational affair, that sects have nothing to do with it. And with the blessed divine requirements in mind, we can see that the decision of dedication must be one of free will, and that it is not to be urged upon anyone. We “beg” persons to “become reconciled to God,” but each one must finally decide for himself what, if anything, he is going to do in response to the truth. This rules out infant baptism because infants cannot make this vital decision. Faith is the basis of the turning to Jehovah. Faith is, in turn, based upon knowledge of God and acceptance of his Word of truth. Dedication follows a period of training, which training must continue. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span><span class="font3"> 15-17a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">15:1, 3, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Is your talk disparaging of the person? Does it hurt his feelings, sow discord or cause him to lose privileges of service? Is it true? If true, has it been exaggerated or colored until the impression it leaves is untrue? Can you say it with a conscience that is clear, so clear that you would say it to the person’s face in exactly the same tone and words? And is the fruit of your talk good or evil? By its fruit it can be recognized. Of course, not all have the same weaknesses. But to counter our weaknesses we must first know them. Do you have a weakness for gossip? If you do, admit it, and fight it! How else can you overcome it? And overcome it you must if you would enter Jehovah’s new world.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 12:2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every one of us has been born in the wicked, delinquent, fearful old world and we have been trained to think selfishly, as human leaders want their followers to think. From childhood we have been taught to hate other nations, people and races and to fear and suspect them. How necessary it is, then, for us to make our minds over, to quit thinking like the old world, and, instead, take instruction from God’s Word, which teaches us to love as he loves! Love casts out fear. When one lives by the accurate knowledge he receives from God's Word, how different his life becomes! But with these new ideas, these newly found truths from God’s Word, we must go forward to teach each other so that all who eventually choose to become part of the New World society will think as Jehovah thinks and grow to maturity. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 2a</span></p>

To believe in their existence is not superstition; it is not only Christian but also scientific. There is a spirit realm, for there is where the invisible Creator, God, who is spirit, dwells. Unknown time before he created our visible universe God made his first creation, his spirit Son. Then by him God made other intelligent spiritual creations, namely, all the glorious, perfect, holy angels, and it was these who “shouted for joy” at the creation of our earth. Thus the spirit realm existed before ever our material universe came into being. The marvelously designed, visible material creation testifies to the existence, power and intelligence of the great Spirit Creator. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> 32</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">All peoples stand in the greatest peril of assault by demons to their own destruction. We dare not trust in Christendom. She has proved to be no protection against spiritism, but in her realm spiritism spreads the same as in heathendom. Where, then, is our protection against the schemes of the demons to cause God to execute all mankind at Armageddon for lack of integrity toward Him and his kingdom? Our protection is in the antispiritualist Book, the Holy Bible. In it alone we find God’s teaching and testimony, and of it Jesus said to God: “Your word is truth.” Consulting the living God by consulting his teaching and testimony in his written Word— this is our source of light and our unfailing protection against the death-dealing operations of the malicious demons. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font3"> 31, 38</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Today Jesus is separating people as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He reproves the goat class because of their failure to show love for his spiritual brothers and sentences them to destruction. He commends the sheep class because of their love for his spiritual brothers and ushers these righteous ones into everlasting life in the new world. They have hope of being preserved alive through the terrible end of this old world into the gloriously opening new worlcL Why? Because even now, by learning to love God and his Christ and by learning to love their neighbor as themselves, they pass over from a death state to a life state, getting onto the way to eternal life.

For the sake of happiness, then, we should not demand more and better from Jehovah, as did the Israelites. Because of their murmuring and complaining they were not going to get the inheritance to which Jehovah had been leading them but were going to die in the wilderness. Neither are those that complain now against God’s way of handling things going to inherit the blessings of the new world, although it is so near, and they will lose their present happiness as well.

If children of dedicated parents want to live forever in the new world, they must give heed to the “discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah” that their parents offer. Years ago youth respected age, but in these last days of critical times youth in general seems to have replaced respect with contempt. But theocratic youths will remember that there is a wisdom and a maturity of judgment that come only with age, with years of study and experience. They will not be like the delinquents of Elisha’s day who taunted and mocked that prophet of God and who came to grief as a consequence.

If the person performing the latter ones will suffer the loss of them, quit doing them, and turn to good works he will be saved. If he will let Jehovah’s judgment eliminate the false practices and will take up the works approved by God he will be saved by this cleansing, purifying fiery judgment; but if he clings to the false works he will perish with them. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font3"> 4a</span></p>

All who make a dedication to do God’s will should be immersed in evidence thereof, and this includes those who find themselves thereafter members of the Lord’s “other sheep,” the “great crowd,” the class with earthly hopes of everlasting life. They wish to carry out all that is righteous. Immersion for them is proper to that end, even as stated by Jesus regarding his baptism at Matthew 3: 15. That these worshipers of Jehovah now being gathered make a dedication individually is proved by, among other scriptures, the ancient prophecy of Micah.

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s law provided for witnesses to testify against wrongdoers. We are not forbidden to bear witness; we are only forbidden to bear false witness. Many in the world condemn the disclosure of facts that expose another. Especially is this the code of the underworld, which says it is odious to tell the truth if it exposes a w’rongdoer. In the Christian congregation it is a mistaken sense of loyalty to a brother to shield his sins when those sins jeopardize both his life and the congregation's purity. The true friend of the brother and of God’s congregation will rebuke him, or if necessary will report to the committee so that rebuke of greater force can be given to shock the sinner back to his senses. A true friend will inflict this temporary wound for the sinner's eternal healing. So the friend that conceals a continued sinful practice is not a real friend, but is actually an enemy. He may be commended by the underworld’s code, but he is condemned by the Scriptural principles of the new world.

<p><span class="font3">The term minister (Greek: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">didkonos)</span><span class="font3"> as used in the Greek Scriptures means, literally, a servant, and here refers to one who is a public servant of Jehovah, and is ordained by him, after dedicating himself by a solemn agreement to do the will of God. Such a minister, in order to prove worthy of the name and retain divine favor, will faithfully carry out whatever commands are laid upon him by the “superior authorities.” He will also, of necessity, prove to be a close footstep follower of Christ, God’s foremost minister, and, like him, will recognize the prior obligation to be a preacher of the good news of Jehovah’s established kingdom by Christ.

<p><span class="font3">According to his own testimony Jehovah is the main support of his organization. This is gratefully acknowledged by all who put their trust in him. (Isa. 12:2) Furthermore, Jehovah assures us that “he will never suffer the righteous to be moved.” This is accomplished by the spiritual provision that he provides for his entire organization. Not as with manna from heaven that sustained fleshly Israel with little effort on their part, Jehovah supports and develops his organization today through his active force upon the anointed society, “his faithful and discreet slave,” and upon its governing body. Previous to his appointing that slave, w’hen Christ ascended on high he gave many servants, “with a view to the training of the holy ones for ministerial work.”—Eph. 4 : 8, 11, 12, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">11: IS, RS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One who discloses secret matters of no concern to others is gossiping. He betrays a trust and works injury. While it is not gossiping to report to the proper servants a continuing sinful practice, it would be gossip to spread it to others who are in no position to take corrective measures, and it would be wrong to reveal a past sin of one who had truly repented and was now making straight paths for his feet. Nor is it gossip to talk about our brothers, what they are doing, where they are going or what is happening to them. We are interested in our brothers, and there is no harm in discussing their activities if we are accurate and if it results in no injury to them.

<p><span class="font3">Fruits of integrity are observable in our relationships with the whole household of faith.

Disappointments, setbacks, apparently insurmountable obstacles will never shake us from patient continuance in well-doing. ‘Pay attention to the flock!’ and, ‘Shepherd the congregation of God!’ are the commands we shall delight to obey. (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2) If we are publishers in the congregation, our integrity will be exhibited in the readiness with which wc labor to assist weaker ones and generally to take that course of action that will promote the unity and peace and prosperity of the congregation.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The sayings that I have spoken to you mean spirit and mean life.—John 6:63, NW,</span><span class="font3"> mar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus spoke the words of his Father in the heavens. He had faith in Jehovah’s words. His course of life was based on his Father’s promises. However, the majority of professed Christians set themselves up as judges of God’s words. But this is no time to push aside God’s Word and say: “I’ll look into that some other time. I have yet many years to live: so I’ll do it later when convenient.” Man reasons that there is so much of importance in this world to care for that he does not have time for the ‘old’ Bible. He wants to keep up to date. He thinks that accumulating riches will make him enjoy life in his later years. But he may never enjoy his savings and he can easily lose out on living eternally. Jesus illustrated this by the rich man who had to build larger storehouses for his crops but who was not rich toward God and died one night. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 3, 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Thy throne is established from of old; thou art from everlasting.—Ps. 93:2, RS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s throne is the absolute center of the boundless universe as to its creative existence, operations and interests. This throne is not at the astral center of the great galaxies of stars or island universes that now exist within or beyond the range of man’s visual powers. But it is at the creative center where God of necessity is the very foundation of all his works. All creation revolves around him as its source, which makes God the Living Center. The centripetal force of this vast system of animate and inanimate things is inward toward him. All is inseparably united to Him. By way of illustration we need only to mention our planetary system. The minutest illustration would be that of the atom. The nuclear design of operations around fixed centers is universal. And to use another illustration, with him “is the fountain of life.” —Ps. 36:9. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font3"> 6</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">They have seen falsehood and lying divination.—Ezek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">13:6, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From prominent spiritualists themselves comes the damaging evidence that the spirits with whom they have contact lie and deceive. They tell of having “to deal with absolute cold-blooded lying on the part of wicked or mischievous intelligences.” It is useless to try to defend spiritualism with the weak argument that there arc good spirits and bad spirits and the intention of spiritualism is to get in touch with the good spirits. Spiritualism is founded on a great untruth, the lie of survival after death and of the immortality of the human soul. Therefore all spirits that would be willing to communicate with spiritualists on the foundation of that lie and try to make that lie appear true must be bad spirits, demons that try to give the lie to God and his Word. But, “let God be found true, though every man be found a liar.” That statement includes every man that is a spiritualist and that gets in touch with these proved lying spirits. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> 19-22</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">No one has love greater than this, that someone should surrender his soul in behalf of his friends.—John 15:13, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Christ’s rule over the church the human husband has a lofty example to aim toward. Did not Jesus expend himself working in the interests of the body members, teaching and preaching, providing the spiritual sustenance that is so much more vital than literal bread? Were not his patience and long-suffering exemplary, his dealings with his disciples merciful and compassionate? Did he not endure much in maintaining integrity toward Jehovah, thereby becoming a safe model for his followers? And finally did he not go the limit and lay down his life for his bride and wife, the church? Surely Christ’s headship over his church demonstrates thoughtful provision, gentle concern, wise understanding, continual forgiveness, protective care and a love that found its climax in the laying down of his own life—and greater love than that no man can have! </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span><span class="font3"> 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Examine yourselves, to see whether you are holding to your faith. Test yourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 13:5, RS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yes, it is needful to keep testing ourselves as to our faith. We can make mistakes, we can get out of line with Jehovah’s principles, we can drift, think on wrong things if we do not read and study the Word of God enough. We cannot come to know God unless we listen to him through his written Word. In private study we can take in much information about God, but by attending congregational meetings our advance study, having equipped us, enables us to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">express</span><span class="font3"> our belief and hope, to benefit others. It is very unprofitable for one to forsake regularly assembling with other dedicated Christians. Think of the harm he does to himself and also to others. He is not incited to love and right works, for he does not hear his fellow workers comment and he is not there to give comment to help them. He is not testing himself to see whether or not he is holding to his faith. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">For since the priesthood is being changed, there comes to be of necessity a change also of the law.—Heb. 7:12, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tithing is not required of Christians. In the first place the tithe in Israel was a means to an end, not the end itself. It was not the material giving but the matters of worship resulting thereby that were to be emphasized. In Jesus’ denunciation of the false religious leaders he showed that the tithe was not even considered as one of the weightier matters of the law. Furthermore, since the tithe was designed to support the Levitical priesthood, the removal of that priesthood to make way for the superior priesthood of Christ Jesus would remove the obligation to tithe. That means that, with the law of Moses and the Aaronic priesthood removed, the law of the tithe goes out with it. Therefore, since Christians are not under law but under undeserved kindness, no organization can Scripturally require its members to tithe.

<p><span class="font3">In turn we should have the same concern for God, not becoming self-centered or selfish so that we take things for granted or feel that Jehovah and his organization owe us something. Avoid thinking that, unless things are done in the way you think best, you are not going to stay with the New World society. Jehovah owes no one a thing. Each of us has been given something of great value. It is the truth that leads to life and our daily service of praise. To Jehovah all are indebted for all we have and for all we hope to gain. Let us not be ingrates, having contempt for his gifts as if we puny people expected more or could do better for ourselves. Above all, let us avoid complaining, because if we complain we shall stop our preaching and then we are certain to become miserable. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font3"> 19a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We must go on “acquiring power in the Lord and in the mightiness of his strength,” because now Satan is mustering his demon princes for an all-out assault against those representing the New World society. Therefore we are told to take up the complete suit of armor of God that we may be able to resist in the wicked day and, after having done all things thoroughly, to stand firm. In Paul’s day the large shield used by soldiers was a real protection in battle. Likewise today, the shield of faith is of greatest importance. And just as a soldier between battles would examine his shield for any weaknesses, so we must continually examine and strengthen our faith so that we do not lose protection in time of need. We know the wicked one continually brings reproach and persecution as flaming missiles against us and the shield of faith is needed to ward them off. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 6, 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In dedication to Jehovah a human creature comes into his own proper state as distinguished from that of all God’s creation below man. Such is the highest and noblest of human ambitions and aspirations, and is the course that must be followed by all who will gain life. When a person comes to an understanding of Jehovah as revealed in the Bible, only selfishness will prevent him from making a dedication of himself to Jehovah, for his dedicated servants come from all walks and classifications of men. It may properly be said that everyone is dedicated to one thing or another. Wherein do the dedications of people in general fall short? In that they are dedications, not to Jehovah, but to selfinterest or some other cause or some other god, and therefore they do not lead the dedicated ones to lasting life to Jehovah’s praise. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">John . . . preached . . . the baptism of those repenting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Acts 13:24, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What w’as the purpose of John's preaching? It was to bring about a change of heart, a repentance, so as to prepare the Israelites for Christ. Some did respond to his message, repented, confessed their sins and were publicly baptized. The baptism accomplished no forgiveness of sins, but it was performed upon those who had repented. That was the purpose of John’s teaching, and the repentance is what brought about the forgiveness of sins against the law covenant. The baptism itself was because of their repentance or was conditioned on it. It was a token of it or a picture of it and so the repentance was thus publicly signified before John and others. Public announcement was made and those persons who thus signified it were properly expected to accept the Messiah. Modern renderings of Matthew 3: 11 and Luke 3: 3 verify this point further. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 19, 20</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">An important means of support given the organization by Jehovah’s faithful people is their regular attendance at meetings of the congregation. Knowing that no organization can be any more than the individuals that compose it, they constantly seek personal advancement in accurate knowledge and maturity of understanding. This they do by making the very most of the meetings provided by the “faithful and discreet slave” as a part of their training for the ministerial work. To make the program a success and provide for the advancement of the local arrangement their own individual contribution is necessary. The early Christians were admonished to “consider one another to incite to love and right works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together.” This united study and fellowship were an essential part of the beginning of the Christian congregation. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">For hardly will anyone die for a righteous man; indeed, for the good man, perhaps, someone even dares to die. But God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 5:</span><span class="font3"> 7, 8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Is such an unusual love a thing to get offended at? The unselfishness of such a love recommends itself to us. It really signifies the highest degree of ingratitude to spurn and turn back a love that is recommended to us in such a way. What man on earth would surrender a dear son to suffer shamefully and die most painfully that those to whom he owes nothing but who deserve destruction may be benefited? God displayed that marvelous degree of love for us humans. That is why it stands written: “God is love.” How could we keep from loving a God like that? When we do learn to love this unselfish God, we are obligated to say as did John: “As for us, we love, because he first loved us.”—1 John 4 : 19, AW. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font3"> 20, 21</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Note some of the excellent qualities shown by Jehovah as the great Leader of his people. On the one hand, with fighting strength and in fiery anger as a manly person of war he proved himself powerful in ability to shatter the enemy. On the other hand, in loving-kindness toward the people whom he had reclaimed from Pharaoh’s grasp, he manifested fatherly strength and ability to protect and conduct Israel gently, yet surely, all the way to their ultimate holy abiding place. Jehovah certainly proved himself a Leader of infinite tenacity and tenderness. In Moses’ closing song we have a lovely and stirring description of Jehovah’s leadership, with all its wealth of significant imagery, finishing on the note of Jehovah’s right to all the honor and credit. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The husband must provide food, clothing and shelter for his wife. But his obligations go far beyond fulfilling these basic physical needs. He must provide for her mental happiness and consider her spiritual well-being, showing a love for her as great as that he bears for himself. Husbands should not be oblivious to the emotional make-up and vicissitudes of their wives. They must give proper direction to their united efforts by making wise decisions and cope with any consequences that may follow in their wake. They must follow right principles, exercise patience and long-suffering, mercy and forgiveness, show consideration and understanding, and, above all, keep alive and active a love patterned after that shown by Jehovah toward his universal organization and as shown by Christ toward the congregation. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">There is a difference between “survival after death” and resurrection. In fact, it is because there is no survival after death that there must be a resurrection of the dead. Since there is no immortality of the human soul and no personality to the spirit of man, the dead in the graves are dead and, to live again, they need to be resurrected. Thus the very foundation of spiritualism must be false and there can be no such thing as communication between the living and the dead. Spiritualism therefore offers a false, misleading comfort to bereaved ones. It subjects them to a deception. It endangers them, for it denies the fall of man, death as the penalty for sin, the need of Christ’s ransom to remove sin and gain God’s forgiveness of sins, and the need of God’s kingdom to destroy this wicked system of things and to resurrect the dead and aid them to attain everlasting life under God’s kingdom. 17 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">9/15</span><span class="font3"> 8</span></p>

Remain truly friendly and loving, remembering that a gos-siper is neither. And treat your fearfully and wonderfully made mind right. Fill it with good. Jehovah’s Word nourishes and strengthens the human mind. Enlarge and deepen your mind to the maturity of appreciating rich food. Better to have more on the mind and less on the tongue than an empty mind and a full tongue. Certainly we are not ignorant of the evils of gossip, of ways to combat it, and of how to use our tongue aright. With Jehovah’s law in our mind we can intelligently fight this sin in our flesh.

<p><span class="font3">It is not good for Christians to take a narrow, shortsighted view about the trials that come upon them. In fact, such hardships bring along with them some of the greatest joys. It is very important to keep the right slant on tests and troubles that come along, either in the present or in the future. We can maintain happiness only by uncomplaining obedience to his will and enduring faithfully in his service. Bearing hardship and even persecution courageously and joyfully, knowing that such hardships will not rob us of our happiness, is the right mental attitude for us to have. Thereby we keep close in mind the all-important reasons for keeping integrity to Jehovah, not weakening or feeling sorry for ourselves and complaining because of the great privilege that is ours. Let us not forget that Jehovah approves of our bearing up under persecution.

Jehovah’s witnesses soon learn that it is essential for them to go to every meeting arranged for them for their education and instruction. To get life they must constantly seek knowledge and learn more of Jehovah and his purposes. They must fully appreciate they cannot get along without his written Word. Also they will learn that they cannot get along without Jehovah’s organization. Their sticking together, their jointly studying God’s Word, makes Jehovah’s witnesses very vigorous.

Work with the New World society now and it may be that you will be able to work with it after Armageddon. It takes effort to seek out and follow theocratic counsel. It requires sacrifice on our part. Such is a commandment from God. “By this we have come to know love, because [Jesus] surrendered his soul for us; and we are under obligation to surrender our souls for our brothers.” (1 John 3 :16, AW) This proper love and concern for our human brothers we will show by telling each one who will listen of his need to praise and worship God. Actually there is no place outside the New World society for Jehovah’s people.

Jesus assured us that the necessities of life would be provided by God if we faithfully serve him. While a man must work to provide things needed for his family, he need not be unduly concerned about the years to come. Jesus emphasized this point when he told us to pray: “Give us today our bread for this day.” God provides for the lilies and for the animals, and he can do as well for us. Do we believe that? We know it is true. Therefore we can devote ourselves without fear to God’s service. If we do so we shall have the privilege of helping others to life and also shall receive God's blessing for the service rendered. So do not be burdened with the things of this world.

<p><span class="font3">The original position of those “sons of God” was up in heaven in the spirit realm, where they were before the foundations of the earth were laid to provide a home, not for angels, but for mankind and the lower animals. Their proper dwelling place was in the loftier invisible realm of the heavens with other spirit angels and with direct access to God's face rather than down here on earth in fleshly companionship with sinful women as wives and as mothers of unnatural children. Adam followed Eve into sin and rebellion against God; these “sons of God” followed the “daughters of men” into sin and demonic rebellion against God. They are the angels Jude refers to and whom he compares to Sodom and Gomorrah. The Israelites, too, committed fornication idolatrously with the flesh of heathen women outside their holy nation.

And now is when it is being preached. It will keep on being preached until this system of things ends and the new system of things, God’s new world of “new heavens and a new earth,” is ushered in with all its blessings.

If we suffer, it should be for maintaining Christian integrity, not for busybodying. Feather than noisily intrude in the affairs of others “make it your aim to live quietly and to mind your own business.” Meddling gossips make trouble. They babble the business of others, color and exaggerate, misrepresent and distort, and heap high their inflammatory whisperings : “Where there is no whisperer, quarreling ceases. . . .

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">22:16, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Docs this show that Paul had his sins forgiven by being baptized, thus washing them away in water? That is not what Paul states. He says that he was commanded to get baptized and that the washing away of his sins was by his calling upon the name of Jehovah through Christ. His calling on him in Jesus’ name showed faithful performance of his conversion or dedication. Was his conversion to Christianity the same as his dedication? Yes, because his conversion means his turning, a turning to follow Christ. This is in harmony with the fact that our repentance must precede baptism. This burial to one’s past course as symbolized by water immersion and the determination to do the will of Jehovah through Christ, that is to say, dedication, are also referred to by Jesus when he said: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after day and follow me continually.”—Luke 9: 23, VW.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">43:10, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the stupendous task of gathering together all true worshipers of Jehovah is Christ, as King and Signal, the only one appointed to undertake the service? No, for Isaiah 43: 10 shows that while at times Jehovah’s servant is spoken of as one individual, there are other instances where that servant is spoken of in a collective sense. So in the final fulfillment there is but the one anointed servant class, yet that class is made up of many individual witnesses or members. Jesus, speaking of this same anointed slave class, spoke of the responsibilities committed to it when he told that God would appoint the faithful and discreet slave over all his belongings. Hence, while the Master retains control at all times and at all levels, yet he gives his faithful followers a considerable share and responsibility in the service of the Kingdom interests. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font3"> 19, 20</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Chron. 29:14, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus never found it necessary to solicit funds for his ministry. He was Jehovah’s minister and Jehovah prospered him. Likewise the Society and Jehovah’s witnesses have never passed a collection plate nor have they ever assessed dues. This has never been necessary and, God helping, will never be necessary so long as Jehovah’s people have his spirit. This giving by his people must certainly bring joy to the heart of Jehovah as it does to all the family of his organization. The advancement of the work to the present time shows that when Jehovah’s faithful servants see the need in God’s great family, either at the local Kingdom Hall or the Watch Tower Society’s branch, they respond even as did the Israelites at the time David gathered materials for building the temple. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font3"> 21</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We expect trouble from Satan’s world, but our faith is confirmed by it, not destroyed. We know Satan will keep on trying to break down those of little faith. The Scripture record is full of demonic opposition to Jehovah’s servants down to the present time. In recent years many have been imprisoned, tortured and separated from their families because of their faithfulness to Jehovah; but nothing can break the faith of the true servant of Jehovah. No matter what comes upon us, we know that Jehovah will not allow us to be tested beyond what we are able to endure, for He will be as a wall of fire around those who serve him and look to him for their protection and safety. In our trial of faith we have the assurance of God’s Word and know that we are backed by his spirit. We do not shrink back from persecution, knowing that, as metal is tempered by heat, so faith is tried and proved by persecution. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 1, 2a</span></p>

From those who insist on worldly practices we must “turn away!” Happy are we indeed if we never go by the advice of the ungodly, never take the road of sinners, never join in the company of the scoffers, but, instead, find joy in Jehovah’s law, poring over it at every opportunity. (Psalm 1) Choosing for our companions others dedicated to pure worship of Jehovah and persons of good will who delight to hear and talk about God’s purposes will do much toward buttressing our integrity. “Do not be misled.

<p><span class="font3">By an illustration Jesus showed that work gives its own reward in joyfulness. A man was going on a trip, but before leaving he summoned his slaves and left them in charge of his interests, distributing his goods according to the varying abilities of his slaves. After a long absence he returned and called for an accounting. By diligent work the one caring for five talents doubled them, and the one caring for two talents doubled them, but the one left in charge of one talent was sluggish and did nothing with it and so gained nothing. Now, how were the two industrious workers rewarded? Were they told to take a vacation? No, their reward for hard work was, not a vacation, but, of all things, more work! The master’s joy was in this work, and by getting more of this work to do the diligent slaves entered more fully into their master’s joy.

<p><span class="font3">“Dedication” means to declare, to affirm, to state solemnly, to devote. It is an act by which a person or thing is initiated into some way or course or use. To us dedication is the exclusive devotion to the worship of Jehovah. It is setting oneself apart by decision, unreservedly and unconditionally to do the will of Jehovah through Christ, as expressed in the Bible and made plain by God's holy spirit. So dedication means henceforth living a holy life, separate from the corrupt world, and serving Jehovah. Dedication requires a decision. You must decide whether you are going to worship and serve the God who gave you life or whether you are going to disregard his Word and his will in your personal life. If you will dedicate yourself </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to serve</span><span class="font3"> him in honesty and sincerity and out of love for him in appreciation of his goodness to you, you are a wise and blessed person. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font3"> 10, 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Hebrew word translated “signal” does not refer to a flag raised aloft by a leader marching at the head of a column of people, rather it refers to a stationary signal set up on a lofty height. This prophecy had a miniature fulfillment when Jerusalem was restored on her own hilltop with Jehovah’s visible representative governing in her midst and with his official high priest conducting the clean worship of Jehovah in the rebuilt temple. Now is the time of its final fulfillment and happy are our eyes that clearly behold Christ as the Signal, enthroned on the lofty height of Mount Zion, the established kingdom of God, for the purpose, primarily, to give lead in restoring and forever establishing in this earth the true, pure worship of Jehovah. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1 </span><span class="font3">16-18</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Every one of Jehovah’s witnesses wants to dwell in the house of Jehovah forever. They have dedicated themselves as Jehovah’s slaves and they are fully cognizant of Jehovah’s will concerning them. They know what he wants them to do despite any outside influences. Knowing that the taking in of more knowledge of him and his purposes is the right thing to do and the way to life eternal, and knowing that they want to live so that they can serve Jehovah, they certainly will not be fearful of anyone else. If they are afraid of evildoers and any hurt that may come upon them, they will fall into a snare. But by staying wholly on Jehovah’s side and in his organization and close to the congregation of his people they will observe their enemies fall and eventually vanish permanently in the battle of Armageddon, now near. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> lb</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Faith can remove mountains but do we let it move us to have a share in fulfilling Matthew 24: 14 ? If some do not want to hear the truth, we need not force it on them as pearls of truth to swine, but we should let our faith be known so that those who want to can hear and learn. We should never let our faith diminish, even though opposed by our own families. The faith of the early Christians at Rome was “talked about throughout the whole world.” Certainly that is true today as the thundering message of truth is proclaimed by us in 158 countries in all parts of the earth. If we display our faith and make it known to others it will make glad the heart of Jehovah and we shall have the joy of leading men of good will toward life. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1 25</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus.—Acts 19:4, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Because John baptized persons in symbol of the repentance that they had made, repentance for sins against the law, he could not understand why Jesus came to him to be immersed, because Jesus had no sins. Yet to him Jesus stated: “Let it be, this time, for in that way it is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous.” Further proof that Jesus’ baptism and Christian immersion is not the same as that performed by John is in the account of Acts 19: 1-5, where certain believers who had been baptized with John’s baptism had to be baptized again in the name of Jesus. So Jesus set a pattern starting something new, not a baptism for remission of sins nor in symbol of repentance but the Christian’s immersion in symbol of dedication, even such as Jesus himself thereby symbolized. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 20, 21</span></p>

Knowing they are guilty themselves, they judge others by themselves, but much more harshly than themselves.

You will sensibly work out your own salvation according to God’s provisions and his requirements, joining in with Jehovah’s witnesses in preaching this good news of the Kingdom in all the earth for a witness. Accepting the sword of the spirit, that is God’s Word, you will be able to parry the worldly sword, utterances inspired by demons, religious traditions and materialistic philosophies of men. You will be able to meet the enemy swordsman in close combat and render him powerless in argument and influence and deliver yourself from him by quoting and relying upon God’s written Word, as Jesus when tempted by the Devil in the wilderness. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font3"> 44, 45</span></p>

There are also prospective earthly sons of God with us today who hope for life as His children in the glorious paradise of the “new earth.” They, too, must conquer the world just as the ancient, pre-Christian witnesses of Jehovah from Abel to John the Baptist did. To do so they must make the same practical display of their faith in Jehovah and his kingdom. But though we are surrounded by so great a cloud of ancient witnesses of Jehovah, we are especially looking at Jehovah’s greatest witness, his Son Jesus Christ, for he was the greatest conquerer of this world. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font3"> 25</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In the congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses it is not just a few who carry the expenses of the organization. As a further example of their unity, the financing of the work is accomplished by the combined giving of all. For example, in supporting the Kingdom Hall some will be able to give more and some less, but those who can give but little need not feel ashamed or feel they cannot have some share. Jesus made this quite clear when he showed how much he appreciated the ‘widow’s mite.’ Those who have an abundance give as they can; it does not hurt them and it is pleasing to Jehovah. But the one who gives of his little amount shows his sincerity to an even greater extent. Giving small amounts is not appreciated or encouraged by the false religions of Christendom, but that is not true in Jehovah’s organization. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font3"> 28, 29</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The salvation from God is not an escape from existence, but is a rescue from death or nonexistence. Going into nonexistence is the punishment for wrongdoing against God. (Rom. 6:23) Those who go into that state of nonexistence should not flatter themselves with the thought that they are experiencing a salvation from life or existence. They are undergoing a punishment and are missing the eternal happiness of perfect life in God’s new world. Any animal or brute beast can die; so for mankind dying is nothing superior to the fate of animals. Salvation from God is a rescue or escape from this beastlike fate, a rescue from nonexistence. God does not preserve the lives of his enemies or sinners in order to keep them unhappy and in pain. He preserves the lives of those who love him to make them enjoy complete happiness forever. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font3"> 15</span></p>

There are some very pointed Scriptural examples demonstrating that invariably com-plainers lose happiness. Often they have suffered the loss of life itself. So we can see how serious it is if we complain against Jehovah or against his organization and its instructions, when such complaining brings sorrow and misery with ultimate death. Take the example of the ancient people of Israel. Had not Jehovah delivered them from oppression in Egypt, protected them and fed them in a loving way so that they were never hungry, cold or naked? They certainly had nothing to murmur about. Never forget that their example applies to complainers now, today.

A headless union would lack proper directive force, whereas a freakish twoheaded one would engender strife and eventual split-up. Let all face this fact: everyone has a head over him except Jehovah, who is Head over all. This arrangement was not made by any creature, but is the law of the Creator of the universe.

Remember the illustration of the sheep and goats. The way you treat your brothers is the way you treat Christ. You would not gossip about him, would you? In fact, the Bible says that if you say you love Jehovah but are hating your brother you are a liar, “for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot be loving God, whom he has not seen.” So start now and never stop paying on the debt of love you owe to your brothers. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font3"> 15a</span></p>

The failure of the ban and persecutions to stamp out Jehovah's witnesses or to halt their increase is an eloquent testimony that among Jehovah’s witnesses the Communists have met up with the one “better religion,” and it serves notice upon these radical fighters against Jehovah that his witnesses will be here triumphant after communism and other radicalisms have gone.

Certainly, then, no condemned spirit medium could force Samuel to do after death what he had refused to do during life. Furthermore, the lady medium could not raise the dead. Only God can do that and he did not accommodate a condemned medium and bring back Samuel for her. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> 16</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our being adequately qualified issues from God.—2 Cor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3:5, NW.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark410"></a><span class="font3">Today mankind stands in great need of adequately qualified ministers. In itself, being adequately qualified means being suitable, being fit, having what is necessary for the ministry, being equal to the requirements of the ministry, in order to carry it out successfully and produce the results desired, namely, other real Christians able to meet the tests of the day, overcome all the faith-destroying, morals-corrupting influences, keep on imitating Christ and gain the approval of God for eternal life in the new world. No one can be adequately qualified to be a minister of God unless he has the light from God through Christ shine upon him, repents of his sinful course, accepts God’s mercy, calls upon God's name to have his sins washed away in the blood of Jesus’ sacrifice and gets baptized in water and thus shows faith and makes a public declaration of that faith.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The cloud began to cover the tent of meeting and Jehovah’s glory filled the tabernacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Ev. 40: 34, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Moses completed the construction of the tabernacle and set it up in the wilderness, “Jehovah’s glory filled the tabernacle.” That miracle symbolized that Jehovah had come to his temple and was now in his holy temple. Eight days later, or the first day after the full consecration of high priest Aaron and his underpriest sons, they themselves performed their first sacrifices for themselves and for the nation of Israel. At the climax “Jehovah’s glory appeared to all the people, and fire came out from before Jehovah and began consuming the burnt offering.” That acceptance of the sacrifice offered by Aaron and his sons was a proof that Jehovah had accepted their consecration to the priesthood according to his covenant with Levi. The cloud that rested above the tabernacle served as a sign that Jehovah was in his holy temple. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.—Matt. 24:14, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Kingdom-preaching that Jesus predicted in this prophecy had to wait until this twentieth century in order to go into action. God’s timing of events made it so. What is the kingdom the good news of which was to be preached earth-wide to all nations at the foremeant time? The apostles had asked about Christ’s actual presence in his Godgiven kingdom. And concerning his “coming” into that kingdom Jesus said in later verses of his same prophetic answer: “They will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. . . . then he will sit down on his glorious throne.” Consequently the kingdom about which this good news would be preached is the kingdom with Jesus Christ present in it in power, on his throne of active rulership. The Kingdom is, not one yet to be set up, but one now established. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font3"> 6</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A continual dripping on a rainy day and a contentious woman are alike; to restrain her is to restrain the wind ar to grasp oil in his right hand.—Prov.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">27</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">:15, 16, RS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When women talk they discuss what interests them, which means they talk about people, which in turn means there is an ever-present danger that the talk may become gossip. Men are more interested in inanimate things, and when they talk about such the danger of gossip is not so great as when discussing people. Talking in itself is not bad. Woman’s talkativeness can be and often is nut to good use. By it small children learn to talk. Because of their ready speech women ministers may present the truth to others more easily than men, and they may make more of a contribution to congregational meetings by volunteering comments. But this asset can become a snare when the tongue breaks loose and runs uncontrolled in gossip. Hence </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">let </span><span class="font3">all examine themselves to see whether they have a weakness for gossip, and if they find they do let them keep a special watch over their tongue. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font3"> 8</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Go ... , baptizing them in the name ... of the San.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 28:19, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To be baptized in the Son’s name is in recognition and appreciation of the authority that he exercises by Jehovah’s appointment as “leader and commander to the peoples,” as King of kings and Lord of lords. “His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.” The salvation for which we hope and in which we trust and for which he eventually officiates in our behalf in priestly office is dependent upon him as Jehovah’s great provision. Yes, dedication to Jehovah is not without recognition of the Son but is in appreciation of the fact that our relationship to God is through the Son, and we confess his lordship to the glory of God. Not getting wet with water, but the sacrifice of Christ is the basis of our salvation and forgiveness of sins. So we gladly recognize the office of authority, even the “name” of the Son. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span><span class="font3"> 12, 13a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">How do we view our Christian ministry ? As something to be attended to just when we have a few minutes to spare from other matters of this life, its amusements, ambitions and careers? No, not in that way. If we would avoid loss of integrity we must take our commission as preachers of the Kingdom in all seriousness. And this we will do if we have genuine love for God and our neighbor. Love for God will cast out fear of puny humans and condemned demons. Love for our neighbors will rivet us to the post of duty, giving warning of danger and directions for escape from destruction. So cultivate love. Be loving, considerate and merciful in all your dealings. Your relationship toward your brother must be so adjusted that it will be truly beneficial to him, not stumble him. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span><span class="font3"> 5, 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Thess. 5:14, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For one to become a spiritual man requires time. If he is a person of the world, he must first study. It may take six months or a year of home Bible studies before such a person of good will is able to understand and appreciate what Jehovah’s purposes are, but in time any person who is sincere and who has a sheeplike disposition will see that the instruction set forth in God’s Word is of greatest value, and it will not be long until he will be becoming spiritually-minded. All the “other sheep” who have dedicated themselves to God have become spiritually-minded just like the anointed remnant. They have become spiritually-minded through the interchange of faith, through communicating to one another about the things they believe. Those who are truly spiritually-minded can help weaker ones in the organization as well as comfort those who may be depressed. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 13a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 37:10, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Intelligent and honest-hearted ones learn where their place is in Jehovah’s sight. Does God have laws of nature to bind them in a certain place? Is man forced to stay in his place? Do the Scriptures tell us where man’s place is and how to get into it and stay in it? There is a relationship possible between man and his Creator and man’s getting into this relationship means a secure place for him with protection. Said David: “Thou art my hiding-place; thou wilt preserve me from trouble.” Man expressing himself as recognizing his dependence upon Jehovah, God answers by showing him exactly what arrangements he has made to put man in his place and for him to keep his plaee. “I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee.”—Ps. 32: 7, 8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">AS.

<p><span class="font3">To love is a wholesome, uplifting, enriching and inspiring thing. The loving of God is the most sublime experience. It primarily is the thing that moves us to accept and act upon the divine terms for everlasting salvation in this time of man’s crisis, for then our effort to gain life in the new world is not a purely selfish effort. Really to benefit ourselves and to glorify God we must respond to God’s love and obey his two great commandments. The great mass of humanity will refuse to do so and will simply perish at Armageddon. They have no love for “Christ’s brothers” nor for his “other sheep.” And having no love for these, they really have no love for Christ nor for Jehovah. “He who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot be loving God, whom he has not seen.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font3"> 33</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">union.—Col. 3: 14, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Above all, a common love for Jehovah will unite families. It is now uniting hundreds of thousands from many nations, races, colors, languages and cultural backgrounds. If it can unite thousands upon thousands from many nations and races it should not be hard for it to preserve unbroken the family circle. It is doing this for tens of thousands of families in many lands, welding them together by their discussing God’s Word, studying it together, attending congregational meetings as a group, and worshiping together in field service. Devotion to Jehovah cements them in a firm unity and harmony. Theocratic conduct within the family circle keeps that circle unbroken. Apply the Scriptural counsel for forgiveness, peace, love, spirituality, subjection, obedience and forbearance in the family circle. Work at it whole-souled as to Jehovah. Then you will receive a reward from him, if not from appreciative family members. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span><span class="font3"> 23, 25</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Have faith in God.—Mark 11:22, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our faith should be in Jehovah rather than in men. If we remember that our dedication is to him we shall never be stumbled by what others do. Each one stands or falls before his own master; therefore we will not be offended because of seeming slights or oversights at congregation meetings. If we are mature in our faith we shall have the proper Christian attitude toward our brothers at all times. When we have maturity in our outlook we shall always be constant in our disposition and dealings with others, even if </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font3"> vary and change. We know our brothers love God or they would not be serving him. For that reason we should have confidence and trust in them as they prove themselves faithful to Jehovah. We should love them for their faith and service and overlook personal differences. Such close unity and devotion are vital when we are under persecution. It is a part of making the mind over. Yes, faith, like love, will help us to overlook inconsequential things. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 9:10, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah does not want man deprived of the fruits of his labor. “The hard-working farmer must be the first to partake of the fruits.” Even the oxen were to partake of the fruits of their labor. But are the oxen the primary concern? If Jehovah safeguards the interests of the working brute, how much more so will he champion the welfare of working men I Paul is not here nullifying the divine rule of consideration for oxen, but by a forceful rhetorical construction he is showing that in comparison with men, oxen are as nothing, and if the humane principle applies to oxen it applies with incomparably greater force to mankind, and especially to those laboring in Jehovah’s service and sowing spiritual things in the interests of others. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1 5</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The spirit of giving originates with Jehovah. Out of himself he has given all created things and out of his boundless love he continually renews the surface of the earth. Truly generous giving is prompted by love and, on the part of mankind, by a sincere appreciation with no thought of reward. It is done either spontaneously out of an overflowing heart or out of loving consideration for the one to whom the gift is made. Christiana recognize the responsibility of giving, but to them it is no painful duty but a blessed privilege that they earnestly seek to cultivate in order to become more Godlike and more positive in their manifestations of love toward Jehovah and their brothers in the New World society. Being voluntary members of the family, they recognize that support of the organization must be voluntary, given out of a full and appreciative heart for all God’s goodness. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1 </span><span class="font3">1, 2</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">If we feel the urge to complain about things, let us examine our motives and not leave Jehovah out of the transaction, as did the crying Israelites. There is abundant proof that Jehovah knows where he is leading ns and just how to run his organization. Those who stick to it and keep its instructions faithfully are going to be a very happy and contented people. With this viewpoint we can keep in mind the wonderful things God has accomplished on behalf of his people in times past. We shall not forget what he is doing for us today and the bright future prospects that are ours. Keeping these happifying thoughts in mind, we are determined to maintain our integrity faithfully and, in view of all that has happened in the past, we conclude that, of all people, we have no cause to complain.

All of us have some gifts that we have cultivated for the improvement of our ministry. We can use these to demonstrate our love for our brothers. Perhaps we can help our brothers to prepare and assist them to make comments in the weekly study of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and in other congregation meetings. We have the opportunity also to aid our young brothers or those with language difficulties to prepare student assignments in the theocratic ministry school.

<p><span class="font3">For their disobedience these have been sentenced to death with Satan. However, their sentence was not executed upon them even at the Flood. In the meantime they have been penalized with having to dwell in Tartarus, which, in the Bible, means an abased condition, deprived of privileges of service rather than a position or a place, and where they are held under dense darkness. It is a spiritual darkness rather than a literal one, with no light of truth and revelation and favor from God. That is why their messages through mediums give no explanation of the Bible and throw no light on Bible prophecies. So, being in pits of dense darkness does not mean that their operations in connection with humankind are restricted to seances in the dark with mediums. They can perform through human agents also in the daylight. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font3"> 3-7</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We have faith in the way of preaching used by Christ and his apostles. We are not too lazy to follow it nor are we afraid to do it because it is the unsafe way, exposing us to ridicule, abuse, violent opposition and religious persecution. Instead of appealing to the “sword of the state,” we wield the “sword of the spirit, that is, the word of God,” and let it do the converting. We use the direct, practical, thorough method of Bible education, giving the people home instruction, private, personal, individual instruction in God’s Word, leading literature containing printed Bible sermons with the people called upon, then returning later to answer Bible questions and to start home Bible studies. This is the aggressive, sensible way that rescues many individuals from the swelling tide of paganism. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font3"> 17</span></p>

When he finally left Corinth he left behind the fruitage of his labors, a Christian congregation that was a letter of recommendation, inscribed “with spirit of the living God,” for it was done by the spirit of God working through Paul. God’s spirit in Paul wrote the readable words of that congregation letter, being written on warm, loving “fleshly tablets, on hearts.” Those hearts were something to read, for they told of love first to God, of faith exercised for righteousness and of mouths moved to make public declaration for salvation. For anyone to produce such a living, speaking letter of recommendation of its writer his being adequately qualified by God was most certainly required. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1 </span><span class="font3">25, 26a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In the face of that uniform stamp the governors of all of Persia’s provinces and also the Jews recognized the binding force of those written documents and they acted as instructed in them. So let no one undervalue the power of a properly stamped letter; the stamp gives it weight and authority. What else the letter may say or whom else the same letter may appoint to a different service does not take away from that servant’s special position. So stamped appointment letters are used by the Society, and all congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses recognize the stamp and accept the appointment. Who, then, has a right to question the power of the ordination or appointment? You may be sure that all such special servants put in office by these stamped letters the Society’s governing body keeps its hands on, not literally, but to back them up, support them or to remove them in the general interests of the work. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 20, 21a</span></p>

But does that complete our commission? No, there is a further work to be done in behalf of those who sigh and cry over the abominations committed in Christendom and who are ready to heed the warning message. Generally these know little or nothing of the fundamental truths of God’s Word, nor of Jehovah’s theocratic organization, Zion, as the place to which they must flee for protection. We must therefore aid these people, not only to get a knowledge of the truth but also to appreciate what they should do about it, namely, come up over the highway leading from Babylon to Zion.

<p><span class="font3">Most gossip is slanderous. Any truth once present is soon magnified till the bulk of the tale is lies. Friends begin to shy away from the one being slandered, and Jehovah’s hatred comes upon the gossiper “who sows discord among brothers” in the congregation. Often gossip is not malicious and no harm is intended, but harm follows nonetheless. If you accidentally kill a man he is just as dead as if you meant to do it. If you spread lies thinking them truths, they are still lies and you are lying. You may try to shift the blame to another, saying he told the tale to you. But according to the libel laws if one repeats a lie in print he is guilty, regardless of who started it or whom he was quoting. After all, if only the originator of a rumor uttered it the rumor would never get very far or do much damage. Does not Jehovah hold responsible those today who repeat the religious lies started many centuries ago? He also holds accountable the gossipers who either start or spread lies. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font3"> 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The case of King Saul and the medium is no unsolved problem. The spirit that tricked the medium into practicing her unlawful business also caused the medium to see a god coming out of the earth and tricked her and also Saul by counterfeiting Samuel’s former living appearance. That invisible spirit working through the medium knew how Samuel dressed in life and what he had said to disobedient King Saul and how he had refused to see King Saul any more and what he looked like at his death. So the spirit could easily counterfeit all that, and he did. The spirit knew that God was against Saul and that Saul had displeased Jehovah further by consulting a spirit medium and was condemned to death for that and would not be helped by Jehovah in battle. So the spirit could reasonably predict defeat for Saul and death to him and his sons. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> 15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Because Jesus called it “good news” let no one think that it docs not take courage and faith in God to preach it. It does. Why? Because the world is no friend to God’s kingdom, neither are Jehovah and Christ friends to this world. Revelation 12 : 5 (.VW) shows that God's kingdom “is destined to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod,” which iron rod is for dashing the nations of this world to pieces. It is no wonder that since 1914 the nations have raged in two world wars, have meditated vain things, such as the United Nations, and have taken counsel against Jehovah and his King. Hence, when a true Christian comes preaching the only really good news he comes as a publisher of a kingdom that is prophesied to destroy the nations of this world.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who delegated power to me, because he considered me trustworthy by assigning me to a ministry.-—1 Tim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1:12, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No man can adequately qualify himself or qualify another as God’s minister. But what we cannot do, God can do. Christ’s sacrifice allowed God to forgive sin. So Jesus stopped Saul the persecutor by blinding him and sent him into the city of Damascus to await the coming of a Christian whom Saul had been bent on persecuting. When this Ananias came to Saul he explained how God was adequately qualifying Saul for the ministry. Saul ‘recovered his sight, rose, was baptized and filled with holy spirit.’ He washed his sins away in the cleansing blood of Christ by calling upon Jehovah who had covenanted to forgive sins and remember iniquities no more. Saul, now baptized, forgiven and filled with holy spirit, felt adequately qualified and sent by God. Hence he at once took up the ministry for which he had been made fit. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 4, 6, 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The priests were unable to enter into the house of Jehovah because Jehovah’s glory had filled the house of Jehovah.—2 Chron. 7:2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By the Ark in the innermost room and by the glory cloud that filled the sacred place, Jehovah’s presence was visibly symbolized. Then Solomon acknowledged Jehovah's faithfulness and blessed all the people present there at the temple. Standing now before the great altar upon which were laid animal sacrifices to God, Solomon offered a long prayer, making petition also in behalf of future worshipers from foreign lands. Jehovah then gave striking evidence that he had heard Solomon’s prayer. The fire from heaven that kindled the wood on the new altar and that consumed the sacrifices on it showed that Jehovah had accepted the temple and its altar. It showed he approved of the transfer of his worship from the old tabernacle to this sacred palace on Mount Moriah. He was now present in this temple. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 7, 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By Mm we have life and move and exist.—Acts 17:28, NW,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The God Source who created all things is not just abstract energy or force left to operate by mere chance. Rather it is Absolute Intelligence itself, the Great Personage, the Communicative One, the Greatest Personality with qualities of infinite love, wisdom, justice and power, and ever existing in a perfect state of happiness. He is always at the zenith of power to bless and make happy. He is the Rock of Absolute Security. For his good pleasure he created intelligent spirit creatures in heaven to live bappy, loving, purposeful lives. For his equal delight God created perfect man on earth in his affectionate image to live an endless life of happiness and purpose. So toward this One of infinite love there exists a natural line of venerating attachment on the part of all intelligent creatures. Yes, we have a basic need and desire to maintain communication with our very Source of life.—Isa. 42: 5. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font3"> 8</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">112: 7, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you find any others on earth who have such delight and satisfaction of living as Jehovah’s witnesses have in serving the Sovereign Ruler of the universe? No wonder it is true that not one of these will be afraid of evil tidings. The reason is that their heart is fixed and they do trust in the living God. As children of Zion, they, to the extent of their capacity, rejoice in Jehovah and his enthroned and unconquerable King, Christ Jesus. The clergy with all their threats, their mob action—the rulers with all their bans and restrictions against “freeness of speech,” their taking away and destroying the printed material Jehovah’s witnesses use to enlighten others with Bible truths—none of these things frighten them. Conscious is each of them that “the desire of the wicked shall perish.” Jehovah’s witnesses earth-wide courageously work on! </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Unitedly,</span><span class="font3"> as one man, let us continue to announce Jehovah’s kingdom. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 13b</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">When John dipped Jesus beneath Jordan’s waters Jesus was not there forgiven inherited sin or deliberate sin, because he had neither. He was not inducted into the body of Christ because he became Christ, the Head of his body. He was buried beneath the water and raised from it, buried to his previous course and raised to the doing of his Father’s will. Likewise for us, after we have made a personal dedication to Jehovah, the immersion performed by a Christian of like faith is an initial act of obedience on our part, obedience to the will of God iu accordance with his wishes as expressed by Christ who himself had baptism performed upon his followers and who commanded that it be continued. Following Jesus’ ascension to heaven, baptism was performed upon Christian converts such as Saul who became the apostle Paul. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span><span class="font3"> 13, 14</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">9:16, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Among Jehovah’s witnesses the preaching is not confined to that by capable speakers from the platform but every baptized member is encouraged, aided and trained to become a preaching witness, able to go alone from house to house and preach introductory sermons of some minutes’ length and also to make return visits and give still longer sermons to show the value of Bible study. Everyone is a preaching minister and none can escape his responsibility to preach in obedience to Christ’s command. Each is keenly conscious of Jesus’ prophecy at Matthew 24: 14, and each one feels with Paul when he exclaimed as above. Each one knows it is vital, not only to the salvation of others, but also to his own salvation to preach publicly, for ‘.while it is with the heart that one exercises faith for righteousness, it is with the mouth that one makes public declaration for salvation.’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font3"> 21, 22</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The word of Jehovah came unto me, saying, Before 1 formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou earnest forth out of the womb I hallowed thee, I appointed [ordained,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> AV] </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">thee a prophet unto the nations. . . . thou shalt go to whomsoever I shall send thee.—Jer. 1:</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5, 7, Da.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark411"></a><span class="font3">That it is God who ordains or appoints a person to be his minister was typified in the case of Jeremiah, who was a minister of the old law covenant. Being of the priestly family of Aaron, Jeremiah was automatically in line to be a priest at the temple in Jerusalem. But to be more than a priest, namely, a prophet who would prophesy with respect to all nations, Jeremiah needed more than to be born as the son of Hilkiah the priest. No man could make him such a prophet. God, who inspires prophecy, was therefore the One to ordain or appoint him as prophet, to qualify him adequately. Jeremiah points to his ordination or appointment from God in the above words. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span><span class="font3"> la</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">17:11,, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Blood flowing freely and fully within your body’s blood vessels means your life as a human soul. Jehovah tells us how important our blood supply is, saying: “The soul of every sort of flesh is its blood by the soul in it.” We can therefore see the reasonableness of his command for us not to take the blood of other people into our system. Because blood has life value, God justly accepted the blood of a proper victim as an atoning sacrifice or a repurchasing price for the life that mankind had lost as a penalty for sin. Even as God was pleased to accept the lifeblood of a proper victim in payment for the life of another, so God is perfectly just in demanding that the life of a person who had been undeservedly killed should be offset or counterbalanced by taking the life of the killer. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font3"> 2</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3:7, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The terms of their covenant required that the Israelites offer only sound animals. But they were offering blind, lame, sick and lean animals and their priests were accepting such for Jehovah’s altar. His altar is as a table and the sacrifices offered on it are as food to him. In view of this both the people and the priests were showing contempt for his temple table; they were offering polluted food upon it and thus cheating God, robbing him. Instead of giving his name glory they were despising it. When they were thus cheating God and the careless priests gave the impression that he did not mind, how could they rightly expect to receive the blessings promised in the covenant to only faithful, appreciative worshipers of Jehovah? This same principle applies to all dedicated servants of Jehovah today. Only faithfulness will be rewarded with prosperity. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 8</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 24:12, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since God’s love has come to the rescue in man’s crisis, we see the importance of love. To live we must love. Adam and Eve found that out when they unlovingly sinned against their God and Creator and had to die for failure to love him. Humankind today must find that out, but not at Armageddon when it is too late as in the ease of Adam and Eve. All of us today are feeling the bitter consequences of their failure to love—to love God and to love each other. But an increasing number of people today are finding it out now and they are learning to develop and exercise the required love. Living as we are today in the awful “time of the end” and now so near its close we are in great danger of succumbing to selfishness and insane hatred. Jesus warned of this at Matthew 24: 12. To cease to love means death. If we do not want to die, we must love. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font3"> 30</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Since Jehovah has created man in his image, everyone wants to be happy. Christians have ever so much more to be happy for than mankind in general. There is every reason for us always to look at the bright side of things. We alone have the good news that brings genuine joy. Serving God faithfully ensures happiness now and everlastingly. For a multitude of people of good will toward God it will result in everlasting life on earth with endless blessings. We can be very glad for Jehovah’s goodness. He is calling together in his worship people who are happy individuals, a people who are friendly and anxious to have others join with them in their happiness. Their conversation is edifying; they recommend and teach to others the kingdom of God, which will leave nothing wanting. In gratitude we observe that “there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”—Acts 20: 35, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

They must present the truth in a way that their children can grasp it, and also bring their children to the congregational meetings with them. Parents arc obligated to have their children in subjection and under control, and if a family head cannot do this he is unfit to be a special servant in the Christian congregation. Just as servants in the congregation perform their duties lovingly and tactfully, so the parents must exercise their parental authority with a firmness that is tempered by love and tact. If only one parent is in the truth, then that one must instruct the children to the extent possible, and thereby hope to save the children. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span><span class="font3"> 7a</span></p>

That will guard us against losing our appreciation and fear of Jehovah. It will keep us humble, always reminded of our own limitations and our complete dependence upon God for everything. Humility will also deter us from trying to go alone. The gift of knowledge of God’s purposes reached us through his “slave” organization, and we may go on rejoicing in the steadily increasing light of truth only as we humbly throw in our lot with his namepeople, assembling with them and deriving from their companionship the courage and fearlessness in preaching that has rendered them notable throughout the world. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font3"> 4/15 1, 2a</span></p>

Admittedly such experiences and observed phenomena are a proof of something. Of what? Of an invisible realm with intelligent spirit creatures, but decidedly not of “survival after death” or of communication between the dead and the living. In this respect spiritualism is a case of mistaken identity, that is, spiritualists mistake the identity of the ones in the spirit realm with whom they communicate. They think these are human souls once alive on earth but now departed. For their own purposes the spirits do not reveal their true identity but assume an identity that is not theirs. Who are they?

In order to keep our place there we must be diligent to follow the counsel God gives us. Those who have positions of responsibilities and are special representatives of the New World society should strive to carry out all the counsel mentioned above by Paul as well as the counsel given throughout the entire Bible. Jehovah caused it to be recorded and preserved for the very purpose of aiding us to get into our proper place in whatever position we serve. Let no one try to evade the duties that come upon him, thus trying to step out of his place, but let each one be eager to accept the responsibilities and diligent to carry them out. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font3"> 21</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Discipline puts to proof our faith. We need confidence in God’s organization and the actions taken through the congregations. In order to keep the standard of pure worship high the leaven of unrighteousness must be purged out. If we are corrected for error or wrongdoing and discipline is administered, we should be grateful for the reproof and thereby show faith in the chastisement received. Perhaps a friend has been disfellow-shiped. We know that discipline never hurts a righteously disposed person. What is important is reacting to the correction with the proper spirit. That is what counts in the sight of God and the brothers. We should not belittle the discipline from Jehovah nor give out when corrected by him, for remember, the purpose of it is to bring forth the peaceable fruit of righteousness. This, however, cannot be done if we resist the spirit of God and the action of his organization.

<p><span class="font3">Material giving is an important part of the Christian’s outlook and is received with thanks to God. While charitable works of preaching are the minister's first concern, still some effort at support of the organization by charitable gifts, however small, is essential to the spiritual health and maturity of the Christian. How is this so? Consider the spiritual gifts for a moment. Take, for example, the gift of the minister who is able to spend only one hour a month in preaching the good news from house to house. Certainly this contribution to the advancement of the Kingdom, though small, is not rejected, is it? And if the brother is unable to do more than that in a month, no one views his effort as ‘pulling down the average,’ does he? Well, the same is true regarding the matter of making material contributions to support the work. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font3"> 29</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">To be happy we need to work. True, we need some rest, a change for mind and body to mend frayed nerves and recuperate physical strength. The sabbath arrangement of the Mosaic law provided for such a relaxing change after a period of hard work. Vacations are invaluable for renewing strength. But when physical, mental and nervous energies have been restored by an enjoyable vacation, the vacation has served its purpose. We have been made strong again for activity and we are ready to go to work. To continue the vacation beyond this point is to enter a period of boredom and restlessness and to court the demoralizing dangers of idleness. We want to get back to work. We miss the joy and satisfaction that come from useful employment. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font3"> 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">If one has been spreading lies unknowingly he is not as reprehensible as the deliberate liar, but neither is he guiltless. If he is truly sorry he will certainly be cautious about repeating tales in the future. But this caution is not characteristic of lovers of gossip. One would think they would remember how often their past gossip proved false, and hence one would expect them to be far more cautious in the future. But they seldom are. If they bother to give their past lies a thought, it is to justify them. They deny that they ever said it, or say they only repeated what someone else said, or they hide the first lie by telling another one. If gossip-ers would look behind them at the harm their lies had done they might not look ahead with such zeal for more tongue wagging.

He is The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.donr </span><span class="font3">or The Master to whom the temple belongs and whose name is on it and who comes to the place where he is supposed to be worshiped. But when he comes this time he comes, not alone, but accompanied by “the Angel of the covenant.” Because of the severity of the judgment that would take place, Jehovah promised that he would mercifully send his messenger and this one would prepare the way before him. If conditions were not prepared among his temple worshipers before his arrival at the temple, then the entire nation would be in danger of being wiped out, as Sodom and Gomorrah were. While this prophecy was not fulfilled upon Zerubbabel’s temple a fulfillment of it did come upon the temple of Herod, with a special foreshadowing of events of our own day. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 13, 14</span></p>

However, the appointment of these special ministerial servants or overseers within the congregation does not mean that a separate clergy class is being created and all the rest of the congregation are not ministers adequately qualified by God.

This regular contribution that we give in token of the fact that we have given all that we are and have to the Most High—this is our antitypical tithe. Remember that the purpose of the Israelite tithe was to support Jehovah’s temple and its service by his chosen priests and Levites. So our antitypical tithe is the support that we give directly to Jehovah’s temple service.

For Jerusalem and its temple were destroyed, the land of Judah was wrecked and completely depopulated, not even domestic animals being left there. That was not the right condition of the land of Judah. God had given it to his chosen people to be inhabited. Therefore after letting it lie desolate and enjoy its sabbaths he brought back a faithful remnant of his people from Babylon that Jerusalem might be rebuilt and her temple restored and the land repopulated. A land was born in that day and was in its right condition, like a bowl right side up, filled with inhabitants who praised and worshiped Jehovah.

<p><span class="font3">Paul wanted these Hebrew Christians to advance and to use their perceptive powers. In view of the time they were in the truth they should have been teachers, but they did not want to express themselves for the enriching of others. But every dedicated Christian should want to grow up and make advancement in the New World society. When one gains knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes it should fill him with vigor and give him vitality. Energized, he should want to help others to gain the same valuable information he has. Therefore he should show an aptness to teach, giving out accurate knowledge so that others, too, can lay hold on instruction. When he really grows to love his brothers he will want to make a public declaration in the congregation to incite them to love and right works. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> la</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics to give them their food at the proper time?—Matt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">24 .’45, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Though the essential meaning of “minister” is that of a servant, yet that does not deny the possibility of such a servant’s being placed in a position of considerable responsibility, involving oversight and care of others, as with the case of the “faithful and discreet slave.” Ever since men have dwelt together in family, national or communal life, there has been the need for some form of organized society. This has meant that some have been placed in a position of authority and leadership, being responsible for the training of others and leading them in the right way. Such an arrangement has God’s approval even as seen by his dealings with Noah, Abraham and others. Unquestionably, Jehovah’s servants often have been placed in positions of greater responsibility, calling for the exercise of the sterling qualities of leadership. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1 2,</span><span class="font3"> 3, 6a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Your people will offer themselves freely.—Ps. 110: 3, RS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do not be fearful of dedication. Rather be anxious for it. Become acquainted with Jehovah’s provisions expressed in his Word and then out of love that truth engenders in your heart dedicate yourself to do Jehovah’s will. Jesus did not say: “I hate to do your will, but I must.” No, he said: “I delight to do thy will, O my God.” In this the individual exercises his own free will. It is not a matter of being spineless, weak-willed. It is a matter of being determined, strong-willed, of subjecting that strong will to the will of Jehovah, being determined to obey his commands, not the commandments of men or apparent selfinterest when such conflict with the will of God as expressed in his Word. One making a dedication to Jehovah is in a personal relationship to him through the step of dedication, through the decision to do his will. This is based upon love for God and faith in his provisions through Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font3"> 9a</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">We were buried with him through our baptism, into his death.—Rom. 6:4, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our word “baptism” is from the Greek </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">bdptisma</span><span class="font3"> meaning immersion, dipping, submerging. In the case of the Christian, baptism in symbol of dedication means an immersion in water. There are many references to immersion that do not refer to the Christian baptism in water in symbol of dedication. For instance, we would not think of a person’s being just slightly sprinkled with death, yet Paul at Homans 6: 3, 4 speaks of Christians’ being baptized into Christ’s death and also being buried in his baptism. When one is literally buried he is not sprinkled with a little bit of dirt nor does he have a little dirt poured on him, but he is covered with it. Since the Bible shows the meaning of the Christian baptism to be a symbol of dedication, burial to one’s former course and a raising to doing the will of Jehovah, only immersion could thus symbolize it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span><span class="font3"> 4, 3a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">terers.—Mal. 3: 5, Da.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In being a swift witness against the sorcerers Jehovah has in 1920, in 1934 and in 1955 given us three powerful booklets exposing spiritism. He has also unmasked the so-called “wise men from the east” who came to visit the babe Jesus as being mere astrologers, unwitting tools used by Satan to incite King Herod to try to kill Jesus. He has also exposed the great Pyramid of Giza as being, not “God’s stone witness” or “the Bible in stone,” but a monument of demonism to glorify belief in immortality of the soul or “survival after death.” With swiftness Jehovah at his temple has also witnessed against those guilty of adultery or moral uncleanness bodily or spiritually and unscriptural divorces. He has taught his people to take an unadulterous position of neutrality toward all the political and military conflicts of this world. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 32, 33</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">20:20, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses obey Jesus’ command to preach “this good news of the kingdom” by going from house to house. This may not be the way that is orthodox but it is apostolic, yes, Christlike. After the apostles had been flogged and told to stop preaching they went awmy rejoicing and “every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news.” Upon becoming a Christian Paul likewise went from house to house, even as he testified, and in doing so he was an imitator of Christ, for, besides preaching in various public places, he was often reported in the houses of the people telling the occupants about the Kingdom. When sending out his twelve apostles and later seventy evangelists to preach, he told them what to say at the doors of the people upon whom they called. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font3"> 15, 16</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">All the nation of spiritual Israel and their dedicated companions are ministers separated and set apart from this world. Yet they do have certain members among them specially set apart to various responsible services, to which they are ordained or appointed. Thus in the first century there were Christian prophets and teachers ministering in these responsible positions and it was to these that the holy spirit said the above words. That laying on of the hands of the cougregation by means of their representative men was a form of ordination or appointment to a special service. Later Paul and Barnabas made appointments of older men in newly formed congregations to responsible service positions. Special service appointments are likewise made in the New World society today. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 15,16a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">10: 33, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the Kingdom hope and service we can maintain happiness even while living in a world of discontented persons afflicted with grief, sorrow and woe. It means comfort and joy to individuals who are in need of comfort. Like the unfortunate “certain man” of Jesus’ illustration about the Samaritan who was a good neighbor, they have been spiritually robbed, stripped and beaten. We must therefore be compassionate toward those persons of the world to whom we preach, even though they are weighted down with false religion, poverty and other personal problems. We must not feel that we are burdened by having to go to such ones and preach to them, for they are not “just so many beggars” to be giveu a handout grudgingly with a long face. So let us uncomplainingly prove ourselves good neighbors by acting mercifully to all, administering to their spiritual wounds with a gladdening message. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font3"> 3a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5: 33, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A husband must measure up as head if he would have the deep respect of his wife. Exercising headship involves more than just taking the lead and having the final say; it requires sound knowledge, good understanding and a self-control that is calm, patient and reasonable when faced with difficult situations. It is hard for a Christian wife to respect a husband who is careless or negligent of family responsibilities or ministerial privileges, who is a glutton or who imbibes too freely of alcoholic drinks, who is thoughtless or coarse or obscene in his speech, or who slights his wife while being overly attentive to other women. His wife may submit because of moral, physical, economic or theocratic reasons, but it will be much easier for her and much more gratifying to the husband if she does it because of the love and deep respect she has for him due to his worthy course of action. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font3"> 4/1 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The avenger of blood is the one who will put the murderer to death.—Num. 35:19, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To be qualified to avenge the slain of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font3"> the earth and especially the slain witnesses of Jehovah, this avenger must be a kinsman of all mankind and especially of Jehovah’s witnesses. Who could that be but God’s only-begotten Son, who became the man Christ Jesus? He is mankind’s closest relative, for he was born of a woman. He became a brother to his footstep followers, so that one who kills one of them kills one of Christ’s brothers and shows he would do it to Christ himself, too. However, as High Priest he is now about to apply the merit of his atoning sacrifice in behalf of all obedient mankind, to make them his children and to become their Everlasting Father. So, anyone that kills one of these “temporary residents” or “settlers” who have associated themselves with the New World society kills one of Christ’s prospective children. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font3"> 13b</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">vah.—2 Cor. 3:18, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Paul was reflecting like a mirror Jehovah’s glory as it shone in the face of Christ, even as Moses’ face had shone upon coming down from Mount Sinai. Paul was being transformed into the same image from one degree of spiritual glory to another, exactly as done by Jehovah the spirit whom he was coming to know more and more. As long as Paul was reflecting glory light and being transformed, he could not behave improperly in his ministry. He could not walk in craftiness nor adulterate God’s Word with any impunity. He had to renounce the underhanded things of which to be ashamed. By making the truth manifest in its purity he had to recommend himself to every human conscience in God’s sight. He could not veil anything from those to whom he preached as a minister of the new covenant. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 10, 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">What if spirit mediums and suchlike make predictions that come true? Still this does not prove they have the right religion. Why not? Because this goes contrary to God’s law and it turns those who rely on spiritistic things away from God’s approved means of giving hidden knowledge and of prophesying concerning the future. It also works in support of the great lie concerning Jehovah’s Godship and concerning the dead. God’s law therefore commanded that even though a prophet’s predictions came true, if he sought to turn his people away from Jehovah he was to be put to death. A prediction that comes true but that is used to turn you from Jehovah is a false disguise to throw you off guard and to mislead you away from the divine source of truth. It is meant to bring you under the power of Satan, the “ruler of the demons.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> 31</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3:2, Da.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After Christ hurled Satan out of heaven down to earth he did not at once proceed to fight Armageddon and put Satan completely out of action. He has allowed Satan a short period of time before again joining battle with him at Armageddon. Thus the days of tribulation upon Satan’s organization have been cut much shorter, and this has worked for the benefit of Jehovah’s chosen royal priesthood. For this reason, since coming to the temple, Christ could not do more than say to Satan: “Jehovah rebuke thee.” In this way the glorified Christ now ‘preaches to Satan and the other spirits in prison’ in the spirit realm. Asking for Jehovah to rebuke them is a preaching of judgment against them, for at Armageddon Jehovah will rebuke Satan and his demons by executing judgment upon them. Thus the ‘preaching to the spirits in prison’ by the resurrected Christ continues till the battle of Armageddon. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font3"> 21, 22</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark412"></a><span class="font3">either that temple nor that tabernacle could contain the great God of the universe. Jehovah was present in that holy temple on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem only by sending forth his power from his heavenly throne and making its operation visible at the temple by the glory cloud and by the fire from the sky. He was also present in that temple by keeping his attention fixed upon it and by answering prayers that were offered there or that were directed there by believers who prayed with their faces toward it. As Jehovah himself said to Solomon later: “I have sanctified this house that you have built by putting my name there to time indefinite, and my eyes and my heart will certainly prove to be there always.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">7; 12, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Unquestionably, the more desirable of the two possessions is the wisdom and understanding of Jehovah. Accurate knowledge and wisdom are in themselves a real treasure to God’s organization, and these are being distributed freely by his ministers of the good news. However, it should not be overlooked that “money is a defence.” Does this apply to Christians today, whose strength is in Jehovah? Yes. Even as the early Christians used their material possessions to support the organization, so Jehovah’s witnesses today make their money serve the interests of the theocracy. Just as legal corporations are used as servants by the Society to advance the preaching work and make possible the use of many instruments otherwise not available, so money helps to build a strong organization and adds to Jehovah’s praise. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1 9,</span><span class="font3"> 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Be slaves to Jehovah.—Rom. 12:11, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Dedication is practical, advisable, commendable, essential. Dedication to Jehovah brings us freedom because it gives us a change in our point of view and we see things through the eyes of his Word, the eyes of our understanding of his purposes. With confidence and assurance in him we are no longer enslaved by the old world, its organization, its standards and practices or its devilish religion. Does not dedication bring with it servitude to Jehovah? Certainly it does. That is one of its objectives. We are here upon God’s earth through no volition of our own. We must be slaves or servants of one thing or the other, either of righteousness or of unrighteousness. If we dedicate ourselves to Jehovah and choose to be his slaves, we make the proper choice. Jesus did this. His dedication is shown in the very fact that he acted out of his own love and zeal for his heavenly Father. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font3"> 10a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Gossip can be vicious. It is cowardly. It can be murderous. It can murder a good name or ruin a good reputation or poison the minds of people against the victim of the gossip. Some tongues are as sharp as swords and the words they shoot forth can pierce like arrows shot from ambush and striking their victim in the back. But the cowards that gossip behind a person’s back should remember that they have to face Jehovah, that Jehovah hears and will avenge the victim. Gossip can become so wicked and do so much damage that it can merit disfellowshiping. It can bring the babbler to ruin in the congregation. His gossip may separate friends, but if it continues it will separate him from Jehovah’s organization. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font3"> 13, 14</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The ones stripped bare are the invisible governments and authorities of Satan and his demons. Once these could accuse us before God because we sought to worship and serve God perfectly but failed to do so. The Mosaic law exposed us as being sinners whom the Devil could tempt and whom he could accuse before God. But what we could not do God did, in order to overcome that accusation against His witnesses. He put Jesus on the earth as a perfect man, and Jesus measured up perfectly to God’s law. Jesus died unconquered by this world and perfectly loyal to God’s universal sovereignty. And he died not only as a martyr to God’s kingdom but also as a perfect human sacrifice. Upon the basis of this sacrifice God could forgive and cancel the trespasses of which the Mosaic law condemned us. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font3"> 28</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">This scripture does not mean merely witnessing from house to house. Many other scriptures prove that we must do that. Then what important fact is brought to our mind in this text? The context shows that the public declaration must be made in the congregation of Jehovah’s people. And there is a definite reason, too; it must be a declaration that will incite to love, to help others in right works and to encourage one another in the Christian ministry. By doing these things all will be helped to remain united, to stay in the organization. Our congregational meetings themselves provide positive assistance to others. Yes, it is our public declaration of our hope in the congregation that does much for others of the congregation. Every dedicated member of the New World society must therefore regularly assemble with others and get the benefit of his brothers’ knowledge as well as give his own brothers the benefit of his knowledge. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 11, 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">All ministers of the new covenant must know Jehovah, otherwise they could not be adequately qualified to be in the ministry of his new covenant. They must be witnesses of what they know, hence be witnesses of Jehovah. “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen.” These words of ordination to be witnesses apply with even more force now to God’s servant class who are in the new covenant than they did to the typical people of God. Of these he said: “This people have I formed for myself: they shall shew forth my praise.” Catching up the glory light from God as it is reflected in the face of Christ, today’s ministers must reflect that light of knowledge of the glory of God to others that he may be praised and they may be enlightened. In this bedarkened age great is the need to do this, by both the ministers of the new covenant and their companions, the other sheep. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Likewise with Jehovah’s witnesses today. We too arc made to rejoice when we heed God’s invitation and bring in the spiritual tithes, for then we see an increase in the temple worship due to an increase in the number of active, well-supported servants at the temple. Because the remnant of spiritual Israelites brought in the spiritual tithes from 1919 on, the full number of members of the royal priesthood were brought in by 1931 to fill up the places of the 144,000 members of the body of Jesus Christ the High Priest. By bringing in the spiritual tithes Jehovah’s house is made to prosper with plenty of food in its storehouse or treasure house, and the temple servants have, so to speak, the necessary food and clothing for carrying on their duties there. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 2a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Faithful worshipers of Jehovah have ‘made request to God for a good conscience’ and he has granted their request through knowledge and faith in his own Son. Now they exercise themselves to hold fast that good conscience by keeping integrity. Sincerity in Jehovah’s pure worship is their mainstay. Another evidence of integrity today is to be seen in the strong, courageous, enduring, soldierly qualities of those of Jehovah’s servants who keep always in mind that they are engaged in a warfare with crafty, superhuman, invisible foes who are ever on the watch for the unguarded moment. As good soldiers of Jehovah they remain on the alert, take no foolish chances, keep their minds on the fight and put into it everything they have. Integrity may be detected, also, in that clean-cut separateness from this old world that is characteristic of all who have become members of the New World society. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15 </span><span class="font3">6-8a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 104:1, 2, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is well worth our time to think seriously of the power demonstrated by Jehovah in causing the creation of so many things, and even though they number in the millions of millions, he has arranged for them to stay in their respective places. Inanimate things are controlled by various laws of nature—such as law of gravity, etc. Living things are bounded by laws of “kind.” Even the angels in heaven have a certain place made and provided for them by God. They, of course, are not bound by the same laws as are such low forms of creation as inanimate things and as plants and animals. However, they are expected to stay in their proper places, and disastrous results accompany their leaving such assigned places, as in the case of the cherub assigned as overseer in the garden of Eden. All this emphasizes the importance of each one of us keeping his assigned place. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font3"> 11, 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">To maintain his heavenly and earthly society of ministers in complete happiness and purpose, Jehovah has an endless store of life-giving information available for communication progressively. As “the fountain of living waters” he is the heavenly Fountain of spiritual waters of truth and life. Be it noted, however, that from this great Fountain source there is only one channel of flow. In Ezekiel 47: 1-5, the waters are pictured as issuing from the temple and flowing eastward in a single set channel. Similarly in the book of Revelation the “river of water of life” is described as “flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of its broad way.” (Rev. 22:1, 2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> Jehovah’s official line of communication with his society of ministers is first through his duly appointed spokesman, his prime minister, his only-begotten Son. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15 11,</span><span class="font3"> 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">What if someone gossips about us? Cannot we fight back in self-defense? With truth, yes, but not with gossip. Why let others provoke us to sin, as Moses once did: “They made his spirit bitter, and ne spoke words that were rash”? Why let a gossipcr turn you into one, making you into his evil image by getting you to gossip back? Prove yourself stronger by “not paying back injury for injury or reviling for reviling.” Refuse to pile more fuel on the fires of gossip and rather than become heated by inflammatory talk remain cool and calm in spirit: “He who has a hasty temper exalts folly.” David realized the danger of heated replies and so held his peace when the wicked were in his presence. As he thought he boiled within, but when he spoke it was not in hot slanders to the opposers, but in prayerful petition to Jehovah.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Mal. 2:7, 8, Da.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since 1919 the priestly remnant have realized that the covenant of Levi calls for them to be the messenger of Jehovah, to keep knowledge upon their lips, to hold the law of truth in their mouth, to walk with God in peace and uprightness and to turn many away from iniquity. To do this they realized that they had to be witnesses of Jehovah and to proclaim the Kingdom truths. And so in 1931 they courageously embraced the name “Jehovah’s witnesses.” They know now that the covenant of Levi calls for a clean priesthood, one that approves of no fornication or adultery either spiritual or physical, a priesthood rendering exclusive devotion to God and proving this by keeping his worship at the temple pure and unhypocritical. Hence they insist on maintaining right worship in the New World society. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 30</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Christ did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but was glorified by him who spoke with reference to him: “You are my Son; today I have become your Father.” Just as he says also in another place: “You are a priest forever after the likeness of Melchizcdek.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 5:5, 6, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even Jesus the carpenter of Nazareth had to be ordained by Jehovah. As a man he was not of a priestly family in Israel. As a member of the royal tribe of Judah he was an heir to the earthly throne of David but not to a heavenly throne and royalty. To be a high priest like the royal priest King Melchizedek, Jesus had to be ordained by Jehovah, who had sworn that Jesus should be such a royal priest. To be a heavenly king sitting on Jehovah’s own right hand, Jesus had to be anointed with something more than the anointing oil at the hands of a human prophet or priest. He had to be anointed and thus ordained or appointed with the holy spirit from Jehovah God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 2a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Never lay your hands hastily upon any man.—1 Tim. 5: 22, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The ancient laying on of the hands of responsible servants of the congregation had the force of ordaining or appointing. That ceremony had some actual effect in those early days when “through the laying on of the hands of the apostles the spirit was given.” Those who laid their hands on Paul and Barnabas did not impart the spirit but they were told by the spirit to set them apart for special work. Today we do not have the spirit speaking audibly to us or the apostles present with us to lay their hands upon us to impart the miraculous gifts of the spirit. Those miraculous gifts of the spirit have passed away as well as the apostolic channels. That is why Paul classed the “laying on of the hands” as part of the “elementary doctrine about the Christ.” (Heb. 6:1, 2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font3">The formality of literally laying hands upon a person at his appointment has no special power today.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah.—Ps. 3:8, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Living eternally in happiness is something no lower animal can attain. It is something that man can attain, but not through himself. The possibility of it comes from outside man, from Jehovah. We may rightly crave or desire this salvation, and we may do so without suffering and without disappointment for indulging in such a craving or desire. By following in God’s way we may have such a craving for salvation finally satisfied by attaining to an endless life without pain, imperfection, poverty, mental ignorance and confusion, and alienation from a loving, happy God. Wrong ideas about life and its purpose are due to man’s not knowing about the one living and true God, with whom is the fountain or source of life. (Ps. 36: 9) Only Satan wishes men ignorantly to desire and choose death, the fate of the ungodly and the wicked. God’s invitation is: “Choose life.” —Deut. 30:19. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font3"> 16</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3">unique circumstances with which the early Christian congregation was confronted called for concerted and unselfish action by all in the faith. Many of these new converts were in Jerusalem only temporarily, having come down as Jews for the feast of Pentecost. Now, having recognized the new and different work called for by the Messiah, they desired to remain for a time and receive proper training and instruction in the Christian ministry. But to do so would require funds that they did not have. The response made by the brothers to this need is an inspiration to all true Christians today. Such charitable gifts are still an important part of the giving of the Christian and necessary to the support of the organization; yet they do not relieve the giver of the responsibility of supporting the organization with his spiritual gifts as well. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 8</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Dedication to Jehovah should be made because he is worthy. He is deserving of our praise, service or worship. His worthiness defies expression in our inadequate tongue, and surely, if there is sincere appreciation in the hearts of men, dedication to the Supplier of all that is good will be the result. To appreciate Jehovah means to set a just value upon his worth, to esteem it to the full, to feel a warmth of satisfaction and approval in regard to our God, to be grateful for what he does. If we have appreciation of life, of its blessings, of the truth, of the revealed Word of God, of what he has done in behalf of mankind through his Son, of his kingdom now established in the heavens, of his work that is going forward in the earth, and of the New World society now active, we shall dedicate ourselves to serve Jehovah God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font3"> 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In some countries where there is a strong tendency for many women to try to share or take over family headship, loud objections rise against the divine requirement of man’s headship and woman’s subjection. It is viewed as discriminatory against women, as oppressive and too difficult a load for them to bear up under. However, careful reflection will reveal that it is the husband that has the weightier load to bear, the heavier responsibility to measure up to. He must strive to copy the flawless example of Jehovah God, the Head and Husband of the universal organization. Jehovah not only created all things but thereafter established laws and rules of action for their guidance and provides the necessities for their continuance. Even in his own ways and acts Jehovah consistently follows righteous principles and conducts his headship with an unparalleled display of justice, wisdom, patience, mercy, compassion and, above all, love. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span><span class="font3"> 5</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">This life is good only for one thing, namely, to get rich in right works, to treasure up a right foundation for the future, to get a firm hold on real life in God’s new world. The days of this life are few, but there are enough of them for us to get rich in right works if we do not delay. To do such works brings us joy and satisfaction, peace and contentment, spiritual health and eternal life. Strange though it may seem, not to do them is exhausting, as both Jeremiah and Elihu discovered. (Jer. 20:9; Job 32:20) Just as God was refreshed by his work of creation, and doing God’s will was like refreshing food to Jesus, so the accomplishment of the preaching work is refreshing to us at this time. So even as we work we are refreshed, and even in the face of persecution we do not become weary in well-doing. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font3"> 9a</span></p>

They listen to our message and accept our Bible literature and our offer to study with them. They act on our invitation to attend our meetings, become a part of the New World society by dedication to God through Christ and then join us in breathing out this delightful, life-giving odor to others that they too may be helped to everlasting life. Jehovah as represented by his ruling King, Jesus Christ, is no “stone of stumbling” or “rock of offence” to them. On the other hand, the prophecy foretold that others, even Christendom itself, would stumble on this great Stone, and hence would fall and be broken and be caught in a snare and be taken for death. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font3"> 38, 39</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">To speak with one another the remnant met together regularly to express their thoughts about his name. Jehovah claims the remnant as his very own possession. The people of good will also recognize the tithe-bringing remnant to be Jehovah’s possession and so they cleave to them as His choice people, that they may enjoy the coming salvation with them. They know that Jehovah promises to spare the remnant in the day when he takes action and vindicates his universal sovereignty. Then he will remember to spare them from destruction, for they are recorded in his book of remembrance because of fearing him and bringing the whole tithe into his storehouse. His sparing them alive during Armageddon will be with all the tenderness of a father who spares the obedient, respectful son that lovingly serves him. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 15a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 8:15, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who accept the light of truth must themselves become light bearers. They must be like David, who was one of Jehovah’s sheep but was eventually called to be the shepherd of Israel. Yes, those who exercise faith to the point of dedication must henceforth demonstrate that right kind of faith by appropriate works. This principle Jesus demonstrated in the way he dealt with his first disciples. He at once called them from their regular occupations, such as fishing, and began training them “to become fishers of men.” Stressing the close bond between himself and his responsive disciples, he said: “My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.” In short, every right kind of believer must be trained to become a right kind of minister. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font3"> 9a</span></p>

Moses knew he could rely on Jehovah when he struck the rock in the wilderness and water gushed out to quench the thirst of the people and the cattle. His confidence was from faith based on experience and knowledge. Elijah showed similar faith, calling for fire from heaven to consume the sacrifice he had prepared in defiance of Baal and to the honor of Jehovah. His faith was an “assured expectation of things hoped for<sup>1</sup>’; he knew he could put his trust in Jehovah. Today we do not expect miracles to establish our faith. But just as we have confidence and trust in a person we know well, so we learn to know God through a study of his Word and this gives us confidence and assurance.

<p><span class="font3">We must keep our minds on the right things and in that way we shall be able to attain accurate knowledge and true understanding. It should be the desire of every one to be filled with accurate knowledge, wisdom and spiritual discernment so that each one can walk worthily of Jehovah and thus please him. As a Christian we each must be bearing fruit in every good work, and as we bear this fruit we must increase in accurate knowledge of God. What a wonderful privilege it is for a dedicated person to have made advancement in Jehovah’s organization so as to qualify himself to be a right kind of minister. He then feels like the apostle Paul who was glad to see others make advancement and cooperate with God to render themselves suitable servants so that they too could share in “announcing Jehovah’s kingdom.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 14a</span></p>

The water baptism symbolized Jesus’ dedication, for a change of course in life. It was first after Jesus had been baptized and came up out of the water that his heavenly Father Jehovah God ordained or appointed him by audibly acknowledging the dedicated Jesus as his spiritual Son and by anointing him with his holy spirit. Shortly afterward, to show that it was Jehovah, not the priestly John the Baptist, who had ordained him, Jesus went to the synagogue in Nazareth and read to the people Isaiah’s prophecy noted above.

Since they were making God feel tired of hearing such disrespectful talk, ought he not at last to do something about it, acting with suddenness?

For the passing of this test with divine approval, Jehovah will justify them to everlasting life in the new earth. But when the High Priest yields them over in human perfection he in effect dies to them as atoning, covering Priest, for they pass out from under his protective covering in the refuge city and are placed before God for a test of their own merit.

The Bible also calls them “unclean spirits.” But Jehovah created them as clean spirits, his heavenly sons, members of his spirit family. They were not created immortal, but mortal, yet with the opportunity to live everlastingly by continuing to be clean, holy, spirit sons of God. Otherwise, now that quite a number of these have become demons, they could not be destroyed.

It was in this state, as a spirit now divine, immortal, incorruptible, that Jesus could preach to those spirits. Just when did he do this ? Hardly during the forty days after his resurrection nor during the ten days he was ascending to his heavenly Father. Rather, it was about the year 96 (A.D.), when God gave to the glorified Christ the marvelous Revelation to give to the aged apostle John, and which Revelation has much to say about Satan the Devil and the demons, his angels. Certainly this delivering of this Revelation to John was a preaching to the spirits in prison, for from chapter twelve on it has much to say about their activities in our day and their defeat, their abyssing and their final everlasting destruction. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font3"> 11, 18</span></p>

So because they were not well off spiritually they were not prospering materially. Jehovah wanted to see them getting along well materially according to his promises in his covenant with them.

If we do not dedicate ourselves to him, either we do not believe what he says or we do not care about him, and in neither event will we receive life from him.

Jehovah now sees to it that these are helped according to their needs, that they may enjoy full spiritual life, participating in all the spiritual provisions of his people.

The dedicated Christian must demonstrate that he is truly an industrious minister and cannot be interested merely in gaining knowledge for himself but he must see the responsibility of maintaining his integrity through aiding others by sensibly preaching the good news to them. We all should welcome additional responsibility. We should not be satisfied with the idea, ‘Let well enough alone,’ but, rather, should be progressive and eagerly desire to advance. No matter how long we have been walking in the truth, we must continue to preach God’s Word and study the things he has provided for us through his organization. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 6a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Israelites of old used wisely the gold and silver that was taken as a gift of redemption from the Egyptians. When Jehovah called for a contribution in order that the “tent of meeting” might be constructed, the response was overwhelming. “And they kept coming, the men along with the women, every willing-hearted one.” Nothing needed was lacking. Jehovah’s faithful servants today likewise use their possessions to advance pure worship. The wise use of money enables the Society to send missionaries into new fields, to open up new branches, to carry legal battles victoriously through costly court proceedings, to operate large conventions and otherwise to spread the good news in every corner of the world according to Jehovah’s commission for his organization. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font3"> 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">With great profit to ourselves we can copy the mental disposition of Jesus. Viewed from the selfish standpoint, did he not have plenty of reason to utter a grievance? He made a great sacrifice. Here he was, sent down to earth alone, just one man to begin a vast, worldwide work of witnessing. In the way of hardships, opposition and persecution he had all that we could experience and far more. The people to whom he preached were indifferent and poverty-stricken for the most part. They were entangled in the practice of false religion. But he did not bewail his plight or groan and deplore his assignment to preach to such people. He came in the willing, uncomplaining way approved by his Father. His message was refreshing and comforting. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font3"> 5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Members of Christ’s bride follow in the footsteps of Jesus. They take on the obligation to preach in harmony with his will, and this brings upon them persecution. But the joys of serving under the loving headship of Christ far outweigh the fleshly tribulations. While the “evil slave” has bolted away from under Christ’s headship, the “faithful and discreet slave” finds real joy by submissiveness to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christ. And when that “evil slave” breaks away from Christ’s headship, does he gain a freedom that spells greater happiness? No, for he lands outside Jehovah’s arrangement to company with hypocrites, there to weep and gnash his teeth. Christian wives who are not submissive to their husbands are copying the “evil slave,” and their bolt from Jehovah’s arrangement to grasp a false freedom will bring them, not true happiness and contentment, but emotional frustrations and spiritual guiltiness. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W i/1</span><span class="font3"> 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Not only is the published knowledge of God an odor in the midst of which we march triumphantly behind God in company with his King, as we make that divine knowledge perceptible to others, but we are also ourselves an odor. But as respects us, noses in this world differ. Not that we of our own accord want to be offensive to anybody on earth, for we seek to be helpful and of benefit to everyone. But all this world is Jehovah’s enemy. So if we dedicate ourselves to God and he uses us in his service as bearers of his message, then we cannot avoid being offensive to the many who are the enemies of God and his theocratic government by Christ. We cannot escape it, now especially when the establishment of the Kingdom has made the issue of universal sovereignty the burning question before all people. On this issue we cannot be friends of this world. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font3"> 36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">35:11, W.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The cities of refuge find their antitypieal fulfillment since God’s kingdom was born, for it is to bring about the avenging of the blood of all who have been unjustly slain. There is a dire need of the antitypieal city of refuge, for since 1918 the time of judgment has been in progress to determine the bloodguiltiness of humanity. As the typical refuge cities were cities of temple servants, including the high priest, the antitypieal city must be Jehovah’s provision for protecting us from death for violating the divine covenant concerning the saered-ness of blood by our coming and remaining under the benefits of the active service of Jehovah’s High Priest, Jesus Christ. That protection is to be found with Jehovah’s theocratic organization of his people. It is only for those pictured by the unintentional manslayer. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1S/1</span><span class="font3"> 9, 10a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah takes great pleasure in observing those integritykeepers who take all the reproach and sufferings that this world and its god can hand out, and still, like Job, walk in undivided, unsullied allegiance to the Universal Sovereign. He is the perfect Father, who sets the example of integrity to all his sons and daughters. In his Word he lovingly provides a storehouse of information as to his wonderful principles and qualities, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped to ward off the attacks of the enemy and stand for uprightness and truth. Another provision to that same end is the flawless, flesh-and-blood example of his own beloved Son here on earth. Even long centuries before Jesus was baptized the reward of integrity that has now been awarded to Christ was confidently foretold by the psalmist in the above words. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span><span class="font3"> 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">With this kingdom by his Son God’s love now comes to man’s rescue. God’s love for a righteous government and a faithful ruler is a reason why he will destroy this old world with its wicked governments. His destroying them is an expression of love—a love of straight principles, a love of those worthy to live on earth in peace and prosperity. There are things that God hates, and the existence of those things in this old world makes certain that it must go. God hates: “haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood; a heart that deviseth wicked purposes, feet that are swift in running to mischief, a false witness . . . and he that soweth discord among brethren.’’ God does not approve our loving what he hates. So he commands: “Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15 25,</span><span class="font3"> 26</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">If this principle was true in Jesus’ day and after Pentecost, how much more forcefully does it apply in these days! Those who have responded to the preaching of the truth must be trained and educated to become reliable and efficient preachers themselves. Because of the great work to be done world-wide, and because of the benefit it will mean to them, it is vital that all who come into the truth learn how to have an active share in the ministry of reconciliation, and learn how to make an effective entreaty to others by properly expounding the message of reconciliation. Failure to do so would be to “accept the undeserved kindness of God and miss its purpose.” All this irresistibly drives home the imperative need for an intensive training work to be done in behalf of all those who come to God’s organization, Zion. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font3"> 10, Ila</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">32:8, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bible is God’s provision for aiding us to know what to do and how to do it, so that we can not only please him but also get into a place that is in complete harmony with the operation of the entire universe. It will enable us to get back into a relationship with Jehovah that was set before Adam. If he had been obedient to God’s instructions, he could have continued living even down to our day and on through our day. So if one will accept Jehovah’s counsel today, he may look forward to the undeserved gift of everlasting life. Worshiping God is a necessary feature of our daily life. And it is necessary as long as we live. Therefore we should accept this counsel now and not refuse or balk like a stubborn mule but obey like an intelligent human creature. We should seek out how to worship God and look to him as a hiding place and a place of deliverance. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1 </span><span class="font3">17, 18</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Christ’s reign will be a time of rest from evil. But it will not be a time of rest from right works. There will always be new work, with new problems to solve and new mysteries to penetrate. These will challenge our mind and body and draw us on to ever-new advances in work, knowledge, wisdom and understanding. And the rich satisfaction of increasing knowledge will never end, for we can never know all. Only Jehovah knows all, and we can never begin to fathom the depths of his wisdom. To have that real life then is worth working for now. Jehovah works, Christ works, man should work, will be happier if he works, and will gain real life in the new world if his present works are right in God’s sight. Store treasure in heaven. Earthly riches are temporary. Work for what endures. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font3"> 11, 12a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 2:15, 16, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As Christians we copy Jesus, we follow his steps, we advertise him as the now reigning King, and so, as it were, we exhale or give out the odor of Christ. In this respect we wish we smelled sweet to everybody, but we do only to the smaller number of people, to those who are being saved. To these we are as an odor that issues from a life-giving source and that therefore leads to life in God’s new world. We are a sweet, life-breathing odor to these because they see that Jehovah, the Source of life, sends us and so we come to them, not for death-dealing purposes, but unselfishly for life-giving purposes. The message we preach of God’s present kingdom is really good news to them. It breathes of life to them, and it shows them the way to happy life in God’s world of new heavens and a new earth, with now the opportunity of even surviving the battle of Armageddon. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font3"> 37</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">There is no more a literal temple at Jerusalem with literal Levites and priests to which to bring such literal tithes. What, then, did the tithe of ancient Israel foreshadow? While in the Bible ten is a symbol of earthly completeness, a tenth is not. The Israelite tenth did not typify the all that Christians dedicate to God through Christ. So the Israelite’s giving of the tenth does not picture our dedicating ourselves wholly to God and symbolizing it by water baptism. The Israelite tithe was not all their increase; it was a mere tenth. Therefore it represents only a part of all that we have dedicated. Our bringing in the antitypical tithe to Jehovah’s storehouse is simply a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">token</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">symbol</span><span class="font3"> of the fact that we have dedicated our all to Jehovah as our God; it is a memorial of our dedication. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15 21, 23, 24</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jesus pointed to John the Baptist as the preparatory messenger in his time. John began his ministry about six months in advance of Jesus and prepared a small remnant of Israelites to receive him. That fact did not mean that Jesus was the Lord who suddenly comes to his temple. Jesus is not Jehovah the Lord of the temple. He is Jehovah’s “Angel of the [Abrahamic] covenant” who accompanies him to the temple. Since the preparatory messenger had come, it was therefore in Jesus’ day that the Lord Jehovah was to come suddenly to the temple to show where the God of judgment was. Not that the Lord Jehovah had to come personally and visibly to the temple. But Christ his Angel of the covenant of blessing did come visibly to Jehovah’s temple back there, as the representative of the Lord Jehovah, and by putting his spirit on Jesus Jehovah was with him in coming to that temple at Jerusalem in 33 (A.D.). </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Thus Paul associates giving of funds with faith and knowledge and love, and recommends it as a condition of spiritual health. He reminded them of the principle that to sow sparingly is to reap sparingly and then encouraged them: “Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” And the charitable gifts of these Corinthians not only was a support of the organization in its material needs but was a great joy and a source of praise to Jehovah’s name. In the same way the voluntary giving of Jehovah’s witnesses today to support the vast world-wide organization of true worshipers is also a cause of joy and praise to Jehovah. Not under compulsion but freely all share in the material advancement of the work as well as by their own word of testimony. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1 </span><span class="font3">23, 24</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah hates perverted speech and so should we. If such lips and tongues are in the congregation, by disfellow-shiping action the congregation can be delivered from them. Many times gossip is concerning a minor matter, but discord is sown as wagging tongues magnify it out of all proportion. A gossip makes a mountain out of the molehill and a molehill of the mountain. The real mountain, the sowing of discord, is as a molehill to the gossiper in comparison with the minor difficulty that he magnifies to mountainous proportions to bring about discord. How dangerous is such unprofitable speaking! “Every unprofitable saying that men speak, they will render an account concerning it on Judgment Day.” Be assured, therefore, that your words, if they were gossip words, will be condemned.

<p><span class="font3">We rely upon God’s appointment or ordination in order to be qualified as his ministers, even as did Christ and the early Christians in this most necessary respect. Today on earth there is only a remnant of those whom God has been choosing and appointing or ordaining to be his anointed ministers of the new covenant. To them he says: ‘Ye are my witnesses, and my servant whom I have chosen.’ As a group this remnant now forms a servant body or a slave body, “the faithful and discreet slave,” who has been “appointed over his domestics to give them their food at the proper time.” They have received their appointment or ordination as such, not from men, but from their Master, Jesus Christ. Since coming to the temple in 1918 for judgment, he has found this remnant of dedicated, anointed Christians doing what they were appointed to do. So he has done to them what he promised. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 7a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">God lays upon people a joint responsibility in respect to bloodshed. This point he made very clear in his law concerning a person slain whose killer was never discovered. In clearing themselves of guilt the older men of that likely guilty city must break the neck of a young unworked cow in an unsown torrent valley, doing so before the Levite priests. The older men of that city then washed their hands over the cow and asked God not to lay it to their account. Only then did God clear them of guilt of innocent blood. So all peoples, especially in these days of total warfare, share in a community of responsibility for the blood that has drenched the earth, all shed because the nations have refused to acknowledge Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and to bow peacefully before his King Jesus Christ, seeking his favor. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font3"> 13, 14a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus</span><span class="font3"> stated that his disciples would be recognized as prophets, bringing a prophet’s reward to those who are desirous of learning about Jesus. He also revealed that the line of communication ran back through the individuals making up the prophet group, then through Jesus and finally to Jehovah. (Matt. 10:40-42) And just as no individual since Jesus’ day has been singled out in the fulfillment of Bible prophecies, so no single individual has comprised God’s special prophet since Jesus. For this reason Jesus made plans for an anointed congregation of disciples to become the collective channel in the earth making known God’s communications, as above indicated. Note that the things to be restrained or freed on earth must first be bound or loosed in heaven with instructions communicated to the organized group on earth.

<p><span class="font3">All who will receive life must dedicate themselves to Jehovah and so it is a wise course indeed. However, many people say: “I believe that, if one just does the best he can and tries to get along, everything will come out all right.” But that is not what the Bible teaches; it is a selfdeception. Those for whom “everything will come out all right” are those who receive everlasting life, and it is impossible to receive lasting life if one is cut off from Jehovah, the Fountain of life. His living Word leaves no doubt about this. Dedication demonstrates complete trust and confidence in Jehovah. It shows that the person has assurance that Jehovah is God, that God is right, that his cause will be victorious, that there is no doubt in the heart and mind of the dedicated one and that he is happy and joyful to take his stand on God’s side. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font3"> 12, 13</span></p>

If you respectfully speak up and express yourself and others become aware that you are becoming more mature and spiritually-minded, that makes their hearts glad and it may help them to follow in the same way, for they see the benefit you are deriving from studying and communicating in the hearing of your brothers. They will observe, too, that you are paying constant attention to yourself, keeping yourself in attendance at all meetings and that you are getting out in the field service. Not that you are trying to be better than someone else, but simply better than you have been, because you see the great responsibility Jehovah has placed on each one who has dedicated himself to serve God, responsibility to grow, to increase. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 16a</span></p>

It pleases him to teach us how to gain happiness in the very way in which he does, by expressing love to others. We want to apply ourselves diligently to this lesson and learn it very well. Our brothers in the congregation will truly appreciate our working with them, if we edify them by the example we set, if we lovingly build them up, not probing and tearing down, but in the helpful way working regularly with them and commending their progress in praising Jehovah. If there is some difficulty or problem in the congregation, we will not be quick to accuse our brothers or condemn them and bring them into public censure.

<p><span class="font3">Keep a tactful tongue in your head when living in a divided household. Divine counsel is: “Det your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one.” If this applies to outsiders, it certainly does to those inside the family circle. “Return evil for evil to no one,” including evil speech. To answer back in angry rebuttal may not be to the interest of the unbeliever. The one loving Jehovah will be “doing nothing out of contentiousness.” Refuse to become provoked; it is better to take abuse than to give it. However, while the believers in a divided house should make many concessions to preserve peace and perhaps win over the unbelievers, there is a point where compromise must end, and that is when integrity to Jehovah is put in jeopardy. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span><span class="font3"> 9, 10a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We must prove our faithfulness by continuing “in the faith, established on the foundation and steadfast and not being shifted away from” our hope. Despite all the Devil and his organization can bring against us, “Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial.” Yes, a trial of faith can be expected in this clash between the old and new-world systems. But instead of shrinking under fire we rejoice to find ourselves privileged to show our faith in God’s name. This is the day to put our faithfulness to the proof. It is the right combination, of faith with works, that meets with approval. This is the faith that is shown in favorable season and troublesome season, in persecution or peace—faith in big things or little things. It is faith in Jehovah, his Word and his organization. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 8, 9a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">To some we are a stench. Our Kingdom message bodes no good to them. It is like a foul smell issuing from a dead thing, contaminating and deadly to breathe in. It issues from a death-dealing source and spells death to them. Why? Because they are a part of this world and love it and do not want to break loose from it. They do not want to reform and become reconciled to God through Christ. They prefer the company of his enemies who tickle their noses as well as their ears. But we preach the coming destruction of this world and of all those who remain a part of it. So wc stink to these world lovers. To them we are pestilential, we are death-dealing, we ought to be buried out of sight, out of smelling and out of hearing. This message of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and of his new world and of the destruction of this old world is an offense to them and puts us in bad odor with them. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15 </span><span class="font3">39</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We do not have just Jesus’ words to make us sure that material prosperity is based on spiritual prosperity. (Matt 6:31-33) We have a national example of this in the nation of Israel long ago and an example today in the holy nation of Jehovah’s anointed witnesses. They an example of prosperity? Yes, spiritually. But what of all the international hatred and widespread persecution of them? That goes along with spiritual prosperity, even as Jesus showed at Mark 10:29, 30. The illustration that Jehovah’s witnesses are furnishing today was foretold in the above prophecy. It stated the rule for gaining real prosperity. As this rule is contrary to the rules of this world the applying of it calls for courage, faith and persistence and brings about a test. But it is a test that proves the rule and leads to a satisfying blessing. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 3-5</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The sons of God began to notice the daughters of men, that they were good-looking, and they went to taking wives for themselves.—Gen. 6: 2, NW.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark414"></a><span class="font3">There is no Bible record that any of the holy angels rebelled with Satan at the garden of Eden or shortly afterward. But other angels did become demons at least in the last hundred and twenty years before the Flood when they married daughters of men. To have sex relations with these the sons of God had to materialize as humans, as men. To live with their wives and enjoy their company night and day and raise their offspring they had to remain materialized in the flesh. The evidence is that they continued in this materialized state without interruption until the Flood. During all this time they were neglecting their God-given duties in the spirit realm, in order to enjoy the satisfaction of the passions of the flesh. This was disobedience to God, not only in this respect, but also in the mixing of what is angelic with what is human for breeding purposes. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15 </span><span class="font3">42, 45</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">God richly blessed the unselfish labors of Paul and his fellow apostles. Their fearless proclamation of the Kingdom message attracted thousands of meek persons who loved righteousness. What proof they gave of unshakable allegiance to Jehovah! The entireness of their devotion was a source of amazement to all who witnessed it. Likewise today, those who walk in the integrity of their heart before Jehovah are in a hostile world as a people wondered at, misunderstood, hatefully opposed and persecuted. Are you one of them merely by profession or does your personal course of integrity identify yon as one of them? Is your mind single for God and righteousness? Is your heart strong and clean to pump constantly through your inner self the heavenly wisdom that becomes a wellspring of life everlasting? If yes, then you will be happily numbered among God’s men of integrity. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span><span class="font3"> 22, 23</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Our interest in the advancement of Jehovah’s praise is not mere lip service, nor is it solely a matter of faith. The material needs of an international organization are not supplied by faith alone, any more than is the world-wide preaching. The material giving necessary for Christians has been demonstrated in modern times as well as in the beginning of the Christian congregation. Today, as then, people of all nations are coming into the truth, associating themselves with God’s organization. Very few are rich in the material things of life nor do they seek such, but they know that it was through his organization that God brought them the truth and so they gladly support it in a material way. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1 21, 22</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“In the name of the Father,” most certainly, because the dedication itself is to the Father, Jehovah God. To be baptized in his name means to have made a dedication to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">him, </span><span class="font3">being baptized in full recognition of his office, supremacy and his authority as the Most High. Even as Jesus repeatedly stressed the importance of the name of his Father so it is expected of the dedicated one that he will uphold the cause of the Father, the cause of true worship, will preach in honor of the Word and name of Jehovah and will fully bear his responsibilities as a minister to uphold the true worship of Jehovah. He must be a house-to-house witness as were Christ and the apostles to the extent of his ability, and he must otherwise be a witness of the theocratic kingdom of righteousness. It is God’s will that the dedicated one continually study his Word and that such one progress in righteousness. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 9, 10a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Since the “other sheep” must follow the Right Shepherd, they also must be ‘faithful and true witnesses’ just as he was; they also must be adequately qualified ministers of Jehovah. Of course, they cannot be “ministers of a new covenant” in the sense that Paul was. But we must remember that spiritual Israel was foreshadowed by natural Israel. As members of that chosen nation the natural Israelites were in the law covenant with Jehovah. But among them were many non-Israelites who were temporary residents, some even being temple slaves. These also worshiped Jehovah as their God and his law protected them and provided many blessings and privileges. They were to bring no reproach upon His name but were to praise him along with the natural Israelites. The same is true of the “temporary residents,” the other sheep, today. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 9, 10a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Now that Armageddon’s destruction is impending and the demons are slyly leading world rulers and their peoples to destruction there, we are indeed living in a wicked day. Everywhere the “works of the flesh” abound and those works include the “practice of spiritism,” concerning which Paul warns that “those who practice such things will not inherit God’s kingdom.” (Gal. 5:19-21, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> Neither will any such be allowed to exist in the “new earth.” (Rev. 21: 8) If we put the greatest value upon life in the new world, then we need to fight constantly against the unseen enemies of our gaining it. Paul exposes these enemies as ‘the governments, the authorities, the world-rulers of this darkness, the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places,’ and at the same time he encourages us to use the “complete suit of armor from God,” the only effective means to beat back these foes and come off victorious. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font3"> 39, 40</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Num. 35:14, 15, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These non-Israelites picture those not of spiritual Israel who turn to Jehovah and want to take advantage of his merciful arrangements through his High Priest. Seeing the bloodguiltiness of all the world they want no share further in it nor in paying its penalty at Armageddon. In fleeing to the antitypical city of refuge they show the sincerity of their repentance and of their reliance upon God’s mercy to spare their lives through Armageddon. How? By dedicating themselves to God to be subject to the divine will from now on into eternity. Thus today, hundreds of thousands of these are found within Jehovah’s provision in company with the remnant, inside the New World society. Now is the time, since 1931, for these other sheep to be gathered to his fold. This fact adds to the proof that now, since 1914, is the time of application of this prophetic picture of the refuge cities. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font3"> 18a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The God of judgment saw that when the priests and Levites, who had handed over Jesus to the Romans, would go back to their duties at the temple it would be with hands reddened with the blood of his Angel of the covenant. So when Jesus gasped out his last words, then Jehovah himself came to the temple, by his power aimed directly at the Most Holy. No, not by a glory cloud filling the house, not by fire from heaven miraculously consuming animal sacrifices, no, but by causing the earth under the temple city to quake and the rock-masses to be split and by hiding the sun from shining on the temple and by ripping the curtain of the sanctuary down the middle, from its thirty-foot-high top down to its bottom, although it was inches thick, exposing the innermost room as being bare of the ark of the covenant. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 18</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">To maintain integrity we see how important it is to meet with the congregation, to mingle with and express ourselves among our brothers, so that we can always be sure that our teaching, the things we speak from house to house and in Bible studies, is correct. By meeting attendance we are constantly testing whether we are in the faith and we keep proving or demonstrating what we ourselves are. Results of such conduct are marvelous, constantly bringing joy and gladness to our hearts. And by taking in knowledge, by holding fast to instruction, by believing the whole Word of God, you can save yourself. By your holding fast to the public declaration of your hope those who listen to you in the congregation can be helped and those also who listen to you preaching the Kingdom good news can be helped. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 17a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">There are work and problems, difficulties and hardships that are common to all who strive to follow in the course of Christian service. Perhaps there are things we might complain about; however, we must resist this temptation with all our strength for, if we do not, it will ultimately take away from us the only thing worthwhile in life, happiness in serving God. Jehovah wants us to be different from the world from which he is separating his people. He is taking them apart and teaching them to live as a New World society. With that separation comes freedom and deliverance from the spirit of complaint and faultfinding. His organization is made up of busy, happy people who strive more and more to live according to the standards of his new world. He will not permit any to carry into it old worldly habits of murmuring and complaining. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font3"> 14a</span></p>

We shudder at their trials, marvel at their integrity, rejoice in their stanch stand and unflinching zeal through it all. We glory in the striking contribution they make to Jehovah’s vindication and pray for their continued courage in the face of tortures. Let us remember also others under dictatorial governments who, besides the risk of suffering such things, are being sorely tried in other ways. What of those whose home is a divided front with a constant clash of wills, with a war of nerves and attrition ceaselessly raging, and in danger of being betrayed to the government? Is it not a sore trial to love a mate or child, yet see that one going against you, opposing Jehovah, heading for destruction?

<p><span class="font3">One who has taken up the ministry and observed all the counsel of God and willingly steps into his proper place becomes an envoy of Christ and is well qualified to urge others to become reconciled to God by getting into their proper place. God is using the ministry to enable multitudes of persons to learn how to please God properly. It is easily seen that for one to humble himself and to be squarely in his proper place is so very important for the success of his ministry and the resultant obtaining of eternal life not only by others but also by himself. This is difficult for many persons to do because of the prestige they may have in this old world. But God will not change his organization for any one of us. It is up to each one of us to change if we want to fit into God’s organization, and fit in we will want to if we appreciate life. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font3"> 23-25</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In ancient times living captives from among the defeated were often stripped naked and led in the triumphal procession before the conqueror’s chariot. So when Jehovah triumphed over the accusing Satanic governments and authorities by letting Jesus die faithful and then resurrecting him for his faithfulness, Jehovah in effect stripped those enemy governments and authorities, disarming them and rendering them naked, completely exposed, as conquered. Jehovah was now within his right to forgive the trespasses of his Christian witnesses and to justify them or declare them righteous that they might gain the heavenly kingdom with their Leader Jesus Christ. So those Satanic governments and authorities could no longer condemn them as sinners already condemned by God’s own law through Moses, for by faith in Christ’s sacrifice they were forgiven and cleansed and declared righteous, and were thus given a good conscience. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font3"> 29</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Contributing spiritually to the witnessing, accompanied by prayer, is more important than the material contribution. All of us, whether materially rich or poor, can bring in this kind of spiritual tithe into Jehovah’s storehouse. Whereas some may see themselves able to give only the ‘widow’s mite,’ they can still give the more vital spiritual tenth to temple worship by directly witnessing according to opportunity. The materially well supplied who can give money or goods must not think that the money gift excuses them from the spiritual contribution in the way of preaching and making public declaration either at meetings or out in the field service. We must bring in the whole spiritual tithe by backing up the preaching and personally taking part in it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 29</span></p>

He was also of a lowly disposition in his dealing with them, with no big ideas of himself or creating an impression of superiority, even though perfect. He was always a refreshing companion, for he truly had the most lovely and lovable personality. He is our example and model, and those who are privileged to have any part, great or small, in giving a right lead to their brothers will do well to follow that example closely. Then you, like Jesus, will always be refreshing to your brothers and in that way you, too, will be giving of your best and will get the best out of others.

The close basic connection between the words </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">fail</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">deceive</span><span class="font3"> underlines the fact that each corrupted one deceived himself into thinking more highly of himself than he ought, and therefore thinking less of his Creator and his fellow creatures than he ought. Once embarked on the course of selfdeception, the next step was to deceive fellow creatures. The courts of heaven witnessed the first failure when the inordinate ambition of a mighty cherub goaded him on to overstep the safe boundaries of freedom and precious responsibility with which his Maker had surrounded him.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">10:11, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our faith in Jehovah is built upon a solid foundation, the inspired record of the Bible. Faith has as its groundwork logic, facts, reason and truth. An example of the solid foundation of faith is set out by Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter 15, about the resurrection. First he presents the evidence about Christ’s resurrection by the testimony of the apostles and five hundred brothers who witnessed his reappearing. He shows the Scriptural evidence on the subject, also using illustrations and argumentation to show a good reason for our faith in the power of God to resurrect. Thus Paul had a reason for his faith. We should in like manner “prove all things,” thereby confirming our faith, building it upon a sure foundation of accurate knowledge. Because of such faith we have confidence in things not seen as yet. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 1, 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The work we do must be good work, done with right motives, in harmony with Jehovah’s purpose, a work given by his hand, and done according to integrity and morality. But inasmuch as modern men have not considered this feasible and look upon it as hampering them in their mad scramble of competitively heaping up money and material goods, they have cast it off like shackles, only to find themselves imprisoned and frustrated by their own greed and their world cringing in terror because of a morally decadent materialism of atomic power. But with an appreciation of spiritual values man can enjoy his work, eat and sleep in peace of mind, have no fear of materialism, and even when he dies the beneficial fruits of his labor will not be lost to him.

<p><span class="font3">This was no materialization of the dead prophets Moses and Elijah. Peter, James and John were conscious and observed what was going on, for they were to be made witnesses of this transfiguration so as to make more firm the prophecies of the Bible. (2 Pet. 1: 16-19) This could not have been a spiritistic materialization of Moses and Elijah, for they were both dead souls, and the time for their resurrection from the dead had not yet arrived. Rather, this was a vision, like the vision that John had about sixty years later and that was so real that he talked with those appearing in it. Jesus himself pronounced the transfiguration a vision, saying: “Tell the vision to no one until the Son of man is raised up from the dead.” Spiritualists are therefore authoritatively barred from using the transfiguration of Jesus in support of their teaching. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15 24,</span><span class="font3"> 25</span></p>

Therefore they are unlike the clergy of Christendom who claim to be set apart and whom the law gives a set-apart status and yet who mix in with the politics and combats of the nations. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 14a</span></p>

This is true not only of the political, commercial and social organizations of this world but also of its religion. All the religions of this world now associate with the United Nations, support it and, like the great harlot, Babylon the Great, ride the seven-headed wild beast to a battle against the King of kings. All the blood unrighteously shed on earth is due to false religion and is there laid to the charge of this mysterious Babylon the Great.

No, they were polluters of the covenant of Levi; they did not accept God’s great sacrificial Lamb for the sins of mankind and the law of truth was not in their mouths. They objected indignantly to many boys in the temple hailing Jesus. And since they did not drive the money changers and animal sellers out of the temple, it took Jesus to do it. The words Jesus quoted on that occasion were Jehovah’s words, and Jehovah was thus with his Angel of the covenant in this expression of judgment at the temple, cleansing it at least of this religious commercialism. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 16</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Let the world spurn Jehovah’s goodness; for our part we shall find satisfaction forever by now accepting the loving offer in his open hand. In loving appreciation we will accept his great means for our salvation, his kingdom by Jesus Christ, which is now established in the heavens, and we will preach it in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations until the end comes. We will band together and regularly meet together as a New World society, doing so without fail, to encourage one another and to incite one another to love and right works, ‘and all the more so as we behold the great day drawing near.’ Doing this, we make and carry out the life-giving decision in this time of man’s crisis, and God’s love in coming to our rescue will be vindicated. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font3"> 37</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Christ.—2 Cor. 12:10, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Where persecution is great, a real spirit of love, harmony and happiness abounds. There may be obstacles to meeting together and preaching regularly, but the brothers overcome them and are happy at it. They have been delivered from a wicked old world and Jehovah sees to it that they are protected and fed spiritually. So they do not pity themselves. They may receive long prison terms, but they consider it no reason to despair or to murmur. On the contrary they all the more recognize their blessings as undeserved, and maintain unshakable faith. They are not discouraged in the least by these hardships. The work is not stopped or even hindered. The good news is being preached. The people of good will are hearing it and are associating themselves with Jehovah’s New World society even in totalitarian lands. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font3"> 17a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Keep this mental attitude in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who . . . gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Phil. 2:5, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christian wives should keep this mental attitude of Christ, and not the attitude of many worldly wives that clamor for equality with and often domi-nancy over their husbands. They will not even untheocrat-ically consider seizing a part or all of the family headship that is divinely assigned to their husbands. They will submit to the marriage arrangement, realizing that it has been so ordained, not by man, but by Jehovah himself. To rebel against the arrangement is to rebel, not against any man, but against Jehovah himself. Remember that it was the covering cherub in Eden that was headstrong and felt cramped and oppressed by Jehovah’s headship and thereupon rebelled and became infamous as Satan the Devil. Wives who are not submissive to their husbands are copying Satan, not Christ. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W If/I</span><span class="font3"> 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Worship of Jehovah calls for dedication to him because of his completely worthy qualities. In Egypt, Moses and fellow Israelites worshiped Jehovah, declining to go contrary to his laws. Jehovah recognized Israel as his people. Repeatedly he made it plain that the purpose of his taking out Israel was that they might worship him as his own people. Israel decided to do what Jehovah would have them do, even though they at the time did not know just what would be involved following their deliverance from Egypt. At Mount Sinai through a covenant arrangement Jehovah emphasized to the nation of Israel the special relationship in which they were with him and there Israel as a nation, all the people, declared their agreement to their dedication. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font3"> l-3a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">—2 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cor. 2:1!,, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If we dedicate ourselves to Jehovah and then as his witnesses preach the good news of his kingdom, he leads us in his triumphal procession with Christ the reigning King. Jehovah leads us, not as captives to our shame and public humiliation, but as a victorious general leads his army in a triumphal procession along a perfumed route through the welcoming capital. He leads us as sharers of His victory through Christ, and as those by whom he is gaining further victory by making perceptible everywhere through us the knowledge of himself, by our publishing of the Bible and its message of the hour. Since 1919 Jehovah has given us this Kingdom message and wherever we preach it it triumphs. It gains victories, transforming many who formerly were enemies of God by wicked works into witnesses of Jehovah. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font3"> 35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses are now the best spiritually provided-for people on the face of the earth. The seed we have sown has been protected, to grow and come to fruition, and the devouring enemies have not been permitted to devour the fruitage by their overrunning tactics, leaving our fields barren of increase. Our pestilential enemies have been rebuked. We are having a blessed time of harvest. Our vine of Kingdom joy has not been blasted or ruined by pests, to cause the developing fruit to drop oft or shrivel up. Our expectations have been realized, no, exceeded. So we have spiritual bread to strengthen our hearts and spiritual wine to gladden them as we go on in Jehovah’s service and regularly bring into his storehouse the whole memorial of our complete dedication to him. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 10a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">James took to task the human tongue. By striking illustrations he emphasized the difficulty of controlling this little body member. Bits in the mouths of horses can turn their whole bodies. Small rudders can swing big ships around. So the little tongue makes great brags. As a tiny spark can set a forest aflame, so the small tongue can be a fire to inflame the whole body and defile it. The beasts of earth men can tame, “but the tongue, not one of mankind can get it tamed.” Why, “if anyone does not stumble in word, this one is a perfect man.” A fountain does not bubble out both the sweet and the bitter. A fig tree does not produce olives, nor a vine figs. Neither does salt water produce sweet water. Yet the same tongue sends out both blessing and cursing.

No one else ean take any one of us into the new world by holding our hand and dragging us through the battle of Armageddon. Each dedicated Christian witness of Jehovah must stand on his own feet. He must hold fast to instruction. Wisdom and understanding of Jehovah’s purposes are the vital essentials that will ensure your survival. But, remember, you cannot go alone. While you may do much private studying, it is very necessary that you meet with the congregation and there make the Eublic declaration of your ope. Knowledge that you thus gain and dispense shows that you are holding fast to instruction and that you can be assured of everlasting life. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 15a</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark415"></a><span class="font3">All who feast on Jehovah's spiritual provision and come to maturity share in the preaching work. The spiritual food is abundant, yet some must devote their time to producing it. This Jehovah has made possible through his generous gift in men to the organization. Writing and printing literature that contains the beautiful Kingdom message are indeed privileges. But distributing the literature is also necessary for the harvest and carries with it its own special blessings. Thus, every activity in the organization is necessary and all work together to complete the arrangement. Besides, those who are not able to have part in the producing of the literature can assist financially in this feature of the work. This shows the interdependency of the organization, each part supplying its own share to provide for the lack of others. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font3"> 31, 32</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">14:9, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In God’s due time earth’s inhabitants became favored with the most direct line of communication possible with God. For three and one-half years men were able to see and hear God’s highest officer or spokesman. Jesus, in his prehuman existence having been the great personal companion of Jehovah, was able to reflect the amazing personality of God, reproduce words and phrases just as originally emanating from the mouth of God and in fact display in conversation here on earth the exalted type of thinking produced by the very mind of God. Our experience today is the same where we get to know someone’s personality very well, are able to repeat words and phrases in his same manner and ean convey to others the type of thinking of this striking individual. Jesus confirms this view in his above answer to Philip’s request: “Master, show us the Father.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font3"> 7, 10a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">It is high time to follow this advice. So gird your mental loins about with the truth of God’s Word. Then you will not weaken in the fight against all the untruthful propaganda of the wicked spirit forces in the unseen places of attack. Let your mind feed upon the truth of the resurrection of the dead. Then you will hold firm and steady against the untruth of the immortality of the human soul and “survival after death.” Also by having on the breastplate of righteousness, your heart will be protected against the sentimental appeals of spiritualism and against its rejection of the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ, which is the only means for us sinners to have our sins counterbalanced and to gain everlasting righteousness that will make us worthy of eternal life in the new world where righteousness is to dwell. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font3"> 41</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Do we, perhaps, like some men, need letters of recommendation!—2 Cor. 3:1, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Could Paul show an appointment letter to congregations he established or to the Roman rulers before whom he appeared? There is nothing to show he had such a letter! Paul did not need such a letter. He had something better. He had witnesses at Damascus to testify that he had been baptized in water to symbolize his dedication. He was also “filled with holy spirit” and had the miraculous gifts of that spirit. What is more, he had the power to lay his hands on baptized believers and impart to them the gifts of the spirit. From this he knew that his being adequately qualified had issued from God. What need did he have, then, of a letter from anyone on earth? The most telling evidence of anyone’s being adequately qualified for a service or ministry is the product of his work, what he has accomplished. Paul had that evidence, and it served as a most impressive letter of recommendation proving his appointment. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1 </span><span class="font3">22a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Let us aid the sheeplike foreigners to see the vital need and opportunity now to serve him, to keep his sabbath by not profaning it with egotistical works of self-righteousness trying to save themselves their own way, but to hold fast Jehovah’s new covenant by accepting its temple, its priesthood, its mediatorship, its sacrifices for forgiveness of sins and its education in the knowledge of Jehovah. If we do this, then we shall be found, not turning the foreigner aside from his right, but loving him as ourselves. Hence at Armageddon Jehovah in his holy temple will not be a swift witness against us with an execution of fiery judgment but will approve of us and spare us to carry on his joyful worship into his own new world. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 45</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">35:25, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Israel’s high priest died he ceased to serve as high priest and to offer atonement for the accidental manslayer. Hence the remnant must remain in the city of refuge as long as they live on earth, because they are still in the imperfect flesh. However, when they finish their earthly duties after Armageddon and die and are instantaneously resurrected, they will no more need the atoning services of Jehovah’s High Priest, for then they have forever left the flesh behind, sacrificed in vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty. Everything that attaches to the imperfect flesh, including accidental bloodguilt, will have passed away from them. Thus the High Priest will have died in an atoning, protective capacity toward them. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1 4,</span><span class="font3"> 5b</span></p>

What a lesson this should be to some in lands where there is a greater measure of freedom—this wonderful spirit of love and unity exhibited by our brothers in less fortunate circumstances! Theirs is a real desire, not only to keep happy themselves in their worship of Jehovah, but actually to spread their joy and happiness to others. In their preaching they copy Christ, having a refreshing message that brings true comfort. It brings great joy to all to hear of their experiences and integrity keeping. Is your congregation one of such blessed associations of brothers with the full joy of Jehovah? Sometimes the brothers in democratic lands miss out on this.

<p><span class="font3">Your marriage mate’s not being in the truth is not grounds for separation. He may eventually accept the truth because of observing your good conduct or hearing your tactful testimony. Sometimes the unbeliever makes conditions intolerable, yet remains with the believer. It may become so difficult that the believer decides to separate, being unable to continue. The husbaud may use extreme violence on his wife or may fail to provide material support, or the wife may oppose the husband's theocratic service, or otherwise endanger his prospects of eternal life. If the believer decides this is the case with his marriage he may separate, but since adultery or death is the only way a marriage is canceled in God’s sight, the believer is not free to remarry, even if a legal divorce is obtained. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W lf/1</span><span class="font3"> 6a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Faith must be tested and proved by works. It must be based on accurate knowledge and must be demonstrated to the full end. God does not change his righteous requirements. Do not think that God is a sentimentalist who will compromise, change his word or make special provision for some person not showing enduring faith and love for him. Having faith now will not save us if we permit it to grow weak and die. Do not be like the son who promised to work for his father and then never did so. He proved faithless to his word and vow. Exercising faith and strengthening it saves one from coming to such a condition. We are now approaching the great hour of testing at Armageddon. We must show our faith by positive action one way or the other. If we are lukewarm in our devotion to Jehovah, or show lack of faith to move us to action, we shall be cast off. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font3"> 26, 27</span></p>

Those disciples were Paul's letter written on his heart because he carried them along with him in his affections and he wrote them letters because he cared for them. At the same time he had taught and trained them to be preaching witnesses of Jehovah and Christ, and so those Corinthian Christians were Paul’s letter on open display, “known and being read by all mankind.” They were a letter, not from man, not even from the governing body at Jerusalem.

<p><span class="font3">With many the incentive to work is not the accomplishment of something worth doing but is an envious rivalry to outdo their fellow man. It is the pressure of competition and greed that drives them to work harder and better than their neighbor. This is selfish and agitating, vexatious and vain. The other extreme is the fool that folds his hands in idleness. Better to follow a middle course, work calmly and peacefully, without agitation and envy of others’ possessions, and enjoy one sufficient handful in quiet contentment, than jealously to grasp two handfuls gained by bitter competition or to sit in want with two hands left empty by foolish laziness. Neither too much nor too little is good— the former makes men feel independent of God and the latter tempts them to thievery. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font3"> 13</span></p>

Just as they had been thoroughly taught how to perform the ministry, just so exactly they were to teach others the same things, nothing more, nothing less. Surely we can help someone else in the same way as we ourselves have been trained, especially when we remember that there are servants in various positions appointed particularly “with a view to the training of the holy ones for ministerial work.” Of course, we should not attempt to do this work in our own strength and wisdom.

<p><span class="font3">Those who walk in the way Jehovah directs have found their feet on a steady and even place. In contrast with this, those persons who have looked to great ones in this old world’s systems have constantly been disappointed and find themselves beset with many troubles and problems. Their feet are on a path that is full of pitfalls, a very uneven path with no sure goal in view. Clearly, then, it is not those things that are great and popular in the sight of this old world that are best for man, but the arrangement that Jehovah has made is best. As humble as a place in the congregation of Jehovah’s people may seem to be, it is the place of real safety and value. It is the place that a Christian should seek out, get into, and then keep his place there. This we will do if we have the appreciation the psalmist had as expressed above. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1 </span><span class="font3">27-29</span></p>

That means that we will keep the New World society clean, upright and at unity. We will take care of difficulties between ourselves and any other individual in the New World society in a Scriptural way, will do no wrong that affects the congregation and its service, and will accept private and public reproof from our fellow servants in the New World society. We will not engage in doctrinal uncleanness, in moral uncleanness or in troublemaking. We will, in all of these and in other matters, private and ministerial, endeavor to conform to the will of the heavenly Father, in whose name we have been baptized and to whom our dedication has been made. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 11a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2:5, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By the end of the first century Christ’s twelve apostles had died. Soon the building and growth of the spiritual temple was lost to view because of a falling away from the pure temple faith. Of course, God has always dwelt in the temple’s Foundation Cornerstone, Jesus Christ, in heaven by means of his spirit; but the living stones on earth were long lost to view and practically unidentifiable. But shortly after 1870 they began to come to view again, for these truths of the spiritual temple began to be recovered and applied and God’s spirit was seen in action for producing the final remnant of the spiritual house. Christendom’s religious systems have claimed to be the house of God, his true temple, although they have continued fallen away from the temple faith and have no evidence of Jehovah’s dwelling in them by his spirit. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 24, 25</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The anointed remnant were not altogether clean from this world, not entirely neutral toward worldly wars. How much of bloodguiltiness Jehovah at his temple judged to be upon them we do not definitely know. But after their release in 3919 they repented, confessed their guilt and endeavored to clean up their worship of him. Moreover, since then, and particularly down to 1931, thousands who were definitely tainted with bloodguilt heard the message of the Kingdom, repented and turned to God for mercy. With faith in his High Priest they gave themselves in full dedication to God to do his will ever afterward and to remain strictly within his merciful provisions to be safeguarded against the executing of all the blood-guilty at Armageddon. These spiritual Israelites were the first to take advantage of this divine protection against bloodguilt. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font3"> 17a</span></p>

Thousands of these new ones are flocking to the family of God and offering themselves for the ministerial work.

<p><span class="font3">It is a fact that human creatures are quicker to criticize than commend. Do we single out the bad because we feel irritation or even righteous indignation about it? Or is it a matter of commenting on extremes that grabs our attention? We comment on the good if it is outstanding and on the bad if it is extreme. However, gossip is more often petty, focusing on trivial matters. So apparently more is involved than extremes that catch our notice, or trespasses serious enough to make us righteously indignant. For one thing, as humans we have a strong tendency to tell others what we have just learned. But why are the tidbits of gossip the daintiest morsels? Because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks and the heart of fallen man is treacherous and very sick. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font3"> 2, 3a</span></p>

This power was exercised by God’s faithful angels for thousands of years after the Flood, but no longer by sinner angels, for they would misuse it. The materializations that are reported by spiritualists are not such as the “sons of God” performed before the Flood, instantaneous and out in the open daylight without a medium and in independent bodies. The spiritualist materializations today are merely the taking of protoplasm or material of the medium’s body and extruding it from such as “ectoplasm” and then shaping it into human appearances. At the end of the apparition the ectoplasm, rather than being dissolved, returns to the medium’s body and the medium becomes conscious and normal again.

Even in Christendom they have experienced being charged with teaching “illegal” and “subversive” doctrine. If Christianity must return to its early dynamism to be completely successful against communism, let it be noted that it is because Jehovah’s witnesses have returned to the dynamism of early Christianity that even today, after the hysteria of World War II, they arc “illegal” in a number of lands in Christendom, not to speak of Communist lands, and arc falsely accused by religious foes of being subversive and security risks, any old charge being leveled at them to rouse public feeling against them, to stir up government action against them and to make their existence unsafe. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15 12</span></p>

Instead, however, we have the distinction of fulfilling Jesus’ prophecy given above. No paper letters that we could show them would alter their attitude toward us. But we have a letter, and we ourselves have been used to write it, that speaks more authoritatively to show our divine ordination. It is a living letter the contents of which are spread over all the earth. Since 1919 the remnant have preached the Kingdom good news to all nations. In this way they have been writing by the spirit of God on fleshly tablets, on hearts, and today the great crowd of other sheep gathered to the one flock is proof that they were ordained by God. It is a human letter of recommendation testifying that they are the “faithful and discreet slave” class of God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 28a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">40:7, 8, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What led up to Jesus’ dedication? Knowledge concerning God, love for his heavenly Father and earnest desire to forward the cause of pure worship for advancing Jehovah’s purposes to the vindication of his name. But why did not Jesus simply go about his work, putting his hand to it and doing what he could in furtherance of his ministry? Why should he dedicate himself? For the reason that doing God’s will, carrying on his worship, is no casual affair. It is not something that is all right if you do it and all right if you do not. Dedication to Jehovah calls for special solemnities, the making of a contract, a formal agreement which, when evidenced, gives notice to all concerned and all observing as to what to expect from the individual henceforth. It calls for punctiliousness, orderliness. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font3"> 7a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">When the returned Israelites defied their enemies and resumed temple building God began blessing them again materially in keeping with his covenant. In 516 B.C. the temple was completed and inaugurated. During the days of Zerubbabel and Joshua the high priest the Israelites continued to keep spiritual matters first, with the correct understanding that the spiritual comes before the material and that the material depends upon the spiritual. But after those days the Israelites began to lose their appreciation of the pure blessings of God’s worship. They became materialistic. They thought that by pursuing materialism at the expense of spirituality they would increase their material things. Just the reverse! Their materialism killed their material prosperity, for it ignored the Source of prosperity. God does not bless materialism. He curses it. Let us note how these examples apply to us today, that we may avoid making the same mistakes. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 11, 12</span></p>

Do you appreciate that when you hear or read the Bible you are actually giving attention to Jehovah as he communicates his thoughts to you? Therefore we should read his Book every day throughout the entire year, and year after year. It is an inexhaustible fountain of refreshing truth. It is always deliciously fresh, tasty. You will find the rarest gems of truth, marvelous instruction, sound counsel.

<p><span class="font3">Although Jehovah had abandoned Herod’s temple he was not left without a temple for he had replaced it with an enduring, spiritual temple. On the third day after he ripped the sanctuary curtain from top to bottom God raised up the “foundation cornerstone” of his spiritual temple by resurrecting his Son from the dead to life in the heavens. In accord with his sworn oath Jehovah raised him up as a royal priest like Melchizedek but having the divine nature. Because of the human sacrifice that he had laid down as such a priest, Jesus was now Jehovah’s royal High Priest, possessing the merit of his sacrifice. By means of holy spirit Jehovah dwelt in Jesus the living “foundation cornerstone” of the spiritual temple and God no longer needed the dead-stone material temple at Jerusalem. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 20</span></p>

Do they have any unimpeachable letter of recommendation that silences all question as unwarranted and all accusation as prejudiced and false? Not any letter in ink on paper or scratched on stone tablets, but the living letter written by means of God’s spirit upon sheeplike people. It is a recommendation letter written on “fleshly tablets, on hearts,” of other believing men and women who since 1931 have increased from far less than 100,000 to now over 600,000 witnesses of Jehovah in the New World society. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 29a</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark416"></a><span class="font3">This shows how the high priest governed the life and liberty of the refugee. It also shows that God’s protection to the blood-stained refugees today against execution at Armageddon is granted through his High Priest who gave his own life to rescue even repentant manslayers. Going outside the refuge city before Israel’s high priest died pictures, therefore, that the one enjoying God’s mercy and protection becomes rebellious at God’s limitations upon him. He loses his appreciation of what God had done for him through Christ and why God has put him under bounds. He comes from under the atonement covering of Christ’s sacrifice; he becomes careless about meeting God’s requirements and humbling himself under God’s mighty hand. Outside Jehovah’s merciful refuge he is certain to become subject to execution at Armageddon. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1 2,</span><span class="font3"> 3b</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We bring in the spiritual tithe by participating directly in the temple worship and promoting it. Ancient temple worship meant to go with your tithe to the temple and be in contact with the priests, Levites and other Israelites there at God’s house; it was more than private worship at home. So we can bring in the spiritual tithe by attending the meetings of Jehovah's worshipers and not only being present but also taking part in such meetings and so building up the others there by some spiritual word or assistance; by afterward encouraging newcomers or newly interested ones, as also by aiding others to get to the meeting. All this may require doing some private preparing of oneself for the temple worship opportunities.

Instead of being worried, happy are we if we awake to the fact that Jehovah in his wonderful love has come to our rescue and we are willing to be rescued in his way. We can get the satisfaction of our loving heart’s desire if we accept God’s open hand. But it takes two to make a gift, an accepter as well as a giver. All mankind are selfishly willing to accept and enjoy the material good things that his open hand has provided. Not all, though, appreciate the greatest offer of his open hand, the spiritual offer. They spurn the offer of God’s gift of eternal life because it is through Jesus Christ our Lord, and they bite the hand that offers to feed them with life-giving spiritual provisions as well as material food. So they remain unsatisfied in the highest sense and will perish in their dissatisfaction at Armageddon. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15 </span><span class="font3">36</span></p>

When we look at the world today, we can appreciate by comparison how fortunate we are. Certainly we have no reason to complain. It is God's purpose to deliver his happy prais-ers alive into his righteous new world when he executes judgment against all who speak abusively against him. The Devil’s world is in a miserable state, but there is no reason why we should be unhappy. Despite all the pressure that has been brought against Jehovah's organization, we marvel at its prosperity and growth. We will stand firm and continue in the preaching work, taking courage from the assurance of Jehovah that by doing so we shall be happy and gain his approval. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15 </span><span class="font3">21, 22a</span></p>

While Jehovah himself is the great Giver and Fruit-bearer, yet all things produced share in the production operation themselves. Jehovah provides bountifully, still the farmer must work to produce the harvest. And if he follows the divinely established rules he will receive enough not only to sustain himself until time for the next planting, but he will have seed to plant.

However, when it is not possible to reach an agreement and a definite decision must be made, then the husband must make it. If the decision is wrong, he is the one that will have to cope with the consequences.

<p><span class="font3">Many times persons gossip about others to exalt themselves. They may not realize this, but it is a subtle motive behind the talk. To criticize others in effect exalts oneself. Since you disapprove of such a fault you would not be guilty of it, is the implication. This kind of gossiping can be a form of bragging. You point the finger of guilt at another, and you feel superior. You border on the Pharisee who in prayer to God gossiped about others and gave thanks that he was not “as the rest of men.” But the tax collector when praying “kept beating his chest, saying: X) God, be gracious to me a sinner.’ ” He did not feel superior to others, but humbly lamented his own unworthiness. To exalt yourself subtly by gossiping leads to humiliation.

He being merely the foundation cornerstone, it is manifest that God did not purpose to use Jesus alone as his living spiritual temple. So on Pentecost, just ten days afterward, God began to rear his spiritual temple upon Jesus the living Foundation Cornerstone. He used Jesus the High Priest to do the building of this spiritual house. Hence at Pentecost Jehovah begot Jesus’ faithful apostles and other disciples on earth with the holy spirit to make them his spiritual sons. Then through Jesus he poured out his holy spirit upon them to anoint them as members of a royal priesthood. He made them living stones to be laid upon Jesus the Foundation Cornerstone. So from the day of Pentecost forward Jehovah has been dwelling in his holy spiritual temple of living stones. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 21, 23</span></p>

The contents of this letter will yet grow longer as more human hearts are written upon until Armageddon, and will thereafter spread over the face of the cleansed earth as a living testimony to the power and spirit of Jehovah now operative in his adequately qualified ministers.

Likewise those fleeing to the Christian’s city of refuge may not be idlers within the New World society. They must show an appreciation of the divine mercy to them and keep in touch with the remnant and especially with the High Priest under whose covering they find protection. They must not be burdens, drags, on the New World society, but must learn a trade in that organization. In view of the divine obligations laid upon it the only trade suitable within that organization is that of preaching the Kingdom message and declaring the day of vengeance of our God.

<p><span class="font3">Nineteen centuries ago Jesus Christ gave John a vision in which he beheld a great crowd gathered at the temple, hailing Jehovah and his Son and ascribing their own salvation to these and serving Jehovah day and night in his temple. What an ecstatic experience for John to see that in vision! Yes, but what a soul-stirring experience for us here today to see it in glorious actuality! Still exercising divine patience for salvation of sheeplike people. Jehovah is not yet through gathering them to his house of prayer for all the nations. Let us be one with him and his Right Shepherd, working with them by preaching the good news of the triumphant kingdom and carrying on all the educational work by which the sheep-gathering is done. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15 44, 45</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Brothers, even though a man takes some false step before he is aware of it, you who have spiritual qualifications try to restore such a man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Gal. 6:1, HW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the responsibility of the stronger ones to speak to those who have shown hesi-tance in taking up their responsibility. Therefore a brother in the organization should not be offended when another brother who is zealous and joyful in God’s service calls on him to help him. He should be grateful to God that someone sees his need and that someone with spiritual qualifications is willing to help to restore him in a spirit of mildness. It may be that the one who was slipping away lost his grip and no longer was holding fast to the instruction God had given through His Word. Once we lose our grip on the instruction in God’s Word we begin to lose our life. We must seek accurate knowledge and for that we must turn to God’s Word; we must associate with his organization and accept the help it offers. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 14a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">is in me.—Ps.</span><span class="font3"> 7</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">: 8, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Integrity is seen in the wisdom of a godly husband who by compliance with true Christian principles earns the respect and affection of his family ; in the wife who strives to make full proof of her position as helper to her husband ; in the parent who seeks to train his children with kindness and firmness upon the basis of Jehovah's authoritative advice; in the child who humbly recalls his parents’ longer experience and maturer judgment and obeys their rule. But regardless of what position we may occupy we all are preachers. Having dedicated our lives to Jehovah we have been granted a high honor, and here is where our integrity shines forth at its best! In this service it is that we are called upon to endure faithfully the hatred of an entire ungodly world. But like Jesus we must never lose sight of the joy that is set before us, the reward of tested and unshaken integrity. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 't/15</span><span class="font3"> Ila</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding; whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in.—Ps. 32: 9, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah knows his creatures and knows what to use to keep them in their places. For man who was created with a marvelous brain, far, far superior to that in any animal, the intellect is the part of man that needs guidance and it is the intellect of man that directs him. Therefore God did not provide the same kind of boundaries for man that he did for the lesser creation, but he provided counsel for him. So in many places in the Scriptures men of understanding spoke of the value of God’s written Word as a guide for them and as a light for their path. Jehovah does not force or drive man to do certain things. He gives man counsel that he can take in through his eyes by reading and his ears by hearing and store it in his mind and then use the information to direct his steps and control his actions. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font3"> 16</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">11: 9, Ro.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One may be unable to do certain things and so criticize those who do these things, making such conduct seem wrong. One might feel insecure, so he finds fault with others to reassure himself. If one is strong in a certain point he might be very critical of those weak in it. By criticizing this weakness in others he subtly calls notice to his own superiority. In many instances persons gossip to get attention. It flatters them to know something others want to hear, makes them feel wise. It is easy to gossip, to criticize, and so they do this to tickle ears itching to hear spicy tales. Undoubtedly there are many reasons and combinations of reasons why people gossip. But when all camouflage is stripped off and we see gossip for what it is—unkind, unfair, harmful, hateful—we understand why Jehovah detests it and why Christians should shun it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font3"> 7a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">18:24, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We bring spiritual tithes by preparing ourselves and then going into the field service to preach the Kingdom message. Preparing ourselves for this will be helped by our attending congregational meetings. Ancient tithes supported the priests and Levites. We must thus support the antitypical sons of Levi, the present-day remnant of Jehovah’s royal priesthood, in their preaching of his established kingdom and in putting his worship topmost. This also includes advertising public meetings by word of mouth and leaflet, by attending them oneself and helping others, whether dedicated brothers or recently interested persons, to attend. Spiritual tithing includes our helping along the global movement of all nations and all peoples up the exalted mountain of Jehovah’s house to his temple courts, there to worship together.—Isa. 2 : 2-4. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font3">28</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Be persevering in prayer, remaining awake in it with thanksgiving.—Col. 4 ■' 2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Offering every form of prayer and supplication in the thick of this theocratic fight against wicked spirits in the invisible realm, you will be keeping God in mind and be depending upon your unfailing Protector and Helper and not upon any arm of flesh. At every suggestion to you of spiritism and against the occult spells that spiritists try to cast upon you, you will appeal to God to give you the victory over the wicked spirits, their deception and their opposition, and that God’s holy angels may serve as ministering spirits in your behalf. You will be thinking not merely of yourself but also of your fellow Christians engaged in the same fight against superhuman powers of wickedness. God’s answers to prayers are just as necessary to our overcoming the wicked spirit forces as are the various pieces of the complete suit of armor from God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font3"> 46</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 2:16, 17, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We can answer, “We are!” not out of boasting, but out of a grateful realization of Jehovah’s favor to us. We cannot deny what results to us when he assigns us to his service and trains us through his organization under Christ. True, we do offer the people literature explaining the Bible, and we do accept contributions from cheerful givers in support of the Bible educational work. But that does not make us peddlers of God’s Word. Since we have no commercial ends in view, we are sincere in dealing with God’s Word. Our heart’s desire is just to make the odor of the knowledge of Jehovah perceptible through us everywhere we go that it may sweeten the lives of all persons whose lives have been made bitter by Satan’s oppression and false religions and who want to be Jesus’ sheep. So we are truly qualified for participation in the glorious triumphs of the Kingdom message in this day of Jehovah’s march to his greatest triumph by Christ. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font3"> 1, 3a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Though you may have ten thousand tutors . . . you certainly do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I have become your father through the good news.—1 Cor. 4:15, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A paid tutor is primarily concerned with fulfilling his obligations by giving the instructions that are required of him. He would not expect to have to repeat a lesson many times because of his pupil’s slowness in grasping things. His duty done, he is satisfied and finished and expects his pay. On the other hand, a true father is primarily concerned with helping his child to make real progress and out of love is prepared to be endlessly patient and forbearing, giving gladly and unselfishly of his best. Paul was a real father to Timothy. Timothy followed the lead set for him and was thus taught how to become a good leader of others in the ministry. We, too, want to accept God’s undeserved kindness and fulfill its purpose in being trained to help others become established as preachers of the good news. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1 </span><span class="font3">17 a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">What have we to do with you, Jesus you Nazarene? Did you come to destroy us?—Mark</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1:24, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus was not a spirit medium. He never yielded to the influence of demons or unclean spirits. But Jesus himself cast out demons and he empowered his disciples also to cast out demons. His enemies said he cast out demons by the power of the “ruler of the demons,” Beelzebub. But Jesus said that this would mean that Satan was divided against himself so that his kingdom could not stand. Well, then, does that mean that when spirit mediums and priests of false religion exorcise demons God is using them to cast out demons? No, but Satan is using them to do so. In his use of these Satan is not divided against himself, because these spirit mediums and false priests are on his side and are upholding his kingdom by the wonderful thing they are performing, and they are giving seeming support to Satan’s religious lies. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font3"> 27</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">When you gossip you help no one and you hurt at least three: the one you talk about, the one you talk to, and yourself. The same is true when you listen to gossip. Do you know a sure way to crush gossip? Refuse to listen to it. The gossiper wants your ears. Do not lend him your ears. He will only fill them with dirt. And you may be tempted to spread it to other ears. Help him and protect yourself by not listening. You should stop gossip both going out and coming in. If you send it out, your tongue is sinning; if you take it in, your ears are sinning. If you listen to gossip and believe it you are in effect answering a matter before you hear it, for until you hear both sides you have not heard it fully. So turn a deaf ear to gossip. Pause and consider: if a gossip were slandering you, would you not like for the hearer to stop him? So do as you would be done to.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">19:15, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah, at Isaiah 63:1-6, prophetically pictures his own self as treading the great press. But in treading the wine press at Armageddon Jehovah uses the nearest Kinsman of all mankind, the Blood Avenger, namely “the man Christ Jesus.” The apostle John had a forevision of his going into the loaded wine press at Armageddon and treading it with a troop of heavenly companions. At this Armageddon wine press the flow of blood from the smitten nations will be a flood, for, even as all the righteous blood shed from Abel down to their day came upon the generation living in Jesus’ day, so at Armageddon all the blood shed since Jesus’ day will come upon unfaithful Christendom. The four-thousand-year-old harlot, Babylon the Great, drunk with the blood of the holy ones and of the witnesses of Jesus, will be hurled into God’s globe-encircling wine press.

<p><span class="font3">Whereas the ancient tithebringing nation of Israel was to be materially rich, the nation of spiritual Israel, Jehovah’s anointed witnesses, today is spiritually rich. They have the evidences of the divine favor, blessing and protection in spite of all the attacks of the enemy. Always they have come through triumphant. They are producing the fruitage of Jehovah’s spirit, which is love, joy, peace, goodness, faith, etc., and hence are not corrupted by the “works of the flesh.” They are a clean organization of clean worship. They have a satisfying Bible message, one that glorifies God and satisfies one’s hunger and thirst for spiritual nourishment. They are rich in the possessing of God’s unique holy name, and they dwell in a theocratic earthly condition, a symbolic land worthy of the name “Beulah.”—Isa. 62: 4. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 11a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Even as the sons of Levi were temple servants and guardians and offerers of the sacrifices so the remnant of the royal priesthood must offer spiritual sacrifices of praise and good works toward God and must notify others of Christ’s sacrifice for sins. Until Jehovah’s coming to his temple in 1918 there was considerable faultiness about their spiritual sacrifices that was not worthy of God’s altar, and their organization was not altogether clean. But after World War I closed in 1918, they underwent a fiery purification in order to “offer unto Jehovah offerings in righteousness.” All the world has now become aware of their offering spiritual sacrifices in righteousness, their greatest offering being the preaching of “this good news” of God’s established kingdom to all the inhabited earth. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 29</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The other sheep are not spiritual Israelites in the new covenant, but they do live under its provisions and must harmonize their lives with it. They are under the one general law of being Jehovah’s witnesses and preaching the Kingdom news. To do this, they also have been adequately qualified, and this requires them, first of all, to have an ordination from God. So they willingly dedicate themselves to God through Christ and symbolize that full surrender by water baptism. In view of their proper dedication God accepts them into the “one flock,” not to be priestly ministers of the new covenant, but to be his witnesses and adequately qualified ministers </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">under</span><span class="font3"> the new covenant. He ordains them as his earthly ministers to serve with the remnant of spiritual Israel.

Their rulers are astounded at what they see going on, unable to believe their own eyes. Which of them can operate a government by a system of voluntary taxation? Yet the New World society is being established forever world-wide on just that basis. Which of their “churches” can fulfill its chosen responsibility to society without constant solicitation or exhortation? Yet the present unparalleled growth of Jehovah’s witnesses and the comfort and inspiration they have brought to millions of people have been the result of a relatively small number’s making a freewill contribution of their money in support of their divinely commissioned work. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 37</span></p>

Those brought into the Christian congregation had preconceived unclear views as to God’s purposes. It would take time to change over their thinking. God knew that as mere men they could not mentally grasp or retain a flood of new truths at one time. So he lovingly arranged for a gradual flow of waters of new truth to his servants in an orderly channeled way. Gradually their minds would be adjusted and become filled with a progression of new things.

Your love for yourself finds excuses or extenuating circumstances to cover over your errors. Well, let the same love that covers your shortcomings work to cover the faults of your brothers. Let it make you as understanding, as merciful, as forgiving toward him as it makes you toward yourself. You are glad that Jehovah knows our frame and remembers that we are dust and does not expect too much? Then remember your brother’s is dust also and do not expect too much. You must forgive to be forgiven. You ask Jehovah to forgive you as you forgive others. If you do not forgive, you are not effectually asking for forgiveness. When you forgive offenses forget them. If you later repeat them and gossip about them you show that you are lacking in the love that covers a multitude of sins. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font3"> 13a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">On the basis of their dedication and God’s acceptance of it all nations that claim to give consideration to Christian ministers should recognize the other sheep as Scripturally ordained ministers. The nations are self-willed and dictatorial when they set up their own rules and by them declare who is a real minister recognized by God. It is Scripturally out of order for nations to require certain written authorizations or man-made ceremonies before recognizing these dedicated men and women as God’s ministers. Uninspired lawmakers of this world did not write the Bible, but God caused the writing of it, and his true ministers have the testimony of his inspired Word respecting their ordination by him for having dedicated themselves to him. The proof of what his ordained ministers should be ought to be taken from the written Word of God, who does the ordaining, not from man-made laws and their legal interpretation by judges. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> Ila</span></p>

Through Heaven’s windows Jehovah empties out his overflowing blessing upon the covenant keepers. He promised to pour out this blessing before the great and dreadful day of Jehovah. By lovingly, faithfully bringing in the spiritual tithes since 1919 the remnant of spiritual Israelites proceeded to test Jehovah according to his new covenant through Christ. Has Jehovah met the test? The abundant blessing that has been poured out upon his witnesses during the thirtyseven years since then answers emphatically yes I Truly Jehovah has opened the floodgates of the heavens and given us a downpour of blessing so that today no more need exists. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15 4, 5,</span><span class="font3"> 10a</span></p>

But who is it that has been able to face this day of his coming to the temple and endure it? It is those who have been sincerely seeking Jehovah. It is those who have been the only ones to call attention to the fact of his coming and presence at the temple with his Angel of the covenant. It is Jehovah’s witnesses who have shown a willingness to subject themselves to Jehovah's judgments through Christ, no matter how fiery, no matter how bleaching, and to endure a cleaning up in their doctrine, organization and activity. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15 27,</span><span class="font3"> 28</span></p>

If we never express ourselves, our thoughts never come into a form to benefit others or even ourselves. One may have a mistaken view of something and by keeping quiet he may never have known it. By expressing yourself you have the opportunity to change your thinking, to get that wrong view straightened out. You want the right ideas in your head, for no one wants to go from house to house talking about Jehovah’s purposes and telling householders the wrong things. So do not let the error you think you might express hold you back from speaking. Your mistake may sharpen the correct answer in the minds of others. If one did all his own thinking and never consulted anyone or expressed himself to others, he never would be able to test himself.

Why expect more of others than of ourselves? Keeping quiet was too great a strain for us. Why expect others to resist the strain we could not? Moreover, another may like the person we slander and may want to give him a chance to defend himself. That is only fair. So when we start to gossip, let us think how we will feel when our victim hears it, probably in an exaggerated version. Our motive for clamping our lips should be better than fearing repercussions when our victim catches us at it. It is Satan’s will for us to gossip. It is Jehovah’s will that we crush it.

Then in 1931 he showed his gathered remnant that they must give full attention to this other sheeplike class, that they must act like the prophetic man “clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side.” They must mark these depressed sheeplike ones in their foreheads that these might be spared by Jehovah’s executioners at Armageddon. If we refuse to do marking work, we are turning aside the sojourner from his right. If we do so, then woe to us! Jehovah is still in his holy temple to act as a swift witness and show up the lovelessness of any who refuse to concern themselves about these sheep </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">and get</span><span class="font3"> busy in the witness work of marking their foreheads. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 36</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We have no need for religious men to lay hands upon us to be ordained. Our ordination is from God and results to us from dedicating our eternal existence to him through Christ. We are not ordained by the hand laid upon us by the one who baptizes us in water in symbol of our dedication. But, inasmuch as our water baptism has a relationship to our ordination from God, we may, for the purposes of record, submit our baptismal date as the approximate time of our ordination, to satisfy the law of the land where an ordination date is asked for. What we want upon ourselves to qualify us is the hand of God, the hand of Him who touched Jeremiah and ordained him. Jehovah’s is the first hand that should be upon us to ordain or appoint us as qualified ministers. Without first his hand upon us the laying of human hands upon us afterward has no force, but is mere form. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font3"> 13a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Deut. 19:3, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This preparing the way meant that the main roads of flight to the cities of refuge had to be made speed roads; hillocks had to be leveled down, stumbling stones had to be cleared out, rivers had to be bridged, the roads had to be broadened so that heavy traffic might not block the fugitive, and at the crossroads signs had to be erected marked “Refuge! Refuge!” to point out the direction to the eity of asylum. Each division of land, three east of the Jordan and three west of the river, had its own refuge eity, so that the flight would not be overlong to a man in any district. Each one knew his proper refuge eity. What an excellent illustration this is of how the way has had to be prepared for the accidentally bloodguilty today, particularly the “temporary resident” and the “settlers,” the other sheep, who are not spiritual Israelites but who are from many nations! </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font3"> 10, lib</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked.—Mal. 3:18, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">J ehovah's witnesses, who have faithfully put Jehovah to the test, are the happiest people on earth and know it is not useless to serve Him. The worldly proud ones in Christendom have not rejoiced in God's established kingdom but have opposed those who advertise it. They have walked in mourning before Jehovah and fret because the schemers of wickedness momentarily prosper materially and politically in their way. (3:13-15) The outpoured, overflowing blessing upon Jehovah's tithebringing witnesses disproves all the false reasonings of the disgruntled, faithless, disobedient religionists. At Armageddon, by the salvation of the Jehovah fearers and the destruction of the Jehovah de-spisers, we shall once more see the difference between the truly righteous and the wicked. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 13, 15a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">True happiness lies in seeking ways to be loving and helpful to our neighbors, not complaining about their misfortunes or weaknesses but strengthening them with the truth, which comforts and builds up. Christ Jesus, in giving us the above commandment, rules out a hypercritical, complaining attitude by Christians toward their neighbors. If we are honest with ourselves we admit our own mistakes and shortcomings. Do we mock and ridicule ourselves when we err? Because we love ourselves we honestly seek to correct ourselves and make straight paths for our feet. This gives us peace of mind and happiness. In serving alongside our close neighbors, our brothers, we observe the same principle. We shall be happy if we seek ways to be loving and helpful to them. Such is a praiseworthy attitude to commend to all and is certain to have Jehovah’s blessing. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font3"> 6, 7a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We must advance, increase, grow up in Jehovah’s organization ; we cannot stand still. Through the Watch Tower publications, as well as through the congregation, circuit and district servants, the Society constantly stresses that we must study. Serious study is hard work. But it does yield happy results. It takes effort to search the Scriptures, but you know that the knowledge gained spells out life. Taking in knowledge of Jehovah God and of his Son means everlasting life. One who wants life must listen to the Giver of life, Jehovah. Everlasting life is due to hearing the Word and believing Jehovah God, for it was God who sent Jesus; and by having this faith we are able to pass over from death to life. By assembling ourselves together for making public declaration of our hope we continue learning and growing, advancing to maturity. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font3"> 18</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">At Armageddon now near comes the time of the wine treaders. That great wine press will be trodden outside the city and the horses under Christ and his heavenly troops will fairly wade through blood, so many will be those in opposition to God and his King. Do not think this is too gruesome to come true! It is a pictorial prophecy of God’s Word and his Word always comes true. &quot;Trodden outside the city” means it will be trodden outside the Christian city of refuge, hence outside the New World society. Do any today want to avoid being pitched into the wine press of God’s anger to be crushed? Then make no delay to escape the divine Avenger of blood. Take the road marked “Refuge ! Refuge!” and flee to the refuge city under the High Priest Jesus Christ.

<p><span class="font3">By putting his name upon his remnant of the spiritual temple and by sending them forth to be his witnesses Jehovah has caused his name to be most highly exalted in all the earth in these latter days. Because of keeping “the covenant of Levi” (Mal. 2:4-8) and rendering exclusive devotion to Jehovah the temple remnant have put his purified worship supreme over everything else, specializing upon it as being of first importance according to their priestly obligations. No government has a right to interfere with it, and in a conflict between worshiping Jehovah and obeying human rulers who oppose him the temple remnant put Jehovah’s worship on top and firmly keep their service in his temple, giving first to God what belongs to God. They have refused to quit offering their spiritual sacrifices of praising God and preaching the good news of his established, triumphant kingdom. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 38</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Family members should al-w’ays show respect for one another, not humiliating others but allowing them a measure of dignity. When necessary to correct, do it in the way you would appreciate being corrected. Do not bluntly rebuke the other publicly, before friends. Do not badger your children over every trivial trespass. As parents, when you correct your children, do you always corroborate each other or do you issue contradictory instructions? Make allowances for individual temperaments, changing moods, upset mental states. When an emotional storm seems to be brewing, remember patience and selfcontrol.

Such individuals of the nations call the spiritual remnant happy. Yearning for spiritual prosperity and happiness themselves, they come to the delightsome land. They join themselves to the spiritually prosperous remnant. They come up to the mountain of God’s house, climb up to his temple courts and join in the worship of him with spirit and truth. Learning that continued prosperity is based upon their obedient action, they too bring in their spiritual tithes in Jehovah’s storehouse that there may be sustenance in it for the temple servants. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 12a</span></p>

Christ showed that God is properly worshiped by man in publicly proclaiming God's purposes and his qualities and characteristics to other human creatures. Jesus counseled all his disciples to be busy proclaiming the Kingdom message. Those associated with the New World society are doing just that. They know that the New World society has accepted God’s Word as its guide and is following a path that is made clear in it. They know that this is the proper place for them to be and that Armageddon will change nothing with the New World society, because it has gotten willingly into its proper place and is not deserving destruction. It will not even change the need to continue preaching, as it will be necessary to praise God's name by talking throughout eternity. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font3"> 18, 19</span></p>

ISight it to the death, with no backing down, no giving in, no retreating. Fight it at the source, kill its roots, which are in the mind and heart. Do more than put gossip from your mind; nut good thoughts in its place. Jesus showed that when an unclean spirit was ousted from a man it would return with seven others if the man did not become filled with Jehovah’s spirit. So crowd out evil gossip with good thoughts.

In these critical days life is very hollow for the greater portion of mankind. What is responsible for their hollowness of life? Bible prophecy answers: “Men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, . . . having no natural affection, . . . lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.” Mankind is starving for life because it is starving for love. Yes, “he who does not love remains in death.” And this loveless, murderous old world, by abiding in death until Armageddon, will be forever destroyed there. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15 </span><span class="font3">31, 32</span></p>

While we are not the wealthiest of people we are not afraid to spend what we have in the right cause and we know how to get the most out of what we spend. Above all, it demonstrates that Jehovah’s spirit is upon his organization and there is nothing needed that can not and will not be done.

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s scales are true balances, not tilted by favoritism, and on them he weighs the impulses that motivate a man’s thinking or speaking or acting. A man’s love for himself makes him partial to himself and to him his ways seem clean, but Jehovah’s impartial scales test the genuineness of the motives behind the thought or word or deed. So be careful, and not too sure you are clean while viewing others as soiled. When Jehovah reads his scales his eye is impartially merciful for all. Try to be impartially merciful when looking at yourself and at others, not partial to yourself and exacting of others. Jehovah in his love provides Christ's ransom to cover all offenses of obedient persons. We should cultivate the kind of love that will cover our brothers’ offenses toward us.

What matters here is that the appointment comes from the recognized governing body, and so the signature of the appointment letter or form must show that it comes from such authoritative body. The signature’s being handwritten or stamped does not alter the matter or weaken or void the appointment. If the stamp is that of the governing body and is imprinted by the one who has the authority to use that stamp, then the appointment is authoritative and binding. This may be true even though rubber-stamping an appointment letter or form may not be so ceremonial or impressive as a literal formalistic laying of men’s hands upon the head of an appointed person.

The patriotic worldlings have resented this but the sheeplike people of all nations appreciated this illustration of the supremacy of Jehovah’s worship. From the temple remnant they learn to put Jehovah’s worship topmost in their lives. They accept his judgments and decisions from his supreme temple. They leave the Devil's world and its religio-political mountains and ascend the mountain of Jehovah’s house to worship him there on this beautiful elevation above this debased world and its demon worship.

We must sound the warning, assist them to speedy flight, becoming as signposts along the way announcing “Refuge! Refuge!” and pointing to the only place where to find it now. Everyone must serve in this lifesaving manner in his own territory. If we fail in our duty, then our present place of refuge will not benefit us at the crucial time, for the blood of those who might have escaped through proper warning will be required at our hand by Jehovah.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—John 7:16, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How wonderful it must have been and still is to hear God communicate directly from his own mouth! In time the Word was sent by God to earth to testify to many things, one of which concerned the matter of communication of truth from the throne of heaven. John confirms that the first stage in the line of communication is through Jesus as the Word, saying: “No man has seen God at any time; the only-begotten god who is in the bosom position with the Father is the one that has explained him.” This logically makes Jesus the second-greatest authority. He has had the longest experience of any in receiving orders of Jehovah and putting them into effect. In his long career of communication he has had a flawless reputation of faithfully transmitting every order of God, never varying it with his own view or originating his own orders contrary to God’s wishes. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font3"> 12-14</span></p>

Spiritual-mindedness is opposed to carnal-mindedness. To be carnally-minded means to be thinking of the things of this world, to be carrying on the wicked practices of the Devil’s organization. By far the majority of the people in the world are interested in only the things that pertain to themselves and not how they can benefit others. This is the Gentiles’ or selfish way of looking at it. In his discussion with his apostles Jesus told us that there was a far greater thing to think about, the spiritual thing, the Kingdom. Jehovah God knows our needs and he can care for them. He does not want us to be worried about them all the time. He wants us to concentrate on the greater thing, his kingdom that will mean life to men of good will.

These should help us to dispel the spirit of complaint and maintain a spirit of humility and meekness with complete devotion to his organization. The way to maintain happiness is to avoid complaining, to edify our brothers and to build up the congregation. To prevail through all our troubles we have only to accept Jehovah’s instructions, carry them out in a joyful frame of mind and dispel the attitude of grumbling about what we are to do. Jehovah gives us the instructions we need to prosper and to be content.

<p><span class="font3">According to the opinion of many scientists “every experience of our lives is recorded and preserved.” How does this fit in with the assertion by some that we are “leaky vessels,” which they base on Hebrews 2: 1, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">King James Version,</span><span class="font3"> margin? The New World Translation presents the proper thought. It is not the truths we hear that run out as though we were leaky vessels, but it is we ourselves who are in danger of slipping or drifting away if we do not pay close, unusual attention to what we learn. So our minds are not leaky vessels, but the information may become buried and lost to us as far as remembering it for use if we have not paid “more than the usual attention” to it when learning it. It will be hard to dig out and will call for strenuous mental effort by a diligent probing of the memory.

To labor to heap up material treasure is as vain as idleness is foolish. We should work for our necessary food and drink and for the sheer enjoyment of work. Such work is good, not vanity, but worthwhile and it is our lot in the life God has given us. Solomon did not ignore Jehovah nor recommend a life given over to fleshly indulgence without the thought of God or the future. There is to be an accounting. We are to work in fear of Jehovah because he will finally judge our works, even the hidden ones, even the motives within our heart. Our work is to do good, in harmony with his commands. Such work is not vanity. It does not perish with us, but continues in God’s remembrance and will gain us a favorable judgment. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 6:33, RS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The basis of true material prosperity is spiritual prosperity. This provable truth rests upon the fact that the one unfailing source of prosperity is Jehovah, the richest and happiest Person in the universe, and who, though spirit, is the Creator of all material things. He controls the production of all things material. The source of all true and lasting material prosperity must therefore be spiritual. Spiritual prosperity means prospering in our relations with Jehovah. He puts spiritual prosperity ahead of material prosperity as being more important, for the former is the basis of the latter even as Jesus showed. Pursuit of material prosperity may lead to enjoying many things of this earth selfishly for a long or a short time, but pursuit of the spiritual prosperity will lead to unending life in an endless world of prosperity in union with the immortal Source of it all, Jehovah. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font3"> 2, 3</span></p>

No, but today the active membership of the New World society at Jehovah’s temple has swelled to 042,929. It is Jehovah’s happy pleasure in this day to make these antitypical foreigners, these other sheep, “joyful in my house of prayer.” Yes, the holy mountain of Jehovah’s house rings with their outcries of happiness as they offer through his High Priest their spiritual burnt offerings and sacrifices upon his altar and as he evidences acceptance of these by blessing them in his service, his witness work. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 43</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Stand therefore, . . . having shod gour feet with the equipment of the gospel of peace; above all talcing the shield of faith.—Eph. 6:1-4-16, RS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With your feet shod with the equipment of the good news of peace, you will avoid responsibility for any of the turmoil of this world and you will not be gathered by the unseen demons to the side of the rulers of this entire inhabited earth at Armageddon for a suicidal war against God Almighty and his reigning King Jesus Christ. You will promote peace and reconciliation with God. Taking up the large shield of faith, you will be able to stop and extinguish all the flaming faith-destroying missiles shot out by the enemy and guard yourself against the faithless course of this world. By your faith-inspired obedience to God and his King Jesus Christ you will overcome this world and keep on pleasing God, who rewards those who hold fast their faith with life. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font3"> 42, 43</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Is it not written, “Mg house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations&quot;?—Mark</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">11:11, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this short remaining time till Armageddon it is the due right of the non-Israelite sheep from all nations to come up to the exalted house of the God of Jacob to worship Jehovah there and gain salvation. Instead of doing anything to ‘turn them aside from their right,’ let us do everything in obedience to God to direct and help them to their right. It is now the decree of Jehovah that his holy temple shall be a house of prayer for all peoples, for all the nations. At the temple inauguration on Mount Moriah and after Jehovah came to the temple and filled it with the glory cloud of his presence, King Solomon prayed that it might be such a house of international prayer, for in his seven petitions Solomon included one for the foreigner that comes from a distant land by reason of Jehovah’s name. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font3"> 41</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Monday, December 31</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.—Hab. 2:1-4,</span><span class="font3"> AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Men may remove Jehovah’s name from translations of the Scriptures, but they cannot remove Jehovah the Rock from his position of Universal Sovereign. And they have not been able to and never will be able to silence the Kingdom message and destroy its preachers. It is Jehovah the Unconquerable that leads us. It is in his triumphal procession that he leads us in company with his King of kings and Lord of lords, the winning King and the winning Lord. The message of Jehovah’s kingdom has already gained grand triumphs throughout the earth because He backs up and blesses the preaching of this “good news” by his witnesses in all the inhabited earth. It will continue to triumph under his protection and guidance of us until Armageddon, when his own triumphant act of vindication will cause all the earth’s atmosphere to be permeated with the sweet, life-giving odor of the knowledge of God for every praiser of Jehovah that then breathes.

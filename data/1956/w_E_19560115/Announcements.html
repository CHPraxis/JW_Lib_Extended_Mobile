<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">On reading the title to this short article do you say: “I am poor, or have just a modest income, so how can I be wealthy in good works?” The answer is a simple one. Regardless of a person’s circumstances he can be wealthy in good works by acquiring a real appreciation of the truth about God’s wonderful kingdom and then helping others also to learn about it.

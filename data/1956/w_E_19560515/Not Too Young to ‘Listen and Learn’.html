<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That children at an early age can listen and learn is apparent from the following heart-warming experience told by a missionary in Korea: “About two months ago three little boys (ages about 5, 7 and 9) began attending our meetings. They came every time and soon all three had their own Bible and <em>Watchtower. </em>As each scripture was cited they would bury their little noses in their Bible and follow along. At first none of the brothers seemed to know anything about them. I tried several times to talk to them but just couldn’t get a response. Finally we learned the circumstances. The boys’ parents had been killed during the war and since that time they have been shifting mostly for themselves. They live together in a tiny place and the eldest is the ‘mother.’ They are handsome youngsters but don’t look like children at all. This is common here where so many have been robbed of their babyhood by the war. Last Thursday evening the seven-year-old one gave his first talk at the theocratic ministry school. He looked spick and span, as neat as a pin, and the other two appeared very proud of him. He read like a bullet, as is typical here, and to hear the words of life come from that dear little heart brought a tear or two. After the meeting I spoke to the three of them and told them how pleased Jehovah was to welcome them to his ‘family,’ and for the first time I saw them smile.”</p>

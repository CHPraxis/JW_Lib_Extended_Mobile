STUDY ARTICLES
▪  “Be Vigilant With a View to Prayers”
As the end of Satan’s wicked system of things nears, it is imperative that we not fall asleep spiritually. This article discusses how being vigilant with a view to prayers can help us to stay awake.

▪  How Can We Maintain “a Waiting Attitude”?
In this article, find out what we can learn from the patience of the prophet Micah. Examine what events will signal the end of our period of waiting for Jehovah to act against this wicked system. Also take note of how we can show appreciation for God’s patience.

▪  Seven Shepherds, Eight Dukes—What They Mean for Us Today
The account of Sennacherib’s attack on Jerusalem in Hezekiah’s day contains practical lessons for us. The material in this article has special significance for those entrusted with shepherding the congregation.

▪  Obey Jehovah’s Shepherds
▪  Shepherds, Imitate the Greatest Shepherds
The first of these two articles discusses the way in which Jehovah and Jesus shepherd their earthly flock today and points out how the sheep ought to respond to their care. The second article analyzes the attitude that congregation elders should strive to adopt as they serve as undershepherds of the flock.

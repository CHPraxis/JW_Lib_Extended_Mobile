How Do You View the Future?

Will our world . . .
           stay the same?

           get worse?

           get better?





WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS

“God . . . will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”​—Revelation 21:3, 4, New World Translation.



WHAT THAT CAN MEAN FOR YOU

Meaningful and satisfying work.​—Isaiah 65:21-23.
No more sickness or suffering of any kind.​—Isaiah 25:8; 33:24.
A happy, unending life with family and friends.​—Psalm 37:11, 29.








CAN WE REALLY BELIEVE WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS?

Yes, for at least two reasons:
            God has the ability to fulfill the promise. In the Bible, Jehovah God alone is called “the Almighty,” for he has unlimited power. (Revelation 15:3) So he is fully able to keep his promise to change our world for the better. As the Bible says, “with God all things are possible.”​—Matthew 19:26.

            God has the desire to fulfill the promise. For example, Jehovah has a longing to restore life to people who have died.​—Job 14:14, 15.
The Bible also shows that God’s Son, Jesus, healed the sick. Why did he do so? Because he wanted to. (Mark 1:40, 41) Jesus perfectly reflected his Father’s personality by his desire to help those in need.​—John 14:9.
So we can be sure that both Jehovah and Jesus want to help us to enjoy a happy future!​—Psalm 72:12-14; 145:16; 2 Peter 3:9.

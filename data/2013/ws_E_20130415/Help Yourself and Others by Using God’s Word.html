<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The apostle Paul made it clear that God’s Word is very important. He wrote to Timothy: “Continue in the things that you learned.” “The things” that Timothy had learned were Bible truths that gave him faith in the good news. What we learn from the Bible can make our faith stronger too.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Jesus told the nation of Israel: “I am sending forth to you prophets and wise men and public <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>instructors.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:23:34-40:23:34" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 23:34</a>) Jesus was speaking about his disciples. He had taught them to use the Scriptures in their ministry. At Pentecost in the year 33, the apostle Peter gave a talk to a large crowd in Jerusalem. He quoted from several parts of the Hebrew Scriptures. When the people heard how Peter explained these verses, many felt very sorry for the bad things they had done. They repented over their sins and asked God to forgive them. On that day, about three thousand of them became Christians.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:37-44:2:41" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 2:37-41</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>We can also learn from the apostle Paul, who preached the good news outside of Jerusalem. In the Macedonian city of Thessalonica, he spoke to Jews worshipping in a synagogue. On three Sabbaths in a row, Paul “reasoned with them from the Scriptures” to prove that it was necessary for Christ to suffer and to be resurrected. Some of those Jews became believers, and so did many Greeks.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:17:1-44:17:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 17:1-4</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Many people today notice that we are able to use the Bible to prove what we teach. One of our sisters in Switzerland read a scripture in the ministry, and the householder asked her which church she belonged to. The sister said that she and the sister with her were Jehovah’s Witnesses. The man said that he should have realized this because Jehovah’s Witnesses are the only ones who would come to his house and read the Bible.</p>

If you are assigned to give talks or other meeting parts, use specific scriptures.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:1:13-54:1:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:13</a>) Before he became a Christian, Paul had treated Christians very badly.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>When the Bible talks about “setting things straight,” it means to make something good or correct. Sometimes we have to set things straight when someone misunderstands what we have said or done. For example, the Jewish religious leaders complained that Jesus was kind to “tax collectors and sinners.” Jesus corrected them by saying: “Persons in health do not need a physician, but the ailing do. Go, then, and learn what this means, ‘I want mercy, and not sacrifice.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:9:11-40:9:13" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 9:11-13</a>) Jesus also corrected people’s thinking about who God really is. He taught people patiently and kindly that Jehovah is “a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:34:6-2:34:6" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Exodus 34:6</a>) As a result, many humble people put faith in the good news.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>We should imitate Jesus when we try to help others.

The Scriptures do not give us the right to speak to someone without caring about his feelings. If we criticize someone harshly, our words can be like “the stabs of a sword.” We will cause him pain and will probably not help him at all.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:12:18-20:12:18" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Proverbs 12:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>How can we be patient and kind when we use the Bible to set things straight? Imagine a married couple who argue frequently. They ask an elder for help. He will not take sides with either one of them, and he will not give his own opinion about their problems. Instead, he uses Bible principles to help them to understand how they can stop arguing. He might use the principles discussed in <a class="xt" data-xtid="13" href="jwpub://p/E:1101996022/1-38">chapter 3 of the book <em>The Secret of Family Happiness</em></a><em>. </em>As they discuss these principles, the husband and wife may realize that they need to make some changes. Later, the elder will ask the couple if the situation is improving, and he will offer more help if it is needed.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>How can parents help their children to set things straight? Imagine that your teenage daughter has a new friend. But you think that the new friend makes bad choices. First, you should find out more about the friend. Then, if you are still worried about your daughter, you can talk with her. You could use the Bible principles found in the book <em>Questions Young People Ask<wbr />—Answers That Work, </em>Volume 2. Then you should make sure to spend extra time with her. You could pay attention to her attitude when she is in field service or is spending time with the family. If you are patient and kind as you talk to your daughter, she will know that you love her and are interested in her. This will help her to follow your counsel about her friends and avoid making bad choices in her own life.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>17. </strong>Why should we be grateful to accept discipline?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>The Bible says that we do not usually enjoy discipline. In fact, it can be very difficult to accept. But when we accept it and apply it, discipline can make us righteous. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:11-58:12:11" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:11</a>) Most Christian adults who were raised in the truth say that the discipline from their parents helped them. And when the elders give us discipline from Jehovah, we can stay on the way to life.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:4:13-20:4:13" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:13</a>.</p>

(b) When elders are mild and give discipline with love, how may a sinner react?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>How can elders and parents <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>learn to give good discipline? Jehovah has told us that we need to give discipline “in righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>) This means that we need to use Bible principles when we discipline others. One important Bible principle is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:18:13-20:18:13" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:13</a>: “When anyone is replying to a matter before he hears it, that is foolishness on his part and a humiliation.” So when someone tells the elders that a brother or a sister has committed a serious sin, the elders should make sure that they know all the facts before they give discipline. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:13:14-5:13:14" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 13:14</a>) Then they can discipline “in righteousness.”</p>

</div>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>The Bible also tells the elders to discipline others “with mildness.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:2:24-55:2:26" data-bid="27-1" class="b"><strong>2 Timothy 2:24-26</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>It is true that a person’s sin might make others think badly about Jehovah or might hurt other people. But if an elder gets angry while he counsels that person, the elder will not be able to help him. If an elder imitates God and speaks kindly when correcting a sinner, the sinner may choose to repent.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:2:4-45:2:4" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Romans 2:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Parents too must apply Bible principles when they discipline their children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:4</a>) For example, what should a father do if somebody tells him that his son has done something wrong? The father should make sure that he knows all the facts before he punishes his son.

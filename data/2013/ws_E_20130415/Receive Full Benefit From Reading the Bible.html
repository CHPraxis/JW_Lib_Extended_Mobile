<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb">AN ELDERLY sister said, “I thank Jehovah every morning for helping me to understand the Bible.” Even though she has read the Bible more than 40 times, she still reads it. A younger sister wrote that reading the Bible has helped her to know that Jehovah is real and to have a closer relationship with him. She said, “I have never been happier in my life!”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The apostle Peter taught us that we need to love the truth from God’s Word. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:2-60:2:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:2</a>) When we study the Bible and apply what it teaches, we can have a clean conscience and a purpose in life. The Bible’s teachings can help us to have good friendships with others who also love and serve the true God. These are good reasons for us to “delight in the law of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:7:22-45:7:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 7:22</a>) How else can Bible study help us?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>The more you learn about Jehovah and his Son, the more your love for them and for other people will grow. Also, the Bible will teach you how God will save righteous people when he destroys the wicked. In your ministry, you have good news to tell people. And you can be sure that Jehovah will help you as you teach others what you have learned.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>What does it mean to read the Bible “in an undertone”?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jehovah wants us to take time to think about and understand what we read in the Bible. He told Joshua: “This book of the law should not <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>depart from your <strong>mouth, </strong>and you must in an <strong>undertone </strong>read in it day and night.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joshua 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:1:2-19:1:2" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Psalm 1:2</a>) Does this mean that we have to read the whole Bible out loud or whisper as we read it? No. It means that you should read slowly enough to think about what you are reading. This will help you to focus on verses that are useful and encouraging to you. When you find an encouraging statement or story, read it slowly, maybe even saying the words quietly as you read. Then what you are reading can really reach your heart. Why is this important? Because when you truly understand God’s counsel, you will want to live by it.</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote"><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sc">Jehovah wants us to take time to think about and understand what we read in the Bible</p>
</div>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>5-7. </strong>Give examples of how reading God’s Word slowly and carefully might help you to (a) obey God’s laws; (b) speak kindly to others; (c) trust in Jehovah even during difficult times.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>When we are reading Bible books that we think are difficult to understand, it can be helpful to read slowly and carefully so that we can think about what we are reading. For example, think of a young brother who is carefully reading the book of Hosea. In chapter 4, he stops to think after reading verses 11 to 13. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/28:4:11-28:4:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Hosea 4:11-13</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Why does he focus on these verses? Lately, he has been tempted at school to do immoral things. But as he thinks about these verses, he says to himself: ‘Jehovah sees the bad things people do even when they are alone. I do not want to offend him.’ The brother decides that he will make sure that he obeys Jehovah’s moral laws.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>As a second example, think of a sister who is carefully reading the book of Joel and comes to chapter 2, verse 13. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/29:2:13-29:2:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Joel 2:13</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>This verse makes her realize that she should imitate Jehovah, who is “gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness.” She decides to make some changes because she sometimes speaks in a hurtful and angry way to her husband and to others.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>As a third example, think of a brother who has a wife and children. He has lost his job and worries about how he can take care of his family. He carefully reads the book of Nahum. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/34:1:7-34:1:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Nahum 1:7</a>, he reads that Jehovah knows those who trust in him and will protect them “in the day of distress.” This helps the brother to realize <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>that Jehovah loves him and his family, and now he does not worry so much. Then he carefully reads verse 15. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/34:1:15-34:1:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Nahum 1:15</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>He realizes that he can prove that he trusts in Jehovah by preaching the good news even during difficult times. So while he keeps on looking for a new job, he will use more time during the week for the field ministry.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>Briefly explain something that you have learned from your Bible reading.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The helpful examples we just discussed are from Bible books that some may think are difficult to understand. But when you find encouraging verses in these books, you will want to keep reading them. They can comfort us and make us wise. All the books of the Bible can help us in the same way. God’s Word is like a mine where many diamonds are buried deep in the ground. While you read the whole Bible, keep looking to find the “diamonds,” or the valuable direction and encouragement that it contains!</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>What can we do to understand the Bible better?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>It is important to read the Bible each day. But you should also make sure that you understand what you are reading. So do research in our publications to learn about the people, places, and events that you read about. If you are not sure how you should apply something that you read in the Bible, you could ask an elder or another mature brother or sister for help. A Christian in Bible times needed help to understand the truth more correctly. His name was Apollos.</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote"><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sc">Make sure that you understand what you are reading</p>
</div>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>10, 11. </strong>(a) How did Apollos receive help to be a better minister of the good news? (b) What can we learn from the example of Apollos? (See the box “Is What You Are Teaching Up-to-Date?”)</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Apollos was a Jewish Christian who knew the Scriptures well and who was a zealous minister. The book of Acts says that he preached about Jesus. But Apollos did not realize that Jesus had taught his disciples something new about baptism. A Christian couple named Priscilla and Aquila heard Apollos teaching in Ephesus, and they explained “the way of God more correctly to him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:18:24-44:18:26" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 18:24-26</a>) How did this benefit Apollos?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>When Apollos went to Achaia, he continued preaching. He helped those who believed the good news by using the Scriptures to prove publicly that the Jews were wrong and that Jesus was the Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:18:27-44:18:28" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 18:27, 28</a>) Now that Apollos understood the meaning of Christian baptism, he “greatly helped” new ones to make progress in the truth. What can we learn from this? We can follow Apollos’ example by working hard to understand what we read in the Bible. But we should also humbly and gratefully accept any suggestions we receive that could make us better teachers.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>16. </strong>(a) How did the Beroeans benefit from reading the Scriptures each day? (b) Why is it important for us to read the Bible each day?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>The Jews who lived in Beroea carefully read the Scriptures each day. When Paul preached to them, they compared what he said with what they knew from the Scriptures. Many of them realized that he was teaching the truth and “became believers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:17:10-44:17:12" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 17:10-12</a>) From this, we can learn that reading the Bible daily can help us to build strong faith in Jehovah. We must have strong faith if we want to survive into God’s new world.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:1-58:11:1" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>17, 18. </strong>(a) How do strong faith and love protect our figurative heart? (b) How does hope protect us?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Paul explained that we need faith, love, and hope. He said: “As for us who belong to the day, let us keep our senses and have on the breastplate of faith and love and as a helmet the hope of salvation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:5:8-52:5:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>) A breastplate was a type of shield <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>worn over a soldier’s chest to protect his heart. In a similar way, our figurative heart needs to be protected. When a Christian builds strong faith in God’s promises and has strong love for Him and for others, he protects his figurative heart. He will do all he can to stay in God’s favor.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Paul also mentioned a figurative helmet that we need to wear. It is “the hope of salvation.” Soldiers in Bible times used a helmet to protect their head. When we build strong hope in Jehovah’s ability to save us, our hope can protect our thinking. Our strong hope gives us every reason to ignore apostates and their wicked speech, which can quickly spread in the congregation like a disease. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:2:16-55:2:19" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:16-19</a>) Our hope will also make us strong and give us a reason to avoid bad conduct.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">IT IS amazing to think that we are part of a huge universal organization. The visions we read about in <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:1:1-26:1:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezekiel chapter 1 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:7:1-27:7:28" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Daniel chapter 7</a> wonderfully describe how Jehovah is working to make his purpose come true. Jesus is leading the part of Jehovah’s organization that is on earth. He is directing it to do the preaching work, to instruct and encourage those who do this work, and to help others become worshippers of Jehovah. This moves us to trust in Jehovah’s organization.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Are you following the example of the organization by staying busy in God’s service? Maybe you feel that you have begun to lose some of your zeal. This happened to Christians in the first century. The apostle Paul had to remind them of the zealous example of Jesus. Paul said that this would help them not to “get tired and give out.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:3-58:12:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:3</a>) In the last article, we discussed the wonderful work Jehovah’s organization is doing today. Just as the example of Christ encouraged Christians in the first century, the example of Jehovah’s organization can help us today to endure in God’s service and to keep our zeal.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Why can we say that meetings have always been an important part of true worship?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Meetings have always been very important for Jehovah’s servants. In heaven, Jehovah meets with the angels. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:22:19-11:22:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Kings 22:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:1:6-18:1:6" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Job 1:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:2:1-18:2:1" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:7:10-27:7:10" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Daniel 7:10</a>) In ancient times, God told the Israelites to meet together “in order that they may listen and in order that they may learn.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:31:10-5:31:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 31:10-12</a>) In the first century, Jews met regularly in special meeting places to read from the Scriptures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:16-42:4:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 4:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:21-44:15:21" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Acts 15:21</a>) Meetings continued to be important when the Christian congregation was formed, and they are still very important in our worship. True Christians “consider one another to incite to love and fine works.” We need to keep on “encouraging one another,” especially because we live in the last days.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How can we encourage one another at our meetings?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>One important way we can encourage one another at our meetings is by giving comments. For example, we can answer the question for the paragraph, comment on a scripture, or give a brief experience that shows how Bible principles help us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:22:22-19:22:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 22:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:40:9-19:40:9" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 40:9</a>) All the comments we hear at the meetings, from both older and younger ones, encourage us very much. This is true no matter how long we have been in the truth.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What are some ways our meetings help us?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Our meetings, assemblies, and conventions help us in many other ways. For example, they help us to have courage to preach even when people in our territory oppose us or do not want to listen to us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:4:23-44:4:23" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 4:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:4:31-44:4:31" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 31</a>) The talks and other parts based on the Bible strengthen our faith.

You probably remember a time when you read a publication and thought, ‘That is exactly what I needed! It is as if Jehovah had that written just for me!’ There is a reason you felt that way. Jehovah uses the publications to teach us and direct us.

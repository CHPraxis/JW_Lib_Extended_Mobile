<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">According to the Bible, all humans are sinners. We inherited the tendency to sin from the first man, Adam. Thus, we sometimes do bad things and may later regret what we did. God’s Son, Jesus Christ, paid for our sins by dying for us. His ransom sacrifice made forgiveness possible. It is a gift from God.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:23-45:3:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 3:23, 24</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some people have committed gross sins and wonder whether God can forgive them. Happily, the Word of God says: “The blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from <em>all </em>sin.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:1:7-62:1:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 1:7</a>) Jehovah willingly forgives even serious sins if we have a proper, repentant attitude.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:1:18-23:1:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 1:18</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">If we want Jehovah God to forgive us, we need to learn about him<wbr />—to understand his ways, his advice, and his requirements. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) Jehovah generously forgives those who repent of their misconduct and try to change.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 3:19</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Gaining God’s approval is not too difficult for us. Jehovah understands our weaknesses. He is merciful and kind. Does not his loving-kindness make you want to learn more about how to please him?<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:103:13-19:103:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 103:13, 14</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">DO YOU find the question, “Is God cruel?” shocking? Some do, but a lot of people today wonder whether God is cruel<wbr />—or they assume that he is. Why?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some who survive natural disasters ask: “Why does God allow these things to happen? Is he indifferent? Or is he cruel?”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Others are similarly troubled when reading the Bible. They come upon such accounts as the one about Noah and the Flood, and they wonder, ‘Why would a loving God put all those people to death? Is he cruel?’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Do such questions occur to you at times? Or do you find yourself unable to give an answer to those who wonder if God is cruel? In either case, consider a different question that may help.</p>

<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>WHY DO WE HATE CRUELTY?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Simply put, we hate cruelty because we have a sense of right and wrong. We differ greatly from animals in that respect. Our Creator made us “in his image.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:27-1:1:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27</a>) What does that mean? He gave us the capacity to reflect his qualities and moral standards, his sense of right and wrong. Consider this: If we received our sense of right and wrong from God and we tend to hate cruelty, does that not suggest that God hates it too?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The Bible confirms such logic, for in the Bible, God assures us: “My ways are higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:9-23:55:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:9</a>) If we were to judge God to be cruel, would we not be stating the opposite<wbr />—in effect saying that our ways are higher than his? It would surely be wise to gather more facts before taking such a stand. Perhaps we should ask, not whether God is cruel, but why some of his actions may <em>appear </em>to be cruel. To help us, let us consider what “cruel” really means.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">When we call someone cruel, we judge his motives. A cruel person is one who <em>enjoys </em>seeing others suffer or who is indifferent to their distress. Thus, a father who disciplines his son because he enjoys hurting his son’s feelings is cruel. But a father who disciplines his son to instruct or protect him is good. Motives are easily misunderstood, as you well know if anyone has ever misjudged you.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Let us consider two of the reasons why some think of God as cruel<wbr />—the natural disasters we see today and the divine judgments we read about in the Bible. Do the facts really show that God is cruel?</p>

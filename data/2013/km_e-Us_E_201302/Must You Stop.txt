Must You Stop?
When sharing in field service, some publishers customarily stop at a certain time, perhaps at noon. Of course, the circumstances of some may require that they end their field ministry at a specific time. But do you discontinue your preaching simply because others in the group do or because it is the custom in your area to stop at a certain time? Could you extend your ministry for a few more minutes and engage in some form of public witnessing, such as street witnessing? Can you make a return visit or two on the way home? Think of how much good you will accomplish if you find just one interested person at home again or if you place just one more set of magazines with a passerby! If we do not have to stop, staying out a few minutes longer is a simple way to increase our “sacrifice of praise.”—Heb. 13:15.

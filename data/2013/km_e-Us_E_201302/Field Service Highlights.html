The total number of publishers increased to 523 in Bermuda, 332 in the Turks and Caicos Islands, and 1,203,642 in the United States.  Also, when compared with the same month during the previous year, the number of regular pioneers increased by 10.4 percent in the Bahamas, 4.6 percent in Bermuda, 36.1 percent in the Turks and Caicos Islands, and 5 percent in the United States.  Clearly, Jehovah’s people are “zealous for fine works.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:2:14-56:2:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Titus 2:14</a>.</p>

BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



Why is world peace so elusive?






Only a government that can change people’s hearts will bring world peace




The Bible points to two main reasons. First, although humans have accomplished marvelous things, they are not created with the ability to direct their own steps. Second, human schemes have failed because “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one,” Satan the Devil. Thus, human efforts have not been able to bring world peace.—Read Jeremiah 10:23; 1 John 5:19.
Human self-interest and ambition have also made world peace elusive. Only a world government that can teach people to love what is right and care for one another will bring world peace.—Read Isaiah 32:17; 48:18, 22.



Who will establish peace on earth?

Almighty God has promised to establish a single government to rule over all mankind. It will replace human governments. (Daniel 2:44) God’s Son, Jesus, will rule as the Prince of Peace. He will eliminate evil from all the earth and will teach people the way of peace.—Read Isaiah 9:6, 7; 11:4, 9.
Already, under Jesus’ direction, millions worldwide are using God’s Word, the Bible, to teach people how to be at peace with others. Soon, world peace will be a reality.—Read Isaiah 2:3, 4; 54:13.

How can marriage be happy?

The Bible’s advice on building a happy marriage works because it comes from the Originator of marriage, Jehovah God. It teaches us to build personal qualities that can make marriage happy and warns about attitudes that can ruin marriage. It also teaches communication skills that enhance happiness in marriage.—Read Colossians 3:8-10, 12-14.
Husbands and wives should honor and respect each other. When both accept the roles that God has assigned them in marriage, they can be happy.—Read Colossians 3:18, 19.



What makes a marriage last?

Married couples can stay together if they love each other. God teaches us how to love. He and his Son, Jesus, are perfect examples of self-sacrificing love.—Read 1 John 4:7, 8, 19.
When husbands and wives respect marriage as an arrangement by God, they will stay together. God created marriage to be a permanent union between a man and a woman so that families would be secure. Marriage can last because God made men and women to complement each other physically and emotionally. He also made them in his image, with the ability to imitate his love.—Read Genesis 1:27; 2:18, 24.

</header>
<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Imagine living in a world free of suffering<wbr />—a world without crime, warfare, sickness, and natural disasters. Imagine waking up every morning without having to worry about discrimination, oppression, or economic uncertainty. Does all of this sound too good to be true? Granted, no human or man-made organization can bring about such conditions. But God has promised to do away with all causes of human suffering, including those discussed in the preceding article. Note the following promises from God’s Word, the Bible:</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">“The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin. And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">The Kingdom of God is a heavenly government. Its chosen Ruler, Jesus Christ, will take the place of all human rulership and will ensure that God’s will is done not only in heaven but also here on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>) This government will not be replaced by any human government because it is “the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.” Lasting peace will be assured.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:1:11-61:1:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Peter 1:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">False religion will be exposed as the work of the Devil and will be eliminated from the earth. Gone will be all religious bigotry and bloodshed. This will allow all lovers of the “living and true God” to worship him in “one faith” and “with spirit and truth.” What peace and unity!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:1:9-52:1:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 1:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:5-49:4:5" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ephesians 4:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:23-43:4:23" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> John 4:23</a>.</p>

There will <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>no longer be any suffering because “God himself will be with them” and will erase “every tear from their eyes.” Human imperfection and suffering will soon be a thing of the past; “the righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 37:29</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><strong>Peace and righteousness will prevail forever: </strong>Under Christ’s rulership, lawlessness will be a thing of the past. How do we know that? Because Jesus is able to read hearts, and he will use that ability to judge between the righteous and the wicked. Those who refuse to change their wicked ways will not be allowed to live in God’s new world.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:9-19:37:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 37:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:11:3-23:11:4" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Isaiah 11:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:65:20-23:65:20" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 65:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:9:4-40:9:4" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> Matthew 9:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">We have considered just a few of the many Bible prophecies that point to the wonderful time to come.

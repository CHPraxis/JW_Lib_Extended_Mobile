STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Jehovah’s Reminders Are Trustworthy
▪  Make Jehovah’s Reminders the Exultation of Your Heart
Jehovah has always used reminders to guide and direct his people. What is included in those reminders? The first article highlights why we can trust God’s reminders. The second discusses three ways we can cultivate unshakable trust in Jehovah’s reminders.

▪  Have You Been Transformed?
▪  Make Personal Decisions Wisely
Both our upbringing and our environment powerfully influence our views and choices. How can we make sure that our decisions are in harmony with God’s will? And what can help us to act in accord with what we decided? These articles will help us to make an honest self-examination in these areas.

▪  Pioneering Strengthens Our Relationship With God
We will consider eight ways that a Christian’s relationship with Jehovah can be strengthened by pioneering. If you are pioneering now, what will help you to continue despite challenges? If you would like to pioneer and enjoy the resulting blessings, what can you do?

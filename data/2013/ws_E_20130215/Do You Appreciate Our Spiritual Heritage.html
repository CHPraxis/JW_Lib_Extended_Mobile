<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb">AT A meeting of the governing body in Jerusalem in the year 49 of our Common Era, James said: “Symeon [Peter] has related thoroughly how God for the first time turned his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name. And with this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written, ‘After these things I shall return and rebuild the booth of David that is fallen down; and I shall rebuild its ruins and erect it again, in order that those who remain of the men may earnestly seek Jehovah, together with people of all the nations, people who are called by my name, says Jehovah, who is doing these things, known from of old.’”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:13-44:15:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 15:13-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>“The booth of David” means the kings that came from David’s family. It had “fallen” when the last king of Judah, Zedekiah, was removed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/30:9:11-30:9:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Amos 9:11</a>) But that prophecy explained that God would “build it up” again. This meant that there would be another king, David’s descendant Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:21:27-26:21:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezekiel 21:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:29-44:2:36" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Acts 2:29-36</a>) James showed that this prophecy also foretold that Jews and Gentiles would be anointed to be kings with Jesus in heaven. These anointed ones and millions of Jesus’ “other sheep” preach about the truth.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>When the Jews were taken as captives to Babylon, it was clear that “the booth of David” <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>had fallen.

In the same way that Jehovah’s people today remain faithful in Satan’s world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) Jehovah’s servants have a special heritage that helps them to remain faithful.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Today, we have the complete Bible as part of our heritage. The Jews in Babylon did not have the whole Bible. But they knew the Mosaic Law and its Ten Commandments. They knew “the songs of Zion” and many proverbs. They also knew about others in the past who had been faithful to Jehovah. The Jews cried because they wanted to return to their homeland, and they did not forget Jehovah. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:137:1-19:137:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 137:1-6</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>All of this helped them to draw close to Jehovah, even though they were surrounded by Babylon’s many false teachings and practices.</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What trinities did the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians believe in?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>In ancient times, gods were worshipped in trinities, that is, in groups of three gods. For example, one of the trinities that the Babylonians worshipped was a moon-god, a sun-god, and a goddess of fertility and war. The Egyptians worshipped families of three gods, with a father, a mother, and a son. Although these gods were a trinity, they were not always viewed as equals. One Egyptian trinity was the god Osiris, the goddess Isis, and their son Horus.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What is the Trinity? Why do Jehovah’s people not believe in it?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Today, Christendom also teaches that there is a Trinity, or one God <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>made up of the Father, the Son, and the holy spirit. But this belief makes it seem that Jehovah is not almighty. It would mean that he is only part of God. Jehovah’s people have been protected from this false teaching. We have learned that “Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:6:4-5:6:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>) Jesus repeated these words, and true Christians believe what Jesus said.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:12:29-41:12:29" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Mark 12:29</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Jesus told his followers to “make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19</a>) This means that a person who wants to be baptized as a true Christian and one of Jehovah’s Witnesses must believe that the Father, Jehovah, has authority over Jesus and that Jesus is God’s Son, who came to earth as a ransom. The person must not believe that the holy spirit is part of a Trinity. Instead, it is God’s active force. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:2-1:1:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 1:2</a>) It is part of our special heritage to know that the Trinity teaching dishonors God and is not true.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>People in Babylon believed not only in their gods but also in demons and spiritism. <em>The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia </em>says that the Babylonians believed that demons could make people sick.

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>(a) How did many Jews learn false ideas about demons? (b) How are we protected from the dangers of spiritism?</p>

Later, many Jews started to believe the Greek idea that the demons could be good. But God tells us that spiritism, or trying to contact the demons, is dangerous and wrong.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Similarly, many today who belong to false religions practice spiritism, as people did in ancient Babylon. That is why the Bible refers to all false religion on earth as Babylon the Great. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:18:21-66:18:24" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Revelation 18:21-24</a>) These false religions are truly like the religion of ancient Babylon because that is where the wrong ideas and bad practices came from. <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>Because of spiritism, idolatry, and other sins, Babylon the Great will soon be destroyed.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:18:1-66:18:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 18:1-5</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jehovah said that he “cannot put up with” spiritism. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:1:13-23:1:13" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:13</a>) In the 1800’s, many people practiced spiritism. So <em>Zion’s Watch Tower </em>of May 1885 discussed this matter. It said that ancient religions taught that the dead were alive and that the mythology of all cultures was based on the idea that the dead were in another world. It also said that the demons have pretended to be dead people who are trying to communicate with the living, and as a result, the demons have been able to influence the thinking and actions of many. The early booklet <em>What Say the Scriptures About Spiritism? </em>gave similar warnings, and so have our more recent publications.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Jehovah had told the Jews the truth about the dead. But when Greek rulers took control of Judah and Syria, they tried to make people accept Greek religion and culture. As a result, the Jews started to believe that an invisible part of the human survives the death of the body. They believed that this invisible part goes to another world and is tortured. The Greeks were not the first to believe in an invisible place of suffering. The book <em>The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria </em>says that the Babylonians believed that there was another world where strong gods and demons tortured people. It is clear that the Babylonians believed that part of the human survives the death of the body.</p>

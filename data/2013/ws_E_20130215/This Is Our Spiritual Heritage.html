<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb">JEHOVAH lives forever, and he has told us what we need to do so that we can live forever. Those instructions have not changed. The Bible says: “The saying of Jehovah endures forever.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:23-60:1:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:23-25</a>) We should be grateful that he has given us the Bible and its important message.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jehovah wants all of us to know his name. The Bible first mentions Jehovah’s name when describing how he made the heavens and the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:4-1:2:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 2:4</a>) God miraculously wrote his name several times on stone tablets when he gave Moses the Ten Commandments.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>We received our name at a convention in Columbus, Ohio, U.S.A., in 1931. The letters “JW” were printed on the convention program. One sister said that the brothers and sisters thought it meant “Just Wait” or “Just Watch,” and some even guessed “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Before that time we had been called Bible Students, but all in the audience during a special talk on July 26, 1931, agreed to be called Jehovah’s Witnesses from then on. That was a very exciting day, because we received a new name that came from the Bible. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:12-23:43:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 43:12</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>“I will never forget the tremendous shout and applause,” said one brother.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Another part of our heritage is the accurate and important information in the Bible about God’s servants in the past. For example, it tells us what happened to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They must have often talked with their families about the way of life that was acceptable to Jehovah. Discussions such as these must have helped Joseph to refuse to commit adultery with Potiphar’s wife. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:39:7-1:39:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 39:7-9</a>) In the first century, Christians shared information about God with one another. Paul told the congregation what Jesus had taught him about the Lord’s Evening Meal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:11:2-46:11:2" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 11:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:11:23-46:11:23" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 23</a>) All of this is in the Bible so that we can learn how to worship God. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:23-43:4:24" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>John 4:23, 24</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>The Bible can help all mankind, but as Jehovah’s people we should be especially grateful for it.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What promise is part of our heritage?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Jehovah helps his people in our day too. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:118:7-19:118:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 118:7</a>) We can read in our publications about what he is doing to protect them. This makes us feel safe, even if we are persecuted. <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>The Bible promises that any weapon, or effort to hurt us, will not be successful. And if others try to speak against God’s people in a court, they will later be proved wrong because our righteousness comes from Jehovah. This is part of our heritage. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:54:17-23:54:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 54:17</a>) Satan can do nothing that will hurt us forever.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Satan has tried to destroy the Bible, prevent people from knowing Jehovah’s name, and hide the truth.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>There have been many efforts to destroy the Bible, but Jehovah has protected it. The Catholic Church has tried to prevent people from reading the Bible. In the year 1229, a church council in France made a law that said that it was wrong for people to read the Bible in their own language. In Spain, in the year 1234, a similar law was made. Later, in the year 1559, Pope Paul IV included the Bible on a list of books that a person could not print or own without the permission of the church.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Even though people have tried to destroy the Bible, Jehovah has protected it. In about 1382, John Wycliffe produced the first Bible translation in English. William Tyndale also translated <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>the Bible into English. As a result, he was put to death in 1536. He was tied to a wooden pole, and he shouted: “Lord, open the eyes of the king of England.” Then he was strangled, and his body was burned.</p>
<div class="blockTxt rule"><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sc">The <em>New World Translation </em>uses God’s name and is clear and accurate</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>In 1535, Miles Coverdale also translated the Bible into English. Coverdale used Tyndale’s translation for part of his Bible, and he translated other parts from Latin and from Martin Luther’s Bible in German. In our day, we have the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. </em>We are happy to have this translation because it is clear, accurate, and easy to use in our preaching work. Neither Satan nor humans have been able to destroy the Bible.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>How has the <em>New World Translation </em>helped people to know Jehovah’s name?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Jehovah God has made sure that his name has never been removed from all Bibles. When the <em>New World Translation </em>was produced, the brothers made sure to use God’s name, Jehovah, in <strong>every </strong>place it was written in the original Bible books. The name is in the Hebrew Scriptures 6,973 times and in the Christian Greek Scriptures 237 times. The <em>New World Translation </em>is now available in over 116 languages. More than 178,545,862 copies have been printed.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>How do we know that people have known God’s name since mankind was first created?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>The first humans, Adam and Eve, knew Jehovah’s name and used it. Noah too used the name. He said: “Blessed be <strong>Jehovah, </strong>Shem’s God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:4:1-1:4:1" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Genesis 4:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:9:26-1:9:26" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 9:26</a>) God used his own name when speaking to people. He said: “I am Jehovah. That is my name; and to no one else shall I give my own glory.” God also stated: “I am Jehovah, and there is no one else. With the exception of me there is no God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:42:8-23:42:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:45:5-23:45:5" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 45:5</a>) Jehovah has made sure that people around the earth can know his name. We should feel honored to use the name Jehovah and to be his Witnesses! This is what the Bible means when it says: “In the name of our God we shall lift our banners.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:20:5-19:20:5" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 20:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>14. </strong>In addition to the Bible, where else does God’s name appear?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>God’s name does not appear only in the Bible. For example, it appears on the Moabite Stone, which was found at Dhiban (Dibon), 21 kilometers (13 miles) east of the Dead Sea. On the stone was written a story that mentions Israel’s King Omri and that includes what Moabite King Mesha said about his battle against Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:16:28-11:16:28" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Kings 16:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:1:1-12:1:1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 2 Kings 1:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:3:4-12:3:5" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 3:4, 5</a>) The Moabite Stone includes God’s name, written as the Tetragrammaton. The Tetragrammaton also appears many times in the Lachish Letters, which were pieces of pottery found in Israel.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>15. </strong>What is the <em>Septuagint, </em>and why was it needed?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>More than 2,000 years ago, the Hebrew Scriptures were translated into Greek and published as the <em>Septuagint. </em>Why was a translation into Greek necessary? The Jews had been prisoners in Babylon for 70 years. When they were released in the year 537 before our Common Era, some chose to stay in Babylon. But in time, many Jews moved to Alexandria, Egypt, where people spoke Greek. These Jews needed a Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures. Some copies of the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>contain God’s name in Hebrew.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>16. </strong>How did the Bay Psalm Book use God’s name?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>The first book published in the American colonies was a translation of Psalms that contains the divine name. It was translated from Hebrew into English. It is called the Bay Psalm Book and was first printed in 1640. One of the places it uses God’s name, spelled Iehovah, is at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:1:1-19:1:2" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1, 2</a>. It says that a blessed man does not listen to the wicked, but he longs for “the law of Iehovah.” For more information about God’s name, see the brochure <em>The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever.</em></p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>After the Flood, there was a mighty hunter named Nimrod, who opposed Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:10:9-1:10:9" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Genesis 10:9</a>) Because Nimrod opposed Jehovah God, he was really serving Satan. Nimrod was like the ones who later opposed God’s Son. Jesus said to them: “You are from your father the Devil, and you wish to do the desires of your father,” who “did not stand fast in the truth.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="25-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:10:10-1:10:10" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Genesis 10:10</a>) He may have been the one who started to build Babel and its tower about the year 2269 before our Common Era. Jehovah did not want mankind to stay in one place, but the builders of Babel said: “Come on! Let us build ourselves a city and also a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves, for fear we may be scattered over all the surface of the earth.” They were not able to finish this tower because God “confused the language of all the earth.” So the people moved away from Babel.

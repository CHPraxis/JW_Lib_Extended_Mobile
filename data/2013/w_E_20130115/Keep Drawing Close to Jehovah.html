<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">JEHOVAH GOD created humans with the need for drawing close to him. Yet, Satan wants us to think as he does<wbr />—that we do not need Jehovah.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Around the world, advanced electronic devices are now commonplace. Used properly, such inventions can be useful tools. Used improperly, they can come between us and our heavenly Father. Consider computers. The magazine you are reading was written and published with the aid of computers. A computer can be an effective research and communication tool and at times a source of refreshing entertainment. We can, however, also become obsessed with computer technology. Marketers cleverly convince people that they <em>must have </em>the latest products. One young man so passionately desired a particular tablet computer that he secretly sold one of his kidneys to buy it. What a shortsighted sacrifice!</p>

To help himself break this bad habit, Jon set his computer to shut itself down when it was time for him to go to bed.<wbr />—<strong><em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:15-49:5:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong><em>Ephesians 5:15, 16</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>“How are you feeling?” This common expression betrays a grim reality. Because our first parents allowed Satan to distance them from Jehovah, we are all subject to illness. Sickness serves Satan’s purpose, for when we are sick, it is harder for us to serve Jehovah. And if we die, we cannot serve him at all. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:115:17-19:115:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 115:17</a>) Naturally, then, we want to do what we can to stay healthy.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> And we should be concerned about our brothers’ health and welfare.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>8, 9. </strong>(a) How can we avoid going to extremes in regard to health? (b) What are the benefits of cultivating joy?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>It is important, however, to avoid <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>going to extremes. Some have zealously promoted certain diets, treatments, or products<wbr />—even more zealously than the good news of God’s Kingdom. They may sincerely believe that they are helping others. Even so, it is not appropriate to promote health or beauty products and practices before or after meetings at the Kingdom Hall or at assemblies or conventions. Why not?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>We meet together to discuss spiritual matters and to increase our joy, a product of God’s holy spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:5:22-48:5:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22</a>) On such occasions, offering health advice or products<wbr />—solicited or unsolicited—<wbr />can detract from our spiritual purpose and rob others of their joy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:14:17-45:14:17" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 14:17</a>) How a person addresses health concerns must be his or her own decision. Further, no one has a solution to all illness. Even the finest doctors get old and sick, and eventually they die. And worrying excessively about our health cannot extend our life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:25-42:12:25" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 12:25</a>) On the other hand, “a heart that is joyful does good as a curer.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:17:22-20:17:22" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Prov. 17:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>(a) What qualities are beautiful to Jehovah? (b) How can we enjoy the best possible health?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Similarly, it is appropriate to be concerned about our appearance. But we need not try too hard to erase all signs of aging. Those signs can be evidence of maturity, dignity, and inner beauty. For example, the Bible says: “Gray-headedness is a crown of beauty when it is found in the way of righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:16:31-20:16:31" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 16:31</a>) That is how Jehovah views us, and we should try to view ourselves as he does. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:3-60:3:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong><em>1 Peter 3:3, 4</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>Is it wise, therefore, to risk unnecessary and potentially dangerous surgical procedures or medical treatments merely to make oneself more physically attractive? “The joy of Jehovah” is a source of true beauty that radiates from the inside, regardless of age or health. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:8:10-16:8:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Neh. 8:10</a>) Only in the new world will we be completely healthy and regain youthful beauty.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Money is not evil, nor is it wrong to engage in honest business. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:7:12-21:7:12" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Eccl. 7:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:19:12-42:19:13" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Luke 19:12, 13</a>) However, nurturing a “love of money” will unavoidably distance us from Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:9-54:6:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:9, 10</a>) “The anxiety of this system,” extreme concern about obtaining life’s necessities, can choke us spiritually. So can “the deceptive power of riches,” the mistaken belief that riches bring lasting happiness and security. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:13:22-40:13:22" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matt. 13:22</a>) Jesus made it clear that <em>“no one” </em>can successfully serve both God and riches.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:24-40:6:24" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 6:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>What sort of financial snares are common today, and how can we avoid them?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The wrong view of money can lead to wrong actions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:28:20-20:28:20" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Prov. 28:20</a>) Promises of quick, easy money have enticed some to purchase lottery tickets or to pursue multilevel marketing schemes, even drawing in other members of the congregation. Others have been fooled by offers of unrealistically high returns on investments. Do not allow greed to cause you to be defrauded. Use good sense. If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>How does Jehovah’s view of money differ from the world’s?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>When we put first “the kingdom <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>and his righteousness,” Jehovah blesses our balanced efforts to obtain life’s necessities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:28-49:4:28" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Eph. 4:28</a>) He does not want us to be falling asleep during meetings because of overwork or to be sitting in the Kingdom Hall worrying about money. Yet, many in the world around us believe that only by devoting themselves to making money can they have a secure future and take it easy later in life. They often push their children toward the same materialistic goal. Jesus showed that such thinking is unreasonable. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:15-42:12:21" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong><em>Luke 12:15-21</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>This may remind us of Gehazi, who thought he could indulge his greed while still maintaining his good standing with Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:5:20-12:5:27" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Ki. 5:20-27</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>14, 15. </strong>Why must we not look to the financial system for security? Give an example.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Certain eagles are reported to have drowned when they did not release from their talons a fish that was too heavy to carry off. Could something similar happen to a Christian? “I’m normally very thrifty,” explains an elder named Alex. “If I pour out a little too much shampoo, I put some back in the bottle.” Nevertheless, Alex got caught up in trading in the stock market, thinking he could soon quit his job and enter the pioneer service. He became ever more engrossed in studying various offerings and market reports. Using his savings and money borrowed from brokers, he bought stocks that analysts predicted would quickly rise in value. Instead, they dropped sharply. “I was determined to get my money back,” Alex relates. “I felt that if I just held on, the stocks would come back up.”</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>For months, Alex could think of little else. He found it difficult to focus on spiritual matters, and he lost sleep. But the stocks never rebounded. Alex lost his savings and had to sell his house. “I caused my family great pain,” he admits. But he learned an important lesson. “I now know that anyone who puts his trust in Satan’s system will be profoundly disappointed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:11:28-20:11:28" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Prov. 11:28</a>) Indeed, resting our hope on our savings, investments, or ability to earn money in this system amounts to resting our hope on “the god of this system,” Satan.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>The Bible contains examples of proud people as well as of humble people. King David humbly looked to Jehovah for guidance, and Jehovah blessed him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:131:1-19:131:3" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 131:1-3</a>) But Jehovah humbled proud Kings Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar.

Ryan, a 32-year-old ministerial servant, relocated to a new congregation. “I expected to be recommended <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>as an elder soon,” Ryan relates, “but a year went by without that happening.” Would Ryan become angry or bitter, feeling that the elders had failed to show him due respect? Would he stop attending meetings, letting pride distance him from Jehovah and His people? What would you have done?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>“I read everything I could find in our publications on postponed expectation,” Ryan recalls. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:13:12-20:13:12" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Prov. 13:12</a>) “I began to realize that I needed to learn patience and humility. I needed to let Jehovah train me.” Ryan directed his attention away from himself and toward serving others<wbr />—in the congregation and in the field. Soon he was conducting several progressive Bible studies. “When I was appointed as an elder a year and a half later, it came as a surprise,” he says. “I had stopped worrying about it because I was enjoying my ministry so much.”<wbr />—<strong><em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:3-19:37:4" data-bid="33-1" class="b"><strong><em>Psalm 37:3, 4</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Be Courageous—Jehovah Is With You!
Many individuals mentioned in the Scriptures showed faith and courage. By examining some of their experiences, we will be strengthened to exercise faith and to serve Jehovah courageously. This discussion highlights our yeartext for 2013.
▪  Let Nothing Distance You From Jehovah
▪  Keep Drawing Close to Jehovah
There are many things in life we cannot choose, including our parents, our siblings, and our place of birth. Our intimacy with Jehovah is different. We can choose whether to be close to him or not. These articles will discuss seven areas of life in which we should let nothing distance us from Jehovah.
▪  Serving Without Regrets
All of us have done things that we wish we could do over and do differently. However, we need not allow such regrets to paralyze us now in our service to God. In this article, we will learn from the apostle Paul’s example how we can keep on serving Jehovah without regrets.
▪  Christian Elders—‘Fellow Workers for Our Joy’
In his second letter to the Corinthians, Paul explained that he and his close associates were ‘fellow workers for their joy.’ (2 Cor. 1:24) How should those words of Paul especially affect Christian elders? And how may each one of us add to a spirit of joy in the congregation? The answers to these questions will be considered in this article.

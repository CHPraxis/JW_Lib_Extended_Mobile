<h1 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>Three Things That Money Cannot Buy</strong></h1>
</header>
<div class="bodyTxt">
<div id="section1" class="section">
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IT SEEMS so ironic: Even when people face the threat of losing their job, their home, and even their pension, many of them are still obsessed with getting anything and everything that money can buy.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Such people are easy targets for advertisers, whose seductive marketing campaigns tell us that we <em>must have </em>a bigger home, a better car, and brand-name clothes. No cash? No problem<wbr />—buy on credit! For many, the goal is to <em>look </em>well-off even if they are deep in debt.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Of course, sooner or later reality sets in. “Buying flashy consumer goods on credit in order to look and feel like a winner is similar to hitting the crack pipe in order to improve your mood,” says the book <em>The Narcissism Epidemic. </em>“Both are initially cheap and work really well<wbr />—but only for a very short period of time. In the long term both leave you penniless and depressed.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Bible exposes the folly of what it calls “the showy display of one’s means of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:16-62:2:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 2:16</a>) The fact is, an obsession with possessions distracts us from the very things that matter most in life<wbr />—the things that money cannot buy. Consider three examples.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Brianne,<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> a teenager in the United States, feels that her father places too much importance on his job and the money it provides. “We have everything we need and more,” she says, “but my dad is never home because he is always traveling. I know it’s because of his work, but I think he has a responsibility to his family too!”</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>To think about: </strong>What regrets might Brianne’s father experience later in life? By putting too much emphasis on material things, how is he affecting his relationship with his daughter? What does his family need from him <em>more </em>than money?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"><strong>Bible principles to consider:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">  “The love of money causes all kinds of trouble. Some people want money so much that they have . . . caused themselves a lot of pain.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:10-54:6:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, <em>Contemporary English Version.</em></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>The bottom line: </strong>Money cannot buy family unity. That only comes from spending time with your family and giving them adequate love and attention.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:18-51:3:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Colossians 3:18-21</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>To think about: </strong>When contemplating the future, what legitimate concerns do you have? When does legitimate concern cross the line and become inordinate worry? How might Sarah’s mom provide a more balanced approach to financial security?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>Bible principles to consider:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">  “Stop storing up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:19-40:6:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 6:19</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><strong>To think about: </strong>Why might it be difficult to be content with basic necessities? When it comes to attitudes toward money, what example do <em>you </em>set for your family?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>Bible principles to consider:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">  “Having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:8-54:6:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:8</a>.</p>

Even people who simply aspire to have more money suffer from poor mental health; they also report more physical health problems such as sore throats, backaches, and headaches and were more likely to drink too much alcohol and use illegal drugs.

Beginning in the 1990s, a majority of students say that ‘making a lot of money’ has become the most important reason to go to college . . . This shift in values among college students takes place at the same time that rates of depression, suicide, and other psychological problems have risen dramatically among this group.”<wbr />—<em>The Price of Privilege, </em>by Dr. Madeline Levine.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sc">According to Dr. Madeline Levine, spending can become “retail therapy” that gives people a measure of comfort in a world where family, community, and church have failed them. “Shopping is one way to control our environment,” she writes in <em>The Price of Privilege. </em>“It puts us in charge of transactions and confers a sense of power on the buyer. This type of power is illusory . . . The real power is being exerted by large corporations and their advertisers, who are paid to suggest that consumer goods confer magical and protective powers on buyers.”</p>

BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



Is eternal life possible?






What provision can set us free from death?





The first man, Adam, lived for centuries. But finally, he grew old and died. Since then, people have tried many ways to avoid aging. Yet no one has ever been able to escape death. Why? Adam grew old and died because he sinned by disobeying God. We grow old because from Adam we have inherited sin and its penalty, death.—Read Genesis 5:5; Romans 5:12.
For us to enjoy eternal life, we need someone to pay a ransom for us. (Job 33:24, 25) A ransom is the price paid to set one free, and in our case, we need to be freed from death. (Exodus 21:29, 30) Jesus paid the price when he died for us.—Read John 3:16.



How can we gain eternal life?

Not everyone will be set free from sickness and aging. In fact, people who disobey God, as Adam did, will lose the privilege of life. Only people who are forgiven for their sins will enjoy eternal life.—Read Isaiah 33:24; 35:3-6.
To be forgiven, we must take action. We need to get to know God by studying his Word, the Bible. It teaches us how to enjoy a better way of life and also how to gain God’s favor and eternal life.—Read John 17:3; Acts 3:19.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The first man, Adam, lived for centuries. But finally, he grew old and died. Since then, people have tried many ways to avoid aging.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">For us to enjoy eternal life, we need someone to pay a ransom for us.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Not everyone will be set free from sickness and aging. In fact, people who disobey God, as Adam did, will lose the privilege of life.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">To be forgiven, we must take action. We need to get to know God by studying his Word, the Bible.

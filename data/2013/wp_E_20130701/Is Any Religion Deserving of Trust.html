<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">If a particular religion has disappointed you, you may find it hard to trust any religion. But be assured that a religion worthy of your confidence does exist. When he was on earth, Jesus gathered a group of faithful followers and taught them to live by God’s standards. Genuine followers of Christ<wbr />—conscientious individuals who endeavor to live by Christian standards—<wbr />still exist. Where can you find them?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Estelle, mentioned in an earlier article, says: “I finally started learning the Bible when I began to study with Jehovah’s Witnesses. It didn’t take me long to understand <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:32-43:8:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 8:32</a>, which reads: ‘You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.’”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Ray, also mentioned earlier, notes: “By studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses, I learned that God is not responsible for mankind’s suffering. I was thankful to see that while God has good reason to permit wickedness now, he also promises to eliminate it soon.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Obviously, it is difficult to swim against the current of this world’s low moral standards. But it <em>is </em>possible. Many people desire assistance to understand and apply the Bible. That is why Jehovah’s Witnesses conduct free home Bible studies with millions worldwide. Each week, multitudes are learning what the Bible really teaches. As a result, they are drawing close to their Creator and building happier lives.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

</div>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The next time you meet Jehovah’s Witnesses, why not ask them why they trust their religion? Examine their teachings and their record. Then decide for yourself if a religion exists that you can trust.</p>

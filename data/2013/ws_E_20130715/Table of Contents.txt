STUDY ARTICLES
▪  “Tell Us, When Will These Things Be?”
▪  “Look! I Am With You All the Days”
These articles will discuss parts of Matthew chapters 24 and 25. The articles include several new explanations about the timing of events in Jesus’ prophecy about the last days and his illustration of the wheat and the weeds. They will also tell us how we can benefit from these new explanations.

▪  Feeding Many Through the Hands of a Few
▪  “Who Really Is the Faithful and Discreet Slave?”
Jesus fed crowds of people and gave out spiritual food to his followers in a similar way: He fed many through the hands of a few. The first article discusses the few Jesus used in the first century to give out spiritual food to his anointed followers. The second article discusses this very important question: Who are the few Jesus is using to give out spiritual food today?

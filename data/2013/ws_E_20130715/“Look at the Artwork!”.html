<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">How many times have you said that to yourself or to others when you opened a new study edition of <em>The Watchtower? </em>It takes much time and work to prepare such beautiful pictures and photographs, and they are in the magazines for a reason. They are there to touch our hearts and to help us think about the lesson. They can especially help us when we prepare for and comment at the <em>Watchtower </em>Study.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">For example, each time you prepare an article, think about the opening picture, the one next to the title. What does it show? Why was it chosen? What does it have to do with the title of the article or with the theme scripture? Then think of how the other pictures in the article help you to understand the subject being discussed and how they can help you in your own life.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The <em>Watchtower </em>Study conductor should give the brothers and sisters time to comment on each picture. They can explain how the picture applies to the lesson and how they feel about it. At times, the caption next to the picture includes a paragraph number. This helps the conductor to know when to discuss the picture. When there is no paragraph number in the caption, the conductor can decide when the picture should be discussed. In this way, all will benefit from the pictures that help us to visualize the lessons from God’s Word.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">One brother said that the pictures in an article are like the icing on the cake. They make a wonderfully written article even better.</p>

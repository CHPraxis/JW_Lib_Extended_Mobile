Field Service Highlights
During the first ten months of the 2013 service year, 66 brothers graduated from three classes of the Bible School for Single Brothers in the United States. Additionally, 432 brothers and sisters graduated from 18 classes of the Bible School for Christian Couples. For the 2014 service year, 47 classes of these schools are planned in the United States and Puerto Rico. Jehovah is equipping these willing brothers and sisters with “every good thing to do his will.”—Heb. 13:21.

Experiences
▪ Australia: John, an educated man, went to church as a child but became a “staunch atheist.” A pioneer left him the brochure Was Life Created? and then on a subsequent visit left the Origin of Life brochure. The pioneer continued cultivating his interest by bringing him the latest magazines and featuring any articles on creation or Bible prophecy. When he thought John was ready, he offered him the book The Bible—God’s Word or Man’s? After reading it, John began describing himself as a “mild agnostic.” The pioneer then introduced the Bible Teach book, showing John paragraph 8 on page 20 and paragraphs 13-16 on pages 23-24. The scriptures cited in the material impressed John so much that he said, “Maybe I need to give the Bible another chance.”
▪ Mexico: One man told a publisher that he did not believe that the Bible was inspired by God. The publisher offered to show him proof of the Bible’s inspiration. After some discussions, the man’s heart began to be affected by what he was learning from the Bible. He was especially moved when he learned about godly standards. He told the publisher: “At first when you and I would read the Bible together, it seemed like advice from any other book and it didn’t affect me. But now when we read from it, particularly its counsel about morality, my heart hurts.”
▪ United States: While engaging in special metropolitan witnessing, a couple met a woman from Taiwan who believed in God but felt that the Bible was for Westerners. She came to their literature display because she felt lost even though she had a privileged life. She was hoping that the Bible would help her find purpose in life. The couple started a study with her using the Bible Teach book along with the brochure Lasting Peace and Happiness—How to Find Them. Instead of studying chapter 2 in the book, they discussed the section in the brochure entitled “A Guidebook for the Blessing of All Mankind.” After considering the first six paragraphs in that section, the woman expressed amazement that the Bible is so unique in comparison to other religious writings. After considering Bible prophecies that have been fulfilled, she said, “There is no other book that I can think of that is as accurate as the Bible!”
▪ Japan: Although a householder told a publisher that he did not believe in God, the publisher continued making brief calls on him, sharing the articles in Awake! entitled “Was It Designed?” Gradually, the man changed his viewpoint and began admitting that there may be a Creator. Now he believes that there is a God, and the publisher is studying with him out of the brochure Good News From God!
▪ Canada: A sister placed the latest magazines with a woman who was leaving her house and walking to her car. When the sister returned later, the woman adamantly told her that she was not interested and did not believe in God. The sister decided not to give up but to bring her the brochure A Satisfying Life—How to Attain It. When the sister found the woman at home, she told her that although she knew that the woman did not believe in God, she had been thinking of her because the sister knew that she was a single parent. She showed the woman paragraph 6 on page 4 of the brochure, which discusses where to find good advice. Then she encouraged her to read the suggestions in lesson 2 regarding raising children. The woman was very happy to take the brochure.

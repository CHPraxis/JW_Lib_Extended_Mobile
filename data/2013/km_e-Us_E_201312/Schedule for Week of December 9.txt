15 min: The Theocratic Ministry School for 2014. Talk by the school overseer. Using the Theocratic Ministry School instructions for 2014, discuss points needing emphasis locally. Explain that if the Bible reading consists of the opening chapters of a book, the brother caring for the highlights will no longer develop material from the “All Scripture” book. In addition, when Assignments No. 2 and No. 3 refer to paragraphs in the Reasoning or Insight books, only paragraphs that are indented are to be counted. Encourage all to be diligent in fulfilling their assignments, in participating during the Bible highlights, and in applying the suggestions given weekly from the Ministry School book.
15 min: “How to Prepare Effective Introductions.” Questions and answers. Demonstrate two introductions for offering the Bible Teach book, one that is not effective and afterward, one that is.

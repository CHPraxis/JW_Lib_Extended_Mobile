Help Them Be “Stabilized in the Faith”
It is exciting to see how Jehovah is blessing the ingathering, with over a quarter of a million people being baptized each year. (Deut. 28:2) Once a publisher helps a student to baptism, the tendency may be for the publisher to discontinue the study and focus on helping others. The student may also be inclined to stop the study in order to devote more time to the ministry. However, it is important for Bible students to have a good foundation in the truth. They need to be “rooted” in Christ and “stabilized in the faith.” (Col. 2:6, 7; 2 Tim. 3:12) Therefore, after a student gets baptized, he should continue his Bible study until he has completed both the Bible Teach and the “God’s Love” books.—See the April 2011 Our Kingdom Ministry, page 2.

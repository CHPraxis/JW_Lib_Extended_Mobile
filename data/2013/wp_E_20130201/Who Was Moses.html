<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">MOSES had all those experiences and more. No wonder this faithful man is highly respected by Christians, Jews, and Muslims alike!</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Without question, Moses was a prophet who showed “great awesomeness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:34:10-5:34:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 34:10-12</a>) He allowed God to use him in a mighty way. Yet, Moses was an ordinary human. Just like the prophet Elijah, who appeared beside Moses in a vision during Jesus’ earthly ministry, Moses was a man “with feelings like ours.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:5:17-59:5:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">James 5:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:17:1-40:17:9" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Matthew 17:1-9</a>) Moses faced many of the same problems that we encounter, and he overcame them successfully.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">God did not create the Devil. Instead, God created the angel who later <em>became </em>the Devil, also known as Satan. Jesus implied that at one time the Devil had been truthful and guiltless. Originally, then, the Devil was a righteous angelic son of God.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>John 8:44</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The angel who became the Devil chose to oppose God and incited the first human pair to join him. He thus <em>made himself </em>Satan, which means “Resister.”<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 3:1-5;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> <strong>Revelation 12:9</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Like the rest of God’s intelligent creatures, the angel that became the Devil had the freedom to choose between doing right and doing wrong, but he developed a desire to be worshipped. His desire for glory was stronger than his desire to please God.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:8-40:4:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 4:8, 9;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:13-59:1:14" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> <strong>James 1:13, 14</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">How has the Devil continued to influence humans? Should you fear him? You can find the answers to these questions in the Bible.</p>

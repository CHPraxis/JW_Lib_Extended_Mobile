<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">BY AND LARGE, Christendom’s churches have distanced themselves from God’s name. For example, the <em>Revised Standard Version </em>states in its preface: “The use of any proper name for the one and only God . . . is entirely inappropriate for the universal faith of the Christian Church.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses, on the other hand, are proud to bear God’s name and to glorify it. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:86:12-19:86:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong><em>Psalm 86:12;</em></strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:10-23:43:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> <strong><em>Isaiah 43:10</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>Furthermore, we count it a privilege to understand the meaning of that name and the universal issue involving its sanctification. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9</a>) That, though, is a privilege that we must never take for granted. Accordingly, let us consider three important questions: What does it mean to know God’s name? How has Jehovah lived up to his great name, thus adding to its glory? And how can we walk in Jehovah’s name?</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>To know God’s name involves much more than merely being acquainted with the word “Jehovah.” It includes knowing Jehovah’s reputation, as well as his qualities, purpose, and activities as revealed in the Bible, such as his dealings with his servants. Of course, Jehovah grants this insight progressively, according to the outworking of his purpose. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:4:18-20:4:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 4:18</a>) Jehovah revealed his name to the first human pair; thus, Eve used it after giving birth to Cain. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:4:1-1:4:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 4:1</a>) The faithful patriarchs Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob knew God’s name. Moreover, their appreciation for it grew as Jehovah blessed them, cared for them, and revealed aspects of his purpose to them. Moses was granted special insight into God’s name.</p>

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Why did Moses ask God about his name, and why were Moses’ concerns understandable?</p>

In effect, Moses asked: ‘What is your name?’ Considering that God’s name was long known, what was the point of Moses’ question? Evidently, he wanted to know more about <em>the person represented by the name<wbr /></em>—facts that would convince God’s people that He really would deliver them. Moses’ concern was warranted, for the Israelites had been slaves for some time. They would likely wonder whether the God of their forefathers <em>could </em>deliver them. Indeed, some Israelites had even taken up the worship of Egyptian gods!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:20:7-26:20:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezek. 20:7, 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How did Jehovah shed more light on the meaning of his name in his reply to Moses?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>How did Jehovah reply to Moses’ question?

Hence, in <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:3:15-2:3:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">verse 15</a> we read that Jehovah himself said: “This is my name to time indefinite, and this is the memorial of me to generation after generation.” How that revelation must have strengthened Moses’ faith and filled him with awe!</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>How did Jehovah fully live up to his great name?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Shortly after commissioning Moses, Jehovah fully lived up to his name by ‘proving to be’ Israel’s Deliverer. He humiliated Egypt with ten devastating plagues, at the same time exposing the Egyptian gods<wbr />—including Pharaoh—<wbr />as impotent. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:12-2:12:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex. 12:12</a>) Then Jehovah opened up the Red Sea, led Israel through it, and drowned Pharaoh and his military force. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:136:13-19:136:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 136:13-15</a>) In the “great and fear-inspiring wilderness,” Jehovah proved to be a Preserver of life as he provided food and water for his people, perhaps numbering from two to three million or more! He even caused <span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>their garments and their sandals not to wear out. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:1:19-5:1:19" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Deut. 1:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:29:5-5:29:5" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 29:5</a>) Yes, nothing can stop Jehovah from proving true to his incomparable name. He later stated to Isaiah: “I<wbr />—I am Jehovah, and besides me there is no savior.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:11-23:43:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 43:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Moses’ successor, Joshua, also witnessed Jehovah’s fear-inspiring deeds in Egypt and in the wilderness. Hence, near the end of his life, Joshua could with heartfelt conviction say to his fellow Israelites: “You well know with all your hearts and with all your souls that not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed. They have all come true for you. Not one word of them has failed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:23:14-6:23:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Josh. 23:14</a>) Yes, in no uncertain terms, Jehovah fulfilled his word<wbr />—he ‘proved to be.’</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>How is Jehovah living up to his name in our time?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Likewise today, Jehovah is ‘proving to be.’ By means of his Son, he foretold that during the last days, the Kingdom message would be preached “in all the inhabited earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) Who else but God Almighty could foretell such a work, see that it is done, and use many “unlettered and ordinary” people to accomplish it? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:4:13-44:4:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 4:13</a>) Hence, when we share in this work, we actually share in the fulfillment of Bible prophecy. We honor our Father and show that we really mean it when we pray: “Let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9, 10</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Shortly after Israel’s Exodus, Jehovah became something new to his people. By means of the Law covenant, he became their “husbandly owner,” willingly taking on all the responsibilities associated therewith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:3:14-24:3:14" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jer. 3:14</a>) The Israelites, in turn, became his figurative wife, his name people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:54:5-23:54:6" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 54:5, 6</a>) As they willingly submitted to him and kept his commandments, he would prove to be the perfect ‘Husband.’ He would bless them, keep them, and assign peace to them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:6:22-4:6:27" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Num. 6:22-27</a>) Jehovah’s great name would thus be glorified among the nations. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:4:5-5:4:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong><em>Deuteronomy 4:5-8;</em></strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:86:7-19:86:10" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> <strong><em>Psalm 86:7-10</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>Indeed, throughout Israel’s history, many foreigners were drawn to true worship. They, in effect, said what the Moabitess Ruth said to Naomi: “Your people will be my people, and your God my God.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:1:16-8:1:16" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ruth 1:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>For some 1,500 years, Jehovah’s <span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>dealings with Israel revealed many new facets of his personality. Despite the nation’s waywardness, over and over Jehovah proved to be “a God merciful” and “slow to anger.” He was a God of extraordinary patience and long-suffering. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:34:5-2:34:7" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ex. 34:5-7</a>) Jehovah’s patience, nevertheless, did have a limit, and that limit was reached when the Jewish nation rejected and killed his Son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:23:37-40:23:38" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 23:37, 38</a>) The fleshly descendants of Israel ceased to be God’s name people. In the main, they became spiritually dead, like a withered tree. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:23:31-42:23:31" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Luke 23:31</a>) How did this affect their attitude toward the divine name?</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>How did God’s name come to be disassociated from the Jewish nation?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>History indicates that, in time, the Jews developed a superstitious attitude toward God’s name, viewing it as something that they should not pronounce. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:20:7-2:20:7" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ex. 20:7</a>) God’s name gradually became disassociated from Judaism. It no doubt hurt Jehovah to see his name treated so disrespectfully. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:78:40-19:78:41" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 78:40, 41</a>) However, God, “whose name is Jealous,” clearly would not forever attach it to a people who had disowned him and whom he had disowned. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:34:14-2:34:14" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ex. 34:14</a>) This fact should impress upon us the importance of treating our Creator’s name with great respect.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Through Jeremiah, Jehovah revealed his purpose to establish “a new covenant” with a new nation, spiritual Israel. All its members, “from the least one of them even to the greatest one of them,” Jeremiah foretold, would “know Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:31:31-24:31:31" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Jer. 31:31,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:31:33-24:31:34" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 33, 34</a>) That prophecy began to be fulfilled at Pentecost 33 C.E. when God established the new covenant. The new nation, “the Israel of God,” which included Jews and non-Jews, became “a people for [God’s] name,” or “people who are called by my name,” said Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:16-48:6:16" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Gal. 6:16</a>; <strong><em>read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:14-44:15:17" data-bid="30-1" class="b"><strong><em>Acts 15:14-17;</em></strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:21:43-40:21:43" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Matt. 21:43</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>(a) Did the early Christians use God’s name? Explain. (b) How do you view the privilege of using Jehovah’s name in your ministry?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>As “people who are called by [God’s] name,” the members of that spiritual nation used the divine name, certainly doing so when quoting from the Hebrew Scriptures.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Thus, when the apostle Peter addressed an international audience of Jews and proselytes at Pentecost 33 C.E., he used God’s name a number of times. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:14-44:2:14" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Acts 2:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:20-44:2:21" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 20, 21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:25-44:2:25" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:34-44:2:34" data-bid="31-4" class="b"> 34</a>) The early Christians honored Jehovah, so he, in turn, blessed their efforts in the preaching work. Likewise today, Jehovah blesses our ministry when we proudly proclaim his name and show it to interested ones, in their own Bibles if possible. We thus introduce them to the true God. What a privilege<wbr />—for them and for us! That introduction may in some cases be the beginning of a wonderful relationship with Jehovah that will grow ever stronger and last forever.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>14, 15. </strong>Despite the spread of apostasy, what has Jehovah done about his memorial name?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Apostasy later began to infect the early Christian congregation, especially after the death of the apostles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/53:2:3-53:2:7" data-bid="32-1" class="b">2 Thess. 2:3-7</a>) False teachers even adopted the <span id="page28" class="pageNum" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>Jewish tradition of not using God’s name. But would Jehovah allow his memorial name to be erased? Never! Granted, its exact pronunciation cannot now be determined, but the name has endured. Over time, it has appeared in various translations of the Bible, as well as in the writings of Bible scholars. For example, in 1757, Charles Peters wrote that “Jehovah,” in contrast with God’s many titles, “seems to be the most expressive of his essence.” In a 1797 book on the worship of God, Hopton Haynes began chapter 7: “JEHOVAH the proper name of GOD among the Jews; whom alone they worshipped; as also did Christ and his Apostles.” Henry Grew (1781-1862) not only used God’s name but also recognized that it had been reproached and must be sanctified. Likewise, George Storrs (1796-1879), a close associate of Charles T. Russell, used God’s name, as did Russell himself.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>The year 1931 was particularly noteworthy, for in that year the International Bible Students, as God’s people were then called, adopted the Scriptural name Jehovah’s Witnesses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:10-23:43:12" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Isa. 43:10-12</a>) They thus announced to the world that they were proud to be servants of the only true God, to be “a people for his name,” praising that name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:14-44:15:14" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Acts 15:14</a>) These developments call to mind Jehovah’s words found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:1:11-39:1:11" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Malachi 1:11</a>: “From the sun’s rising even to its setting my name will be great among the nations.”</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Walking in God’s name involves at least three things.

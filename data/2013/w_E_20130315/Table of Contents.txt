All Christians are in a race for the prize of everlasting life. But because of inherited sin, we all stumble. This article will help us identify five stumbling blocks and will explain how to prevent them from hindering us from winning.
▪  Do You Have “a Heart to Know” Jehovah?
The book of Jeremiah has much to tell us about the heart. This article will help us to see what an ‘uncircumcised heart’ is and how such may be a danger even for Christians. Also, how can we have “a heart to know” Jehovah?—Jer. 9:26; 24:7.

Who Really Controls the World?

Do you think it is . . .
           God?

           humankind?

           someone else?





WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS

“The Evil One controls the whole world.”​—1 John 5:19.
“The Son of God came . . . to destroy the devil’s work.”​—1 John 3:8, New Century Version.



WHAT THAT CAN MEAN FOR YOU

Logical explanations for the world’s problems.​—Revelation 12:12.
Reason to believe that our world will change for the better.​—1 John 2:17.








CAN WE REALLY BELIEVE WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS?

Yes, for at least three reasons:
            Satan’s rulership is doomed. Jehovah is determined to bring Satan’s control over mankind to an end. He promises to “bring to nothing . . . the Devil” and undo all the damage that Satan has caused.​—Hebrews 2:14, New World Translation.

            God has chosen Jesus Christ to rule the world. Jesus is the complete opposite of this world’s present cruel, selfish ruler. Concerning Jesus’ kingship, God promises: “He will have pity on the lowly and the poor . . . From oppression and from violence he will rescue them.”​—Psalm 72:13, 14.

            God cannot lie. The Bible plainly states: “It is impossible for God to lie.” (Hebrews 6:18) When Jehovah promises to do something, it is as good as done! (Isaiah 55:10, 11) “The ruler of this world will be cast out.”​—John 12:31.





TO THINK ABOUT





What will the world be like after its ruler is removed?
The Bible answers that question at PSALM 37:10, 11 and REVELATION 21:3, 4.

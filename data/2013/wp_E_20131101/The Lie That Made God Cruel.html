<p data-pid="3" class="p3 sn"> “Immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into hell, where they suffer the punishments of hell, ‘eternal fire.’” (<em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em>) Some religious leaders say that hell is a state of complete isolation and separation from God.</p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>THE TRUTH FROM THE BIBLE</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="4" class="p4 sn"> “The soul that is sinning<wbr />—it itself will <em>die.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:18:4-26:18:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezekiel 18:4</a>) The dead “are conscious of nothing at all.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:5</a>) If the soul dies and is unconscious, how could it suffer “eternal fire” or even the pain of everlasting separation from God?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the Bible, the Hebrew and Greek words often translated “hell” actually refer to the common grave of mankind. For example, when Job suffered a painful illness, he prayed: “I wish you would hide me in my grave [“in hell,” <em>Douay-Rheims Version</em>].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:14:13-18:14:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 14:13</a>, <em>Holy Bible<wbr />—Easy-to-Read Version</em>) Job wanted to rest, not in a place of torment or alienation from God, but in the grave.</p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="6" class="p6 sn"> Cruelty does not endear us to God; it repels us. “From infancy I was taught the doctrine of hellfire,” says Rocío, who lives in Mexico. “I was so terrified that I could not imagine that God had any good qualities. I thought that he was angry and intolerant.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Bible’s clear statements about God’s judgments and the condition of the dead changed the way Rocío viewed God. “I felt free<wbr />—that a big emotional burden had been lifted off me,” she says. “I began to trust that God wants the best for us, that he loves us, and that I can love him. He is like a father who takes his children by the hand and wants the best for them.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:41:13-23:41:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Many have striven to be pious out of fear of hellfire, but God does not want you to serve him because you are terrified of him. Rather, Jesus said: “You must <em>love </em>Jehovah your God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:12:29-41:12:30" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mark 12:29, 30</a>) Moreover, when we realize that God does not act unjustly today, we can trust his future judgments too. Like Job’s friend Elihu, we can confidently say: “Far be it from the true God to act wickedly, and the Almighty to act unjustly.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:34:10-18:34:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 34:10</a>.</p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>THE TRUTH FROM THE BIBLE</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="4" class="p4 sn"> God said: “I am Jehovah. That is my name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:42:8-23:42:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:8</a>) Jehovah is a Hebrew name that means “He Causes to Become.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:4-1:2:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 2:4</a>, footnote.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah wants us to use his name. <em>“Call </em>upon his name,” states the Bible. <em>“Make known </em>among the peoples his dealings. <em>Make mention </em>that his name is put on high.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:12:4-23:12:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 12:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jesus used God’s name. In prayer, Jesus told Jehovah: “I have made your name known to them [Jesus’ disciples] and will make it known.” Why did Jesus make the divine name known to his disciples? He continued: “In order that the love with which you [God] loved me may be in them and I in union with them.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:26-43:17:26" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 17:26</a>.</p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="7" class="p7 sn"> “A man who does not know God by name does not really know him as a person,” wrote theologian Walter Lowrie, “and he cannot love him, if he knows him only as an impersonal force.”</p>
<div class="blockTxt floatEast"><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sc">Concealing or replacing God’s personal name is like cutting it out of the Bible</p>
</div>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">A man named Victor attended church weekly, but he did not feel that he really knew God. “Then I learned that God’s name is Jehovah, and it was like an official introduction to him,” he says. “I felt as though I had finally met the One about whom I had heard so much. I came to see him as a real Person and to develop a friendship with him.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Jehovah, in turn, draws close to humans who use his name. Regarding “those thinking upon his name,” God promises: “I will show compassion upon them, just as a man shows compassion upon his son who is serving him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:3:16-39:3:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Malachi 3:16, 17</a>) God also rewards those who call upon his name. The Bible says: “Everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:10:13-45:10:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Romans 10:13</a>.</p>

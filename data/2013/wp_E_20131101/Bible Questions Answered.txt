BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



Who will go to heaven, and why?

Millions long for life in heaven. Jesus said that his faithful apostles would live there. Before he died, he promised to prepare a place for them with his heavenly Father.—Read John 14:2.
Why will people from earth be resurrected to life in heaven? What will they do there? Jesus told his apostles that they would be kings. They will rule over the earth.—Read Luke 22:28-30; Revelation 5:10.



Do all good people go to heaven?

In most lands, only a few people are rulers. Since Jesus resurrects people to heavenly life so that they can rule over the earth, we would expect those chosen to be few. (Luke 12:32) The Bible says exactly how many will rule with Jesus.—Read Revelation 14:1.
Jesus has prepared places in heaven for some of his followers. Do you know what they will do there?

Those going to heaven will not be the only ones rewarded. Faithful subjects of Jesus’ Kingdom will enjoy life without end in a restored paradise on earth. (John 3:16) Some will enter Paradise by surviving the destruction of the present wicked system of things. Others will enter by resurrection.—Read Psalm 37:29; John 5:28, 29.

STUDY ARTICLES
▪  “Be Vigilant With a View to Prayers”
It is very important that we do not fall asleep spiritually, especially because the end of Satan’s world is so near. This article shows us that we must keep praying so that we can stay awake spiritually.

▪  How Can We Maintain “a Waiting Attitude”?
In this article, learn from the patience of the prophet Micah. Find out what events will be the signal that the time is near for Jehovah to destroy this wicked world. Also, learn how to show that we are grateful for God’s patience.

▪  Seven Shepherds, Eight Dukes—What They Mean for Us Today
We can learn many good lessons from the account of Sennacherib’s attack on Jerusalem in Hezekiah’s day. This information has special meaning for those who shepherd the congregation.

▪  Obey Jehovah’s Shepherds
▪  Shepherds, Imitate the Greatest Shepherds
The first of these two articles discusses the way Jehovah and Jesus shepherd their flock on earth today. It also explains how the sheep show that Jehovah and Jesus are their Shepherds. The second article describes the attitude congregation elders should have as they help to care for the flock.

“We Have Found the Messiah”!




Some four centuries after the last book of the Hebrew portion of the Bible was written, Micah’s prophecy about the Messiah was fulfilled: Jesus was born in Bethlehem. About 30 years later, in 29 C.E., the first part of Daniel’s prophecy about the coming of the Messiah was fulfilled. Jesus was baptized, and God anointed him with holy spirit. Right on time, the long-awaited Messiah, the Seed, had arrived!
Jesus immediately began his ministry, “declaring the good news of the kingdom of God.” (Luke 8:1) Just as it had been prophesied, Jesus proved to be kind, gentle, and genuinely concerned about others. His teaching was practical and loving, and he cured people of “every sort of infirmity,” demonstrating that God was with him. (Matthew 4:23) People of all ages flocked to Jesus and concluded: “We have found the Messiah”!—John 1:41.
Jesus foretold that just before his Kingdom took complete control, the world would experience wars, earthquakes, and many other troubles. He urged all to “keep on the watch.”—Mark 13:37.
Jesus was a perfect man who remained obedient to God, but he had enemies who eventually had him killed. His death thus provided the perfect offering to buy back for us what Adam and Eve had lost—the prospect of endless life in Paradise.
Jesus’ death fulfilled prophecy, as did God’s resurrecting Jesus as a powerful spirit creature three days later. Jesus then appeared to more than 500 of his disciples. Before ascending to heaven, Jesus commissioned his followers to take the good news about him and his Kingdom to “people of all the nations.” (Matthew 28:19) How thoroughly did they carry out that assignment?

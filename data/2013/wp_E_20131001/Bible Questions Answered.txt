BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



Is there hope for the dead?

Death is like sleep in that the dead are unconscious and cannot do anything. However, the Creator of life can bring the dead back by means of a resurrection. In proof of that, God empowered Jesus to raise several dead people to life.—Read Ecclesiastes 9:5; John 11:11, 43, 44.
In what sense is death like sleep?

God has promised that the dead who are in his memory will be resurrected to life in a righteous new world. Those who will be resurrected must remain in death until God gives them life again. Almighty God yearns to use his power to restore life to the dead.—Read Job 14:14, 15.



What will the resurrection be like?

When God resurrects people, they will be able to recognize themselves, their friends, and their family. Even though a person’s body decomposes, God can resurrect that same person with a new body.—Read 1 Corinthians 15:35, 38.
Relatively few individuals are raised to life in heaven. (Revelation 20:6) Most resurrected ones will return to life in a restored paradise on earth. These will be given a fresh start, with the prospect of living forever.—Read Psalm 37:29; Acts 24:15.

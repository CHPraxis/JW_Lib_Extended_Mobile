<h2 class="inline" id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>MY PAST:</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="7" class="p7 sn"> I grew up in Santiago, the capital of Chile, in a neighborhood where drugs, gangs, and crime were common. When I was five, my father was murdered. After that, my mother lived with a man who was cruel. He regularly beat us both. I still carry emotional scars from those years.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">As I was growing up, I reacted to the negative influences by becoming extremely violent. I listened to heavy-metal music, drank excessively, and occasionally took drugs. I was regularly involved in street fights with drug dealers, who several times tried to do away with me. On one occasion, a rival gang hired an infamous hit man to kill me, but I managed to escape with only a stab wound. On another occasion, a group of drug dealers held a pistol to my head and tried to hang me.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In 1996, I fell in love with a woman named Carolina, and in 1998, we were married. After our first son was born, I became terrified that because of my violent temper, I would turn out like my stepfather and abuse my family. So I sought help at a local rehabilitation center. I received medical treatment and therapy, but to no avail. I continued to become infuriated over every little thing; I was out of control. In a misguided effort to stop hurting my family, I attempted suicide. Fortunately, I did not succeed.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">I had been an atheist for many years, but I wanted to believe in God. So I associated with an evangelical religion for a time. Meanwhile, my wife was studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. I hated the Witnesses, and many times I screamed obscenities at them. But they always responded peacefully, which was not what I expected.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">One day, Carolina asked me to look up <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18</a> in my own Bible. That verse clearly states that God’s name is Jehovah. I was surprised to realize that in my religion I <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>had learned about a god, but not about Jehovah. Early in the year 2000, I too began to study the Bible with the Witnesses.</p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>HOW THE BIBLE CHANGED MY LIFE:</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="12" class="p12 sn"> As I progressed, I found comfort in learning that Jehovah is a compassionate and forgiving God. For example, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:34:6-2:34:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 34:6, 7</a>, the Bible describes Jehovah as “a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth, preserving loving-kindness for thousands, pardoning error and transgression and sin.”</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote"><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sc">I found comfort in learning that Jehovah is a compassionate and forgiving God</p>
</div>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Even so, it was not easy to apply what I was learning. I was convinced that I would never be able to control my violent temper. Each time I failed, Carolina lovingly encouraged me. She reminded me that Jehovah took note of my efforts. Her support gave me the strength to continue trying to please Jehovah, even though I often felt like a lost cause.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">One day, my study conductor, Alejandro, asked me to read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>. Those verses say that the fruitage of God’s spirit is “love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control.” Alejandro explained that my developing those qualities did not depend on my own strength but, rather, on God’s holy spirit. That truth completely changed my viewpoint!</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Later, I attended a large convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The order, cleanliness, and fellowship I saw there convinced me that I had found the true religion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35</a>) I was baptized in February 2001.</p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>HOW I HAVE BENEFITED:</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="16" class="p16 sn"> Jehovah has transformed me from a violent man to a peaceable one. I feel that he has lifted me up out of the mire that had me trapped. Many people hated me, and I don’t blame them. Now, however, I enjoy peacefully serving Jehovah along with my wife and two sons.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">My relatives and former friends cannot believe how much I have changed. As a result, several of them have shown interest in learning Bible truth. I have also had the privilege of helping others to come to know Jehovah. What a pleasure it has been to see Bible truth transform their lives as well!</p>

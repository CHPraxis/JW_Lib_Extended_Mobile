BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



Is it possible to understand the Bible?






The Bible is God’s Word. It is like a letter from a loving father. (2 Timothy 3:16) In the Bible, God explains how we can please him, why he allows evil, and what he will do for mankind in the future. But teachers of religion have twisted Bible teaching; as a result, many people despair of ever understanding it.—Acts 20:29, 30.
Jehovah God wants us to know the truth about him. For that reason, he has given us a book that is possible to understand.—Read 1 Timothy 2:3, 4.



How can you understand the Bible?

In addition to giving us the Bible, Jehovah provides us with help to understand it. He sent Jesus to teach us. (Luke 4:16-21) Jesus helped his listeners to understand the Scriptures, referring to one verse after another.—Read Luke 24:27, 32, 45.
Jesus established the Christian congregation so that the work he had started would continue. (Matthew 28:19, 20) Today, Jesus’ genuine followers help people to understand what the Bible teaches about God. If you would like to understand the Bible, Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to help you.—Read Acts 8:30, 31.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In April 2013, special metropolitan public witnessing in the United States was expanded to include Atlanta, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. These cities join Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City, where the program has already been established. From September 2012 through March 2013, publishers at these displays placed 90,896 magazines and 66,263 books. Additionally, 5,173 Bible studies were requested. Jehovah is clearly blessing this new initiative to reach people with the good news.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:2:4-54:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Because many people are home from work during religious and national holidays, these are often good times for us to share in the ministry. Congregations are encouraged to make special arrangements for holiday witnessing. If many in the territory will be sleeping later than usual, it would be good to adjust the time for the meeting for field service. An announcement may be made during the Service Meeting informing the congregation of any special arrangements for holiday witnessing and encouraging all who can to participate. Of course, holidays also afford us time to rest or to care for personal matters. But why not set aside part of the day for the ministry? Then you will enjoy the refreshment that comes from engaging in sacred service.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:11:29-40:11:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 11:29, 30</a>.</p>

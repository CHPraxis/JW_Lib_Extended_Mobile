“I’m sharing in a worldwide campaign to distribute this important message. Here is your copy.”
Note: In order to cover the territory, keep your presentation brief. However, in some cases the householder may show genuine interest and may wish to converse. If so, you can ask his opinion about the question on the front, read to him the Bible’s answer as shown inside, and consider a portion of the tract’s contents, as time allows. Before leaving, show him the “To Think About” question on the back and arrange to return and discuss it.

Awake! November
“We are making a brief visit because many people are concerned that moral values seem to be eroding. Do you think that society has lowered its moral standards?

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“We’re visiting briefly because many are alarmed over how widespread pornography has become. Many others, however, feel that pornography is a harmless diversion. What’s your opinion? [Allow for response.] Jesus said that we can determine whether something is good by the fruitage it produces. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:17-40:7:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 7:17</a>.] This magazine considers the fruitage produced by pornography. It also gives practical tips on how to break free from pornography.”</p>

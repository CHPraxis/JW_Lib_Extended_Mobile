<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">We are happy to report two new peaks during the month of January 2013. The Turks and Caicos Islands reported 55 regular pioneers and 3,692 return visits. In addition, when compared with the same month last year, the number of regular pioneers increased by 5.5 percent in the Bahamas, 8.8 percent in Bermuda, and 7.4 percent in the United States. What a pleasure it is to see so many willingly expanding their ministry!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 110:3</a>.</p>

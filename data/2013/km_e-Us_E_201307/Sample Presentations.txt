Sample Presentations
To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in August
“Almost everyone prays at one time or another. Even atheists have prayed when in trouble. Do you think that God listens to all prayers?” Allow for response. Show the back of the August 1 Watchtower, and consider together the material under the first question and at least one of the cited scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return to discuss the next question.
Note: This presentation should be demonstrated during the meeting for field service on August 3.
The Watchtower August 1
“We’re visiting briefly because many are alarmed over how widespread pornography has become. Many others, however, feel that pornography is a harmless diversion. What’s your opinion? [Allow for response.] Jesus said that we can determine whether something is good by the fruitage it produces. [Read Matthew 7:17.] This magazine considers the fruitage produced by pornography. It also gives practical tips on how to break free from pornography.”
Awake! August
“Most of us want to live as long as we can. Do you think advances in science will one day make it possible to live forever? [Allow for response.] Notice this intriguing promise. [Read 1 Corinthians 15:26.] But how will God accomplish this—through science or by some other means? And why do we now grow old and die? This magazine shows how the Bible answers these questions.”

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 1. The Memorial season is a special time to do what?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The Memorial on Tuesday, March 26, provides an excellent opportunity to rejoice in God’s means of salvation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:61:10-23:61:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 61:10</a>) Even before the upcoming observance, a joyful spirit will help us to be well-prepared. How so?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. What impels us to make preparations for the Memorial observance?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Preparing for the Observance: </strong>The Lord’s Evening Meal is a profound yet simple observance. Still, it requires advance planning so that important details are not overlooked. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:21:5-20:21:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 21:5</a>) The time and a suitable location must be selected. The proper emblems need to be obtained. The meeting place has to be cleaned and readied. The designated speaker needs to prepare carefully, and the servers and attendants must be organized. No doubt much of this has already been done. Gratitude for the saving power of the ransom moves us to prepare well for this sacred occasion.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:8-60:1:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:8, 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 3. How can we prepare our heart for the Lord’s Evening Meal?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Preparing the Heart: </strong>It is also essential to prepare our heart to appreciate the full significance of the Memorial. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/15:7:10-15:7:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezra 7:10</a>) To that end, we should set aside time to consider the special Memorial Bible reading and then ponder the final days of Jesus’ earthly life. Meditating on Jesus’ self-sacrificing spirit will motivate us to imitate him.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:2:20-48:2:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gal. 2:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 4. Which benefit of the ransom gives you the greatest joy?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Christ’s death vindicates Jehovah’s sovereignty. It gives release from sin and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:2-62:2:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 2:2</a>) It opens the way for peaceful relations with God and the way to eternal life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:21-51:1:22" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Col. 1:21, 22</a>) It also helps us to strengthen our resolve to live up to our dedication to Jehovah and remain firm as Christ’s disciples. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:16:24-40:16:24" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 16:24</a>) As you prepare for and attend the upcoming Memorial, may your joy be increased!</p>

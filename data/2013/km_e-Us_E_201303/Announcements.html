<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The Memorial will be held on Tuesday, March 26, 2013. If your congregation normally has a meeting on Tuesday, it should be switched to another day of the week if the Kingdom Hall is available. If the Service Meeting must be canceled, the coordinator of the body of elders may make adjustments to the schedule so that parts that are particularly applicable to your congregation are considered during the month. Congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer should reschedule the meetings normally held on Tuesday evening to another night during the visit.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">We rejoice to report three new peaks during the month of September 2012! There were peaks in regular pioneers of 74 in Bermuda, 53 in the Turks and Caicos Islands, and 152,134 in the United States. In addition, when compared with the same month of the previous year, the Bahamas experienced an increase of 9.1 percent in Bible studies.

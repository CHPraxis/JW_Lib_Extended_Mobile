10 min: Ideas for Offering the Magazines in October. Discussion. Take 30 to 60 seconds to relate why the magazines will have appeal in your territory. Then, using the cover subject of The Watchtower, invite the audience to give suggestions on an interest-arousing question to ask. Next, invite suggestions on a scripture to read. Do the same for Awake! and, if time allows, for one other article from either magazine. Demonstrate how each issue may be offered.
10 min: Local needs.
10 min: Those Who Are Working Hard. (1 Thess. 5:12, 13) Interview two elders. What are their congregation and other theocratic assignments? How are they able to care for these in addition to secular and family responsibilities? How do they make the ministry a priority? How have family members given them support?

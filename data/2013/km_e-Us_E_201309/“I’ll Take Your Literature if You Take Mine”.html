<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is the proposition of some householders. Since we do not exchange our Bible study aids for religious literature that disseminates error, how might we answer tactfully? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:1:25-45:1:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 1:25</a>) We could say: “Thank you for your offer. What does this say about the solution to mankind’s problems? [Allow for response. If he invites you to read his literature to find the answer, you can remind him that you did not offer literature without telling him what it contains. Then read or quote <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>.] Jesus indicated that God’s Kingdom will cause God’s will to be done on earth. Therefore, the only religious literature that I read highlights God’s Kingdom. May I show you from the Bible some specific things that God’s Kingdom will accomplish?”</p>

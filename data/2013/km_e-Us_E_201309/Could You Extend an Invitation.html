<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In many congregations there are publishers whose share in the ministry is limited because of chronic health problems or advancing age. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:16-47:4:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:16</a>) Could you invite one in such circumstances to accompany you on a Bible study? If the publisher is housebound, perhaps you could even conduct the study at his or her home. Could you occasionally make arrangements to take an infirm publisher with you to a few doors in the house-to-house ministry or on a return visit or two? Many elderly publishers have much experience in the ministry. Therefore, your efforts will not result only in encouragement to them. You too will benefit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:1:12-45:1:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 1:12</a>) In addition, your efforts to demonstrate love in this way will be rewarded by Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:19:17-20:19:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 19:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:3:17-62:3:18" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 John 3:17, 18</a>.</p>

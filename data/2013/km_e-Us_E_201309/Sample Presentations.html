<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“We’re making just a brief visit on our neighbors today. Many whom we have talked to say that one of the most difficult situations they have had to face is the death of a loved one. Is that how you feel too? [Allow for response.] I found this to be encouraging.” Show the <a class="xt" data-xtid="32" href="jwpub://p/E:2013731/1-9">back</a> of the October 1 <em>Watchtower, </em>and consider together the material under the first question and at least one of the cited scriptures.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“We’re visiting briefly to encourage Bible reading. We know that some people have an interest in the Bible; others do not. What about you? [Allow for response.] The Bible makes this bold claim. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:2:13-52:2:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>.] I’m sure you will agree that if it is true that the Bible is a book from God, then it is worth reading. This magazine briefly outlines what the Bible is all about and why it should interest us.”</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“I would like to hear your opinion on this question: Is contentment possible if we do not have a lot materially? [Allow for response.] Notice what the Bible says. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:8-54:6:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:8</a>.] This magazine presents a balanced view of material possessions and discusses three valuable things that money cannot buy.”</p>

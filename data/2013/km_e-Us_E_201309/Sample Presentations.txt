Sample Presentations
To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in October
“We’re making just a brief visit on our neighbors today. Many whom we have talked to say that one of the most difficult situations they have had to face is the death of a loved one. Is that how you feel too? [Allow for response.] I found this to be encouraging.” Show the back of the October 1 Watchtower, and consider together the material under the first question and at least one of the cited scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return to discuss the next question.
The Watchtower October 1
“We’re visiting briefly to encourage Bible reading. We know that some people have an interest in the Bible; others do not. What about you? [Allow for response.] The Bible makes this bold claim. [Read 1 Thessalonians 2:13.] I’m sure you will agree that if it is true that the Bible is a book from God, then it is worth reading. This magazine briefly outlines what the Bible is all about and why it should interest us.”
Awake! October
“I would like to hear your opinion on this question: Is contentment possible if we do not have a lot materially? [Allow for response.] Notice what the Bible says. [Read 1 Timothy 6:8.] This magazine presents a balanced view of material possessions and discusses three valuable things that money cannot buy.”

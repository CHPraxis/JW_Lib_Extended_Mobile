<div class="openingContent"><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">Is Halloween celebrated where you live? In the United States and Canada, Halloween is widely known and celebrated every year on October 31. Halloween customs, though, can be found in many other parts of the globe. In some places holidays are celebrated that, although named differently, share similar themes: contact with the spirit world involving the spirits of the dead, fairies, witches, and even the devil and demon angels.<wbr />—See the box <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:102013325/12-19">“Celebrations Like Halloween Worldwide.”</a></p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">PERSONALLY, you may not believe in supernatural spirits. You might simply view taking part in Halloween and similar celebrations as a way to have fun and teach your children to explore their imagination. Many people, though, regard these celebrations as harmful for the following reasons:</p>
<ol><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">               “Halloween,” explains the <em>Encyclopedia of American Folklore, </em>“is integrally related to the prospect of contact with spiritual forces, many of which threaten <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>or frighten.” (See the box <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:102013325/31-69">“Halloween Time Line.”</a>) Likewise, many celebrations like Halloween have pagan origins and are deeply rooted in ancestor worship. Even today, people around the world use these days to make contact with supposed spirits of the dead.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">               Although Halloween has been viewed mainly as an American holiday, each year people in more and more countries have been adopting it. Many newcomers to the celebration, however, are unaware of the pagan origins of Halloween symbols, decorations, and customs, most of which are related to supernatural beings and occult forces.<wbr />—See the box <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:102013325/21-27">“Where Did It Come From?”</a></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">                 Thousands of Wiccans, who follow ancient Celtic rituals, still call Halloween by the ancient name Samhain and consider it to be the most sacred night of the year. “Christians ‘don’t realize it, but they’re celebrating our holiday with us. . . . We like it,’” stated the newspaper <em>USA Today </em>when quoting a professed witch.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>                 Celebrations like Halloween are in conflict with Bible teachings. The Bible warns: “There must never be anyone among you who . . . practices divination, who is soothsayer, augur or sorcerer, who uses charms, consults ghosts or spirits, or calls up the dead.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:18:10-5:18:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 18:10, 11</a>, <em>The Jerusalem Bible; </em>see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:19:31-3:19:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Galatians 5:19-21</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="se"><strong>VAMPIRES, WEREWOLVES, WITCHES, ZOMBIES: </strong>These creatures have long been associated with the evil spirit world.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="se"><strong>CANDY: </strong>The ancient Celts tried to appease wicked spirits with sweets. The church later encouraged celebrants to go from house to house on All Hallows’ Eve, asking for food in return for a prayer for the dead. This custom eventually became Halloween’s trick or treat.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="se"><strong>COSTUMES: </strong>The Celts wore frightening masks so that evil spirits would mistakenly think the wearers were spirits and would leave them alone. The church gradually amalgamated pagan customs with the feasts of All Souls and All Saints. Later, celebrants went from house to house wearing costumes of saints, angels, and devils.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="se"><strong>PUMPKINS: </strong>Carved, candlelit turnips were displayed to repel evil spirits. To some, the candle in the turnip represented a soul trapped in purgatory. Later, carved pumpkins were more commonly used.</p>

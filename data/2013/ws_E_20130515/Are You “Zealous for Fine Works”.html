Even though many opposed him and wanted to kill him, he was zealous until the end of his life on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:18:36-43:18:37" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 18:36, 37</a>) Because he knew that he would soon suffer and die, he worked even harder to help people come to know Jehovah.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>In the year 32, Jesus gave an illustration about a man who had a fig tree that did not produce figs. After three years, the man told his worker to cut it down, but the worker asked for more time to try to make the tree produce fruit. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:13:6-42:13:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 13:6-9</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>When Jesus said this, only a small number of people had become his disciples. But Jesus’ illustration showed that he wanted to work harder in the short time before he died. So he preached with more zeal in Judea and Perea for about six months. A few days before he died, Jesus wept because most did not accept his message.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:13:15-40:13:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 13:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:19:41-42:19:41" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Luke 19:41</a>.</p>

We are the only people on earth who can tell others how mankind’s problems will be solved. A newspaper writer recently said that it is impossible to know why bad things happen to good people. But the Bible tells us why, and it is our responsibility and privilege as Christians to tell others. We should be “aglow with the spirit” as we do Jehovah’s work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:11-45:12:11" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Romans 12:11</a>) Jehovah will bless our work, and we can help people come to know and love him.</p>

The pioneers view the ministry as their most important work, but many of them also have to have a job. Think, too, of the missionaries who work hard to help people in foreign lands. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:17-50:2:17" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Philippians 2:17</a>) The elders sometimes have to miss meals or lose sleep to take care of the members of the congregation.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Our zeal for the ministry is not enough to make people want to know God. The second thing that helps them is our good Christian conduct. Paul explained why our conduct is important by saying: “In no way are we giving any cause for stumbling, that our ministry might not be found fault with.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:6:3-47:6:3" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:3</a>) Our clean speech and good conduct may make other people want to worship Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:2:10-56:2:10" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Titus 2:10</a>) In fact, we often hear that people respond to the truth when they see how we imitate Christ.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>Why should we think and pray about the way our conduct affects others?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Just as our good conduct can make people want to learn the truth, bad conduct can make people not want to know Jehovah at all. So whether we are at work, at home, or in school, we should make sure <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>that we do nothing that would turn someone away from Jehovah. If we were to “practice sin willfully,” we would lose our relationship with Jehovah forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:26-58:10:27" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:26, 27</a>) This should make us think carefully and pray about our conduct and how it affects others. As the world’s conduct keeps getting worse, it should be easier for people to see the difference “between one serving God and one who has not served him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:3:18-39:3:18" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Malachi 3:18</a>) Yes, our good Christian conduct is an important way to help people want to become friends of God.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>12-14. </strong>How does the way we endure opposition affect how others view the truth? Give an example.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>In his second letter to the Corinthians, Paul explained that he had been persecuted, beaten, and put in prison because people opposed his ministry. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:6:4-47:6:5" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>2 Corinthians 6:4, 5</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>When we endure opposition, others may be moved to accept the truth. Several years ago, some in Angola wanted to get rid of all of Jehovah’s Witnesses in their area. They whipped 2 baptized Witnesses and 30 interested ones until their flesh was cut and bleeding. They even whipped the women and children. They wanted others to be afraid to listen to Jehovah’s Witnesses, so they forced the local people to watch. But later many of these people asked the Witnesses for home Bible studies! As a result, the preaching work continued, more people came into the truth, and the brothers were blessed.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>This example shows that when people see that we are courageous <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>during a test, they might decide to accept the truth. The courage of Peter and the other apostles may have encouraged others to become God’s friends. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:5:17-44:5:29" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 5:17-29</a>) Our schoolmates, workmates, or family members may accept the truth because they see that we have courage when we experience opposition.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>There are always some of our brothers who are being persecuted. Right now, for example, about 40 brothers in Armenia are in prison because of their neutrality. And many more in that country will likely be put there in the near future. In Eritrea, 55 Witnesses are in prison, and some of them are over 60 years old. In South Korea, about 700 Witnesses are in prison because of their neutrality. For 60 years our brothers there have been sent to prison. We should keep praying that the faithfulness of these brothers who are persecuted will honor God and help others to accept the truth.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:76:8-19:76:10" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 76:8-10</a>.</p>

The sister explained that the right thing to do was to pay for the ticket, even for just one stop. After that, her friend got off the bus. Then the bus driver asked the sister, ‘Are you one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?’ She said ‘Yes. What made you ask?’ ‘I heard your conversation about paying for the bus ticket, and I know that Jehovah’s Witnesses are among the very few people who pay for tickets and are honest in all things.’ A few months later, a man approached the sister at a meeting and said, ‘Do you know me? I’m the bus driver who talked to you about paying for the ticket. After I saw how honest you were, I decided to begin studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.’ When people see that we are honest, they trust the good news that we preach.</p>

She said that when he rang the doorbell, she was on a ladder in the kitchen, trying to replace a lightbulb. “It isn’t safe for you to be doing that alone,” he said.

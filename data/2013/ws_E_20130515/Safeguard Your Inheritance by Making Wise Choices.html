<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>Who was Esau? What inheritance was he supposed to receive?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>About 4,000 years ago, Rebekah gave birth to twins, Esau and Jacob. These twins grew to be very different. “Esau became a man knowing how to hunt, a man of the field,” but Jacob was “a blameless man, dwelling in tents.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:25:27-1:25:27" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 25:27</a>) Jacob was <span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>called blameless because he had integrity and did not practice sin.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>When Esau and Jacob were 15 years old, their grandfather Abraham died. But Jehovah remembered the promise he had made to Abraham. Later, Jehovah repeated to Isaac what he had promised. God said that all the nations of the earth would bless themselves by means of Abraham’s “seed,” or descendants. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:26:3-1:26:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 26:3-5</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>In this way, God revealed that one of Abraham’s descendants would be the faithful “seed” of <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>, that is, the Messiah. Because Esau was Isaac’s firstborn son, he had the right to share in the promise that God made to Abraham. So the Messiah should have been one of Esau’s descendants. This was a wonderful inheritance for Esau. But did he appreciate it?</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>One day when Esau came in from the field, he saw Jacob “boiling up some stew.” Esau asked for some, saying: “Quick, please, give me a swallow of the red<wbr />—the red there, for I am tired!” Jacob said: “Sell me, first of all, your right as firstborn!” What choice did Esau make? He said that the birthright was of no benefit to him and chose a bowl of stew over his right as firstborn! Jacob wanted to make sure that Esau really was selling the birthright, so he asked him to make an oath. Jacob said: “Swear to me first of all!” Without even taking time to think, Esau sold his birthright. After that, “Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he went to eating and drinking. Then he got up and went his way.” Esau showed that he thought that his birthright was worthless and not important.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:25:29-1:25:34" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Genesis 25:29-34</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Years later, when Isaac thought that he would soon die, Rebekah made sure that Jacob would receive the birthright that Esau had sold to him. When Esau realized that he had made a foolish choice by selling his birthright, he begged Isaac: “Bless me, even me too, my father! . . . Have you not reserved a blessing for me?” When Isaac told Esau that he could not change the blessing he had already given to Jacob, Esau cried bitterly.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:27:30-1:27:38" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis 27:30-38</a>.</p>

He showed that his fleshly desires were more important to him than receiving the blessings that Jehovah had promised as part of his inheritance. Esau did not appreciate his birthright and did not really love God. And Esau did not think about how his choice would affect his descendants. But Jacob was different. He truly appreciated his inheritance and made good choices to protect it. For example, although it was not easy for him, Jacob <span id="page30" class="pageNum" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>was willing to follow the counsel his parents gave about choosing a wife. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:27:46-1:28:3" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Genesis 27:46–28:3</a>) Jehovah blessed his obedience by having the Messiah be one of Jacob’s descendants.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>We can benefit from the account about Esau. The apostle Paul warned Christians to be careful that “there may be no fornicator nor anyone not appreciating sacred things, like Esau, who in exchange for one meal gave away his rights as firstborn.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:16-58:12:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:16</a>) We need to learn from that warning. We must always appreciate sacred things so that we will resist temptation and protect our inheritance. When he described what Esau did, why did Paul also talk about fornication? Because if we act like Esau and let our fleshly desires control us, it will be easy for us to commit a sin such as fornication, and as a result we could lose our inheritance.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>The first step is to <strong>think about the consequences of sin. </strong>The more we love Jehovah, the more we will appreciate our inheritance. When we love someone, we do not want to hurt that person. Instead, we try our best to make him happy. So we should take time to think about the consequences of sin, that is, how we would hurt ourselves and others if we gave in to temptation. We should ask ourselves: ‘How would my selfish conduct affect my relationship with Jehovah? How would the sin affect my family? How would it affect my brothers and sisters in the congregation? Would my conduct offend others?’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:1:10-50:1:10" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Philippians 1:10</a>) We could also ask ourselves: ‘Are a few moments of immoral pleasure worth the price I will pay afterward?

The Bible explains: “My son, <strong>if </strong>you will receive my sayings and treasure up my own commandments with yourself, so as to pay attention to wisdom with your ear, that you may incline your heart to discernment; <strong>if, </strong>moreover, you call out for understanding itself and you give forth your voice for discernment itself, <strong>if </strong>you keep seeking for it as for silver, and as for hid treasures you keep searching for it, in that case you will understand the fear of Jehovah, and you will find the very knowledge of God.

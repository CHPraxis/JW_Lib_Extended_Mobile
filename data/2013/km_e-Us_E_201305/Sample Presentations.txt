Sample Presentations
To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in June
“Almost everyone we talk to wants to see peace in the world. Yet, we still have wars. In your opinion, why is world peace so elusive?” Allow for response. Then show the back of the June 1 Watchtower, and consider together the material under the first question and at least one of the cited scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return to discuss the next question.
Note: This presentation should be demonstrated during the meeting for field service on June 1.
The Watchtower June 1
“We are making very brief visits in the community to talk about a common problem. Most people have experienced prejudice at one time or another. Do you think that there is any place in the world where prejudice does not exist? [Allow for response.] Notice how God views all people. [Read Acts 10:34.] This magazine discusses how God will end prejudice once and for all.”
Awake! June
“We would like to get your opinion on something. It’s natural to want a better life. Do you think we can achieve that by buying more material possessions? [Allow for response.] Notice this profound statement of Jesus. [Read Luke 12:15.] This magazine presents a balanced view of material possessions and offers helpful suggestions on how to keep our spending under control.”

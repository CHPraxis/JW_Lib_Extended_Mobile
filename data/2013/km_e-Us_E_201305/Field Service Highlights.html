<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">We are pleased to report four all-time peaks for the month of November 2012: 196 regular pioneers in the Bahamas, 78 in Bermuda, and 154,613 in the United States, along with a new peak of 404 Bible studies in Bermuda. Also, when compared with November 2011, the Turks and Caicos Islands had a 20.5 percent increase in regular pioneers. These fine increases give evidence that Jehovah’s people are not holding back in sharing the good news with others.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:3:27-20:3:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 3:27</a>.</p>

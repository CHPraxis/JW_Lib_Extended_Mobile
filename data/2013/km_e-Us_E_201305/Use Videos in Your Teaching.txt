Use Videos in Your Teaching
When Jehovah conveyed important information to Abraham and Jeremiah, he did so not only by telling them but also by showing them. (Gen. 15:5; Jer. 18:1-6) We can help our students to grasp and appreciate Bible truths by making good use of visual aids, such as our videos. The following are ideas as to when some of the videos could be shown. Keep in mind that these are just suggestions, since every student is different.
Bible Teach book
□ Chapter 1: After paragraph 17, view The Wonders of Creation Reveal God’s Glory
□ Chapter 2: At the end, view The Bible—Mankind’s Oldest Modern Book
□ Chapter 9: After paragraph 14, view Jehovah’s Witnesses—Organized to Share the Good News
□ Chapter 14: At the end, view The Bible—Its Power in Your Life
□ Chapter 15: After paragraph 10, view Our Whole Association of Brothers
“God’s Love” book
□ Chapter 3: After paragraph 15, view Young People Ask—How Can I Make Real Friends?
□ Chapter 4: At the end, view Respect Jehovah’s Authority
□ Chapter 7: After paragraph 12, view No Blood—Medicine Meets the Challenge
□ Chapter 9: After paragraph 6, view Warning Examples for Our Day
□ Chapter 17: At the end, view ‘Walk by Faith, Not by Sight’
Are there other videos that one of your students would benefit from seeing? For example, individuals who are dealing with opposition might be encouraged by viewing Faithful Under Trials—Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Soviet Union or Jehovah’s Witnesses Stand Firm Against Nazi Assault. Youths may benefit from Pursue Goals That Honor God and Young People Ask—What Will I Do With My Life? Make notations in your copy of the Bible Teach and “God’s Love” books to remind you when you might view a video with your student or lend it to him to watch. As new videos are released, think about how you could use them to touch the heart of your Bible students.—Luke 24:32.

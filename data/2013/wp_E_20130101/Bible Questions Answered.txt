BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



What is God’s name?

Our family members all have personal names. Even pets have names! Wouldn’t it be reasonable for God to have a name? In the Bible, God has many titles, such as God Almighty, Sovereign Lord, and Creator, but he also has a personal name.—Read Isaiah 42:8.
Many translations of the Bible contain God’s personal name at Psalm 83:18. For example, in the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, that verse says: “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”



Why should we use God’s name?






We use personal names when we talk with those we love, such as our close friends




God wants us to use his personal name. We use personal names when we talk with those we love, such as our close friends—especially if they invite us to do so. Should it be different when it comes to talking with God? Furthermore, Jesus Christ encouraged the use of God’s name.—Read Matthew 6:9; John 17:26.
However, to be God’s friend, we need to know more about him than just his name. For instance, what is God like? Is it really possible to get close to God? You can find the answers to those questions in the Bible.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">How do you feel about December 21, 2012, the date on the Maya calendar that many have been saying would bring worldwide change? Depending on what you expected, you might be relieved, disappointed, or indifferent. Was it just another incorrect prediction for the end of the world?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What about “the end of the world” described in the Bible? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3</a>, <em>King James Version</em>) Some fear that the earth will be burned up. Others are fascinated by end-time scenarios. Many have simply grown tired of being told that the end is near. But could those be reactions to fiction rather than to fact?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">You might be surprised to learn what the Bible really says about the end of the world. Not only does the Bible give reasons to look forward to the end but it also acknowledges the frustration that can set in if the end seems to be overdue. We invite you to consider the Bible’s answers to some common questions about the end of the world.</p>

<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><strong>Will the earth be burned up?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>THE BIBLE’S ANSWER: </strong><em>“</em>[<em>God</em>] <em>has founded the earth upon its established places; it will not be made to totter to time indefinite, or forever.”<wbr /></em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:104:5-19:104:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">PSALM 104:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The earth will not be destroyed, either by fire or by any other means. Instead, the Bible teaches that this planet is mankind’s eternal home. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 37:29</a> says: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:115:16-19:115:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 115:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Isaiah 45:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">After God created the earth, he said that it “was very good,” and he still feels that way. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:31-1:1:31" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 1:31</a>) Far from planning to destroy it, he promises to “bring to ruin those ruining the earth”<wbr />—and to protect it from permanent damage.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:11:18-66:11:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 11:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">You may wonder, though, about <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:7-61:3:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:7</a>. That Bible verse says: “The heavens and the earth that are now are stored up for fire.” Does this not show that the earth will be burned up? Actually, the Bible sometimes uses the terms “heavens,” “earth,” and “fire” figuratively, as symbols. For example, when <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:11:1-1:11:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 11:1</a> says: “All the earth continued to be of one language,” it uses “earth” to mean human society.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The context of <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:7-61:3:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:7</a> shows that the heavens, earth, and fire mentioned there are also symbols. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:5-61:3:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Verses 5 and 6</a> draw a parallel with the Flood of Noah’s day. On that occasion, an ancient world was destroyed, yet our planet did not disappear. Instead, the Flood wiped out a violent society, or “earth.” It also destroyed a kind of “heavens”<wbr />—the people who ruled over that earthly society. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:11-1:6:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 6:11</a>) In the same way, <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:7-61:3:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:7</a> foretells the permanent destruction of wicked society and its corrupt governments as if by fire.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>THE BIBLE’S ANSWER: </strong><em>“The world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.”<wbr /></em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:17-62:2:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 JOHN 2:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">“The world” that is to pass away is, not the earth, but the world of mankind whose lives are not in harmony with God’s will. Just as a surgeon might remove a cancerous tumor to save a patient’s life, God will “cut off” the wicked so that good <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>people can truly enjoy life on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:9-19:37:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 37:9</a>) In that sense, “the end of the world” is a good thing.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Such a positive view of “the end of the world” is implied by the Bible translations that render this expression “the conclusion of the system of things” or “the end of the age.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3</a>; <em>New International Version</em>) Since both humankind and the earth survive the end, does it not seem reasonable that a new age, a new system of things, would follow? The Bible answers yes, for it speaks of “the coming system of things.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:18:30-42:18:30" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 18:30</a>.</p>

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">The Bible likens the world’s destruction to the onset of labor<wbr />—the mother’s pain is inevitable and comes suddenly. The time leading up to the end is also like a pregnancy, for an expectant mother is aware of ever-increasing signs of the coming birth. Her doctor might estimate the birth date; yet, even if the event should delay, she would still be sure that her baby will soon be born. Similarly, any mistaken expectations about the end do not alter the unmistakable features identifying these as “the last days.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">‘If the sign that we are near the end is so obvious,’ you might ask, ‘why do so many people fail to recognize it?’ The Bible shows that when the end is near, many will belittle the evidence. Rather than acknowledge the fundamental changes during the last days, they would scoff: “From the day our forefathers fell asleep in death, all things are continuing exactly <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>as from creation’s beginning.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:3-61:3:4" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:3, 4</a>) In other words, the sign of the last days is clear, but many will ignore it.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:38-40:24:39" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Matthew 24:38, 39</a>.</p>

<div class="boxSupplement"><aside><div id="p43" data-pid="43" class="boxTtl"><div><strong>HAVE JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES GIVEN INCORRECT DATES FOR THE END?</strong></div></div>
<div class="boxContent"><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sc">Jehovah’s Witnesses have had wrong expectations about when the end would come. Like Jesus’ first-century disciples, we have sometimes looked forward to the fulfillment of prophecy ahead of God’s timetable. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:19:11-42:19:11" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Luke 19:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:1:6-44:1:6" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Acts 1:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/53:2:1-53:2:2" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 2 Thessalonians 2:1, 2</a>) We agree with the sentiment of longtime Witness A. H. Macmillan, who said: “I learned that we should admit our mistakes and continue searching God’s Word for more enlightenment.”</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sc">  Why, then, do we continue to highlight the nearness of the end? Because we take seriously Jesus’ words: “Keep looking, keep awake.” The alternative, to be found “sleeping” by Jesus, would prevent us from gaining his favor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:13:33-41:13:33" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Mark 13:33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:13:36-41:13:36" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 36</a>) Why?</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sc">  Consider this example: A lookout in a fire tower might see what he thinks is a wisp of smoke on the horizon and sound what proves to be a false alarm. Later, though, his alertness could save lives.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sc">  Likewise, we have had some wrong expectations about the end. But we are more concerned with obeying Jesus and saving lives than with avoiding criticism. Jesus’ command to “give a thorough witness” compels us to warn others about the end.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:10:42-44:10:42" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Acts 10:42</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sc">  We believe that even more important than focusing on <em>when </em>the end will come, we must be confident that it <em>will </em>come, and we must act accordingly. We take seriously the words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/35:2:3-35:2:3" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Habakkuk 2:3</a>, which says: “Even if [the end] should delay [compared to what you thought], keep in expectation of it; for it will without fail come true. It will not be late.”</p>

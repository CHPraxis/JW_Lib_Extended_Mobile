STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Jehovah’s Reminders Are Trustworthy
▪  Make Jehovah’s Reminders the Exultation of Your Heart
Jehovah has always used reminders to guide and direct his people. What are some of those reminders? The first article explains why we can trust that God’s reminders are always for our benefit. The second discusses three ways that we can strengthen this trust.

▪  Have You Been Transformed?
▪  Make Personal Decisions Wisely
Both the way we were raised and the people around us can powerfully influence the way we think and make decisions. How can we make sure that our decisions please God? And what can help us to do what we have decided to do? These articles will help us to find out if we need to change the way we think or make decisions.

▪  Pioneering Strengthens Our Relationship With God
We will discuss eight ways that a Christian’s friendship with Jehovah can be strengthened by pioneering. If you are pioneering now, what will help you to continue even during difficult times? If you want to pioneer and enjoy the blessings that come from pioneering, what can you do?

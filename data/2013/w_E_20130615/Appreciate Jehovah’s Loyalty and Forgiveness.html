<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Loyalty is a warm quality that includes devotion, faithfulness, and unswerving allegiance. A loyal person is not fickle. Rather, he lovingly attaches himself to someone (or something), sticking closely to that person (or thing) even through difficult circumstances. Yes, Jehovah is the supremely “loyal One.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:16:5-66:16:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rev. 16:5</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>How does Jehovah demonstrate loyalty? He never abandons his faithful worshippers. One such worshipper, King David, testified to Jehovah’s loyalty. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:22:26-10:22:26" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong><em>2 Samuel 22:26</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>During David’s trials, <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>Jehovah loyally guided, protected, and delivered him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:22:1-10:22:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Sam. 22:1</a>) David knew that Jehovah’s loyalty involves more than mere words. Why did Jehovah act loyally toward David? Because David himself was “someone loyal.” Jehovah cherishes the loyalty of his worshippers, and he repays it with loyalty toward them.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:2:6-20:2:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Prov. 2:6-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>We can gain strength from reflecting on Jehovah’s acts of loyalty. “It really helps me when I read about how Jehovah dealt with David in times of distress,” says a faithful brother named Reed. “Even when David was on the run, living in and out of caves, Jehovah always sustained him. I find that very encouraging! It reminds me that no matter what the circumstance might be, no matter how bleak the situation might seem, Jehovah will be there for me as long as I remain loyal to him.” No doubt, you feel the same way.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:8:38-45:8:39" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 8:38, 39</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>In what other ways does Jehovah demonstrate loyalty, and with what benefit to his worshippers?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>In what other ways does Jehovah demonstrate loyalty? He remains true to his standards. “Even to one’s old age I am the same,” he assures us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:46:4-23:46:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa. 46:4</a>) He always makes decisions based on his unchanging standards of right and wrong. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:3:6-39:3:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mal. 3:6</a>) In addition, Jehovah demonstrates loyalty by remaining faithful to his word of promise. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 55:11</a>) Jehovah’s loyalty thus benefits all of his faithful worshippers. How so?

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>We can also imitate Jehovah’s loyalty by remaining true to those whom we love.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:5:15-20:5:18" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Prov. 5:15-18</a>) So we do not take even the first step down a path that could lead to adultery. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:28-40:5:28" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 5:28</a>) In addition, we show loyalty to our fellow believers by shunning hurtful gossip or slander, refusing to spread such negative talk or even to listen to it.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:12:18-20:12:18" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Prov. 12:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>9, 10. </strong>(a) To whom especially do we want to remain loyal? (b) Why will obeying Jehovah’s commands not always be easy?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Above all, we want to remain loyal to Jehovah. How do we do that? By striving to view things the way that he views them<wbr />—loving what he loves and hating what he hates—<wbr />and then conducting ourselves accordingly. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:97:10-19:97:10" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong><em>Psalm 97:10</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>The more we bring our thoughts and feelings into harmony with Jehovah’s thoughts and feelings, the more we will be inclined to obey his commands.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:119:104-19:119:104" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 119:104</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:7:39-46:7:39" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:39</a>) A single sister might see that her unbelieving coworkers are always trying to introduce her to some potential mate.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>What does it mean to be forgiving?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Among Jehovah’s most endearing qualities is his willingness to forgive. What does it mean to be forgiving? Basically, it involves pardoning an offender when there is a valid basis for doing so. That is not to say that a forgiving person condones the offense or denies that it happened. Rather, he chooses to let go of resentment. The Scriptures teach that Jehovah is “ready to forgive” those who show genuine repentance.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:86:5-19:86:5" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 86:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>(a) How does Jehovah demonstrate forgiveness? (b) What does it mean to have one’s sins “blotted out”?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>How does Jehovah demonstrate forgiveness? When Jehovah forgives, he does so “in a large way”; he forgives both <em>completely </em>and <em>permanently. </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:7-23:55:7" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Isa. 55:7</a>) How do we know that Jehovah forgives <em>completely? </em>Consider the assurance found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 3:19</strong></a><strong>. (<em>Read.</em>) </strong>The apostle Peter urged his listeners to “repent . . . and turn around.” When a sinner genuinely repents, he deeply regrets his wrong course. He is also determined not to repeat his sin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:7:10-47:7:11" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Cor. 7:10, 11</a>) Moreover, true repentance moves a sinner to “turn around,” abandoning his <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>wrong course and pursuing a course that is pleasing to God. If Peter’s listeners would manifest such genuine repentance, what would be the result? Peter said that they could get their sins “blotted out.” That expression comes from a Greek word that means to “wipe out, erase.” So when Jehovah forgives, he wipes the slate clean. He forgives completely.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:22-58:10:22" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Heb. 10:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:1:7-62:1:7" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 1 John 1:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>Of what do the words “their sin I shall remember no more” assure us?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>How do we know that Jehovah’s forgiveness is <em>permanent? </em>Consider Jeremiah’s prophecy concerning the new covenant, made with anointed Christians, which makes true forgiveness possible for those who exercise faith in the ransom. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:31:34-24:31:34" data-bid="29-1" class="b"><strong><em>Jeremiah 31:34</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>Jehovah says: “I shall forgive their error, and their sin I shall remember no more.” So Jehovah assures us that once he forgives, he will never in the future act against us because of those sins. He does not rehash our sins in order to accuse us or punish us again and again. Rather, Jehovah forgives those sins and puts them behind him<wbr />—permanently.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:4:7-45:4:8" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Rom. 4:7, 8</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>We can gain comfort from meditating on Jehovah’s forgiveness. Consider an example. Many years ago, a sister whom we will call Elaine was disfellowshipped. Several years later, she was reinstated. “Although I told myself and others that I believed that I was forgiven by Jehovah,” admits Elaine, “I always felt that somehow he was at a distance or that others were closer to him and that he was more real to them.” However, Elaine drew comfort from reading and meditating on some of the word pictures that the Bible uses to describe Jehovah’s forgiveness. “I felt Jehovah’s love and tenderness toward me in a way that I had never realized before,” Elaine adds. She was especially moved by this thought: “When Jehovah forgives our sins, we need not feel that we bear the stain of such sins for the rest of our life.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Elaine says: “I realized that I had not believed that Jehovah could fully forgive me, and I thought that I would carry this burden for the rest of my life. I know that it will take time, but I am starting to feel that I really can draw closer to Jehovah, and I feel that a weight has been lifted off me.” What a loving and forgiving God we serve!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:103:9-19:103:9" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ps. 103:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>We can imitate Jehovah’s forgiveness by choosing to be forgiving toward one another whenever there is a basis for doing so. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:17:3-42:17:4" data-bid="32-1" class="b"><strong><em>Luke 17:3, 4</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>Recall that when Jehovah forgives, he forgets our sins in the sense that he does not thereafter hold them against us.

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>16. </strong>(a) Does being forgiving mean that we condone offenses or let others take advantage of us? Explain. (b) To be forgiven by God, what must we do?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Being forgiving does not mean that we condone offenses or allow others to take unfair advantage of us. No. It basically means that we choose to let go of resentment. Significantly, though, in order to be forgiven by God, we must imitate Jehovah’s forgiveness in our dealings with others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:14-40:6:15" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matt. 6:14, 15</a>) After <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>all, empathy moves Jehovah to remember that “we are dust.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:103:14-19:103:14" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 103:14</a>) Really, then, should not empathy move us to make allowances for the shortcomings of others, forgiving them freely from the heart?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:32-49:4:32" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Eph. 4:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:13-51:3:13" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Col. 3:13</a>.</p>

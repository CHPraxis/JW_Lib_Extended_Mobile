STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Appreciate Jehovah’s Qualities to the Full
▪  Appreciate Jehovah’s Generosity and Reasonableness
▪  Appreciate Jehovah’s Loyalty and Forgiveness
Many Christians think of Jehovah as having four principal attributes. But these three articles will deepen our appreciation for several qualities of Jehovah that are studied less often. In the case of each quality, we will consider the questions: What is its meaning? How does Jehovah demonstrate it? And how can we imitate Jehovah in showing it?
▪  Let Jehovah’s Discipline Mold You
Describing Jehovah’s sovereign authority over humans in an illustrative way, the Scriptures refer to Jehovah as “our Potter.” (Isa. 64:8) This article shows what we can learn about the Great Potter from the way he has molded individuals and nations in times past. It also discusses how we may benefit from his molding today.

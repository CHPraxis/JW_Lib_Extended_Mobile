BIBLE QUESTIONS ANSWERED



Why is Jesus called God’s Son?

God does not have a literal wife with whom he fathered children. He is the Creator of all life. Humans were created with the capacity to imitate God’s qualities. That is why the first human that God created, Adam, is called a “son of God.” Similarly, Jesus is called “the Son of God” because he was created with qualities like those of his Father.—Read Luke 3:38; John 1:14, 49.



When was Jesus created?

God created Jesus before creating Adam. In fact, God created Jesus and then used him to make everything else, including the angels. That is why the Bible calls Jesus “the firstborn of all creation” by God.—Read Colossians 1:15, 16.
Before he was born in Bethlehem, Jesus lived as a spirit creature in heaven. When the time came, God transferred Jesus’ life from heaven to Mary’s womb so that he could be born as a human.—Read Luke 1:30-32; John 6:38; 8:23.
Why did God have Jesus born on earth as a human? What special role did Jesus fulfill? You can find the answers to those questions in the Bible, and they will greatly enhance your understanding and appreciation of what God and Jesus have done for you.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class = "themeScrp">“All the days of the afflicted one are bad; but the one that is good at heart has a feast constantly.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:15-20:15:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHAT do those words mean? They refer to one’s mental and emotional state. “The afflicted one” dwells on the negative<wbr />—an outlook that makes his days “bad,” or dismal. By contrast, the one who “is good at heart” tries to focus on the positive<wbr />—an attitude that fosters inner joy, giving him “a feast constantly.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We all have problems that can rob us of a measure of happiness. Yet, we may be able to do certain things that help us to retain our joy through difficult times. Consider what the Bible says.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">  Do not let anxieties over tomorrow weigh you down today. Jesus Christ said: “Do not worry about tomorrow; it will have enough worries of its own. There is no need to add to the troubles each day brings.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:34-40:6:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:34</a>, <em>Good News Translation.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  Try to focus on the good things that have happened to you. In fact, when you feel down, why not make a list of those good things and reflect on them? Also, do not dwell on past mistakes or bad deeds. Learn from them, and move on. Be like a driver who <em>glances </em>into his rearview mirror but does not <em>focus </em>on it. Keep in mind, too, that “there is the true forgiveness with [God].”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:130:4-19:130:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 130:4</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">  When anxieties weigh you down, confide in someone who may be able to cheer you up. “Anxious care” causes our heart “to bow down, but <em>the good word </em>is what makes it rejoice,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:12:25-20:12:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 12:25</a>. That “good word” may come from a family member or a trusted friend<wbr />—someone who is not cynical or pessimistic but “is loving all the time.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The wise sayings found in the Bible have helped many to find more joy in life, even through trying times. May those precious sayings help you too.</p>

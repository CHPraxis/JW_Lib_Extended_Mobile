<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In 2012, one of Germany’s highest courts ruled that people cannot formally quit a church with the status of a public corporation and still remain a member of that religious community. Catholics who formally quit their church, and thus no longer pay the church tax, yet continue practicing their faith may be barred from Communion, confession, positions of office, and possibly even a church burial.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In late 2012, Bolivia conducted a national census. So that the census would be accurate, Bolivians were required to remain at home on the day in question. Additionally, private traffic was forbidden, borders were closed, and alcohol consumption was banned.</p>

Through play, parents help their children develop their imagination and a “sense of rules,” says Andrea Angiolino, a professional designer of board games.</p>

Do You Have “a Feast Constantly”?

“All the days of the afflicted one are bad; but the one that is good at heart has a feast constantly.”—Proverbs 15:15.



WHAT do those words mean? They refer to one’s mental and emotional state. “The afflicted one” dwells on the negative—an outlook that makes his days “bad,” or dismal. By contrast, the one who “is good at heart” tries to focus on the positive—an attitude that fosters inner joy, giving him “a feast constantly.”
We all have problems that can rob us of a measure of happiness. Yet, we may be able to do certain things that help us to retain our joy through difficult times. Consider what the Bible says.
  Do not let anxieties over tomorrow weigh you down today. Jesus Christ said: “Do not worry about tomorrow; it will have enough worries of its own. There is no need to add to the troubles each day brings.”—Matthew 6:34, Good News Translation.

  Try to focus on the good things that have happened to you. In fact, when you feel down, why not make a list of those good things and reflect on them? Also, do not dwell on past mistakes or bad deeds. Learn from them, and move on. Be like a driver who glances into his rearview mirror but does not focus on it. Keep in mind, too, that “there is the true forgiveness with [God].”—Psalm 130:4.

  When anxieties weigh you down, confide in someone who may be able to cheer you up. “Anxious care” causes our heart “to bow down, but the good word is what makes it rejoice,” says Proverbs 12:25. That “good word” may come from a family member or a trusted friend—someone who is not cynical or pessimistic but “is loving all the time.”—Proverbs 17:17.


The wise sayings found in the Bible have helped many to find more joy in life, even through trying times. May those precious sayings help you too.

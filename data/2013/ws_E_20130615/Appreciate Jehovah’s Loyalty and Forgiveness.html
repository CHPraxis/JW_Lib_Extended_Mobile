He <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>always supports his faithful servants.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:22:1-10:22:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Samuel 22:1</a>) David saw in his own life that Jehovah shows loyalty not just with words but by helping his servants. Why was Jehovah loyal to David? Because David was loyal to him. Jehovah loves his servants for their loyalty, and he is loyal to those who are loyal to him.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:2:6-20:2:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:6-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>We feel encouraged when we think about how loyal Jehovah is to his servants. One faithful brother named Reed said that he likes to read about how Jehovah helped David through difficult situations. He explained: “Even when David was on the run, living in and out of caves, Jehovah always sustained him. I find that very encouraging! It reminds me that no matter what the circumstance might be, no matter how bleak the situation might seem, Jehovah will be there for me as long as I remain loyal to him.” Surely, you feel that same way.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:8:38-45:8:39" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 8:38, 39</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:3:6-39:3:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Malachi 3:6</a>) Another way Jehovah shows that he is loyal is that he always does what he promises to do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:11</a>) Because Jehovah is loyal, all of his faithful servants benefit. How?

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>What does it mean to be forgiving?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>What does it mean to be forgiving? A forgiving person chooses not to stay upset with others for something that they have done against him. This does not mean that he approves of what they did or that he pretends it never happened. Rather, he decides not to be upset. One of Jehovah’s most wonderful qualities is that he is forgiving. The Bible says that Jehovah is “ready to forgive” those who truly repent.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:86:5-19:86:5" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 86:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>(a) How forgiving is Jehovah? (b) What did Peter mean when he said that a person’s sins can be “blotted out”?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>How forgiving is Jehovah? The Bible says that Jehovah forgives “in a large way.” This means that he forgives both <strong>completely </strong>and <strong>permanently. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:7-23:55:7" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:7</a>) How do we know that Jehovah forgives <strong>completely? </strong>Think about the promise at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 3:19</strong></a><strong>. (Read.) </strong>The apostle Peter said that if a sinner truly repents, he feels sorry for his bad course. How can a person who has sinned be forgiven by Jehovah? Peter said that the sinner must “repent” and “turn around.” A person who truly repents decides that he is not going to repeat his sin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:7:10-47:7:11" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 7:10, 11</a>) This person then turns around, that is, he stops doing what is wrong and does everything he can to please God. Then his sin can be “blotted out.” To blot out means to wipe out, or erase. So when Jehovah forgives, it is as if he erases our sins. Jehovah forgives completely.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:22-58:10:22" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:1:7-62:1:7" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 1 John 1:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>How do we know that Jehovah forgives our sins <strong>permanently? </strong>We learn how forgiving Jehovah is from something he said to Jeremiah in a prophecy about anointed Christians. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:31:34-24:31:34" data-bid="29-1" class="b"><strong>Jeremiah 31:34</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jehovah said: “I shall forgive their error, and their sin I shall remember no more.” So once Jehovah forgives, he does not keep thinking about our sins so that he can accuse us or punish us again <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>and again. He forgives our sins permanently.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:4:7-45:4:8" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Romans 4:7, 8</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>We can be comforted when we meditate on how forgiving Jehovah is. Let us discuss the example of a sister we will call Elaine. Many years ago, she was disfellowshipped. Several years later, she was accepted back into the congregation. Even so, Elaine says that she did not really believe that Jehovah had forgiven her. She felt that Jehovah loved others more than he loved her. But Elaine was comforted when she meditated on how the Bible describes Jehovah’s forgiveness. For example, she read that when Jehovah forgives, it is as if Jehovah washes us clean of our sins. We do not need to feel guilty about them for the rest of our life.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (See footnote.) Elaine adds: “I realized that I had not believed that Jehovah could fully forgive me, and I thought that I would carry this burden for the rest of my life. I know that it will take time, but I am starting to feel that I really can draw closer to Jehovah, and I feel that a weight has been lifted off me.” Jehovah is truly a loving and forgiving God!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:103:9-19:103:9" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 103:9</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:14-40:6:15" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matthew 6:14, 15</a>) Jehovah remembers that “we are dust.” He understands that we are imperfect.

Think about what happened to Job. Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar were supposed to be Job’s friends. But they insulted him and accused him of doing bad things. Job felt very hurt.

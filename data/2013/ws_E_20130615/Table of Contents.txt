STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Appreciate Jehovah’s Qualities to the Full
▪  Appreciate Jehovah’s Generosity and Reasonableness
▪  Appreciate Jehovah’s Loyalty and Forgiveness
As Christians, we know that Jehovah’s four main qualities are love, justice, wisdom, and power. But these three articles will help us to understand and to value several qualities of Jehovah that we may study less often. For each quality, we will answer these questions: What does this quality mean? How does Jehovah show it? And how can we imitate Jehovah in showing this quality?
▪  Let Jehovah’s Discipline Mold You
The Bible gives an illustration to show the kind of authority Jehovah has over humans. He is like a potter. (Isaiah 64:8) This article shows what we can learn about Jehovah from the way he has molded people and nations in the past. It also discusses how we can benefit when he molds us today.

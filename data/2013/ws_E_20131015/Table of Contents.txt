STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Creation Reveals the Living God
An invisible God created the universe. Do you truly believe that? Not all people do. How can we help others learn the truth about the Creator and at the same time strengthen our own faith in him? This article will help us to learn to do that.

▪  “Slave for Jehovah”
Christians are encouraged to be slaves for Jehovah. This article teaches us about the special law Jehovah made for slaves. We will also learn how we can avoid becoming slaves to Satan and his world and how we benefit from being faithful to our God.

▪  Lessons From a Well-Prepared Prayer
▪  Act in Harmony With Jesus’ Loving Prayer
If we daily meditate on God’s Word, our prayers will be more meaningful. In the first article, we will learn how meditating on God’s Word helped the Levites offer a meaningful prayer for God’s people. The second article shows how we can act in harmony with one of Jesus’ loving prayers. Both prayers are examples of how we should put Jehovah’s will before our own requests.

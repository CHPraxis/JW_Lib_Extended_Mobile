<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb">ESTHER tried to calm her heart as she approached the courtyard in the palace at Shushan. It was not easy. Everything about the castle was designed to inspire awe​—its multicolored relief sculptures of winged bulls, archers, and lions of glazed brickwork, its fluted stone columns and imposing statues, even its position atop huge platforms near the snowcapped Zagros Mountains and overlooking the pure waters of the river Choaspes. All of it was intended to remind each visitor of the immense power of the man whom Esther was going to see, the one who called himself “the great king.” He was also her husband.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Husband!

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:12-1:21:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 21:12</a>) The king knew little or nothing of Esther’s God, Jehovah, or of His Law. Ahasuerus knew Persian law, though, including a law forbidding the very thing that Esther was about to do. What was that? Well, the law said that anyone who appeared before the Persian monarch without first being summoned by the king was liable to death. Esther had not been summoned, but she was going to the king anyway. As she drew near to the inner courtyard, where she would be visible from the king’s throne, she may have felt that she was walking to her death.​—<strong><em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:4:11-17:4:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong><em>Esther 4:11;</em></strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:5:1-17:5:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> <strong><em>5:1</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Esther was an orphan. We know very little of the parents who named her Hadassah, a Hebrew word for “myrtle,” a lovely white-blossomed shrub. When Esther’s parents died, one of her relatives, a kindly man named Mordecai, took pity on the child. He was her cousin, but Mordecai was much older. He brought Esther into his home and treated her as his own daughter.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:5-17:2:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Esther 2:5-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:15-17:2:15" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 15</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Mordecai and Esther lived as Jewish exiles in that Persian capital, where they probably had to deal with a measure of disdain because of their religion and the Law they tried to follow. But Esther surely drew closer to her cousin as he taught her about Jehovah, the merciful God who had rescued His people from trouble many times in the past​—and would do so again. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:44-3:26:45" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Lev. 26:44, 45</a>) Clearly, a loving and loyal bond grew between Esther and Mordecai.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Mordecai evidently worked as some kind of official at the castle at Shushan, regularly sitting within its gate, along with other servants of the king.

Perhaps she enjoyed going to the market in Shushan, where goldsmiths, silversmiths, and other merchants displayed their wares. Esther could not have imagined that such luxuries would later become commonplace to her; she had no idea of the future in store for her.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>One day, Shushan was buzzing with gossip about turmoil in the household of <span id="page127" class="pageNum" data-no="127" data-before-text="127"></span>the king. At a grand feast, where Ahasuerus was entertaining his noblemen with sumptuous food and wine, the king decided to summon his beautiful queen, Vashti, who was feasting separately with the women. But Vashti refused to come. Humiliated and enraged, the king asked his advisers how Vashti should be punished. The result? She was deposed as queen. The king’s servants began searching throughout the land for beautiful young virgins; from among them the king would select a new queen.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:1:1-17:2:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Esther 1:1–2:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>(a) Why might Mordecai have felt some concern about Esther as she grew up? (b) How do you think we might apply the Bible’s balanced view of physical beauty? (See also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:30-20:31:30" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:30</a>.)</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>We may imagine Mordecai gazing fondly at Esther from time to time and noting with a mixture of pride and concern that his little cousin was grown-up​—and had turned out to be a remarkable beauty. “The young woman was pretty in form and beautiful in appearance,” we read. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:7-17:2:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Esther 2:7</a>) The Bible presents a balanced view of physical beauty​—it is delightful, but it needs to be coupled with wisdom and humility. Otherwise, it may breed vanity, pride, and other ugly traits of the heart. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:22-20:11:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong><em>Proverbs 11:22</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>Have you ever seen that to be true?

<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>(a) What happened when the king’s servants noticed Esther, and why must her parting from Mordecai have been difficult?

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The king’s servants noticed Esther. They gathered her up in their search, taking her away from Mordecai and off to the grand palace across the river. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:8-17:2:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Esther 2:8</a>) It must have been a difficult parting, for the two were like father and daughter.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Esther found herself ushered into a world that was entirely new and strange to her. She was among “many young women” <span id="page128" class="pageNum" data-no="128" data-before-text="128"></span>who had been gathered from far and wide in the Persian Empire. Their customs, languages, and attitudes must have varied greatly. Placed under the charge of an official named Hegai, the young women were to undergo an extensive beauty treatment, a yearlong program that included massages with fragrant oils. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:8-17:2:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Esther 2:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:12-17:2:12" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 12</a>) Such an environment and lifestyle might easily have bred an obsession with personal appearance among those young women, along with vanity and competitiveness. How was Esther affected?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>No one on earth could have been more concerned about Esther than Mordecai was. We read that day by day, he made his way as near as he could to the house of the women and endeavored to learn of Esther’s welfare. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:11-17:2:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Esther 2:11</a>) As bits of information trickled out to him, perhaps through cooperative servants <span id="page129" class="pageNum" data-no="129" data-before-text="129"></span>in the household, he must have beamed with fatherly pride.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Esther so impressed Hegai that he treated her with great loving-kindness, giving her seven servant girls and the best place in the house of the women. The account even says: “All the while Esther was continually gaining favor in the eyes of everyone seeing her.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:9-17:2:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Esther 2:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:15-17:2:15" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 15</a>) Would beauty alone have impressed everyone so profoundly?

When they do so, like Esther, they make the heart of their heavenly Father rejoice.​—<strong><em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong><em>Proverbs 27:11</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>When the time came for Esther to be presented to the king, she was given the liberty to select any items that she thought she might need, perhaps to beautify herself further. Modestly, though, she asked for nothing beyond what Hegai mentioned to her. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:15-17:2:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Esther 2:15</a>) She probably realized that beauty alone would not win the king’s heart; a modest and humble spirit would prove a far rarer commodity in that court. Was she right?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>The account answers: “The king came to love Esther more than all the other women, so that she gained more favor and loving-kindness before him than all the other virgins.

Did her new position go to her head, filling her with pride? Far from it!</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu"><strong>17. </strong>(a) In what ways did Esther remain obedient to her adoptive father? (b) Why is Esther’s example an important one for us today?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Esther remained obedient to her adoptive father, Mordecai. She kept her connection to the Jewish people a secret. Further, when Mordecai uncovered a plot to assassinate Ahasuerus, Esther obediently passed his warning along to the king, and the plotters were foiled. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:2:20-17:2:23" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Esther 2:20-23</a>) She still expressed faith in her God by showing a humble, obedient spirit.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu"><strong>18. </strong>(a) Why might Mordecai have refused to bow down to Haman? (See also footnote.) (b) How do men and women of faith today imitate the example of Mordecai?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>A man named Haman rose to prominence in the court of Ahasuerus. The king appointed him prime minister, making Haman his principal adviser and the second in command in the empire. The king even decreed that all who saw this official must bow down to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:3:1-17:3:4" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Esther 3:1-4</a>) For Mordecai, that law posed a problem. He believed in obeying the king but not at the cost of disrespecting God. You see, Haman was an Agagite. That evidently means that he was a descendant of Agag, the Amalekite king who was executed by God’s prophet Samuel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:15:33-9:15:33" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Sam. 15:33</a>) So wicked were the Amalekites that they had made themselves enemies of Jehovah and Israel.

Mordecai could not. He stood his ground. To this day, men and women of faith have risked their lives to adhere to this principle: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:29-44:5:29" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu"><strong>19. </strong>What did Haman want to do, and how did he go about persuading the king?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Haman was enraged. But it was not enough for him to find a way to kill off Mordecai. He wanted to exterminate all of Mordecai’s people! Haman persuaded the king by painting a dark portrait of the Jews. Without naming them, he implied that they were inconsequential, a people “scattered and separated among the peoples.” Even worse, he said that they did not obey the king’s laws; hence, they were dangerous rebels. He proposed to donate to the king’s treasury an immense sum of money to cover the expense of slaughtering all the Jews in the empire.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> Ahasuerus gave Haman the king’s own signet ring to seal any order that he had in mind.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:3:5-17:3:10" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Esther 3:5-10</a>.</p>

Imagine the impact of such a proclamation when it reached far-off Jerusalem, where a remnant of Jews who had returned from exile in Babylon were struggling to rebuild a city that still had no wall to defend it. Perhaps Mordecai thought of them, as well as of his own friends and relatives in Shushan, when he heard the terrible news. Distraught, he ripped his clothes, wore sackcloth and placed ashes on his head, and cried aloud in the middle of the city. Haman, however, sat drinking with the king, unmoved by the grief he had stirred up among the many Jews and their friends in Shushan.​—<strong><em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:3:12-17:4:1" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong><em>Esther 3:12–4:1</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

Esther heard of his distress and sent clothes to him, but Mordecai refused to take comfort.

She was afraid, as she freely revealed in her reply to Mordecai. She reminded him of the king’s law. To appear before the king unsummoned meant a death sentence. Only if the king held out his golden scepter was the offender spared. And did Esther have any reason to expect such clemency, especially in view of Vashti’s fate when she had refused the king’s command to appear? Esther told Mordecai that the king had not invited her to see him in 30 days!

He assured her that if she failed to act, salvation for the Jews would arise from some other source. But how could she expect to be spared once the persecution gathered force?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:23:14-6:23:14" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Josh. 23:14</a>) Then Mordecai asked Esther: “Who is there knowing whether it is for a time like this that you have attained to royal <span id="page134" class="pageNum" data-no="134" data-before-text="134"></span>dignity?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:4:12-17:4:14" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Esther 4:12-14</a>) Is not Mordecai worthy of imitation?

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><strong><sup>25 </sup></strong>As described at the outset of this chapter, Esther made her way to the king’s court. We can only imagine the anxious thoughts and fervent prayers filling her mind and heart. She entered the courtyard, where she could see Ahasuerus on his throne. Perhaps she tried to read the expression on his face​—the face that was framed by the carefully tended, symmetrical curls of his hair and of his squared beard. If she had to wait, it must have felt like an eternity. But the moment passed​—her husband saw her. He was surely surprised, but his expression softened. He held out his golden scepter!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:5:1-17:5:2" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Esther 5:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu"><strong>26. </strong>Why do true Christians need courage like Esther’s, and why was her work only beginning?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><strong><sup>26 </sup></strong>Esther had gained an audience, a hearing ear. She had taken a stand for her God and for her people, setting a beautiful example of faith for all servants of God down through time. True Christians today cherish such examples. Jesus said that his genuine followers would be marked by self-sacrificing love. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="31-1" class="b"><strong><em>John 13:34, 35</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>Showing such love often requires courage like Esther’s. But even after Esther stood up for God’s people that day, her work was only beginning. How would she convince the king that his favorite adviser, Haman, was a wicked schemer? How could she help to save her people? We will consider these questions in the following chapter.</p>

<div class="groupFootnote"><div><p id="p35" data-pid="35">Ahasuerus is widely thought to have been Xerxes I, who ruled the Persian Empire early in the fifth century B.C.E.</p></div>

<div><p id="p37" data-pid="37">Haman may have been among the very last of the Amalekites, since “the remnant” of them had been destroyed back in the days of King Hezekiah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:4:43-13:4:43" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Chron. 4:43</a>.</p></div>
<div><p id="p38" data-pid="38">Haman offered 10,000 silver talents, worth hundreds of millions of dollars today. If Ahasuerus was Xerxes I, the money might have made Haman’s offer more appealing. Xerxes needed a vast store of funds to carry out his long-proposed but ultimately disastrous war against Greece.</p></div>
<div><p id="p39" data-pid="39">Xerxes I was known for his mercurial, violent temper. The Greek historian Herodotus recorded some examples from Xerxes’ war against Greece. The king ordered that a pontoon bridge of ships be built across the strait of Hellespont. When a storm ruined the bridge, Xerxes ordered the engineers beheaded and even had his men “punish” the Hellespont by whipping the water while an insulting proclamation was read aloud. In the same campaign, when a wealthy man begged that his son be excused from joining the army, Xerxes had the son cut in half, his body displayed as a warning.</p></div>

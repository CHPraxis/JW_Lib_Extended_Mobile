<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Our inability to avoid error shows that sin is a deeper problem than simply committing wrong acts. We all <em>inherit </em>sin. We get sick, grow old, and die, not because we choose to do bad deeds, but primarily because we are <em>born </em>imperfect, inclined to error. We cannot rid ourselves of this inclination by our own efforts. “Who can produce someone clean out of someone unclean? There is not one.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:14:4-18:14:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 14:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Adam and Eve were created perfect<wbr />—not inclined to error. When they chose to sin, they became like a dented cake pan that could produce only a dented cake. Thus, we have no choice in the matter. We all carry a dent like theirs<wbr />—various imperfections and wrong inclinations. In a word, the sin we inherited from Adam and Eve. But does that really matter?</p>

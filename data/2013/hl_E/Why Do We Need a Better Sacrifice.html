<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Since the temple and priesthood no longer exist, it is not possible to offer the sacrifices required by the Law for the atonement of sins. But God has not left us without hope. The Scriptures point to a permanent solution, “a new covenant,” by means of which Jehovah promises: “I shall forgive their error, and <em>their sin I shall remember no more.” </em>By means of this “new covenant,” God provides the basis for forgiving all of our sins forever.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:31:31-24:31:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">When Adam rebelled against God, he lost the prospect of endless life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:17-1:3:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 3:17-19</a>) As our common progenitor, Adam could pass on to us only imperfection and death.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">An equal exchange is required<wbr />—‘soul for soul,’ that is, life for life.

Only someone with such a perfect life, uncontaminated by sin inherited from Adam, could provide the atoning sacrifice.

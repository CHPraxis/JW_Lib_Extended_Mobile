SECTION 1
Will We Ever Enjoy Real Happiness?

“The meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”—PSALM 37:11.








EVERYONE wants to be happy. But many problems threaten our personal and family happiness, including armed conflict. A resident of the Middle East put it this way, “It is always the day before a war, a war, or the day after a war.”



What do you think? Is life today the way it should be?

The current state of human society is in many ways contrary to our natural desire for a peaceful, secure, and happy life.



Must things always be this way?

The Scriptures show how we can enjoy a happier life now and in the future.

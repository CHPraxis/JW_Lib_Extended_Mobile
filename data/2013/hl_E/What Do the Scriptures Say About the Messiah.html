<div class="boxContent"><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sc">  Over time, many have claimed to be the Messiah or have been hailed as the Messiah by their followers.</p>
<h3 id="p32" data-pid="32"><strong>Has anyone ever fit the prophetic picture?</strong></h3>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sc">  Many people thought Jesus did so, since he appeared at the right time and place and was a descendant of David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:1:6-40:1:6" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 1:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:1:16-40:1:16" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:2:4-42:2:7" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> Luke 2:4-7</a>) Despite the negative image his name evokes for some, it is instructive to consider what he said and did.</p>
<h3 id="p34" data-pid="34"><strong>What did he <em>really </em>teach?</strong></h3>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sc">  He never claimed to be God, but said: “The Father is greater than I am.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:28-43:14:28" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 14:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sc">  The principles he taught were all in line with the Hebrew Scriptures. He said: “Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill; for truly I say to you that sooner would heaven and earth pass away than for one smallest letter or one particle of a letter to pass away from the Law.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:17-40:5:18" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 5:17, 18</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sc">  He would never have approved the shocking things that Christendom’s churches have taught and done<wbr />—supposedly in his name.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sc">  He was fair and honest as well as kind to women, children, and the sick. He defended the poor and the oppressed.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sc">  People of all kinds were drawn to his good qualities and his teaching.</p>

INTRODUCTION



WHO ARE JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES?






  Our name comes from the Scriptures: “‘You are my witnesses,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.”—Isaiah 43:10.

  In more than 230 lands and in some 630 languages, we bear witness about the true God and his loving purpose for mankind as set out in the Scriptures.

  We are not part of Christendom’s churches; nor are we part of Judaism or Islam.

  We do not ask for money.

  We recognize that religious matters are sensitive and personal and that each individual must do his own thinking on religious questions.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">For many people, some or all of these requirements are hard to meet. The Scriptures provide realistic and practical guidance that can help us make the best of our circumstances, whatever they may be. More important, the Scriptures provide a foundation for confidence that the conditions on earth will be much better in the near future. Indeed, future conditions will be as God intended them to be.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sc">  Psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl noted: “Ever more people today have the means to live, but no meaning to live for.” The Scriptures long ago showed that pursuing riches and pleasures without having a deeper purpose in life is empty and unsatisfying. “A mere lover of silver will not be satisfied with silver, neither any lover of wealth with income. This too is vanity.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:5:10-21:5:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a> [5:9, <em>TNK</em>]) The affluent may seem to enjoy a life of ease and pleasure-seeking, but “even in laughter the heart may be in pain.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:14:13-20:14:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:13</a>.</p>

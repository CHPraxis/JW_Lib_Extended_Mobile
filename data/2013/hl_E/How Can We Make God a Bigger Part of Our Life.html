<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">God himself makes it possible for us to know him. King David told his son Solomon: “Know the God of your father . . . If you search for him, he will let himself be found by you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:28:9-13:28:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>) Many such expressions in the Scriptures show that a close relationship with God is possible and very desirable. God wants to have that kind of relationship with us. Because of Abraham’s faith, God referred to him as “my friend.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:41:8-23:41:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:8</a>) If we show faith and respond to God’s direction, he will bless, protect, and help us too.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">When we pray, God listens. “The desire of the meek ones you will certainly hear, O Jehovah. . . . You will pay attention with your ear.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:10:17-19:10:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 10:17</a>) Rather than simply reciting a written or memorized prayer, we should do as the Scriptures tell us: “Before him pour out your heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:62:8-19:62:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 62:8</a> [62:9, <em>TNK</em>]) We should feel free to ‘draw near’ to him as our beloved Father, openly expressing any and all concerns. “The prayer of the upright ones is a pleasure to him.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:73:28-19:73:28" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 73:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:8-20:15:8" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Proverbs 15:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:64:8-23:64:8" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Isaiah 64:8</a> [64:7, <em>TNK</em>].</p>

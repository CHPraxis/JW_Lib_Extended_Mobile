<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Professor George Zinsmeister, formerly of the University of Massachusetts in the United States, believes in God and answers this question in a single word<wbr />—entropy. He is referring to what scientists term “the second law of thermodynamics.” This law implies something that we all observe. An orderly system, such as a house, cannot come into existence on its own. Yet, our universe consists of countless examples of highly ordered physical and biological systems. All of this is evidence that points to an unimaginably intelligent and powerful Creator.</p>

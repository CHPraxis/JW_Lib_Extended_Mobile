SECTION 20
How Can We Be Part of God’s Purpose?

“Let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will instruct us about his ways, and we will walk in his paths.”—MICAH 4:2.



ANYONE who wishes can be part of God’s purpose and have a truly meaningful and happy life. But we must be willing to make an effort. First, we must learn more about God and his purposes.



How can we get to know God and his purposes better?

Solomon wrote: “If you will receive my sayings and treasure up my own commandments with yourself, so as to pay attention to wisdom with your ear, that you may incline your heart to discernment; if, moreover, you call out for understanding itself and you give forth your voice for discernment itself, if you keep seeking for it as for silver, and as for hid treasures you keep searching for it, in that case you will understand the fear of Jehovah, and you will find the very knowledge of God.”—Proverbs 2:1-5.





Learning God’s will is worth whatever time and effort are required




Notice the word “if.” It is used three times. Clearly, gaining “the very knowledge of God” calls for determination to learn his will and to carry it out. Taking in this knowledge is worth whatever time and effort are required. (Proverbs 23:23) Jehovah’s Witnesses would be happy to show you how you can gain the future that Adam and Eve forfeited. It will mean sharing in Jehovah’s beautiful purpose—to live life as he originally intended, to his praise and to your eternal happiness!

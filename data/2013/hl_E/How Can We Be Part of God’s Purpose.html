<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Notice the word “if.” It is used three times. Clearly, gaining “the very knowledge of God” calls for determination to learn his will and to carry it out. Taking in this knowledge is worth whatever time and effort are required. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:23:23-20:23:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:23</a>) Jehovah’s Witnesses would be happy to show you how you can gain the future that Adam and Eve forfeited. It will mean sharing in Jehovah’s beautiful purpose<wbr />—to live life as he originally intended, to his praise and to your eternal happiness!</p>

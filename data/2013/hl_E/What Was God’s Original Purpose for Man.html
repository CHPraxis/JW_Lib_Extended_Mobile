<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Adam and Eve were free to enjoy life as part of God’s universal family, as long as they respected their Creator’s standards of good and bad. He told them how best to use their freedom and warned them of the consequences of disobeying: If they lived according to God’s instructions, they would enjoy perfect life forever; if they chose their own way, they would suffer and lose their lives. Whenever we have freedom of choice, we bear responsibility for our decisions and actions.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 2:16, 17</a>.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sc">  Before God created the earth and man, he created angels. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:38:4-18:38:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 38:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:38:7-18:38:7" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 7</a>) One of those angels became “Satan”<wbr />—meaning “Resister”—<wbr />when he tried to take over the rulership of mankind.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sc">  By listening to Satan, Adam and Eve put themselves under Satan’s rule and severed their relationship with God. Were they better off afterward? Since then, has mankind benefited from trying to live independent of God? Does mankind today enjoy perfect life in Paradise, as God originally purposed?</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class = "themeScrp">“You are not a God taking delight in wickedness; no one bad may reside for any time with you.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:5:4-19:5:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">PSALM 5:4</a> [5:5, <em>TNK</em>].</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">BY SINNING, Adam and Eve severed their relationship with God. So too our sin separates us from God. “The very errors of you people have become the things causing division between you and your God, and your own sins have caused the concealing of his face from you to keep from hearing.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:59:2-23:59:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 59:2</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">God has never abandoned his purpose. He still wants the earth to be a paradise, inhabited by happy people. Nothing can prevent Almighty God from reaching his objective. “God is not a man that he should tell lies, neither a son of mankind that he should feel regret. Has he himself said it and will he not do it, and has he spoken and will he not carry it out?”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:23:19-4:23:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Numbers 23:19</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Just as a caring human father feels pain when his children suffer<wbr />—even for their own mistakes—<wbr />it distresses God to see us suffer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:63:9-23:63:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 63:9</a>) God feels deeply for us, and he promises that he will eventually remove all evil from the earth. But how, and when?</p>

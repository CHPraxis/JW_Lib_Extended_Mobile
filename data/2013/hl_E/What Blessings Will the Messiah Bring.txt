What Blessings Will the Messiah Bring?

“His name will be called . . . Prince of Peace.”—ISAIAH 9:6 [9:5, TNK].



THE Messiah’s atoning sacrifice will completely remove the burden of sin and guilt from human hearts. Yet, his Kingdom will accomplish much more.








How will God use the Kingdom under the Messiah’s rule?

“In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. And he will have subjects from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.”—Psalm 72:7, 8.
The blessings of the Messiah’s rule include endless life on earth. “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.” (Psalm 37:29) “There Jehovah commanded the blessing to be, even life to time indefinite.” (Psalm 133:3) “Like the days of a tree will the days of my people be; and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full.”—Isaiah 65:20-25.
Jehovah promised David “length of days to time indefinite, even forever.” (Psalm 21:4 [21:5, TNK]) To fulfill that promise will require a resurrection, as foretold elsewhere in the Scriptures. Consider a few examples: “If an able-bodied man dies can he live again? . . . You will call, and I myself shall answer you. For the work of your hands you will have a yearning.” (Job 14:13-15) “He will actually swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces.” (Isaiah 25:8) “You will rest, but you will stand up for your lot at the end of the days.”—Daniel 12:2, 13 [12:2, 12, TNK].
Jehovah has already demonstrated that he has the desire and the ability to bring dead ones back to life.—1 Kings 17:17-24; 2 Kings 4:32-37; 13:20, 21.

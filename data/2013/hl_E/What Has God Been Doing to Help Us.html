<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sc">  God’s name<wbr />—Jehovah (יהוה)—<wbr />represents God himself. Regarding his name, God said: “This is my name to time indefinite, and this is the memorial of me to generation after generation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:3:15-2:3:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 3:15</a>) The meaning of God’s name<wbr />—“He Causes to Become”—<wbr />guarantees that he will become whatever he needs to become to achieve his purpose. He demonstrated this ability when he delivered Israel from Egypt, the most powerful nation of the day.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:9:16-2:9:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 9:16</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>How should we regard God’s name?</strong></h3>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sc">  The third commandment is: “You must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:20:7-2:20:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 20:7</a>) No one should pronounce his name in an empty or a disrespectful way. All those who bear God’s name are obligated to praise him by their conduct, never dishonoring his holy name.</p>
<h3 id="p18" data-pid="18"><strong>Should we ever pronounce God’s name?</strong></h3>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sc">  The Scriptures tell those who fear God to use his name but never to misuse it. “Give thanks to Jehovah, call upon his name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:105:1-19:105:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 105:1</a>) Faithful ones, such as Boaz, pronounced God’s name respectfully in worship and in daily life.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:2:4-8:2:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ruth 2:4</a>.</p>

SECTION 19
How Far Will the Messiah’s Rule Extend?

“All the nations, for their part, will serve him.”—PSALM 72:11.








THE Messiah’s rule will result in worldwide physical and, more important, spiritual blessings. “All the nations, for their part, will serve him. For he will deliver the poor one crying for help, also the afflicted one and whoever has no helper. He will feel sorry for the lowly one and the poor one, and the souls of the poor ones he will save.”—Psalm 72:11-13.
“To the abundance of the princely rule and to peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom in order to establish it firmly and to sustain it by means of justice and by means of righteousness, from now on and to time indefinite.”—Isaiah 9:7 [9:6, TNK].

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">THE people of Jerusalem are shocked. Why? A known opposer of Jehovah is allowed to stay in a room at the temple. The Levites are no longer doing their assigned work. Instead of putting Jehovah first, the elders are doing business on the Sabbath day. And many Israelites have married women from other nations. These are just some of the problems Nehemiah sees when he returns to Jerusalem.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:13:6-16:13:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nehemiah 13:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>Why was Israel a holy nation?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>About a thousand years earlier, the Israelites were willing to obey Jehovah. They said: “All the words that Jehovah has spoken we are willing to do.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:24:3-2:24:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 24:3</a>) God chose them to be his people and wanted them to be holy and separate from other nations. This was a great honor! Forty years later, Moses reminded them: “You are a holy people to Jehovah your God. It is you Jehovah your God has chosen to become his people, a special property, out of all the peoples that are on the surface of the ground.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:7:6-5:7:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What had happened to true worship when Nehemiah made his second trip to Jerusalem?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Sadly, the nation of Israel did not do what it promised to do. There were always some individuals who served God, but most of the Jews were not willing to obey Jehovah and only pretended to be holy. Nehemiah made a second trip to Jerusalem about a hundred years after a remnant had returned to rebuild the city. They wanted to rebuild it so that they could worship Jehovah again. But by the time Nehemiah made this second trip, <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>true worship was no longer first in the Jews’ lives.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>How can we remain holy and acceptable to Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Like the Israelites, Jehovah’s Witnesses have been sanctified by God. Both anointed Christians and those of the “great crowd” are holy and serve only Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:14-66:7:15" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:6:11-46:6:11" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 6:11</a>) The Israelites lost their relationship with Jehovah because they did not remain holy. We do not want the same thing to happen to us. So how can we remain holy and acceptable to Jehovah? <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:13:1-16:13:31" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Nehemiah chapter 13</a> teaches us four ways that will help us to do this. They are (1) avoid bad association; (2) support Jehovah’s work; (3) put Jehovah’s service first; and (4) protect our Christian identity. Let us now discuss each of these ways.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>5, 6. </strong>Who were Eliashib and Tobiah? Why may Eliashib have given Tobiah a place in the temple?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:13:4-16:13:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Nehemiah 13:4-9</strong></a><strong>. </strong>We are surrounded by bad influences that can make us unholy, or unclean. The Bible tells us about High Priest Eliashib and a man named Tobiah, who was an Ammonite probably working for the Persian king. Tobiah and his friends had tried to make Nehemiah stop rebuilding Jerusalem’s walls. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:2:10-16:2:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Nehemiah 2:10</a>) It was against God’s Law to allow Ammonites to come onto the temple grounds. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:23:3-5:23:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 23:3</a>) So why would the high priest give such a man as Tobiah space in a temple dining hall?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>There are three reasons: First, Eliashib was a friend of Tobiah. Second, Tobiah and his son Jehohanan had married Jewish women, and many Jews said good things about Tobiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:6:17-16:6:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Nehemiah 6:17-19</a>) Third, Tobiah was a very close friend of Sanballat, governor <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>of Samaria, who was a member of High Priest Eliashib’s family. Sanballat’s daughter was married to one of Eliashib’s grandsons. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:13:28-16:13:28" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Nehemiah 13:28</a>) All these relationships may explain why Eliashib allowed Tobiah to tell him what to do, even though Tobiah was not an Israelite and was opposed to the work of God’s people. But Nehemiah showed loyalty to Jehovah by throwing all of Tobiah’s furniture outside the dining hall.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>How do all of God’s people, including elders, make sure that they remain holy?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>We are God’s dedicated people, so our loyalty to Jehovah must come first in our life. Sometimes, though, we might be tempted to ignore Bible principles because we want to be loyal to our family. But if we do not live by Bible principles, Jehovah will begin to view us as unholy. Christian elders make decisions based on Jehovah’s thinking, not based on their own opinions or feelings for others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:5:21-54:5:21" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:21</a>) The elders are careful never to do anything that would make them harm their friendship with God.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:2:8-54:2:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What should we remember about our association?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Never forget that “bad associations spoil useful habits.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>) Even some of our relatives could be bad association, that is, they might influence us to do bad things. At one time, High Priest Eliashib was a good example and worked with Nehemiah to rebuild Jerusalem’s walls. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:3:1-16:3:1" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Nehemiah 3:1</a>) But Tobiah and others were bad association for Eliashib. They influenced him to do things that were wrong, and this made him unholy. We need to associate with people who encourage us to do good things, such as reading the Bible, attending the meetings, and going in field service. We can be especially grateful when our family members encourage us to do what is right.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:12:44-16:12:44" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Nehemiah 12:44</a>) Nehemiah made sure that these contributions were collected, and he appointed faithful men to give the tithes to the Levites.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:13:15-16:13:21" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>Nehemiah 13:15-21</strong></a><strong>. </strong>If we use too much time thinking about material things and working to obtain them, we can lose our relationship with Jehovah. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:31:13-2:31:13" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Exodus 31:13</a> explains that the Israelites were supposed to use the weekly Sabbath as a time to remember their relationship with Jehovah as his separate and holy people. The Jews were told to use the Sabbath day to worship with their families, to pray, and to meditate on God’s Law. But some of the Israelites in Nehemiah’s time used the Sabbath day to do business, just as they used the other days of the week. So Nehemiah chased the foreign merchants out of the city and closed the gates before the Sabbath began.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>What can we learn from this? One lesson is that we should not become distracted and spend a lot of time trying to make money. We can be distracted by our work, especially <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>if we enjoy it. But remember that Jesus said that we cannot slave for two masters. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:24-40:6:24" data-bid="24-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 6:24</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Nehemiah could have made a lot of money, and he could have used his time doing business with the Tyrians and other merchants. But what did he do instead? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:5:14-16:5:18" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Nehemiah 5:14-18</a>) He worked hard to help his brothers and to bring honor to Jehovah’s name. In the same way, Christian elders and ministerial servants spend their time and energy on helping the congregation. Members of the congregation love them for this. As a result, God’s people love one another, have peace with one another, and feel secure.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:34:25-26:34:25" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:34:28-26:34:28" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 28</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Christians are not required to keep a Sabbath day each week. But Paul said that “there remains a sabbath resting for the people of God.” He added: “The man that has entered into God’s rest has also himself rested from his own works.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:9-58:4:10" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:9, 10</a>) As Christians, we can do “sabbath resting,” that is, enter “into God’s rest,” by obeying Jehovah and working to support his purpose. Are you and your family putting Jehovah first in your lives by having family worship, attending the meetings, and going in field service? Our employer or the people we work with may not think that these things are important. So we may have to be firm and make it clear to them that Jehovah’s work is the most important work to us. This is similar to what Nehemiah did when he chased the Tyrians away and closed the gates of the city. He was putting Jehovah first. Because we are God’s separate and holy people, we need to ask ourselves, ‘Do I show by the way I live that I put Jehovah first?’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33</a>.</p>

Or would they think <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>of themselves as foreigners, that is, as Ashdodites, Ammonites, or Moabites? If they could not understand Hebrew, it would be unlikely that they could understand God’s Law.

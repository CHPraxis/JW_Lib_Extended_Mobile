<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">IMAGINE that a happily married man comes home one day and finds that everything in his house has been destroyed. The furniture and dishes have been smashed to pieces, and the carpet is ruined. His beautiful home looks like a disaster area. Whom do you think he would blame for this? Would he say, “Why did my wife do this?” No, most likely he would say, <strong>“Who </strong>did this?” He knows that his loving wife would never destroy their home.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Today, the earth has been ruined. Its soil, water, and air are polluted. People are violent and immoral. But we have learned from the Bible that this is not Jehovah’s fault. He created the earth to be a beautiful paradise home for us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:8-1:2:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 2:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:15-1:2:15" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 15</a>) Jehovah is a God of love.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>However, we cannot blame Satan for all our problems. Why not? Because some of our problems are the result of our own mistakes. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:32:4-5:32:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 32:4-6</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>We might say that we believe this.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:14:12-20:14:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:12</a>) Instead of blaming ourselves or Satan for our problems, we could start to blame Jehovah.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Is it possible to become “enraged against Jehovah”? Really, it would do us no good to become angry with him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:41:11-23:41:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:11</a>) We have no chance of winning a fight against God. It is true that we may never <strong>say </strong>that we are angry with Jehovah. But <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:19:3-20:19:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:3</a> says that a man’s foolish thinking “distorts his way” and that “his <strong>heart </strong>becomes enraged against Jehovah.” This means that a person can become enraged against God in <strong>his heart </strong>and feel bitter toward Him. This can start to affect what the man does. For example, he might slow down in his service to Jehovah or stop worshipping with the congregation.</p>

He brought ten plagues on Egypt and destroyed Pharaoh and his armies at the Red Sea. The Israelites were free!

But they started to complain about Jehovah. Why did they lose faith just as they were going to receive their reward?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:14:1-4:14:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Numbers 14:1-4</a>) As a result, Jehovah did not let them enter into that “good land” at that time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:1:34-5:1:35" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 1:34, 35</a>) What can we learn?

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>Why did the people of Judah who lived in Isaiah’s day blame Jehovah for their problems?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup>Tragedies and difficulties could discourage us. (Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:8:21-23:8:22" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 8:21, 22</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>In Isaiah’s day, the people of Judah <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>were suffering. They were surrounded by enemies. Many were hungry because there was not enough food. But there was an even bigger problem. They had stopped listening to Jehovah and were letting their relationship with him get weak. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/30:8:11-30:8:11" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Amos 8:11</a>) Instead of asking Jehovah for help, they blamed him and the king for their problems. In a similar way, if we become discouraged because of a tragedy or other problems in our life, we might begin to blame Jehovah and feel that he did not help us when we needed him.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>Why did the Israelites in Ezekiel’s day have a wrong attitude about Jehovah’s way of doing things?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup>We do not know all the facts. </strong>Because the Israelites in Ezekiel’s time did not know all the facts about each situation, they thought that God’s way of doing things was wrong. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:18:29-26:18:29" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezekiel 18:29</a>) They acted as if it were their right to judge God and to decide whether he was doing things in the best way, even though they did not understand all of his reasons. How might we make the same mistake? The Bible contains stories that may be difficult for us to understand. Or maybe we do not understand why something is happening in our own life. We could begin to feel in our heart that Jehovah’s way is unfair and “not adjusted right.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:35:2-18:35:2" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 35:2</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup>We do not take responsibility for our sins and mistakes. </strong>The first man, Adam, blamed God for his own sin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:12-1:3:12" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Genesis 3:12</a>) Adam knew that he was breaking God’s law and that God would punish him for his sin. But he blamed Jehovah, as if he had made the mistake because Jehovah gave him a bad wife. Others have followed Adam’s bad example by blaming God for their own mistakes. We should ask ourselves, ‘Could I get so disappointed and frustrated about my own mistakes that I begin to think that Jehovah’s standards are too strict?’</p>

He was afraid they would think that he was a false prophet because the city was not destroyed after he said that it would be. It seems that Jonah was more concerned about what people would think of him than he was about the people themselves. Could we feel the same way as Jonah did? If we think only about ourselves, we may forget about the needs of other people. For example, perhaps we have been preaching for many years that Jehovah’s day is close.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Do you desire good health and a long life for yourself and your family? Do you long to live in a world where pain, suffering, and death will be things of the past? Such a world is not a figment of the imagination. On the contrary, a righteous new world will soon be a reality, for Jehovah God has purposed it. Note how the fulfillment of his purpose is described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:3-66:21:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 21:3-5</strong></a><strong>.<wbr />—Read.</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“[<em>God</em>] <em>will wipe out every tear from their eyes.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>) What kind of tears will he wipe out? Neither tears of joy nor the tears that protect our eyes. God’s promise refers to tears caused by suffering and sorrow. God will not merely dry off such tears; he will wipe them out completely by removing the causes of unwanted tears<wbr />—suffering and sorrow.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>“Death will be no more.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>) What has caused more unwanted tears than the enemy death? Jehovah will release obedient humans from the grip of death. How? By eliminating the real cause of death: sin inherited from Adam. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) Jehovah will lift obedient humans to perfection on the basis of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Then the last enemy, death, will be “brought to nothing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:26-46:15:26" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>) Faithful humans will be able to live as God purposed for them to live<wbr />—forever in perfect health.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>“Neither will . . . pain be anymore.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>) What kind of pain will be no more? All the mental, emotional, and physical pain that has resulted from sin and imperfection and made life miserable for countless millions will be no more.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A life without tears, death, and pain will soon be a reality. ‘But where?’ you may ask. ‘Is God’s promise perhaps about life in heaven?’ No. Consider why not. First, the promise is introduced with the words “the tent of God is with <em>mankind,” </em>and mankind lives on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:3-66:21:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3</a>) Second, the promise describes a world where “death will be no more”<wbr />—a world where death once existed but will cease to exist. Death has never existed in heaven, but it has had a long existence here on earth. Clearly, then, God’s promise of a better life will be fulfilled right here on earth.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jehovah wants us to believe his promise of a righteous new world. Right after describing the blessings to come, he guarantees his promise, saying: “Look! I am making all things new.” Then he adds: “These words are faithful and true.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:5-66:21:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 21:5</a>) Why not learn more about how you and your loved ones can be among the happy worshippers who will see God’s promise become a glorious reality?</p>

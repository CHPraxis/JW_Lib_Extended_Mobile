A New Member of the Governing Body




On Wednesday morning, September 5, 2012, it was announced to the United States and Canada Bethel families that a new member had been added to the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Effective September 1, 2012, Mark Sanderson began to serve in that capacity.
Brother Sanderson was raised in San Diego, California, U.S.A., by his Christian parents and was baptized on February 9, 1975. He began to serve as a pioneer in Saskatchewan, Canada, on September 1, 1983. In December 1990, he graduated from the seventh class of the Ministerial Training School (now called the Bible School for Single Brothers) in the United States. Brother Sanderson was appointed to serve as a special pioneer on the island of Newfoundland, Canada, in April 1991. After serving as a substitute circuit overseer, he was invited to become a member of the Canada Bethel family in February 1997. In November 2000, he was transferred to the United States branch, where he worked in Hospital Information Services and later in the Service Department.
In September 2008, Brother Sanderson attended the School for Branch Committee Members and thereafter was appointed as a member of the Philippines Branch Committee. In September 2010, he was invited to return to the United States, where he served as a helper to the Service Committee of the Governing Body.

STUDY ARTICLES
▪  “Tell Us, When Will These Things Be?”
▪  “Look! I Am With You All the Days”
These articles consider parts of Matthew chapters 24 and 25. They present several clarifications of our understanding of the timing of events in Jesus’ prophecy about the last days and in his parable about the wheat and the weeds. The articles also consider how we can personally benefit from these clarifications.

▪  Feeding Many Through the Hands of a Few
▪  “Who Really Is the Faithful and Discreet Slave?”
Whether miraculously providing food to crowds of people or spiritually feeding his followers, Jesus followed a pattern—he fed many through the hands of a few. The first article discusses the few through whom he fed his first-century anointed followers. The second article examines this vital question: Who are the few through whom Christ feeds us today?

STUDY ARTICLES
▪  For Those Loving Jehovah, “There Is No Stumbling Block”
All Christians are in a race for the prize of everlasting life. But because we are imperfect, we all stumble. This article will explain five things that could make us stumble. It will also explain how we can avoid these things so that we can win the race.
▪  Do You Have “a Heart to Know” Jehovah?
The book of Jeremiah has much to tell us about the figurative heart. This article will help us to see what an ‘uncircumcised heart’ is and how this may be a danger even for Christians. Also, how can we have “a heart to know” Jehovah?—Jeremiah 9:26; 24:7.
▪  Having “Come to Know God”—What Now?
What steps do we take so that we can come to know God and be known by him? How and why should we keep making progress, even if we have been a Christian for a long time? This article will help you answer these questions.
▪  Jehovah—Our Place of Dwelling
We live in a world that hates us, but we do not need to fear. This article shows us that Jehovah always protects his people.
▪  Honor Jehovah’s Great Name
What does it mean to know God’s name? What does it mean to walk in that name? And how does God feel about those who disrespect his name? This article will answer these questions.

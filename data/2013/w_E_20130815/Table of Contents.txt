STUDY ARTICLES
▪  You Have Been Sanctified
As dedicated servants of Jehovah, we have been sanctified, or set apart for sacred service. In this study, we will consider Nehemiah chapter 13. We will examine four factors that can help us to remain holy.

▪  Never Become “Enraged Against Jehovah”
This article will consider five factors that could lead a loyal Christian to become “enraged against Jehovah.” (Prov. 19:3) Then we will discuss in detail five ways to avoid even starting to blame Jehovah for our problems.

▪  Consider and Encourage One Another
▪  Consider What Kind of Person You Ought to Be
The first of these articles discusses how we can help one another to be resolute despite the challenges we face. The second article shows how we can successfully resist temptations used by Satan as he attempts to damage our friendship with God.

How Do You View the Bible?

Would you say it is . . .
           a book of human wisdom?

           a book of myths and legends?

           the Word of God?





WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS

“All Scripture is inspired of God.”​—2 Timothy 3:16, New World Translation.



WHAT THAT CAN MEAN FOR YOU

Satisfying answers to life’s big questions.​—Proverbs 2:1-5.
Reliable guidance for day-to-day living.​—Psalm 119:105.
Real hope for the future.​—Romans 15:4.








CAN WE REALLY BELIEVE WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS?

Yes, for at least three reasons:
            Amazing harmony. The Bible was written over a period of 1,600 years by some 40 different people. Most of them never met one another. Yet, the entire book is harmonious, with one central theme!

            Honest history. Secular historians seem quick to cover over the defeats of their people. In contrast, Bible writers candidly recorded both their personal failings and those of their nation.​—2 Chronicles 36:15, 16; Psalm 51:1-4.

            Reliable prophecy. The Bible foretold the destruction of the ancient city of Babylon some 200 years in advance. (Isaiah 13:17-22) It revealed not only the manner in which Babylon would fall but even the name of its conqueror!​—Isaiah 45:1-3.
Numerous other Bible prophecies were also fulfilled down to the smallest detail. But is that not what we would expect of the Word of God?​—2 Peter 1:21.





TO THINK ABOUT





How can God’s Word improve your life?
The Bible answers that question at ISAIAH 48:17, 18 and 2 TIMOTHY 3:16, 17.

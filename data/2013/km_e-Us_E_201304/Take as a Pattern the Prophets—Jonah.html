<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 1. What positive qualities did Jonah possess?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>What comes to mind when you think of the prophet Jonah? Some may view him as cowardly or hard-hearted. However, he clearly manifested humility, courage, and a spirit of self-sacrifice. How can we “take as a pattern” Jonah’s admirable qualities?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:5:10-59:5:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jas. 5:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. How can we imitate Jonah’s humility?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Humility: </strong>Initially, Jonah fled in the opposite direction of his assigned territory. This is not surprising because the Assyrians were notoriously violent, and Nineveh came to be called “the city of bloodshed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/34:3:1-34:3:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nah. 3:1-3</a>) Nonetheless, Jehovah disciplined Jonah, who showed humility by accepting the assignment when given a second chance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:24:32-20:24:32" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 24:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/32:3:1-32:3:3" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Jonah 3:1-3</a>) Despite his initial reluctance, he did Jehovah’s will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:21:28-40:21:31" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 21:28-31</a>) Are we similarly determined to preach the good news, even if we are disciplined or have a challenging territory assignment?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 3. What aspects of your ministry require courage and self-sacrifice?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Courage and Self-Sacrifice: </strong>When Jonah realized that his bad decision had jeopardized the lives of the mariners, he was willing to sacrifice his life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/32:1:3-32:1:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jonah 1:3, 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/32:1:12-32:1:12" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 12</a>) Later, when fulfilling his commission in Nineveh, he walked deep into the heart of the city, perhaps looking for a suitable location to proclaim the judgment of Jehovah. Those were the actions, not of a coward, but of a courageous prophet of God! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/32:3:3-32:3:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jonah 3:3, 4</a>) What about us today? God-given courage is needed to give a bold witness in the face of opposition. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:4:29-44:4:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 4:29,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:4:31-44:4:31" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 31</a>) Self-sacrifice is required to invest time and resources in the ministry.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:20:24-44:20:24" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 20:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 4. Why should we take time to reflect on the fine pattern set by the prophets of Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Each time you read an account about one of Jehovah’s prophets, you will benefit if you visualize yourself in those circumstances. Ask yourself: ‘How would I have responded? How can I imitate his good qualities in my life?’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:6:11-58:6:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Heb. 6:11, 12</a>) Future articles in <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>will consider further valuable lessons that we can learn from other faithful prophets of Jehovah.</p>

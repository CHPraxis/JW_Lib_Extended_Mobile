<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 1. Why are Jehovah’s Witnesses conspicuous when attending district conventions?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>When attending district conventions, we are quite conspicuous. In many convention cities, local news outlets inform the community of our presence. The hotels and restaurants are often filled with delegates, and people living in the area notice the many visitors wearing convention badges. The following are some reminders that will help us to glorify God by our good conduct while in the convention city.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:12-60:2:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 2. How may we glorify God by our modest dress while in the convention city?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Modest Dress: </strong>Our modest dress while attending the program often impresses onlookers. However, our style of dress at other times<wbr />—when checking in at the hotel, when eating at area restaurants, when shopping, and so forth—<wbr />may make a bigger impression on observers. Although we need not wear dress clothes on these other occasions, what we wear should be modest, dignified, and not overly casual. Observers should be able to see a difference between us and unbelievers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2</a>) In addition, we should wear our convention badge, as this will advertise the convention, lead to witnessing opportunities, and enable other delegates to identify us.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 3. How may we display patience and courtesy?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Patience and Courtesy: </strong>At a time when many in the world are self-centered and unthankful, how refreshing our patience and courteousness will be to onlookers, such as hotel and restaurant personnel! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-5</a>) When saving seats or when getting in line to obtain convention releases, we should seek, not our own advantage, but that of the other person. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:23-46:10:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:23, 24</a>) After attending his first convention, one interested man said, “I don’t remember any of the talks that were given that day, but the conduct of the Witnesses made a lasting impression on me.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 4. Why should we consider volunteering at the convention if our circumstances allow?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Willing Volunteers: </strong>The volunteer spirit is a mark of true Christians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 110:3</a>) Could you volunteer to assist at the convention? At one convention site, some 600 brothers and sisters volunteered to clean before the convention. The staff remarked: “This is the most amazing thing we have ever seen! It’s hard to imagine that all of these people are volunteers.” We eagerly look forward to the 2013 district conventions and the opportunity we will have not just to listen and learn from God but also to glorify him.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sc"><strong>2013 District Convention Reminders</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="su">▪ <strong>Program Times: </strong>The doors to the building will open at 8:00 a.m. The introductory music will begin at 9:20 a.m. all three days. At that time, all of us should go to our seats so that the program can begin in a dignified manner. The closing song and prayer will be introduced at 4:50 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and at 3:35 p.m. on Sunday.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="su">▪ <strong>Parking: </strong>At all convention sites where we control the parking, the spaces will be available to attendees at no charge on a first-come, first-served basis. Parking is usually limited, so carpooling should be done to the extent possible. Only those with a license plate or placard for the disabled will be allowed to park in the area reserved for such ones.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="su">▪ <strong>Seat Saving: </strong>Seats may be saved only for those living in your home or traveling in your vehicle or for your current Bible students. Seating for the elderly and the infirm is limited, so it may not be possible for all of their family members to sit with them. Please leave these seats for the elderly and the infirm and those assisting them.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:13:5-46:13:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="su">▪ <strong>Noon Meal: </strong>Please bring a light lunch rather than leave the convention site to obtain a meal during the noon break. A small cooler that can be placed under a seat may be used. Large family-size picnic coolers and glass containers are not permitted in the convention facility.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="su">▪ <strong>Donations: </strong>We can show our appreciation for the convention arrangements by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at the convention. Any checks should be made payable to “Christian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Donations can also be made by means of a debit or credit card.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="su"><span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>▪ <strong>Medication: </strong>If you require prescription medication, please be sure to bring an adequate supply with you, since none will be available at the convention. Diabetic syringes and needles must be disposed of properly as hazardous waste and not in trash receptacles at the convention facility or hotel.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="su">▪ <strong>Footwear: </strong>Each year injuries occur that are related to footwear, especially high-heeled shoes. It is best to choose modest, well-fitting shoes that will allow you to walk safely on ramps, stairs, gratings, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="su">▪ <strong>Hearing Impaired: </strong>The program will be broadcast in the auditorium on an FM radio frequency. To receive it, you will need to bring a small battery-operated FM receiver and earphones.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="su">▪ <strong>Baby Strollers and Lawn Chairs: </strong>Baby strollers and lawn chairs should not be brought to the convention site. However, child-safety seats are acceptable if they can be secured in a seat next to the parents.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="su">▪ <strong>Fragrances: </strong>Most conventions take place in enclosed areas with mechanical ventilation. Therefore, it would be loving on our part to limit the use of strong fragrances, colognes, and perfumes that may cause reactions in people with respiratory or related problems.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:24-46:10:24" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="su">▪ <strong><em>Please Follow Up </em>(S-43) Forms: </strong>A <em>Please Follow Up </em>form should be used to provide information regarding any interest found through informal witnessing during the convention. Completed forms may be submitted <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>to the Book Room or given to your congregation secretary on your return home.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="su">▪ <strong>Restaurants: </strong>Honor Jehovah’s name by your fine conduct at restaurants. Dress in a way that befits a Christian minister. Leave a tip if this is customary.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="su">▪ <strong>Hotels:</strong></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sm"> (1) Please do not reserve more rooms than you will actually use, and do not have more people stay in your room than what is allowed.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sm"> (2) Do not cancel your reservation except for an emergency situation, and notify the hotel as soon as it occurs so that others needing accommodations can use the room. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:37-40:5:37" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 5:37</a>) If you do have to cancel, be sure to get a cancellation number. If you cancel a room less than 48 hours ahead of time, your deposit will not be refunded.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sm"> (3) Please note that if you use a debit or credit card when registering at a hotel, it is standard practice for the hotel to place a “hold” on funds in your account to cover your total room cost, plus any possible damages or incidentals during your stay. You will not be able to use any of those funds until your account is settled within a few days after you depart.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sm"> (4) Take a luggage cart only when you are ready to use it, and return it immediately so that others may use it.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sm"> (5) If it is the custom in your country, tip hotel workers when they carry your luggage and leave a tip for the housekeeper each day.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sm"> (6) Cook only in rooms where cooking is permitted.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sm"> (7) Do not abuse any complimentary breakfast, coffee, or ice provisions that are made available for guests to consume while they are at the hotel.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sm"> (8) At all times, display the fruitage of the spirit when dealing with the hotel staff. They are caring for a large number of guests and appreciate our kindness, patience, and reasonableness.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sm"> (9) Parents should supervise their children at all times around the hotel, including the elevators, swimming pool, lobby area, exercise room, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sm">(10) The room rate shown on the <em>Recommended Lodging List </em>is the full price per day, excluding tax. If you are overcharged, refuse these charges and inform the Rooming Department at the convention as soon as possible.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sm">(11) If a problem arises with your hotel room, inform the Rooming Department while at the convention so that they can assist you.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="su">▪ <strong>Volunteer Service: </strong>Any who wish to volunteer should report to the Volunteer Service Department at the convention. Children under 16 years of age can also make a fine contribution by working under the direction of a parent, guardian, or other adult approved by a parent or guardian.</p>

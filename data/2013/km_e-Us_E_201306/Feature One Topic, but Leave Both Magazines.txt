Feature One Topic, but Leave Both Magazines
Each set of our magazines contains a variety of interesting topics. Rather than trying to feature several subjects at each door, it is generally better to discuss only one. If we are observant and familiar with the contents of the magazines, we can choose something from either The Watchtower or Awake! that will interest the householder. For example, if we see childrenâ€™s toys in or around the home, we may choose to highlight an article on family life. If a man comes to the door, we might decide to feature a subject that many men are interested in, such as good government. Although we may discuss only one topic, we should usually leave both magazines with the householder if he shows interest.

Field Service Highlights
We are happy to report two new all-time peaks in regular pioneers during the month of December 2012: 154,706 in the United States and 79 in Bermuda. Also, when comparing December with the same month of the previous year, the number of Bible studies being conducted increased by 5.9 percent in the Bahamas and by 15.6 percent in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Clearly, Jehovah’s servants are making a “sacrifice of praise” to him.—Heb. 13:15.

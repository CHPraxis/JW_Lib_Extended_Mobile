Sample Presentations
To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in July
“Almost everyone in our community would like to live a long, happy life. So we would like to get your opinion on this question: Do you think that science and medicine will enable us to live forever one day? [Allow for response.] Notice what it says here.” Show the back of the July 1 Watchtower, and consider together the material under the first question and at least one of the cited scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return to discuss the next question.
Note: This presentation should be demonstrated during the meeting for field service on July 6.
The Watchtower July 1
“Many whom we talk to have their own religion. But others say that they have lost trust in religion altogether. How do you feel about religion? [Allow for response.] Jesus provided a standard to help us when examining a religion. [Read Luke 6:44a.] This magazine discusses some of the bad fruit that religion has produced. It also answers the question, Is any religion deserving of trust?”
Awake! July
“We are visiting our neighbors to talk about a distressing problem—injustice. Some people fight injustice by protesting. Do you think that people who protest succeed in bringing about changes? [Allow for response.] Notice what the Bible says will bring real change to the earth. [Read Matthew 6:9, 10.] This magazine answers the question, Is protest the answer?”
Good News From God!
“We’re visiting the families on your street to share an encouraging thought from the Bible. Many that we’ve talked to wonder why a loving God would allow so much suffering in the world. Do you think that suffering was part of God’s original purpose for the earth?” Allow for response. Then turn to Lesson 5, and read and discuss the first two paragraphs and the scriptures in italics. Offer the brochure, and make arrangements to return to consider the next question in bold print.

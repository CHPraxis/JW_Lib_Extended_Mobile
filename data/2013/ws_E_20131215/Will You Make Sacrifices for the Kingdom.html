<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">PEOPLE are willing to make sacrifices for the things that are important to them. Parents give their time, money, and energy to benefit their children. Young athletes who want to compete in the Olympics spend hours each day practicing and training very hard while their friends play and have fun. Jesus also made sacrifices for things that were important to him. It was not his goal to have a luxurious lifestyle or to have children. Instead, he wanted to use all his energy to support God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:17-40:4:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 4:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:9:58-42:9:58" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Luke 9:58</a>) His followers also made many sacrifices. God’s Kingdom was the most important thing in their lives, so they made sacrifices for it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:18-40:4:22" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 4:18-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:19:27-40:19:27" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 19:27</a>) We should ask ourselves, ‘What is important in my life?’</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>(a) What sacrifices are necessary for all true Christians to make? (b) What extra sacrifices do some make?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Some sacrifices are necessary for all true Christians. They are needed if we want to keep a close friendship with God. Our personal time and the energy we use to pray, to read the Bible, to have family worship, to attend meetings, and to preach are sacrifices that we must make.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.) (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Joshua 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Matthew 28:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>) As a result of our efforts and Jehovah’s blessing, the preaching work is speeding up, and more and more <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>people are beginning to worship God by going to “the mountain of the house of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:2:2-23:2:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:2</a>) To support the Kingdom, many make sacrifices to serve at Bethel, to help with building Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls, to organize conventions, or to help those who suffered in natural disasters. Although Jehovah does not require us to make these extra sacrifices to have eternal life, they are necessary to support God’s Kingdom.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>(a) How do we benefit when we make sacrifices for the Kingdom? (b) What questions should we answer?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Today more than ever before, it is important to do as much as we can for the Kingdom. How happy we are that so many people willingly make sacrifices for Jehovah! <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:54:6-19:54:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 54:6</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>If we do this too, we will be happy while we wait for God’s Kingdom to come.

How are we using our time, money, energy, and abilities? What should we not neglect when we make sacrifices? Let us discuss what we can learn from some examples of voluntary sacrifices. This will help us to have more joy.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>How did the Israelites benefit from making sacrifices?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The people of ancient Israel had to offer sacrifices for their sins to be forgiven. Sacrifices were necessary to have Jehovah’s approval. Some of these were required, and others were voluntary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:23:37-3:23:38" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Leviticus 23:37, 38</a>) Whole burnt offerings could be made as voluntary offerings, or gifts, to Jehovah. One example of the offering of sacrifices to Jehovah was at the dedication of Solomon’s temple.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:7:4-14:7:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 7:4-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How did Jehovah make it possible for even the poor to make sacrifices?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah lovingly understood that not everyone could give the same amount. He asked the Israelites to give only what they could. Jehovah’s law commanded that animal sacrifices be made and that the blood of <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>the animals be poured out. These sacrifices were “a shadow of the good things to come” through Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:1-58:10:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>) However, Jehovah applied this law in a very reasonable way. For example, God would accept an offering of turtledoves if someone could not afford to give a larger offering, such as a ram or a goat. So even the poor could offer sacrifices to Jehovah and be joyful. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:1:3-3:1:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Leviticus 1:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:1:10-3:1:10" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:1:14-3:1:14" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:5:7-3:5:7" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> 5:7</a>) Although Jehovah would accept different animals as offerings, he required two things from all who made voluntary sacrifices.</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote"><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sc">Jehovah asked the Israelites to give only what they could</p>
</div>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What two things were required to make a sacrifice? How important was it to obey these requirements?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>First, a person who made a sacrifice had to give his best. If an animal was sick or had a defect, Jehovah would not accept the sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:22:18-3:22:20" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Leviticus 22:18-20</a>) Second, the person giving the sacrifice had to be clean as explained in the Law. If he was not clean, he would first have to make a sin offering or a guilt offering so that he could again have Jehovah’s approval. Only then would Jehovah accept his voluntary sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:5:5-3:5:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Leviticus 5:5, 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:5:15-3:5:15" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 15</a>) This was very serious. Jehovah commanded that if any person ate from a sacrifice while he was unclean, he was to be killed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:7:20-3:7:21" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Leviticus 7:20, 21</a>) However, if a person was clean and his sacrifice had no defect, the giver would have a good conscience and great joy.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:29:9-13:29:9" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>1 Chronicles 29:9</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

Working hard to help our brothers also gives us joy. One brother who helps to build Kingdom Halls and who has helped those affected by natural disasters says that it is difficult to describe how good he feels when helping his brothers. He says, “Seeing the happiness and appreciation of the local brothers and sisters after they stand in their new Kingdom Hall or when they receive assistance after a natural disaster makes all the work and effort worthwhile.”</p>

We have only 24 hours in each day, yet Jesus gave us a principle that can help us use our time wisely. When he sent his disciples out to preach, Jesus told them not to “embrace anybody in greeting along the road.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:10:2-42:10:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Luke 10:2-4</a>) Why would Jesus give those instructions? In Jesus’ day when people greeted each other, they did not just bow or shake hands. Instead, they would hug each other several times and even bow down on the ground. All of this would take a lot of time. Jesus was not telling his followers to be rude. He was helping them to see that they did not have much time, so they needed to make the best use of their time and do what was most important. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:16-49:5:16" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:16</a>) Can we apply this principle so that we will have more time to support the Kingdom work?</p>

Every month, 100 million copies of the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines are printed. All this work is supported by your voluntary donations.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jehovah inspired the apostle Paul to write down a principle we can use when making donations. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:16:1-46:16:2" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 16:1, 2</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>He encouraged <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>his brothers in Corinth, not to wait until the end of the week to see what they had left, but to decide at the beginning of the week how much money they could give.

Others might think of an important date in history that is celebrated, such as when their country became independent. But do you know which national anniversary has been celebrated for more than 3,500 years?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>That anniversary is the Passover. It is the celebration of the Israelites’ being freed from slavery in Egypt. The Passover should be important to you. Why? Because it affects your life in some very important ways. You might think: ‘The Passover is a Jewish celebration, but I am a Christian. Why should I be interested in the Passover?’ The answer is found in these important words: “Christ <strong>our passover </strong>has been sacrificed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:5:7-46:5:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>) What exactly does this mean? To find the answer, we need to know more about the Jewish Passover and what this anniversary has to do with a command given to all Christians.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>When the Israelites had been slaves in Egypt for many years, Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron to <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>ask Pharaoh to free His people. But Pharaoh was proud and did not let the Israelites go. So Jehovah punished Egypt with ten terrible plagues. During the tenth plague, the firstborn of the Egyptians were killed.

When Nisan 14 came, each family was to slaughter a male sheep (or goat) and splash some of its blood on the doorframe of the home.

God told them: “This day must serve as a memorial for you, and you must celebrate it as a festival to Jehovah throughout your generations. As a statute to time indefinite you should celebrate it.” After the Passover celebration on Nisan 14, the Israelites would also celebrate a seven-day festival called the Festival of Unfermented Cakes.

<div id="section3" class="section">
<h2 id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>ON WHAT DAY WAS THE LORD’S EVENING MEAL?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What question about the Passover and the Lord’s Evening Meal might some ask?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jesus gave instructions for the Lord’s Evening Meal right after celebrating the Passover with his apostles. So the Lord’s Evening Meal was on the same day as the Passover. You may have noticed, though, that Jews today may not celebrate the Passover on exactly the same day as we observe the Memorial of Christ’s death. Why the difference? God’s command to the Israelites about the start of the Passover helps us to answer this question. God told the people <strong>when </strong>on Nisan 14 to slaughter the lamb, which is when the Passover would begin.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:5-2:12:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Exodus 12:5, 6</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:6-2:12:6" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Exodus 12:6</a>, when was the Passover lamb to be slaughtered? (See also the box <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:402013925/64-65">“What Part of the Day?”</a>)</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The Jewish publication <em>The Pentateuch and Haftorahs </em>points out that <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:6-2:12:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Exodus 12:6</a> says that the lamb was to be slaughtered “between the two evenings.” Some Bible versions use exactly that expression. Other Bibles, including the Jewish <em>Tanakh, </em>translate it “at twilight.” There are also Bibles that say “at dusk,” “during the evening twilight,” or “around sundown.” So the lamb was to be slaughtered at the <strong>start </strong>of Nisan 14, that is, after the sun had set but while there was still light.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>Some believe that the Passover lamb was slaughtered when? But what question must we ask?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>In later times, some Jews felt that it would have taken hours to slaughter all the lambs brought to the temple. So they believed that the expression “between the two evenings” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:6-2:12:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Exodus 12:6</a> referred to the <strong>end </strong>of Nisan 14, between the time the sun started to go down in the afternoon and the time the sun set in the evening. But if the lambs were slaughtered at the end of Nisan 14, when would the Israelites have eaten the Passover meal? According to Professor Jonathan Klawans, it would have been eaten on Nisan 15. But he admits that this is not said directly in the Bible book of Exodus. He also says that the writings of the rabbis do not discuss how the Passover was celebrated before the year 70, which was the year the temple was destroyed.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>On what day, then, was the Passover meal celebrated in the year 33? Well, on the day before the Passover, Nisan 13, Jesus told Peter and John: “Go and get the passover ready for us to eat.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:7-42:22:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 22:7, 8</a>) Then, on <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>Nisan 14, which was Thursday evening after sunset, Jesus ate the Passover meal with his apostles.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>At the time of the first Passover in Egypt, God commanded the Israelites to celebrate this event every year “to time indefinite.” Each year at the Passover, children would ask their parents why they were celebrating it. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:24-2:12:27" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>Exodus 12:24-27;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:6:20-5:6:23" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 6:20-23</a>) So the Passover would be “a memorial” that even children could learn lessons from.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:14-2:12:14" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Exodus 12:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>From generation to generation, Israelites taught their children important lessons about the Passover.

Imagine what it was like for the Israelites when Jehovah rescued them from Egypt. They were guided to the Red Sea by a pillar of cloud and of fire. Then, they saw Jehovah split the sea into two high walls of water. Next, they walked across on dry ground. Once they were safely across, they watched as those waters crashed down on the Egyptian army. The Israelites praised Jehovah for delivering them and sang: “Let me sing to Jehovah . . .

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>True Christians do not celebrate the Passover.

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>When the lamb was slaughtered for the Passover meal, the Israelites were not to break any of its bones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:46-2:12:46" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Exodus 12:46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:9:11-4:9:12" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Numbers 9:11, 12</a>) What about the bones of “the Lamb of God,” Jesus, who gave his life as a ransom? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:29-43:1:29" data-bid="29-1" class="b">John 1:29</a>) He was hanged on a torture stake with a criminal on each side of him. The Jews asked Pilate to have the bones of Jesus and of the two criminals broken so that they would die quicker. This way, their bodies could be taken off the torture stakes before Nisan 15, a double Sabbath. Soldiers broke the legs of the two criminals, “but on coming to Jesus, as they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:19:31-43:19:34" data-bid="30-1" class="b">John 19:31-34</a>) Just like the bones of the Passover lamb, Jesus’ bones were not broken. So the Passover lamb was like “a shadow” of Jesus’ sacrifice on Nisan 14 of the year 33. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:1-58:10:1" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:1</a>) This fulfilled the words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:34:20-19:34:20" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 34:20</a>.

In the year 33, Nisan 15 was also the beginning of the weekly Sabbath (Saturday). Because both Sabbaths were on the same day in that year, that day was called “a great” Sabbath.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:19:31-43:19:31" data-bid="35-1" class="b"><strong>John 19:31,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:19:42-43:19:42" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> <strong>42</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p></div>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="sc">  Jewish commentator Marcus Kalisch (1828-1885) wrote: “The same opinion has been more distinctly expressed by Ebn Ezra [noted Spanish rabbi, 1092-1167]: ‘We have two evenings; the first, the setting of the sun . . . and the second, the ceasing of the light which is reflected in the clouds; and between both lies an interval of about one hour and twenty minutes;’ and this explanation, which appears to be the most rational interpretation is also that of the Karaites and the Samaritans, and has been adopted by many others.” This explanation that the lamb was killed at the start of Nisan 14 agrees with the command that the Israelites received as recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:16:6-5:16:6" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 16:6</a>: “You should sacrifice the passover in the evening as soon as the sun sets, at the appointed time of your coming out of Egypt.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:30:8-2:30:8" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Exodus 30:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:9:3-4:9:5" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> Numbers 9:3-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:9:11-4:9:11" data-bid="38-3" class="b"> 11</a>.</p>

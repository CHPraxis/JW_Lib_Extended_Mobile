▪  Avoid Being “Quickly Shaken From Your Reason”!
It is important not to be deceived into believing questionable ideas and things not explained in the Bible. We are living very close to the end, so the warnings from First and Second Thessalonians are very appropriate.

▪  Will You Make Sacrifices for the Kingdom?
Those who want to support God’s Kingdom need to be willing to make sacrifices. In this article we will learn from the sacrifices made in ancient Israel. We will also be encouraged by the examples of many who today are giving their best to support the Kingdom work.

▪  ‘This Is to Be a Memorial for You’
▪  ‘Do This in Remembrance of Me’
About the same time each year, Jews celebrate the Passover and true Christians observe the Memorial of Jesus’ death. The first article will discuss why Christians should know about the Passover even though they do not celebrate it. The second article will discuss when we should observe the Lord’s Evening Meal and why this special meeting should be important to all of us.

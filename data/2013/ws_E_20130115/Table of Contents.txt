STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Be Courageous—Jehovah Is With You!
The Bible mentions many servants of God who showed faith and courage. Their experiences will strengthen our faith and help us to serve Jehovah courageously. In this article, we will learn about our yeartext for 2013.
▪  Let Nothing Distance You From Jehovah
▪  Keep Drawing Close to Jehovah
There are many things in life we cannot choose, including our parents, our siblings, and our place of birth. But we can choose whether to stay close to Jehovah or not. These articles will discuss seven things that we should not let separate us from Jehovah.
▪  Serving Without Regrets
All of us have done things that we wish we could go back and do differently. But if we constantly worry about the mistakes we have made, we may not be able to give our best to God. In this article, we will learn how the example of the apostle Paul can help us.
▪  Christian Elders—‘Fellow Workers for Our Joy’
In his second letter to the Corinthians, Paul said about himself and others: “We are fellow workers for your joy.” (2 Corinthians 1:24) What can elders learn from those words of Paul? And how can we encourage one another to continue serving God with joy? In this article we will answer these questions.
COVER: A retired couple conduct a Bible study in Camp Perrin. Like this couple, some Haitian brothers and sisters who lived in another country are now moving back to Haiti to help with the preaching work

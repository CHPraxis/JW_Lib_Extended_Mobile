<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb">JEHOVAH GOD created humans with the need to have a close relationship with him. But Satan wants us to think that we do not need Jehovah. Satan has been trying to make humans believe this ever since he lied to Eve in the garden of Eden. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:4-1:3:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 3:4-6</a>) And since then, many people have thought that humans do not need God.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>We do not need to make the same mistake. The Bible has explained to us the ways Satan tries to mislead people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:2:11-47:2:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>) He tempts us to make choices that will separate us from Jehovah. The previous article explained how we can make good choices about our work, our entertainment, and our family. This article will talk about four more things that Satan uses to tempt us: electronic devices, health concerns, money, and pride. If we make good choices in these areas, we can “draw close to God.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>More and more people are using computers and other electronic devices. When we use these devices in the right way, they can be very helpful. But when we use them in a wrong way, they can separate us from our heavenly Father. Computers can help us. Our brothers use computers to write and publish <em>The Watchtower. </em>Computers can help us do research and communicate, and they can be fun to use. But if we really like computers, we might spend too much time thinking about them <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>and using them. There are many advertisements that tell us we <strong>must have </strong>every new device that is made. One young man wanted a certain computer so much that he secretly had one of his kidneys removed and sold it so that he could buy the computer. What a sad thing to do!</p>

We could spend too much time using them or use them in wrong ways. One brother named Jon, who is almost 30, said that he was spending too much time on the computer instead of studying.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.) He often stayed up late using the Internet. He said that the more tired he was, the harder it was to stop chatting or watching videos, even some bad ones.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>We often ask how others are feeling. People have been getting sick ever since Adam and Eve listened to Satan and separated themselves from Jehovah. Satan is happy that we get sick because when we are sick, it is more difficult to serve Jehovah. And if we die, we cannot serve him at all. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:115:17-19:115:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 115:17</a>) So we want to do what we can to stay healthy.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> (See footnote.)

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>8, 9. </strong>(a) How can we make sure that health is not the <strong>only </strong>thing we think and care about? (b) Why is it good for us to stay joyful?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>However, our health should not be the <strong>only </strong>thing we think and care about. Some spend more time talking about certain diets, health treatments, or health and beauty products than they spend preaching about God’s Kingdom. They may really believe that they are helping others. But we do not use the Kingdom Hall, our assemblies, or our conventions to sell products or advertise our ideas about health. Why not?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>We meet together to discuss the Bible and to have the joy that comes from God’s holy spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:5:22-48:5:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22</a>) It is not the purpose of the meetings to talk about health treatments and products, even if someone else wants to talk about them. We could make others lose their joy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:14:17-45:14:17" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 14:17</a>) Let people make their own decisions about how they will care for their health. No one, not even doctors, can cure all sicknesses. And it does not help us to worry about our health all the time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:25-42:12:25" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 12:25</a>) Instead, the Bible says that “a heart that is joyful” can help us to feel better.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:17:22-20:17:22" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:22</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Similarly, we need to care about how we look. But we do not need to try to look younger than we really are. The Bible says: “Gray-headedness is a crown of beauty when it is found in the way of righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:16:31-20:16:31" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:31</a>) Jehovah thinks that the kind of person we are inside is more important than the way we look, and we <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>too should think that way. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:3-60:3:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 3:3, 4</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>So do we need to risk our health or our life by getting dangerous medical treatments or having surgeries only to improve the way we look? No matter how old we are or how healthy we are, true beauty comes from having “the joy of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:8:10-16:8:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8:10</a>) In the new world, we will be completely healthy and look young again.

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>How can money separate us from Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>It is not wrong to have money or to try to make money. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:7:12-21:7:12" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:19:12-42:19:13" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Luke 19:12, 13</a>) But if we <strong>love </strong>money, it will separate us from Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:9-54:6:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:9, 10</a>) “The anxiety of this system” means worrying too much about getting the things we need. This anxiety can separate us from Jehovah. “The deceptive power of riches” means we can be fooled into believing that money will make us happy and safe. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:13:22-40:13:22" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 13:22</a>) Jesus said that <strong>“no one” </strong>can slave for God and riches.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:24-40:6:24" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 6:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>In what ways do people try to make a lot of money quickly? How can we avoid making bad choices?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>If we think that money is the most important thing, we might be tempted to do wrong. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:28:20-20:28:20" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:20</a>) Some have wanted to make a lot of money quickly, so they bought lottery tickets. Some brothers get involved in businesses that are supposed to make them money quickly, and they even promise others in the congregation that they too can make a lot of money. At other times, brothers have asked members of the congregation for a loan for a business and promised to pay back a lot more money. If we are greedy, we might accept a business offer that could cause us to lose a lot of money. So be careful not to become greedy. It is usually not possible to make a lot of money quickly.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>How does Jehovah want us to view money?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>If we put first “the kingdom and his righteousness,” Jehovah will bless our hard work to obtain what we really need. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:28-49:4:28" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Ephesians 4:28</a>) He does not want us to fall asleep during the meetings because we are working too hard. He does not want us to be worrying about money when we are in the Kingdom Hall. Many people in the world think that they have to do everything they can to make money. They do not want to have to work later in life. They often tell their children to do the same thing. But Jesus showed that this is unreasonable. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:15-42:12:21" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 12:15-21</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Gehazi thought that he could be greedy and still have a good relationship with Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:5:20-12:5:27" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Kings 5:20-27</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Eagles have drowned because they tried to catch a fish that was too heavy. Something similar can happen to us if we try hard to become rich. An elder named Alex explained that he is normally very careful with his money. He does not even like to waste <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>shampoo. But he thought that if he could make some extra money, he could quit his job and pioneer. So he studied how to buy and sell stocks and used all his money to buy what he could. He even borrowed money to buy more stocks! But the stocks he bought became worthless. Alex said: “I was determined to get my money back.” He thought that if he waited, the stocks would become valuable again.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Alex found it difficult to think about anything but his stocks. It was difficult for him to keep his service to Jehovah first, and he could not sleep well. But the stocks never got their value back. Alex lost all his money and had to sell his house. He says that he caused a lot of trouble for his family. But he learned an important lesson. He said that anyone who trusts that Satan’s system will provide real security and happiness will be very disappointed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:11:28-20:11:28" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:28</a>) If we put all our trust in our money or our ability to make money, we are really putting our trust in Satan, who is “the god of this system.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:4-47:4:4" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:17-54:6:17" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 6:17</a>) Alex has now made changes in his life so that he can again spend more time preaching the good news.

Ryan, a 32-year-old ministerial servant, moved to a new congregation. He thought that he would be recommended as an elder very soon. But even after a year, he had not been made an elder. Did Ryan become prideful and get angry with the elders for not making him an elder?

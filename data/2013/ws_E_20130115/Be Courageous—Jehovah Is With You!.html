<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">JEHOVAH’S service brings us joy. But we still have problems like everyone else. And we may suffer for doing what is right. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:13-46:10:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:14-60:3:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 3:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:5:8-60:5:9" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 5:8, 9</a>) To endure these trials successfully, we need faith and courage.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>What is faith? The apostle Paul wrote: “Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:1-58:11:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:1</a>) Another translation reads: “Faith is the title-deed to the things we hope for. Faith is being sure of things we cannot see.” (<em>The Simple English Bible</em>) A “title-deed” is a document that proves that a property belongs to us. Because we have faith that God always does what he promises, it is as if we have received a valuable “title-deed.” We are absolutely convinced that what God has promised will happen and that everything he tells us in his Word is the truth, even “things we cannot see.”</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>3, 4. </strong>(a) What is courage? (b) What is one way to strengthen our faith and courage?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Courage is the strength to speak and act without fear when we are in difficult and dangerous situations. To have courage is to be confident and brave, even willing to suffer for what we believe.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:6:49-41:6:50" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mark 6:49, 50;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:1:7-55:1:7" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 1:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>We may feel that we need more faith and courage. The Bible speaks of thousands of servants of God who were good examples of faith and courage. So one way to strengthen these <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>qualities in us is to think carefully about some of those examples.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>We can think of something that happened about 3,500 years ago. This was 40 years after Jehovah had delivered millions of Israelites from Egypt. The prophet Moses was their leader. He was 120 years old when he went to the top of Mount Nebo and saw the Promised Land. Then he died there on top of the mountain. The next leader of Israel was Joshua, a man “full of the spirit of wisdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:34:1-5:34:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 34:1-9</a>) The Israelite army was ready to take the land of Canaan.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The wisdom, courage, and faith Joshua showed must have strengthened the Israelites during the many years they fought to take the land of Canaan. They needed courage not only to fight in battle but also to obey God. Just before Joshua died, he told them: “You must be very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses by never turning away from it to the right or to the left.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:23:6-6:23:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Joshua 23:6</a>) We too need courage to obey Jehovah at all times, especially when humans tell us to do something that is against God’s will. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:4:18-44:4:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 4:18-20;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:5:29-44:5:29" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> <strong>5:29</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>If we pray for Jehovah’s direction and trust in him, he will help us to have the courage we need.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>To have the courage needed to do God’s will, we must study his Word and do what it says. That is what Jehovah told Joshua to do when he took Moses’ place: “Be courageous and very strong to take care to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you.” He added: <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>“This book of the law should not depart from your mouth, and you must in an undertone read in it day and night, in order that you may take care to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way successful and then you will act wisely.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:1:7-6:1:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Joshua 1:7, 8</a>) Joshua was successful because he followed that counsel.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>When Joshua sent two spies into Canaan, Rahab the prostitute hid them and then sent their enemies in the wrong direction.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Ruth, who was from Moab, lived after Joshua. She probably knew something about Jehovah because she had been married to an Israelite. She had the courage to worship Jehovah. Her mother-in-law, Naomi, had lived in Moab, and when her husband and sons died, she decided to return to Bethlehem, in Israel. On the road, Naomi told Ruth to return to her own people, but Ruth said that she would not turn back to Moab. Ruth said: “Your people will be my people, and your God my God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:1:16-8:1:16" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ruth 1:16</a>) In time, Ruth married Boaz, a man from Naomi’s family.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Our faith and courage become stronger when we see that God is with those who risk their lives to do his will and to protect their brothers. For example, think of High Priest Jehoiada and his wife, Jehosheba. After King Ahaziah died, Athaliah, his mother, killed all the king’s children except Jehoash and made herself queen. But Jehoiada and Jehosheba saved Ahaziah’s son Jehoash and kept him hidden for six years, even though this was a dangerous thing to do. In the seventh year, Jehoiada made Jehoash king and ordered that Athaliah be killed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:11:1-12:11:16" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Kings 11:1-16</a>) Jehoiada later helped King Jehoash to repair the temple.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:38:4-24:38:6" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jeremiah 38:4-6</a>) Ebed-melech asked King Zedekiah to help Jeremiah. What Ebed-melech did was dangerous, since so many people hated Jeremiah. Zedekiah agreed to help and told Ebed-melech to take 30 men with him and get Jeremiah out of the pit. Through Jeremiah, God promised Ebed-melech that he would not die when the Babylonians attacked Jerusalem.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>About 600 years before Christ, three Hebrew servants of God were rewarded for showing faith and courage. King Nebuchadnezzar ordered that all important men of Babylon gather and worship a giant image of gold. Anyone who disobeyed would die in a fiery furnace. The three Hebrews respectfully told Nebuchadnezzar: “Our God whom we are serving is able to rescue us. Out of the burning fiery furnace and out of your hand, O king, he will rescue us. But if not, let it become known to you, O king, that your gods are not the ones we are serving, and the image of gold that you have set up we will not worship.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:3:16-27:3:18" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Daniel 3:16-18</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:3:19-27:3:30" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Daniel <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>3:19-30</a>, we can read the exciting account of how Jehovah saved the three Hebrews.

As soon as he learned about that law, he “entered into his house, and, the windows in his roof chamber being open for him toward Jerusalem, even three times in a day he was kneeling on his knees and praying and offering praise before his God, as he had been regularly doing prior to this.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:6:6-27:6:10" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Daniel 6:6-10</a>) Daniel was thrown into a lions’ pit.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:19:18-3:19:18" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:18</a>) So why was Jesus’ commandment “new”?

Daniel P. Mannix wrote in his book <em>Those About to Die </em>that an altar with a fire burning on it was usually kept in the arena. He said that all a prisoner had to do was sprinkle some incense on the flame and he would be freed. It was explained to the prisoner that he would not be worshipping the emperor. The prisoner was told that he would simply be agreeing that the Roman emperor was a god. Even so, very few Christians accepted this offer to escape.</p>

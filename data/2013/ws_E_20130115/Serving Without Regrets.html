<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">A POET named J. G. Whittier wrote that the saddest words ever written or spoken are “it might have been.” People say these words when they think of how life might have been if they had done some things differently. All of us can think of things we wish we had done differently. But some constantly feel regret, or deep sadness, because of things they did or did not do. Do you feel like that about something you have done?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Some people have made serious mistakes or done very bad things. Others are just not sure if the decisions they made in life were really the best. Some people are able to stop thinking about their past. Others constantly feel bad about decisions they have made and think, ‘If only I had not done that!’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:51:3-19:51:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 51:3</a>) How do you feel? Would you like to do your best in God’s service without constantly worrying about mistakes you have made? Is there an example in the Bible of someone who was able to do that? Yes there is, the apostle Paul.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Paul made both terrible mistakes and wise choices. He deeply regretted the mistakes he had made, but he also learned to focus on doing his best in God’s service. Let us see what we can learn from his example.</p>

<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>PAUL’S PAST</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>What did the apostle Paul wish he had not done?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>When Paul was a young Pharisee named Saul, he did things that he later wished he had not done. For example, he cruelly persecuted Christ’s <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>disciples. The Bible says that immediately after Stephen was killed, Saul “began to deal outrageously with the congregation. Invading one house after another and, dragging out both men and women, he would turn them over to prison.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:8:3-44:8:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 8:3</a>) Albert Barnes, a Bible scholar, said that “to deal outrageously with” means that Saul violently attacked the Christian congregation “like a wild beast.” Saul was a zealous Jew who strongly believed that God wanted him to destroy the Christian congregation. So he viciously persecuted the Christians and threatened to kill “both men and women.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:9:1-44:9:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 9:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:22:4-44:22:4" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 22:4</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.)</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What made Saul stop persecuting Jesus’ disciples and start preaching about Christ?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Saul later wanted to go to Damascus, take Christians from their homes, and drag them to Jerusalem to be punished by the Jewish high court. But Jesus, the Head of the Christian congregation, stopped him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:23-49:5:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:23</a>) While Saul was on his way to Damascus, Jesus appeared to him, and Saul was blinded by a light from heaven. Then Jesus sent him to Damascus to wait for more instructions. We know what happened after that.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:9:3-44:9:22" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 9:3-22</a>.</p>

</div>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>What shows that Paul realized he had made serious mistakes?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>As soon as Paul realized that he was wrong, he stopped persecuting Christ’s disciples and instead began to preach zealously about Christ. Even so, Paul did not ignore what he had done. He later wrote about himself: “You, of course, heard about my conduct formerly in Judaism, that to the point of excess I kept on persecuting the congregation of God and devastating it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:1:13-48:1:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Galatians 1:13</a>) He again mentioned his past when he wrote to the <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>Corinthians, to the Philippians, and to Timothy. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:9-46:15:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 15:9;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:3:6-50:3:6" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Philippians 3:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:1:13-54:1:13" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 1 Timothy 1:13</a>) Paul was ashamed of the things he had done, but he did not pretend that they had never happened. He realized that he had made serious mistakes.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:26:9-44:26:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 26:9-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>A Bible scholar named Frederic W. Farrar wrote that when we think about how severely Paul had persecuted Christians, we can understand the deep sadness he must have felt and how much others may have criticized him. When Paul visited various congregations, it may be that brothers who met him for the first time said: ‘So you’re Paul. You’re the one who persecuted us!’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:9:21-44:9:21" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 9:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>How did Paul feel about the mercy and love that Jehovah and Jesus showed him? What do we learn from Paul’s example?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Paul realized that he was able to serve as an apostle only because God showed him great kindness. He mentions God’s undeserved kindness about 90 times in his 14 letters, more than any other Bible writer. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:10-46:15:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 15:10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Paul was very grateful that God had been merciful to him, and he wanted to show his gratitude. So he worked harder in God’s service than all the other apostles. What do we learn from Paul’s example? If we have faith in Jesus’ sacrifice, confess our sins, and stop doing what is wrong, Jehovah is willing to forgive even very serious sins. So if you <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>think that your sins are too great to be forgiven by means of Christ’s ransom sacrifice, remember the example of Paul. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:1:15-54:1:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 1:15, 16</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Even though Paul had persecuted Jesus, he wrote that Jesus loved <strong>him </strong>and had died for <strong>him. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:9:5-44:9:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 9:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:2:20-48:2:20" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Galatians 2:20</a>) Paul learned that he had to do his best in God’s service in spite of his past, so that he would not have anything else to regret. Is this something that you have learned to do?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>9, 10. </strong>(a) Why might we feel regret? (b) Why is it not good to keep worrying about past mistakes?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Have you done things that you now regret? Do you wish you had used your time and energy for more important things? Did you do something that harmed others? Or maybe there is something else that you wish you had done differently. What can you do if you feel this way?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Some people worry all the time! They make themselves sad and anxious by thinking about their mistakes over and over again. Will you solve any problems by worrying? No! Imagine trying to move forward by rocking for hours in a rocking chair. You would use a lot of energy but get nowhere. Instead of worrying, you must do all you can to solve the problem. Apologize to the person you offended, and try to make peace with him. Think about why you did what you did so that you do not make the same mistake again. Sometimes, though, you may simply have to endure the consequences of your mistake. But worrying about past mistakes will not help you. In fact, it can make it difficult for you to give your best in God’s service.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>(a) What must we do if we want Jehovah to show us mercy and love? (b) According to the Bible, what do we need to do to stop feeling guilty about our past mistakes?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Some feel that the mistakes they have made are so terrible that they do not deserve God’s mercy. Maybe they feel that their mistakes are too serious or that they have made too many mistakes. But the fact is that no matter what they have done in the past, they can admit their mistakes, make changes, and ask God for forgiveness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 3:19</a>) Jehovah can show them mercy and love, just as he has shown to so many others. Jehovah will kindly forgive anyone who is humble, honest, and sorry for his sins. For example, God forgave Job, who deeply regretted the mistakes he had made. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:42:6-18:42:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 42:6</a>; footnote) The Bible tells us exactly what we need to do to stop feeling guilty about our mistakes and to have inner peace: “He that is covering over his transgressions will not succeed, but he that is confessing and leaving them will be shown mercy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:28:13-20:28:13" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:5:14-59:5:16" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> James 5:14-16</a>) We need to confess our sins to God, pray for his forgiveness, and do all we can to show we are sorry for what we did. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:7:10-47:7:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 7:10, 11</a>) Then Jehovah, who <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>forgives “in a large way,” will show us mercy.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:7-23:55:7" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Prayer is a powerful way that God can help us. In a beautiful psalm, David expressed his faith that Jehovah had answered his prayers. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:32:1-19:32:5" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 32:1-5</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Before David confessed his sin to God, his guilty conscience made him feel terrible. He felt anxious, sick, and depressed. David was forgiven and felt relief only after he confessed his sin to God. Jehovah answered David’s prayers. He helped David to feel better and to continue doing what was right. In a similar way, if you worry about mistakes you have made, pray sincerely to Jehovah for forgiveness and do your best to make the necessary changes. Then believe that Jehovah has carefully listened to your prayer and has forgiven you.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:86:5-19:86:5" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 86:5</a>.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sc">Many times, the Bible mentions that Jehovah “felt regret.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/32:3:10-32:3:10" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Jonah 3:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:6-1:6:7" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Genesis 6:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/7:2:18-7:2:18" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> Judges 2:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:15:11-9:15:11" data-bid="25-4" class="b"> 1 Samuel 15:11</a>) The Bible does not mean that Jehovah made mistakes.

For example, in the past, Jehovah decided to punish people because of their badness. But later he showed them mercy and forgave them because they repented and made changes.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:18:7-24:18:10" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Jeremiah 18:7-10</a>.</p>

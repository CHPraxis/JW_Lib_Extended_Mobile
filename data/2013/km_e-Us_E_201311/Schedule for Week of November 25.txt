Then, using the cover subject of The Watchtower, invite the audience to give suggestions on an interest-arousing question to ask. Next, invite suggestions on a scripture to read. Do the same for Awake! and, if time allows, for one other article from either magazine. Demonstrate how each issue may be offered.

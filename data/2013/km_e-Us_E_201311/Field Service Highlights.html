<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">As of May 2013, there were 223 sign-language congregations and 58 groups in the 11 geographic locations cared for by the United States branch office. These are in 12 sign-language circuits. On average, 5,915 Bible studies are conducted each month in the sign-language field. Additionally, 15 sign-language congregations in Canada receive regular visits from a U.S. traveling overseer fluent in ASL. Certainly, these efforts are a fine expression of silent praise to Jehovah God.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:113:1-19:113:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 113:1</a>.</p>

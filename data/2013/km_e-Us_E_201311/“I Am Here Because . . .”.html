<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">When householders open their door and see us standing there, they may wonder who we are and why we are there. What could we say in our introduction to put their mind at ease? After giving the customary greeting, some publishers use the word “because” to explain. For example, they may say: “We are visiting <em>because </em>many neighbors are concerned about crime. Do you think . . .” or “I am here <em>because </em>I give Bible lessons free of charge.” If in the very beginning the householder is told <em>why </em>you are there, he may be more inclined to listen to <em>what </em>you have to say.</p>

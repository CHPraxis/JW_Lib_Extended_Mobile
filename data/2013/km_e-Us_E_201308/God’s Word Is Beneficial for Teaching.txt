God’s Word Is Beneficial for Teaching
 1. What is the theme of the circuit assembly for the 2014 service year, and what question will be answered by the program?
1 Our “Grand Instructor,” Jehovah, is the best teacher in the universe. (Isa. 30:20, 21) How, though, does Jehovah instruct us? He has provided a book that excels all others—his inspired Word, the Bible. How can divine teaching benefit us physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually? The answer to this question will be considered during our circuit assembly program for the 2014 service year. The theme of the program, “God’s Word Is Beneficial for Teaching,” is based on 2 Timothy 3:16.
 2. The main points will be highlighted by the answers to what questions?
2 Look for These Main Points: The main points of the program will be highlighted by the answers to the following questions:
• What effect does divine teaching have on our lives? (Isa. 48:17, 18)
• If we seek to make changes in our circumstances so as to serve Jehovah full-time, of what can we be assured? (Mal. 3:10)
• What should be our reaction when confronted with “strange teachings”? (Heb. 13:9)
• How can we imitate Jesus’ “way of teaching”? (Matt. 7:28, 29)
• Why should teachers in the congregation teach themselves? (Rom. 2:21)
• For what is God’s Word beneficial? (2 Tim. 3:16)
• How are people affected by the “rocking” of the nations? (Hag. 2:6, 7)
• What confidence does Jehovah have in us? (Eph. 5:1)
• Why must we work hard to remain in Jehovah’s teaching? (Luke 13:24)
 3. Why is it important for us to attend and pay close attention to this timely program?
3 Earlier in 2 Timothy chapter 3, just before writing the words on which the theme of this program is based, Paul described the critical times that would characterize the last days. He wrote: “Wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled.” (2 Tim. 3:13) So that we will not be misled, how important it is for us to listen to and apply divine teaching! Therefore, may we be determined to attend and pay close attention to this timely program.

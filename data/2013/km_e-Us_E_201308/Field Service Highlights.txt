Field Service Highlights
When comparing the first six months of this service year with the same period the previous year, the number of regular pioneers increased by 8.8 percent in the Bahamas and by 7.3 percent in the United States. Also during this same period, the number of return visits increased by 6.8 percent in Bermuda and by 13.4 percent in the Turks and Caicos Islands. We rejoice that Jehovah’s servants take seriously their responsibility of ‘watering’ seeds of Kingdom truth.—1 Cor. 3:6.

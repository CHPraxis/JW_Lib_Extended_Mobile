<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Beginning in May of 2011, publishers were encouraged to try to start Bible studies on the first Saturday of each month. To help us do that, a regular feature of the public edition of <em>The Watchtower </em>entitled “Bible Questions Answered” has been prepared. Therefore, the meeting for field service held on the first Saturday should highlight how this feature can be used to start Bible studies and should include a demonstration of a presentation.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The elders can choose to have each field service group meet separately on the first Saturday, or they can decide to have the groups combine and perhaps meet at the Kingdom Hall. However, if multiple congregations use the Kingdom Hall, no congregation should move this special day for starting Bible studies to another day in order to have a combined meeting for field service.</p>

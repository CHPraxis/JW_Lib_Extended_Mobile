<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="qu"> 1. What is the theme of the special assembly day for the 2014 service year?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[13]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Unlike anything that originates with imperfect men, the Bible has the power to transform us, bringing our thoughts and ways into harmony with Jehovah’s will. Just how powerful is the Word of God? How can we fully utilize its power in our lives? How can we use it more effectively to assist others? We are confident that all will be built up spiritually as these points are considered during the special assembly day program prepared for the 2014 service year. Its theme is “God’s Word Exerts Power,” drawn from <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="qu"> 2. We should listen for the answers to what questions?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[14]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Find Answers to These Questions: </strong>As you listen to the program, make note of the answers to the questions listed below.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="su">• Why should we have confidence in Jehovah’s Word? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:29:4-19:29:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 29:4</a>)</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">• How can we experience the power of God’s Word in our own lives? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:34:8-19:34:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 34:8</a>)</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">• How can you unleash the power of God’s Word in your ministry? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17</a>)</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">• How can we avoid falling prey to the deceptive power of Satan’s world? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>)</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">• How can you as a youth attain spiritual success? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:17:7-24:17:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jer. 17:7</a>)</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="su">• How can we become powerful even when we are weak? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:12:10-47:12:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:10</a>)</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="su">• What is the key to ongoing transformation, even with regard to strongly entrenched habits and attitudes? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:23-49:4:23" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eph. 4:23</a>)</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="qu"> 3. Besides listening to the program, how else can we benefit from the special assembly day?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[15]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>How we will benefit from hearing this important information! In addition, the special assembly day, like the circuit assembly and the district convention, will give us opportunities to widen out and to enjoy fellowship with brothers and sisters from outside our congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:133:1-19:133:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:6:11-47:6:13" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 6:11-13</a>) So allow time to associate with old friends and to make new ones. If a visiting speaker such as a district overseer or a brother from Bethel has been assigned to your special assembly day, why not take the opportunity to welcome him and his wife? Indeed, we have many reasons to look forward to the upcoming special assembly day!</p>

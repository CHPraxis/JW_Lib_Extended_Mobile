 3. Besides listening to the program, how else can we benefit from the special assembly day?
3 How we will benefit from hearing this important information! In addition, the special assembly day, like the circuit assembly and the district convention, will give us opportunities to widen out and to enjoy fellowship with brothers and sisters from outside our congregation. (Ps. 133:1-3; 2 Cor. 6:11-13) So allow time to associate with old friends and to make new ones. If a visiting speaker such as a district overseer or a brother from Bethel has been assigned to your special assembly day, why not take the opportunity to welcome him and his wife? Indeed, we have many reasons to look forward to the upcoming special assembly day!

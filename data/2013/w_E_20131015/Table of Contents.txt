STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Creation Reveals the Living God
An invisible God created the visible universe. Do you believe that with all your heart? Not all people do. How can we help others to understand the truth about the Creator and at the same time strengthen our own faith in him? Find out in this article.

▪  “Slave for Jehovah”
Christians are exhorted to slave for Jehovah. This article teaches us what provision the Mosaic Law made for slaves, how we can avoid becoming enslaved to Satan and the lures of his world, and how faithful slavery to our God is richly rewarded.

▪  Lessons From a Well-Prepared Prayer
▪  Act in Harmony With Jesus’ Loving Prayer
If we daily meditate on God’s Word, our prayers will be enriched. The first article shows how this proved true of a prayer the Levites offered in behalf of God’s people. The second article shows how we can act in harmony with one of Jesus’ loving prayers. Both prayers are examples of putting Jehovah’s interests ahead of our personal requests.

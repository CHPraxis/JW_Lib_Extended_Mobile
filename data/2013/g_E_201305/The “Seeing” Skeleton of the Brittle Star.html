<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Consider: </strong>When scientists examined the skeletal plates of the brittle star, they saw “an unusual pattern of densely packed, crystal-clear bumps, each thinner than a human hair,” says the magazine <em>Natural History. </em>These crystalline bumps, made of calcium carbonate (calcite), proved to be high-quality microlenses that focus light onto what seem to be photosensitive nerves just below the plates. Moreover, the lenses have the exact shape needed to produce the desired image.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">According to chemist Joanna Aizenberg, the brittle star’s dual-purpose shell “demonstrates an important principle: in biology, materials are often optimized for multiple functions.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Taking a lesson from the biology of the brittle star, researchers have devised a simple, low-cost method of producing arrays of microlenses made of calcium carbonate. The many applications of these arrays include telecommunications, where they are used to conduct light signals through optical fibers.</p>

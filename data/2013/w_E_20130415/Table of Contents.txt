▪  Receive Full Benefit From Reading the Bible
▪  Help Yourself and Others by Using God’s Word
Paul wrote that “the word of God is alive and exerts power.” (Heb. 4:12) But that power will benefit us only if we study God’s inspired Word and apply its teachings. These articles highlight an effective method of Bible study and show how we can allow godly wisdom to influence our ministry and our personal life.

▪  “Do Not Tire Out”
We are privileged to be part of God’s awesome universal organization. How, though, can we cooperate fully with what it is accomplishing today? What will help us to keep pace with Jehovah’s organization and not tire out? These articles will explain.

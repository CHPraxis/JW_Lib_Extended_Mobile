<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"><strong>1, 2. </strong>How is our confidence heightened by contemplating Jehovah’s universal organization?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">IT IS awe-inspiring to contemplate that we are part of a vast universal organization. The visions recorded in <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:1:1-26:1:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezekiel chapter 1 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:7:1-27:7:28" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Daniel chapter 7</a> vividly portray Jehovah maneuvering matters to a grand climax. Jesus is taking the lead in directing the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization to focus on preaching the good news, to care spiritually for those carrying out this work, and to promote the true worship of Jehovah. What confidence this gives us in Jehovah’s organization!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Are we personally in step with this wonderful organization? Is our enthusiasm for the truth ever-increasing, or is it decreasing? When considering such questions, we may note that we have begun to tire out or perhaps have lost some of our zeal. That can happen. In the first century, the apostle Paul had to exhort fellow Christians to consider the zealous example of Jesus. Paul said that this would help them not to “get tired and give out in [their] souls.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:3-58:12:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 12:3</a>) In a similar manner, careful examination of the preceding article, which shows what is being accomplished by Jehovah’s organization, ought to have done much toward helping us maintain our enthusiasm and endurance.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What is needed in order for us not to tire out, and what will we consider in this article?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Paul, however, indicated that more is needed if we are not going to tire out. He stated that we would need to work at “doing what is fine.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:9-48:6:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gal. 6:9</a>) Thus, action is needed on our part. Let us consider five areas of activity that can help us to remain steadfast and to keep pace with Jehovah’s organization. Then we can personally decide whether there are aspects to which we or our families need to give greater attention.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Why can we say that gathering together is an integral part of true worship?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Gathering together has always been a key activity for Jehovah’s servants. In the invisible realm, spirit creatures are invited into Jehovah’s immediate presence at appropriate times. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:22:19-11:22:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:1:6-18:1:6" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Job 1:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:2:1-18:2:1" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:7:10-27:7:10" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Dan. 7:10</a>) In ancient Israel, the nation was to gather “in order that they may listen and in order that they may learn.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:31:10-5:31:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deut. 31:10-12</a>) Jews in the first century had the custom of going to the synagogues to read from the Scriptures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:16-42:4:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 4:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:21-44:15:21" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Acts 15:21</a>) This emphasis on meeting together continued with the formation of the Christian congregation, and it is still a major part of our worship. True Christians “consider one another to incite to love and fine works.” We need to keep on “encouraging one another, and all the more so as [we] behold [Jehovah’s] day drawing near.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How can we encourage one another at our meetings?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>One important way in which we encourage one another is by having a share in our meetings. We can make a public expression of our faith by answering a printed question, by giving an application of a scripture, by relating a brief experience that illustrates the wisdom of following Bible principles, or in other ways. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:22:22-19:22:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 22:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:40:9-19:40:9" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 40:9</a>) Surely you will agree that no matter how many years we have been attending meetings, it remains a source of encouragement to listen to the heartfelt comments made by our brothers and sisters<wbr />—old and young.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>For what other reasons does our God place such importance on our regularly gathering together? Our meetings, assemblies, and conventions help us to have courage to speak with boldness and to deal with opposition or apathy in our territories. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:4:23-44:4:23" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 4:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:4:31-44:4:31" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 31</a>) We are strengthened and made firm in the faith by the Scriptural discussions.

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>7, 8. </strong>(a) What is the primary purpose of our congregation meetings? (b) How do the meetings help you spiritually?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>There is something even more important, however, than the personal benefits we receive from our meetings. The primary purpose of our gathering together is to worship Jehovah. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:95:6-19:95:6" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong><em>Psalm 95:6</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>What a privilege we have to praise our wonderful God! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:16-51:3:16" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Col. 3:16</a>) Jehovah deserves our regular worship through our attendance and participation at theocratic gatherings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rev. 4:11</a>) It is no wonder, then, that we are exhorted ‘not to forsake the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom’!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:25-58:10:25" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Heb. 10:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Do we see our Christian meetings as a provision to help us endure until Jehovah acts against this wicked system of things? If so, the meetings will be among “the more important things” that we make room for in our busy lives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:1:10-50:1:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Phil. 1:10</a>) It would have to be something extremely significant to cause us to miss an <span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>opportunity to be united with our brothers in worship of Jehovah.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Having a full share in the preaching work also helps us to keep in step with Jehovah’s organization. Jesus set this work in motion when he was here on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) Since then, the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work has been a main focus of Jehovah’s entire organization. Many modern-day experiences give evidence that the angels are supporting our work and guiding us to those “rightly disposed for everlasting life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 13:48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:14:6-66:14:7" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Rev. 14:6, 7</a>) The earthly part of Jehovah’s organization is in place today and organized to support this all-important work.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Being zealous in the ministry helps us to maintain our enthusiasm for the truth. Consider the comments of Mitchel, a longtime elder and regular pioneer. He states: “I love telling people about the truth. I think about a new article in <em>The Watchtower </em>or <em>Awake! </em>and just marvel at the wisdom, insight, and perfect balance in each issue. I want to get out in the ministry to see how people will react, how I can spark their interest. <span id="page30" class="pageNum" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>My ministry keeps me stable.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jehovah has provided a bounteous supply of written spiritual food to give us strength. No doubt, you can think of a time when after reading a publication, you thought: ‘That is exactly what I needed! It is as if Jehovah had that written just for me!’ That is not a coincidence. Through these provisions, Jehovah does instruct and guide us. He has said: “I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:32:8-19:32:8" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 32:8</a>) Do we strive to take in all the spiritual food we receive and meditate on it?

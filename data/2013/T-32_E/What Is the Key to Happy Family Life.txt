What Is the Key to Happy Family Life?

Do you think it is . . .
           love?

           money?

           something else?





WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS

“Happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it!”​—Luke 11:28, New World Translation.



WHAT THAT CAN MEAN FOR YOU

Finding real love.​—Ephesians 5:28, 29.
Enjoying genuine respect.​—Ephesians 5:33.
Having true security.​—Mark 10:6-9.








CAN WE REALLY BELIEVE WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS?

Yes, for at least two reasons:
            God is the Originator of family life. The Bible says that “every family . . . owes its name” to Jehovah God. (Ephesians 3:14, 15) In other words, the family unit exists because Jehovah created it. Why is that significant?
Consider: If you were enjoying a tasty meal and wanted to learn its ingredients, whom would you ask? Logically, the person who prepared it.
Likewise, to discover the ingredients for a happy family life, we do well to look to Jehovah, the Originator of the family arrangement.​—Genesis 2:18-24.

            God cares about you. Families are wise to seek Jehovah’s advice, which he provides through his Word. Why? “Because he cares for you.” (1 Peter 5:6, 7) Jehovah has your best interests at heart​—and his counsel always works!​—Proverbs 3:5, 6; Isaiah 48:17, 18.





TO THINK ABOUT





How can you be a good husband, wife, or parent?
The Bible answers that question at EPHESIANS 5:1, 2 and COLOSSIANS 3:18-21.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In 1473 B.C.E., the Israelites were poised to enter the Promised Land, but powerful enemies stood before them. “Be courageous and very strong,” God commanded Joshua. If he remained faithful, Joshua would be successful. “Do not suffer shock or be terrified,” he was told, “for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.” And God did prove to be with him, for the Israelites conquered their enemies in just six years.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:7-6:1:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 1:7-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">True Christians are soon to cross into the promised new world, so they need to be courageous and strong. Like Joshua, we face powerful enemies who strive to break our integrity. The battles we fight are waged, not with spears and swords, but with spiritual weapons, and Jehovah trains us to use them skillfully. Whatever situation you may face, be assured that if you are courageous, strong, and faithful, Jehovah will be with you to make you victorious.</p>

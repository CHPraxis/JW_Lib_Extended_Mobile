That event should be important to you. Why? Because it relates to some very significant aspects of your life. ‘But,’ you might think, ‘though Jews celebrate Passover, I am not a practicing Jew. Why should I be interested in that anniversary?’ The answer can be found in this profound statement: “Christ <em>our passover </em>has been sacrificed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:5:7-46:5:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 5:7</a>) To grasp the import of that truth, we need to know about the Jewish Passover and to consider it in the light of a command given to all Christians.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>When the Israelites had been slaves in Egypt for many years, Jehovah sent Moses and his brother, Aaron, to Pharaoh to ask him to liberate His people. That haughty Egyptian ruler would not let the Israelites go, so Jehovah struck the land with a series of devastating plagues. Finally, God sent a tenth plague, the death of Egypt’s firstborn, which <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>did move Pharaoh to release them.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:1:11-2:1:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 1:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:3:9-2:3:10" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:5:1-2:5:2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 5:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:11:1-2:11:1" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 11:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:11:5-2:11:5" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> 5</a>.</p>

On Nisan 14, each household was to slaughter a male sheep (or goat) and splash some of its blood on the doorposts and lintel of the house.

God told them: “This day must serve as a memorial for you, and you must celebrate it as a festival to Jehovah throughout your generations. As a statute to time indefinite you should celebrate it.” The celebration on the 14th was to be followed by a seven-day festival.

<h2 id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>THE LORD’S EVENING MEAL<wbr />—WHAT DAY?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>In considering the Passover and the Lord’s Evening Meal, what question arises?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Given that Jesus instituted the Lord’s Evening Meal right after the last valid Passover, this new event would coincide with the day of the Passover. You may have observed, though, that the date of the Jewish Passover shown on some modern calendars may differ one or more days from the date when we commemorate Christ’s death. Why the difference? The answer, in part, involves God’s command to the Israelites. After saying that “the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel must slaughter” the lamb, Moses specified <em>when </em>on Nisan 14 they were to do so.<wbr />—<strong><em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:5-2:12:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong><em>Exodus 12:5, 6</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:6-2:12:6" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Exodus 12:6</a>, when was the Passover lamb to be slaughtered? (See also the box <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:2013925/54-55">“What Part of the Day?”</a>)</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>The Pentateuch and Haftorahs </em>points out that <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:6-2:12:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Exodus 12:6</a> says that the lamb was to be slaughtered “between the two evenings.” Some Bible versions use exactly that expression. Others, including the Jewish <em>Tanakh, </em>translate it “at twilight.” Still others, “at dusk,” “during the evening twilight,” or “around sundown.” <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>So the lamb was to be slaughtered after the sun had set but while there was still light, at the <em>start </em>of Nisan 14.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>According to some, when was the lamb slaughtered, but what question does that raise?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>In later times, some Jews thought that it would have taken hours to slaughter all the lambs brought to the temple. So <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:6-2:12:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Exodus 12:6</a> was understood to refer to the <em>end </em>of Nisan 14, between the time when the sun started to decline (after noon) and the end of the day at sunset. But if that were the meaning, when would the meal have been eaten? Professor Jonathan Klawans, a specialist in ancient Judaism, noted: “The new day begins with the setting of the sun, so the sacrifice is made on the 14th but the beginning of Passover and the meal are actually on the 15th, <em>although this sequence of dates is not specified in Exodus.” </em>He also wrote: “Rabbinic literature . . . does not even <em>claim </em>to be telling us how the Seder [Passover meal] was performed before the destruction of the Temple” in 70 C.E.<wbr />—Italics ours.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>(a) What did Jesus go through on the day of Passover 33 C.E.? (b) Why was Nisan 15 in 33 C.E. called “a great” Sabbath? (See footnote.)</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>We thus have reason to ask, What of the Passover in 33 C.E.? Well, on Nisan 13, as the day drew near ‘on which the passover victim was to be sacrificed,’ Christ told Peter and John: “Go and get the passover ready for us to eat.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:7-42:22:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 22:7, 8</a>) “At length . . . the hour came” for the Passover meal, after sunset on Nisan 14, which would be Thursday evening. Jesus ate that meal with his apostles, and then he instituted the Lord’s Evening Meal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:14-42:22:15" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 22:14, 15</a>) That night he was arrested and tried. Jesus was impaled close to noon on Nisan 14, and that afternoon he died. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:19:14-43:19:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 19:14</a>) Thus, “Christ <em>our passover </em>[was] sacrificed” on the same day as the Passover lamb was slaughtered.

Moses said that in the future, <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>God’s people were to keep the Passover; it was to be a regulation “to time indefinite.” As part of that annual observance, children would ask their parents questions that focused on the meaning of the event. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:24-2:12:27" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong><em>Exodus 12:24-27;</em></strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:6:20-5:6:23" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Deut. 6:20-23</a>) Hence, the Passover would have meaning as “a memorial” even for children.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:14-2:12:14" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ex. 12:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>As new generations grew up, important lessons would be emphasized, passed on by father to son. One was that Jehovah could protect his worshippers. The children learned that he is not some vague, abstract deity. Jehovah is a real, living God who is interested in his people and who acts in their behalf. He proved this at the time he protected the Israelite firstborn “when he plagued the Egyptians.” He kept the firstborn alive.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Christian parents do not each year recount to their sons and daughters the meaning of that Passover.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>What can be learned from the Passover is not just Jehovah’s ability to protect his people. He also delivered them, having ‘brought them out of Egypt.’ Think about what that included. They were guided by a pillar of cloud and of fire. They walked on the seabed as the Red Sea towered on the left and on the right. Once safely across, they saw those waters crash over the Egyptian military. Then the delivered Israelites could sound forth: “Let me sing to Jehovah . . . The horse and its rider he has pitched into the sea.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>17, 18. </strong>Thinking about the use of blood at the first Passover should bring what to our mind?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>True Christians do not memorialize the Jewish Passover. That anniversary was part of the Mosaic Law, and we are not under the Law.

Still, there are features of the Passover observance that was instituted back in Egypt that have meaning for us.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>The lamb’s blood sprinkled on the doorposts and lintel was a means to preserve life. Today, we do not offer animal sacrifices to God<wbr />—neither on the date of the Passover nor at any other time. But there is a better sacrifice that can preserve life permanently. The apostle Paul wrote about “the congregation of the firstborn who have been enrolled in the heavens.” The means of preserving the lives of those anointed Christians is “the blood of sprinkling,” Jesus’ blood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:23-58:12:24" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Heb. 12:23, 24</a>) Christians who hope to live forever on earth depend on that same blood for preservation.

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>When the lamb was slaughtered for the Passover meal, the Israelites were not to break any of its bones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:46-2:12:46" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ex. 12:46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:9:11-4:9:12" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Num. 9:11, 12</a>) What of “the Lamb of God” who came to provide the ransom? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:29-43:1:29" data-bid="29-1" class="b">John 1:29</a>) He was impaled with a criminal on each side. The Jews asked Pilate that the bones of the impaled men be broken. This would hasten their death so that they would not be left on the stakes into Nisan 15, a double Sabbath. Soldiers broke the legs of the two impaled criminals, “but on coming to Jesus, as they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:19:31-43:19:34" data-bid="30-1" class="b">John 19:31-34</a>) That matched what was done with the Passover lamb, so this lamb was in that sense “a shadow” of what was to come on Nisan 14, 33 C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:1-58:10:1" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Heb. 10:1</a>) Moreover, the way things worked out fulfilled the words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:34:20-19:34:20" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 34:20</a>, which should strengthen our confidence in prophecy.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>There are, however, differences between the Passover and the Lord’s Evening Meal. These show that the Passover that the Jews were to memorialize was not to foreshadow what Christ told his followers to do in memory of his death. Back in Egypt, the Israelites partook of the lamb’s flesh but not of its blood. That differs from what Jesus directed his disciples to do. He said that those who would reign “in the kingdom of God” should partake of both the bread and the wine as <em>symbols </em>of his flesh and his blood. We will consider this in more detail in the following article.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:14:22-41:14:25" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Mark 14:22-25</a>.</p>

STUDY ARTICLES
▪  Avoid Being “Quickly Shaken From Your Reason”!
How important it is that we do not let ourselves be deceived into accepting as truth questionable ideas and wild speculation! In the books of First and Second Thessalonians, we find timely warnings for us.

▪  Will You Make Sacrifices for the Kingdom?
Much self-sacrifice is needed to advance Kingdom interests. In this article we will learn from the sacrifices made in ancient Israel. We will also consider examples of many who today are making sacrifices to support the Kingdom.

▪  ‘This Is to Be a Memorial for You’
▪  ‘Do This in Remembrance of Me’
About the same time of the year, Jews celebrate the Passover and true Christians observe the Memorial of Jesus’ death. Why should we know about the Passover? How do we know when the Lord’s Evening Meal should be held, and what meaning should it have for all of us?

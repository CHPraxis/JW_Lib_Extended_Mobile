<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">PEOPLE willingly make sacrifices for the things that are important to them. Parents give their time, money, and energy to benefit their children. While their peers play and have fun, young athletes who aspire to represent their country in the Olympics spend several hours every day strenuously practicing and training. Jesus too made sacrifices for things that were important to him. He did not seek luxuries, and he did not have children of his own. Rather, he chose to focus on the advancing of Kingdom interests. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:17-40:4:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 4:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:9:58-42:9:58" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Luke 9:58</a>) His followers likewise gave up much to support God’s Kingdom. The advancement of that Kingdom was of primary importance to them, and they made sacrifices to have as full a share as possible in supporting the Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:18-40:4:22" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 4:18-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:19:27-40:19:27" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 19:27</a>) So we may ask ourselves, ‘What is important in my life?’</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>(a) What sacrifices are fundamental for all true Christians? (b) What additional sacrifices are some able to make?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Certain sacrifices are fundamental for all true Christians and are essential to our cultivating and maintaining a good relationship with Jehovah. Such sacrifices include devoting personal time and energy to prayer, Bible reading, family worship, meeting attendance, and the field ministry.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Josh. 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Matt. 28:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) As a result of our efforts and Jehovah’s blessing, the preaching work is accelerating, and many continue to stream to “the mountain of the house of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:2:2-23:2:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa. 2:2</a>) To support Kingdom activities, many make sacrifices to serve at Bethel, to assist with building Kingdom Halls and <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>Assembly Halls, to organize conventions, or to do relief work in the wake of natural disasters. This additional work is not a requirement to gain life but is vital to supporting Kingdom interests.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>(a) How do we benefit when we make sacrifices for the Kingdom? (b) What questions should we consider?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>The need for active support of the Kingdom has never been greater. It is a joy to see that many are willingly making sacrifices for Jehovah. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:54:6-19:54:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong><em>Psalm 54:6</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>Such a generous spirit brings us much joy as we await the coming of God’s Kingdom.

Are there ways in which we can make additional sacrifices for the Kingdom? How are we using our time, money, energy, and abilities? What cautions must we consider? Let us review a pattern that we can imitate for making such voluntary sacrifices, thus increasing our joy.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>How did the Israelites benefit from making sacrifices?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Offering sacrifices in ancient Israel was the basis for receiving forgiveness of sins. Sacrifices were necessary for the people to enjoy Jehovah’s favor. Some of these were required; others were voluntary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:23:37-3:23:38" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Lev. 23:37, 38</a>) Whole burnt offerings could be made as voluntary offerings, or gifts, to Jehovah. An outstanding example of offerings was seen in connection with the inauguration of the temple in Solomon’s day.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:7:4-14:7:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Chron. 7:4-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What provision did Jehovah make for those with limited means?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah lovingly understood that not everyone could give the same amount, and he required from each one only according to the individual’s ability. Jehovah’s law stipulated that the blood of the animal be shed, which was to be “a shadow of the good things to come” through his Son, Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:1-58:10:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Heb. 10:1-4</a>) However, Jehovah was not rigid in the application of that law. For example, God would accept an offering of turtledoves if the person could not afford an offering from the flock or the herd. Thus, even the poor could joyfully sacrifice to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:1:3-3:1:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Lev. 1:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:1:10-3:1:10" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:1:14-3:1:14" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:5:7-3:5:7" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> 5:7</a>) Though the animals sacrificed may have differed, there were two things that <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>were required from each person making voluntary sacrifices.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What was required of each person when making sacrifices, and how important was it to follow those requirements?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>First, the person had to give his best. Jehovah told the nation that any offering had to be a sound one in order “to gain approval.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:22:18-3:22:20" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lev. 22:18-20</a>) If there was a defect in the animal, it would not be viewed as an acceptable sacrifice to Jehovah. Second, the person giving the sacrifice had to be clean and undefiled. If a person was in an unclean state, he would have to make a sin offering or a guilt offering to restore his standing with Jehovah before making a voluntary offering. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:5:5-3:5:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Lev. 5:5, 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:5:15-3:5:15" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 15</a>) This was a serious matter. Jehovah stipulated that if someone in an unclean state partook of a communion sacrifice, which included voluntary offerings, he would be cut off from God’s people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:7:20-3:7:21" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Lev. 7:20, 21</a>) On the other hand, when the person making the sacrifice had a good standing with Jehovah and the offering was without defect, the giver could rejoice with satisfaction.<wbr />—<strong><em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:29:9-13:29:9" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong><em>1 Chronicles 29:9</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

Working in behalf of our brothers is rewarding. One brother who shares in building Kingdom Halls and assisting those affected by natural disasters states that it is hard to describe the satisfaction he receives from serving in these ways. He says, “Seeing the happiness and appreciation of the local brothers and sisters after they stand in their new Kingdom Hall or when they receive assistance after a natural disaster makes all the work and effort worthwhile.”</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup><em>Our time. </em></strong>It takes much time and effort to translate and print our literature, to build places of worship, to organize conventions, to assist in disaster relief, and to engage in many other necessary activities. We have only a fixed amount of hours in a day. Jesus provided a principle that can help. When sending out his disciples into the field, Jesus told them not to “embrace anybody in greeting along the road.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:10:2-42:10:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Luke 10:2-4</a>) Why would Jesus give such instructions? One Bible scholar states: “Salutations among the Orientals did not consist, as among us, of a slight bow, or extension of the hand, but [were] performed by many embraces, and inclinations, and even prostrations of the body on the ground. All this required much time.” Jesus was not encouraging his followers to be rude. Rather, he was helping them see that they had a limited amount of time and that they needed to make the most of it to care for the more important things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:16-49:5:16" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Eph. 5:16</a>) Can we apply this principle so as to have more time to assist with work in behalf of the Kingdom?</p>

However, the project was to be undertaken in the middle of their planting season.

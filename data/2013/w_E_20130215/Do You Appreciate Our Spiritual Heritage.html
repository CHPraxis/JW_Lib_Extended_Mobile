<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">DURING a milestone governing body meeting in Jerusalem in 49 C.E., the disciple James said: “Symeon [Peter] has related thoroughly how God for the first time turned his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name. And with this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written, ‘After these things I shall return and rebuild the booth of David that is fallen down; and I shall rebuild its ruins and erect it again, in order that those who remain of the men may earnestly seek Jehovah, together with people of all the nations, people who are called by my name, says Jehovah, who is doing these things, known from of old.’”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:13-44:15:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 15:13-18</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>When the Jews were taken into captivity in Babylon, it was clear that “the booth of David” had fallen. Since false religion ran rampant in Babylonia, how did God’s people survive spiritually during their 70-year exile there from 607 B.C.E. to 537 B.C.E.? <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>The same way we survive as Jehovah’s people in this world under Satan’s control. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) A rich spiritual heritage has helped to make such survival possible.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>As part of our spiritual legacy, we have the written Word of God. Jewish exiles in Babylon did not have the Holy Scriptures in complete form, but they did have knowledge of the Mosaic Law, with its Ten Commandments. They knew “the songs of Zion,” could recall many proverbs, and were acquainted with the exploits of earlier servants of Jehovah. Yes, those exiles wept when they remembered Zion, and they did not forget Jehovah. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:137:1-19:137:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong><em>Psalm 137:1-6</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>That kept them alive spiritually even in Babylon, with its many false doctrines and practices.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What evidence of religious triads, or trinities, do we have from ancient Babylon and Egypt?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The religious triad, or trinity, was a prominent feature of worship in Babylon. One Babylonian triad was composed of Sin (a moon-god), Shamash (a sun-god), and Ishtar (a goddess of fertility and war). In ancient Egypt, a god was often viewed as being married to a goddess who bore him a son, “forming a divine triad or trinity in which the father, moreover, was not always the chief, contenting himself on occasion with the role of prince consort, while the principal deity of the locality remained the goddess.” (<em>New Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology</em>) One Egyptian triad consisted of the god Osiris, the goddess Isis, and their son Horus.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>How would you define the Trinity, and how have we been protected from believing such error?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Christendom has its triad<wbr />—the Trinity. Clerics say that the Father, the Son, and the holy spirit are one God. But that is an assault on the sovereignty of Jehovah, making it seem that he is triune<wbr />—in effect, only one third of a supposed godhead. Jehovah’s people have been protected from believing such error because they agree with these inspired words: “Listen, O Israel: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:6:4-5:6:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 6:4</a>) Jesus quoted that statement, and would any true Christian disagree with him?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:12:29-41:12:29" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Mark 12:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>Why is it impossible for a person who believes in the Trinity to be baptized in symbol of a valid dedication to God?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>The Trinity doctrine runs counter to the commission Jesus gave his followers to “make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19</a>) To be baptized as a genuine Christian and one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, a person must acknowledge the supremacy of the Father, Jehovah, as well as the position and authority of God’s Son, Jesus. The baptism candidate must also believe that the holy spirit is God’s active force, not part of a Trinity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:2-1:1:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 1:2</a>) An individual who continues to believe in the Trinity cannot be baptized in symbol of a valid dedication to Jehovah God.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Religious thought in Babylonia provided plenty of room for false doctrines, deities, demons, and spiritism. <em>The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia </em>states: “Next in importance to the gods in the Bab[ylonian] religion are the <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>demons who had the power to afflict men with manifold diseases of body or mind.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>After their Babylonian exile, many Jews fell prey to unscriptural ideas. As Greek concepts made inroads, many Jews became vulnerable to demonic control because they adopted the view that demons could be evil or good. Our spiritual legacy protects us from the dangers of willing involvement with demons, for we know that God condemned Babylon’s spiritistic practices.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Spiritism has been practiced not only by the Babylonians but also by supporters of Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:18:21-66:18:24" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rev. 18:21-24</a>) <em>The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible </em>states: “Babylon [the Great] embraces more than one empire or culture. It is defined rather by dominant idolatries than by geographical or temporal boundaries.” (Vol. 1, p. 338) Riddled with spiritism, idolatry, and other sins, Babylon the Great still exists<wbr />—but not for long.<wbr />—<strong><em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:18:1-66:18:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 18:1-5</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>What warnings have we published regarding spiritism?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jehovah declared: “I cannot put up with the use of uncanny power.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:1:13-23:1:13" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 1:13</a>) Often called spiritualism, the practice of spiritism played a notable role in 19th-century thinking. <em>Zion’s Watch Tower </em>of May 1885 therefore said: “The belief that the dead are alive in another sphere or condition of being is not new. It was part of the religion of the ancients, and was the very root of all mythology.” The article added that the unscriptural idea of the dead communicating with the living “has given cover and force to the deceptions practised by ‘demons’ under the guise of dis-embodied spirits of men. They have eagerly availed themselves of this mode of concealing their identity, and have thus perpetuated their sway over the minds and lives of many.” The early booklet <em>What Say the Scriptures About Spiritism? </em>gave similar warnings, as have our more recent publications.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>The Jews were in a position to know the truth about the dead. When Greece was divided among the generals of Alexander the Great, however, efforts were made to unite Judah with Syria by <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>such means as Greek religion and Hellenic culture. As a result, the Jews accepted the false teachings that the human soul is immortal and that there is an underworld place of torment. The Greeks did not originate the idea of an underworld full of suffering souls, for the Babylonians thought of “the nether world . . . as a place full of horrors, . . . presided over by gods and demons of great strength and fierceness.” (<em>The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria</em>) Yes, the Babylonians believed in the immortality of the soul.</p>

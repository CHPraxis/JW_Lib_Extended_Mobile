New Literature Rates
Throughout the world costs are increasing. The materials we use in the production of our literature are costing more than ever before. Shipping and mailing costs have also gone up. We have reached the point where it is necessary to increase the prices of some of our publications.
As announced in Our Kingdom Service last month, as of January 1, 1978, the Watchtower and Awake! subscriptions will increase in price to $2.00 for a year’s subscription and $1.00 for six months. At the same time the individual copies of the magazines will be offered for 10 cents per copy in the United States. Prices of individual copies to the congregations and pioneers in this country will be double what they were, namely, 8 cents to the congregations and 2 cents to the pioneers. Congregations will remit $1.85 for each subscription obtained by publishers and $1.00 on pioneers’ subscriptions.
Also affected by the price increase from January 1 on is the regular edition of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. In the United States the price change goes up to $1.50 for the public. This means that the congregations will be charged $1.40 and the pioneers 75c.
In some languages we publish only the Christian Greek Scriptures. The New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures will change proportionately. The public price will be 75c. Congregations will remit 70c, and pioneers 40c.
There will be no change in the price of the deluxe edition of the New World Translation at this time.
This increase in the literature rates on the above items will help the Society to meet the higher production and shipping costs involved and still make it possible for people everywhere to receive these publications for a small contribution.

Special Combination Book Offer
According to literature inventories received by the Society at the close of the 1977 service year, many congregations still have a good supply of older publications in stock, including many 384-page book. These books have a fine message that would be of great benefit to persons seeking the truth. During February and March we want to make this information available to people in our territory by offering three books for 60 cents.
The field overseer and the ministerial servant assigned to care for literature needs in the congregation should review what items are on hand as shown on your literature inventory. The combination of three books should include two 384- or 416-page books and one pocket-size book. For each 384- or 416-page book placed the congregation will be able to request 30 cents credit at the end of each month. Publishers may obtain these larger books at the literature counter for 15c each. Among the publications to be used are the following:
384- or 416-Page Books
“Your Will Be Done on Earth”
“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”
Life Everlasting​—in Freedom of the Sons of God
“Then Is Finished the Mystery of God”
“The Nations Shall Know that I Am Jehovah”​—How?

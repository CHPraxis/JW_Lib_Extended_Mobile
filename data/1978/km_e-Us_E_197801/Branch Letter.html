<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Kingdom Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Congregations throughout the country had some encouraging results from the tract distribution in September. One elder stated that: “Now our congregation has no shortage of return visits to go on.” Others had similar expressions. There were over 220,000 more books placed this September in connection with the tract work than were placed in September 1976.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">There have been some interesting developments in recent months. For example, at the annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania on October 1, 1977, it was announced that plans are being made to computerize the printing operations in Brooklyn and at the Watchtower Farms. At present, we do have a small business computer in operation. With the use of this computer we hope to save time and be of better service to our brothers in the months ahead. However, during the transitional period delays may occur.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">During the month of December the first groups of pioneers were scheduled to attend the Pioneer Service Schools. These schools are situated in 13 different areas in the United States. About 350 were scheduled to attend the first of these two-week classes. Other classes will be scheduled for March and April as well as this fall.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In addition to the Pioneer Service School, the first sessions of the Five-Week Gilead Course for the benefit of the Branch Committee members was scheduled to begin at the close of December at Brooklyn Bethel. These courses will provide training in handling Scriptural and committee matters, operations in the Society’s Bethel homes and printing facilities, and cover other subjects that will be useful to the brothers in their assignments.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">With all of these fine provisions <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>we are excited over the expectations for the future. We are continuing to plan for future advancement and expansion with complete awareness that the “day of Jehovah” is approaching.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:11-61:3:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:11, 12</a>.</p>

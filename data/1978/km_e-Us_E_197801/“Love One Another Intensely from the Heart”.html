<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>How do you feel about your brothers and sisters in the congregation? Having accepted the truth yourself and molded your life to conform to God’s will, do you count each member of the congregation​—each brother and sister—​as bought with the same precious blood and equally loved by God? If so, your love will be unhypocritical​—intensely from the heart—​and will manifest itself in deeds. Are you showing this love?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:22-60:1:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><strong>HOW CAN WE SHOW THIS LOVE?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>We want to help everyone we can spiritually. But in our busy lives do we forget the other needs that people have? For example, some may be physically unable to mow their lawn or shovel snow, take out the garbage, or clean the house, and may also be financially unable to hire someone to do it. Or the problem may be repairs on the home. Elderly or sick persons may appreciate your doing some painting or repairs around the home. In some cases you may run an errand to shop for groceries or other items or to take care of some necessary business for them. In addition to our making public declaration to God’s name, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:16-58:13:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:16</a> encourages us: “Do not forget the doing of good and the sharing of things with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>All of us have a special responsibility toward widows in their tribulation, as Jesus’ half brother pointed out at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:27-59:1:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 1:27</a>. Lonesomeness is a distressing thing for many bereaved persons or older ones. Sisters, both old and young, could take turns visiting widows or sisters who are ill. They could read together, sew, or talk, or help the handicapped one to telephone others or to write letters in witnessing. Occasionally a sister or two could cook a meal and take it to the home of the “shut-in.” At the same time an atmosphere of love and good fellowship will be enjoyed by all involved. Brothers, including younger ones, could help sick or shut-in brothers.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>What a bond of love and unity can be built up in a congregation if all “love one another intensely from the heart”! Sometimes it will cost time and money. But our willingness to share with our brothers is evidence of the genuineness of our love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35</a>) Moreover, God can equalize matters and increase or blessings in many ways, and he will do so.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:14-47:8:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:13-47:9:14" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 9:13, 14</a>.</p>

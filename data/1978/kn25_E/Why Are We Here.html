<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sa">JUST TO LIVE A SHORT TIME, GET WHAT WE CAN OUT OF LIFE, AND DIE?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Many people view life in such ways. But still they may wonder . . .</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">Where am I really going?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="si">Is there no greater purpose than the brief cycle of birth, life and death?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Some try to give meaning to life by devoting themselves to a cause, to art, to another person, or to pleasure.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">But none of these things satisfy our desire to keep on living and to know the purpose of life. Yet . . .</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT LIFE HAS A REAL PURPOSE. WHY SO?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Well, consider:</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="si">The unchanging laws of the universe—gravity, atomic forces, heredity. These things make it possible for life to be stable and to continue.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The Bible comes to grips with this question.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">It reveals that God “did not create [the earth] simply for nothing”; he “formed it even to be inhabited.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="si">But there must be more to it than simply having people live on earth.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="si">Surely God’s purpose for humans is not reflected by today’s wars, crime, hunger and pollution. These must be removed.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="si">Therefore God purposes that “as regards the wicked, they will be cut off from the very earth.” “The blameless are the ones that will be left over in it.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:21-20:2:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:21, 22</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Jesus Christ taught men to pray for this very thing in the Lord’s Prayer when they ask God:</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="si">“Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10</a>. See also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:25-46:15:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong>A SATISFYING PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">With all obstacles to peace and happiness removed, God promises that . . .</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="si">“The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Living forever, humans will then be able to realize their full potential . . .</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="si">Endless opportunities to learn and be creative will open up before mankind.</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Chapters in the book offered below are devoted to discussing these very questions. Reasonable and satisfying answers from the Bible are offered.</p>

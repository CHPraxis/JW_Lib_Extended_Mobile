Your Service Meetings
WEEK STARTING FEBRUARY 26
20 min: Song 52. Announcements. Talk on the subject How Are Our Brothers Doing? with some highlights from the introductory material of the 1978 Yearbook, pages 3-32. (Pick out points that would be of interest to your congregation.)
20 min: “Presenting the Good News​—Using Bible Topics for Discussion.” Chairman introduces part using Romans 10:15, explaining offer for month and service arrangements. During March we will again be offering two 384- or 416-page books with a pocket-size book for 60 cents. Publishers may want to highlight the Word of God, “Eternal Purpose” or Evolution book using Psalm 119:105 as a basis for the discussion.
Publishers demonstrate offer using the Word of God book. After introducing yourself you could say: “Many people today believe that the Bible is practical for our day but others do not. If the Bible is really the Word of God, then we would expect it to be the most practical book in the world, would we not? [Allow for response.] Psalm 119:105 shows the Bible to be God’s guide for mankind. [Read.] The Bible does give us guiding principles for handling major and minor problems of life. [Refer to subheadings in Chap. 11 of book.] This publication discusses these principles and their benefits. We are offering this book along with these other two books [name them], which show the importance of God’s Word in our lives.” A different book might be featured if more practical locally.
Discuss Presenting the Good News with audience. Encourage use of Bible Topics for Discussion in the field. Explain how publishers can develop interest for return visits using method from Presenting the Good News. (May use example given or a subject that applies better locally.) Explain advantage for publisher to conclude original call by arousing interest for a question to be answered on the next visit.
20 min: “Personal Goals Are Helpful.” Audience discussion. Have some prepared to comment on how they have used goals beneficially. Song 106 and prayer.
WEEK STARTING MARCH 5
Theme: “Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot.” (Ps. 119:105)
25 min: Song 20. Announcements. Discussion led by Theocratic School overseer of next week’s Bible reading (Judg. 13-16) and how to get the most out of it. Find examples of points in the Bible reading that require some extra research to understand, and demonstrate how this research can be done. May wish to have audience read a portion of material and thereafter questions can be raised to see if brothers really got the sense of it or not. The point should be made that weekly Bible reading is a rewarding experience and also a challenge if the material is to be fully understood. It can be done regularly by setting aside just a few minutes each day.
20 min: Could our family study be more of a Bible study? (This is just one of many ways in which a family may study together.) Arrange for family to read and discuss a chapter from the Bible dealing directly with a family situation. For example, Acts 5:1-11 on honesty. Daniel 3 on neutrality, Genesis 42-45 on forgiveness, 1 Kings 18 on faith in Jehovah’s power, Acts 17:2-4, 16-34 on field service activity, and so forth. Each one, including children, can read a portion. A second portion might be acted out if time permits.
15 min: Scriptural discussion with congregation led by an elder on why Bible reading is an essential part of true worship and should take priority over other reading that we do. As time permits, discuss Matthew 4:4, Psalm 1, Joshua 1:1-8 and Deuteronomy 17:18-20. (Here you could give examples of kings who did and who did not follow this advice and the results. For example, Josiah in 2 Kings 22:3-13, as contrasted with Jehoiakim in Jeremiah 36.) Song 119 and prayer.
WEEK STARTING MARCH 12
15 min: Song 114. Announcements. Accounts Report. Discussion of “International Convention Rooming Information.”
25 min: Scriptural discussion with audience entitled, Our Destiny Is Not Fixed. Stress Romans 2:4-6, which shows that ‘the kindly quality of God is trying to lead all to repentance,’ something not possible if our destiny were fixed or predetermined. (Discussion based on Aid book material, “Foreknowledge, Foreordination,” to be handled by an elder.)
The following questions are raised to be answered in Scriptural discussion. Try to apportion the time so that there will be some discussion of each question using only the most outstanding scripture or scriptures to do so. (1) How does Jehovah’s kindly quality hold out wonderful prospects for all people? (Rom. 2:7, 10; 1 John 5:13, 20; Gen. 18:23-26; Neh. 9:31) (2) What factors should be considered to understand God’s foreknowledge and whether one’s destiny is predetermined? (Aid, p. 594, ¶11 to p. 595, ¶2; Isa. 48:3-7; Gen. 2:16, 17) (3) Why is it not reasonable to believe that Jehovah foreknew the rebellion of Satan, Adam and Eve? (Aid, p. 595, ¶7, 8; Gen. 6:5, 6; 18:20, 21; 22:11, 12) (4) How is the prospect of everlasting life presented in God’s Word? (Aid, p. 596, ¶2-5; Matt. 7:7-11; 2 Pet. 3:9, 13) (5) Are persons in our territory foreknown to become either sheep or goats or does each one have a choice? (Deut. 30:19, 20; Rom. 2:4-11)
Chairman concludes, helping audience to reason on the following points: God’s kindly quality, his genuine desire to see all persons gain salvation, should move us to serve him fully from the heart. It should move us to preach and teach with determination, knowing all others have genuine opportunity to “take life’s water free.” (Rev. 22:17) Even those entrenched in false religion, weighed down with wrong attitudes and practices, rather than being predestined to be goats, have opened to them the opportunity to benefit from God’s kindly quality that is trying to lead them to repentance. Let us keep on preaching as Jehovah’s kindly quality motivates us to do our best.
20 min: “Getting Ready for Memorial.” A lively discussion of the importance of the Memorial. Explain the congregational arrangements for the Memorial and have a demonstration inviting an interested person to attend the Memorial and public talk. Song 47 and prayer.
WEEK STARTING MARCH 19
Elders may decide if a Theocratic School and service meeting should be scheduled for this week in view of the Memorial.
15 min: Song 69. Announcements. Branch Letter. Discuss field activity of congregation.
20 min: Discussion of article in the March 1, 1978, Watchtower, “Memorializing Christ’s Death​—How Much Longer?”
25 min: This part may be arranged according to local needs. Elders may wish to have discussion of part of the Kingdom Ministry School textbook that would be of interest locally. Song 75 and prayer.
WEEK STARTING MARCH 26
10 min: Song 93. Announcements.
25 min: Talk and audience discussion showing that communication with our brothers is important. Elder gives talk on following material and has audience discussion on questions listed.
(10 min:) As Jehovah’s servants we recognize the need for clear and loving communication with one another. When communication between family members, relatives, fellow servants or friends is lacking, much anxiety is experienced. On the other hand, when we cultivate the fruitage of the spirit, we find communication much easier and life more enjoyable. Counsel of the Scriptures is that there should be no “class distinctions” among brothers. (Jas. 2:1-9) Do you give your brothers reason to shy away from approaching you? Have you separated yourself from some in the congregation? (Prov. 18:1) If you feel a lack of love in the congregation, do you yourself show love? If we find that we have difficulty communicating with others, is it not better to conduct a self-examination first, before placing the blame upon others? If, upon making such an examination we find that we are in any way lacking, what can we do to make improvement? One thing is to examine the Scriptures on the subject and frankly apply to ourselves the counsel that especially fits us. (Mark 11:25; Col. 3:13; Prov. 6:20-22; Rom. 14:19)
(15 min:) Draw out comments from audience on the following questions highlighting the theme that we should be willing to listen with an open mind to what our brothers have to say. In the same manner, we would like to have our brothers listen to us when we try to communicate with them. 1. How can our reactions to suggestions or points of counsel cause a lack of communication between brothers? What suggestions could be given to improve communication in these areas? (Jas. 1:19, 20; Eph. 4:26; Prov. 15:1, 2, 4) 2. How can the following scriptures help publishers improve communication with other members of the congregation when personality problems arise? (Prov. 17:9; Eccl. 7:8, 9; Matt. 7:12; 5:23, 24; 1 John 4:20, 21) 3. When elders are willing to accept suggestions from others in the congregation, how can this be mutually beneficial? (Prov. 15:31; Rom. 12:16; Ezek. 24:16a) 4. When fellow elders communicate freely regarding matters pertaining to physical and spiritual needs of the congregation, how does this keep the flock strong? (1 Cor. 12:25, 26; Ps. 146:7-9) Conclude with Romans 8:28.
25 min: “Enlarging Your Sacred Service.”
(15 min:) Have a panel of publishers who are or have been auxiliary or regular pioneers discuss together the highlights from the article in the November 15, 1977, Watchtower.
(10 min:) Talk about their plans for service in April. Demonstrate April subscription presentation. One on panel might do so, introducing himself by saying, “Most religious organizations teach that they have the truth. Since beliefs vary so much, how do you think we can identify which religion is teaching the truth of the Bible? [Allow for comment.] God wants his people to worship him in the true way. [Read John 4:23, 24.] There are many ways the true religion can be identified. One is found in John 13:35. [Read.] Do you think that it is important for us to find out which religion is the true one?” (Allow for comment.) Then lead into The Watchtower explaining that it has additional information. Offer subscription with free, large book as listed in January Our Kingdom Service. Chairman ends by encouraging auxiliary pioneering during April. Not too late to apply. Song 84 and prayer.

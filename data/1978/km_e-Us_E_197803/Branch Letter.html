<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Kingdom Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Truly all of us have reason to rejoice because of having come to a knowledge of the truth. Since true worship brings great joy, you may have been surprised to learn that, despite the fact that nearly 28,000 were baptized in the United States during the 1977 service year, a monthly average of 14,270 fewer persons reported having shared in field activity.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This may well have given you reason for concern, and we share that concern. Doubtless a number of factors are responsible. Some may have been caught up in the whirl of materialistic living or in anxieties of life. Old age or infirmity may have affected how much some individuals can do.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">However, we need to examine ourselves. Do we have the same love for the truth that we did at first? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:4-66:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rev. 2:4</a>) Jesus Christ stated: ‘Out of the heart’s abundance the mouth speaks.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:45-42:6:45" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 6:45</a>) So, might it be that some of us have neglected regular reading of and meditation on God’s Word? Those of us who are elders especially need to consider whether we have set a fine example in public witnessing and whether good field service arrangements exist in the congregation.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">However, there are some encouraging signs. Magazine placements, subscriptions and return visits were higher in November 1977 as compared with the same month the year before. Bible studies are also starting to increase again.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">There is much work to do. Our commission to make disciples has not changed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) The Grand Evangelizer is still sponsoring the preaching of the “good news” and it is our privilege and joy to work with him in this, to his honor and for the blessing of others.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sj">Your brothers,</p>

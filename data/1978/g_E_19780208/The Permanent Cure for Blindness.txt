The Permanent Cure for Blindness
■ “Jesus said to them: ‘Go your way and report to John what you are hearing and seeing: The blind are seeing again, and the lame are walking about, the lepers are being cleansed and the deaf are hearing, and the dead are being raised up, and the poor are having the good news declared to them; and happy is he that finds no cause for stumbling in me.’”​—Matt. 11:4-6.

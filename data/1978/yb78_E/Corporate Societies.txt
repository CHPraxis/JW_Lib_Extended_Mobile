Corporate Societies
After a long, faithful life of service as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, having been baptized in 1923, Brother Nathan H. Knorr finished his earthly course on June 8, 1977. He had succeeded Brother Rutherford as president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in 1942, and served faithfully and well. He became a member of the Bethel family in September 1923. Brother Knorr felt a deep responsibility for pressing the expansion of the preaching and teaching work world wide and had a great love for the missionaries scattered throughout the countries of the world. (Acts 1:8; Matt. 28:19) While he is missed by all who recognized his love of theocratic service, they rejoice in the words at Revelation 14:13: “Happy are the dead who die in union with the Lord from this time onward. Yes, says the spirit, let them rest from their labors, for the things they did go right with them.”
On June 22, 1977, Brother Frederick W. Franz, vice-president, was elected to serve as president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.
The various corporate religious societies (associated with the principal one, Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania) that have been formed by Jehovah’s Witnesses throughout the earth in compliance with the laws of various governments cooperate with the Governing Body in carrying on the evangelizing work commanded by Jesus.​—Matt. 28:19, 20.

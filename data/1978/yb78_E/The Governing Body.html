<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses has continued to give a good lead during the service year in caring for the interests of Jehovah’s kingdom earth wide. The Governing Body holds weekly meetings, with all the committees represented, to discuss matters presented to it by the various Branch Committees and to consider recommendations for appointment of branch personnel and traveling overseers, as well as other business coming before it.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">During the service year Charles J. Fekel finished his earthly course, as did also Nathan H. Knorr. This resulted in there being three vacancies on the Governing Body, inasmuch as the place of John O. Groh, who finished his course on January 23, 1975, had not been filled.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Accordingly, action was taken to fill these vacancies, and the following brothers were named to serve on the Governing Body, to wit, Carey W. Barber, John E. Barr and Martin Poetzinger. There are now eighteen members of the Governing Body.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah’s favor has been manifest on the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work of his name-people during the past service year and all of us are determined to hold “firmly to the faithful word.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:9-56:1:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Titus 1:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:28-42:11:28" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Luke 11:28</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">After a long, faithful life of service as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, having been baptized in 1923, Brother Nathan H. Knorr finished his earthly course on June 8, 1977. He had succeeded Brother Rutherford as president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in 1942, and served faithfully and well. He became a member of the Bethel family in September 1923. Brother Knorr felt a deep responsibility for pressing the expansion of the preaching and teaching work world wide and had a great love for the missionaries scattered throughout the countries of the world.

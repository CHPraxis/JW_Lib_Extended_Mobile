<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Do not leave your own companion or the companion of your father, and do not enter the house of your own brother on the day of your disaster. Better is a neighbor that is near than a brother that is far away.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:10-20:27:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 27:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This Biblical proverb highlights the importance of having a true friend and being one, especially in time of need. First, it deals with being such a friend. In a day of calamity or disaster, you should not “leave” or desert those who have been your friends, or your family’s friends. You should not be just a “fair-weather friend,” one who makes himself absent when he is really needed. Consider, then, the reverse. At a time of need, rather than having to travel a long way to the house of your fleshly brother to see if he might help, it is better to have a friend nearby who is ready, yes, willing to aid you. As another proverb states it: “There exists a friend sticking closer than a brother.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:24-20:18:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 18:24</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“The sacrifice of the wicked ones is something detestable to Jehovah, but the prayer of the upright ones is a pleasure to him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:8-20:15:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 15:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">These words were written at a time when the worship of Jehovah was centered at a temple in Jerusalem, where animal sacrifices were offered. An Israelite could spend a considerable amount of money to buy a bull or a lamb for sacrifice. This proverb reveals, however, that God preferred a sincere prayer that costs nothing from an upright person, rather than an animal sacrifice from a wicked person. So God’s criterion is not the expense an individual goes to in practicing religion, but his heart condition and general life pattern. The verse that follows says: “The <em>way </em>of the wicked one is something detestable to Jehovah, but the one <em>pursuing </em>righteousness he loves.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:9-20:15:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 15:9</a>.</p>

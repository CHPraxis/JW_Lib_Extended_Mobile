What Place Should Sports Have in Your Life?
Did you know that the Bible says “bodily training,” such as we get in sports, has its place? It is good for us. But how can we reap the good from sports and avoid possible harm?
The 192-page book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It discusses this in its chapter “Sports and Entertainment.” Send only 35 cents (U.S.) and a copy will be mailed to you postpaid.
Please send the hardbound book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. I enclose 35c (U.S.).

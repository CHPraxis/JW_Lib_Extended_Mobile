Question Box
● How can we help a person to get ready for field service?
In most cases, the publisher conducting the Bible study is in the best position initially to determine when a student is ready to participate in the evangelizing work.
It is essential that the student develop a strong love for Jehovah and Christ Jesus. (Eph. 3:18, 19) His heart and mind must be affected by the truth. Help him to meditate unselfishly on the many expressions of Jehovah’s love for mankind. Endeavor to get him to apply quickly what he is learning in his personal life and to think of the needs of other people. This can be done best by asking thought-provoking questions and progressively reasoning with the student. See or book, pages 128-130.
It is recommended that we spend sufficient time preparing our student for participation in field activity and endeavor personally to work with him from house to house. Have him share in the public preaching work as much as possible, learning to use the Bible in conversing with householders.
When any new ones desire to get started in the preaching work and feel that they have made progress and are ready, encourage them to talk to one of the local elders about it. They will be pleased to render any assistance that might be needed.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Good morning. I am calling to discuss the need we have in common for a workable solution to moral and governmental problems. Do you feel that man will be able to solve the growing difficulties in crime, economics and politics? [Mention something of local interest.] Whether one is optimistic about man’s ability or not, the problems we face make some wonder, ‘If there is a Creator, why has he allowed these conditions, and does he offer any solutions?’ I was pleasantly surprised when someone shared this text with me. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:21-20:2:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:21, 22</a>.] Isn’t it reassuring that the Creator purposes to fill the earth with upright individuals?” (Show how the <em>Watchtower </em>or <em>Awake! </em>subscription will enable a person to learn more about God’s purpose for the earth.)</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Another introduction might be: “Good morning. In view of the changing moral standards, a person could at times question whether it is worth while anymore to try living an honest, morally upright life. Have you noticed that tendency among some?” (Then show Creator’s viewpoint.)</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>30 min: </strong>Stimulating review of “Victorious Faith” International Convention. This should be scheduled the week following the assembly that your congregation is scheduled to attend. Brothers should be assigned well in advance to present information on each of the following matters: (1) Things learned regarding field service, including experiences enjoyed on field service day. (2) Things learned relative to family life, including relationships with brothers and sisters basic to Christianity. (3) New things learned from God’s Word. (4) Experiences we enjoyed personally or heard that demonstrate faith. If your assembly has not been held as yet, you may take 10 minutes to discuss the May 15, 1978, <em>Watchtower </em>article entitled, “All Ready to ‘Go.’” Use the remainder of time for local needs.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn"><strong>17 min: </strong>Demonstration.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">(3 min.) Chairman: A major objective in house-to-house work is to reach the hearts of sheeplike persons with the good news. If we can start friendly conversations, we are well on the way to reaching that goal. If you have difficulty starting conversations, you may find it helpful to ask questions. Viewpoint questions are best because they get the householder talking rather than merely answering Yes or No. You may find it helpful to ask someone who is good at starting conversations to work with you in field service so you can develop this ability.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">(4 min.) Discussion with audience. Chairman asks: “What questions do you find helpful in starting conversations and keeping them going?” After audience has made suggestions, as time permits consider the following questions that can be used in an introduction: “What kind of future do you want for your children?” “What kind of future do you envision for yourself in the next 10 or 20 years?” “What do you feel is the number one problem in our neighborhood?” “If you had the power to change one thing to benefit mankind, what would it be?” “What do you think is required to have good government?” Scriptural answers to these questions can be found in <em>Bible Topics for Discussion </em>or in current offer itself.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">(8 min.) Present brief, realistic demonstrations using the most appropriate questions. Show how additional questions can be asked to keep the conversation going so that a good witness can be given.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">(2 min.) Chairman: We are looking for those of honest heart. After we have made an effort to reach people with the Kingdom message, if they are not interested, we can conclude the conversation in a pleasant way and continue our search, confident that Jehovah will direct our efforts.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 14:6, 7</a>.</p>

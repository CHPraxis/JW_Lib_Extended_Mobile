Do You Have Problems?
The very best help you can find is in the Bible, because it contains the wisdom of God. Why not try personal and family Bible reading?
Bible reading can be rewarding with the easy-to-understand modern English New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. Printed on fine-quality Bible paper, bound in durable vinyl; with concordance and appendix, it is only $1.50 (U.S.), postpaid.
Also, if you desire, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses will call at your home and, free of charge, discuss matters that may help you to solve your problems.
Check either or both: Please send the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures along with the gift booklet Is There a God Who Cares? I enclose $1.50 (U.S.) □. Also, I would like to have one of Jehovah’s Witnesses call to discuss the Bible free of charge □.

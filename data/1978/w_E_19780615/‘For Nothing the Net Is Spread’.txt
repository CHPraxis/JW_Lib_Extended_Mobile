‘For Nothing the Net Is Spread’
AS PART of a warning against involvement with lawless men, Proverbs 1:17 states: “It is for nothing that the net is spread before the eyes of anything owning wings.” Birds are naturally cautious and possess a keen sense of vision. Hence, were a person to spread a net in full view of a bird, he could not hope to trap it. His efforts would be in vain. Similarly, those who live by theft and robbery are not actually getting by with anything. They are merely laying a snare for themselves, and all their scheming will eventually come to nothing.​—Prov. 1:19.

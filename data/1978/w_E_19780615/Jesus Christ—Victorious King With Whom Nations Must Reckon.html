<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A destiny-determining confrontation is at hand! Every one of us will be directly involved. No place on earth will be behind the lines or uninvolved. The principal talk at the current international assemblies of Jehovah’s Witnesses will show the vital role played by Jesus Christ in the reckoning that all nations soon will face.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Other features of the assembly program include four Bible dramas enacted in full costume, and helpful Bible discussions on practical matters of life. Contact the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses to find out where the nearest assembly will be, or write the publishers of this magazine.</p>

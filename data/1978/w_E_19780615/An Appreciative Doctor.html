<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHEN we called on Dr. M, we explained that we were Jehovah’s Witnesses and that we had something we wanted to give him. He was very good-natured and invited us in immediately, all the while joking with us, saying: “It’s a $15.00 office visit once you come in!” We gave him the booklet <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Question of Blood </em>and explained that a copy was being given to every doctor, nurse and lawyer so that they would be more familiar with the feelings of the Witnesses and why we do not accept blood.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The doctor said that, even though he had served in the M.A.S.H. unit in Korea and had given blood to many people, he believed that each person should be able to make his <em>own </em>decision about what is done to his body. He also agreed with the point of treating the “whole man,” since forcing blood on someone could lead to psychological problems.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">After discussing <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>, I offered the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>subscriptions to him, explaining that they would help him to learn more about the Bible and how God would relieve mankind of these problems. He obtained both subscriptions, saying: “I feel these are a good investment.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">He related why he had fond feelings for Jehovah’s Witnesses. Once he was stranded on the Pennsylvania Turnpike and another car came to his assistance. The people, not only helped him get his car to a gas station, but remained there with him until his car was repaired and they were sure he could get on his way. Before leaving, they left him copies of the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Thus he learned that they were Jehovah’s Witnesses. He remarked several times how extremely kind they had been to him in going well out of their way to help.​—<em>Contributed.</em></p>

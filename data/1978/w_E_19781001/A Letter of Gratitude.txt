A Letter of Gratitude
“For five long years my wife and son were Jehovah’s Witnesses, without my total consent. I realize now that I placed a great hardship and burden on them through my actions and failure to believe in Jehovah. God only knows what they went through during that time. And I can only hope that he is a very, very forgiving God.
“Although I was a non-practicing Catholic, sinning every day of my life, I still felt I was better than Jehovah’s Witnesses, whom I regarded as fanatics. I failed to realize that Jesus Christ was also called a fanatic in his time. The very name Jehovah was repugnant to me.
“However, after a lot of hardships in moving from Missouri to California, I felt there was something missing in my life. It was as if I was lost in this mixed-up world, and I didn’t know the way to get my life started again in a positive way. Consequently, I began to pray to Almighty God for guidance, direction and a way to remove the emptiness that was inside me. Immediately, there was a knock on the door of the apartment. Upon answering, I discovered that it was a lady, a Witness of Jehovah.
“Normally I would have turned away, and closed the door politely, but this time, due to the fact that I had just prayed for guidance, I felt different inside. We talked for approximately 40 minutes, after which she invited me to attend the meetings at the hall. She even took time to draw a map with directions on how to get there. I had never met a Catholic that would take this much time and show concern for the spiritual interests of his fellowman. I felt strange inside because this person had that much concern for my salvation.
“So now I am attending the Kingdom Hall with my wife Christine and son Phillip. I’m also studying the Bible regularly. I only hope I did not find Jehovah too late to gain eternal life.”

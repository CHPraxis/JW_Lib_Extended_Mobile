<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">AOYAMA Gakuin University, founded by Methodist missionaries in Tokyo, was ordered to pay 300,000 yen (over $1,000, U.S.) as compensation to a former undergraduate in theology for depriving him of advancing in his studies. “The Daily Yomiuri” of October 8, 1977, reported that the university decided to abolish the theology course in 1973, because of a decline in applicants and a deficit in its operation. Those observing world conditions can see a more important meaning in this. That is the current trend in which religion is losing ground. People are becoming more and more secular and less and less religious. The above university offers other courses, but its theology course is closed. However, over 44,000 Japanese Jehovah’s Witnesses continue to carry on a free Bible educational service in more than 61,000 homes every week.</p>

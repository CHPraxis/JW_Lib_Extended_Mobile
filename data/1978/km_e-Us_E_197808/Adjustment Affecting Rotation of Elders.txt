Adjustment Affecting Rotation of Elders
As announced at the international conventions this summer, there will be a further adjustment in the congregation arrangement for elders. Starting with the 1979 service year (September 1, 1978), rotation will take place only with respect to the position of presiding overseer. There will be no rotation with regard to the positions of field overseer and Bible study overseer.
This means that, for the present, elders who are currently serving as field overseer and Bible study overseer will continue in these positions until further notice. Details will be provided in the near future regarding the arrangement for each body of elders to select and recommend certain elders to serve continuously in caring for various matters.
As to rotating into the position of presiding overseer in September 1978, it may well be that the person next in line to serve as presiding overseer, no matter what position he holds now, can continue to serve in his present capacity temporarily and also serve as presiding overseer. If an elder feels he is not in a position to serve as presiding overseer due to health or other reasons, then the next one in line will be given the opportunity.
So, at their meeting in the first part of September, the body of elders should determine who should rotate into the position of presiding overseer, but all other elders should remain in their present positions, awaiting further direction. Such direction will be given in due time, so it will not be necessary to write or phone the Society about this matter.

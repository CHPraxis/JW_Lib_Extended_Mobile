<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Enjoyable Theocratic Family Projects.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">(2 min:) Talk. What does your family do together that is enjoyable and relaxing, yet wholesome and beneficial? Could be damaging spiritually just to let things happen, with no planning, each one seeking out own diversion. Isn’t it true, too often family ends up in front of TV? Children enjoy projects where there is parental guidance but not total domination. This permits initiative, creativeness. Project should fit age of child. Should not be allowed to get out of hand, become too expensive, time consuming.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">(16 min:) Audience discussion. Why could projects, such as the following, be good for families? (1) Father goes over songs for Sunday’s <em>Watchtower </em>study, helping children get full import. All sing. (2) <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22, 23</a> read at breakfast table. One child prints name of “fruit” selected on card. Father has children watch for opportunities to show that fruitage throughout the day. At evening meal all give experience. Repeat each day or each week covering nine “fruits.” (3) Using map, a country is selected on which to report. Children take turns telling of brothers there, customs, obstacles to witnessing, ratio of publishers. (4) Family arrange trips to museum, zoo, planetarium, park, and so forth. Relate things seen to Bible. (5) Children make scrapbook from pictures in back issues of study copies of <em>The Watchtower, </em>if these are available. Learn to explain pictures to parents. (6) Select various features of “sign” of “time of the end.” Children collect news items as proof and store in labeled boxes. (7) Family shares project to help with future trade or homemaking, such as carpentry, cabinetmaking, auto repair, cooking, dressmaking, and so forth.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">(5 min:) Talk. Reflecting on the service year just ending, it is appropriate to ask: “How much have I grown spiritually during the year? What was I able to accomplish?” Perhaps you set some personal goals by which to measure your spiritual progress. What were the results?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">(15 min:) Interview publishers who made some noticeable progress during service year. Suggestions: Ones who started pioneering, shared in auxiliary pioneer service, started Bible study, progressed to baptism, enrolled in Theocratic School, started going from house to house, started commenting at meetings, improved meeting preparation, conducted regular family study, improved shepherding work (on part of elder), and so forth. Get comments from group on following points: Did you accomplish all you projected for yourselves during the year? What obstacles got in the way? What encouragement can you offer others as to the value of setting personal goals? (Make suggestions practical, realistic.)</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">(5 min:) Summarize by pointing out the value of having personal goals. They can be an aid to progressive spiritual improvement, but should not cause discouragement or the feeling that Jehovah is never satisfied with our progress. Additional suggested goals: Keeping up with Bible reading in Theocratic School; becoming more effective in using Bible to give a witness; participating regularly in field service; attending all meetings and commenting; fellowshiping more, before and after meetings, and so forth. (May suggest other goals that represent points needing attention in your congregation.)</p>

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">(5 min:) Talk. In starting to school soon, our children will be spending many hours each day in the presence of worldly children. This sometimes brings problems, temptations. How can we parents, elders and others help them to face these successfully? How can children fortify themselves spiritually?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">(17 min:) Elder interviews group made up of two families with school-age children. (Rehearse ahead of time. If another problem prevails in your area, may substitute.) (1) When schoolmates ridicule us as Jehovah’s Witnesses, what should we do? Is this persecution? How would recalling Jesus’ words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:10-40:5:12" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 5:10-12</a> help? How are we protected by letting students know that we are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses right from the start? What may help ridiculers to have more respect for us? Are we losing anything if we don’t gain friendship of ridiculers? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Prov. 17:17</a>) How will ridiculers react if they see they are provoking us? If they see it doesn’t bother us? What could it lead to if we give in when ridiculed? What outcome does the Bible foretell for ridiculers? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:3-61:3:3" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:7-61:3:7" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 7</a>) (2) Use of drugs and tobacco. Is it a problem where you attend school? Why would other children want to get you started on drugs? Could we give any Bible principles that would be violated by the use of drugs, including tobacco? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:1-47:7:1" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Cor. 7:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:39-40:22:39" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Matt. 22:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:13-60:1:13" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 1:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:23-41:15:23" data-bid="19-4" class="b"> Mark 15:23</a>) So how would God feel about one of his servants taking drugs or smoking? (3) Maintaining neutrality. What is done in your school that tests a Christian’s neutrality? What is the strongest reason you can think of to remain neutral? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:4-2:20:5" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ex. 20:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> John 17:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:36-43:18:36" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 18:36</a>)</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">(3 min:) Conclude with brief exhortation for youth to remain faithful. Jehovah will help them and reward them for their faithfulness, just as he also holds them responsible for their conduct.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:11:9-21:11:10" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Eccl. 11:9, 10</a>.</p>

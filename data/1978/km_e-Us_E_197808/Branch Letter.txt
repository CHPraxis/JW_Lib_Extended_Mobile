Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
The “Victorious Faith” International Conventions are under way! From the preliminary figures, it is apparent that many from the United States of America have been or will be visiting in other countries. For example, close to 1,500 are going to the Caribbean, and about as many to Europe. Over 3,700 made plans to go to Hawaii. Nearly 100 are going to Africa, and as many to South America. So far, about 1,200 will be going to either Mexico or Central America. Some 150 or more are scheduled to go to the Orient.
Tours to Israel have been continuing since April and on into the summer. From preliminary estimates it appears that upwards of 15,000 planned to go to Israel, with over 700 traveling from the United States and thousands from Europe. In addition to arranging a very educational tour throughout this Bible land, the brothers in Israel arranged special meetings for the benefit of their guests.
Thousands have already come from around the world to attend conventions in this country. Many of these are missionaries or others in the full-time service who have been able to return to their home country for a visit because of your generous contributions, and they wish to thank you for your kindness.
Brother F. W. Franz visited Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Philippines in May and June. Special talks were arranged to give encouragement according to the need. In Japan, branch facilities will be expanded on a large tract of land that was purchased. The faith of our brothers in Korea and Taiwan is being severely tested because of their separateness from the world. Fine increases are taking place in Hong Kong and Japan.
We send Christian greetings to all of you.
Your brothers,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Do you find that assemblies are like theocratic milestones? It is always good to look forward to them and the benefits they bring. They fill a special need for God’s people. Do you recall how you were especially benefited by the last circuit assembly program? Perhaps you were impressed by the suggestions given on the theme, “Do All Things for the Sake of the Good News,” and resolved to increase your opportunities to share the good news with others. And, do you remember the counsel and demonstrations on keeping the spirit of the world out of the congregation? And what our conduct should be like in attending assemblies? Were you more alert to the need to set a good example in conduct at the international assembly you attended?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Another circuit assembly program has been arranged to meet special needs, and this will begin in September. You will not want to miss it. Its theme is: “‘Rendering Sacred Service’ with Loyalty.” What are some program features? Instead of the regular Theocratic School, there will be discussions on how the school has benefited Jehovah’s people, and how we can get the most out of it. Also, there will be interviews with those who have served Jehovah loyally for many years. A special part for young folks will give suggestions on how they can show their loyalty and devotion today. There are particular pressures and problems with which we are all faced today, and you will find the suggestions given on the program of much value in coping with these. Be sure to attend all sessions of your next circuit assembly in order to receive the special benefits in store for you.</p>

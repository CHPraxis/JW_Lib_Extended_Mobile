“The Happy God”​—Really Different!
● Down through the centuries, a principal trait of many gods of mankind has been cruelty. But matters really are different with Jehovah, the true God. The Scriptures describe him as One who displays loving-kindness, and he is called “the happy God.” (Ps. 62:12; 1 Tim. 1:11) To many persons, this truly is impressive.
● To Illustrate: One woman living in South Africa stated: “As a Hindu I knew many gods, and these were fierce gods. I did not know there was a happy God, Jehovah. Learning about the happy God Jehovah has filled my heart with great joy. Now this joy helps me to share this ‘good news’ with others, telling them about the happy God and his purpose for the future.”
● Serving Jehovah as one of his witnesses does bring a person true joy. Moreover, preaching “the glorious good news of the happy God” results in great happiness for those who hear that message with real appreciation.

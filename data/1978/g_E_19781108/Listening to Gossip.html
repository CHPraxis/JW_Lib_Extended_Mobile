<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">When next tempted to give ear to the tidbits of gossip that someone has to relate, remember that a person who delights to gossip to you about the faults of others probably will gossip to others about your faults. How true the words of Solomon: “He who covers a transgression seeks love, but he who repeats a matter separates intimate friends.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:9-20:17:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 17:9</a>, “New American Standard Bible.”</p>

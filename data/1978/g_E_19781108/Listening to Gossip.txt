Listening to Gossip
When next tempted to give ear to the tidbits of gossip that someone has to relate, remember that a person who delights to gossip to you about the faults of others probably will gossip to others about your faults. How true the words of Solomon: “He who covers a transgression seeks love, but he who repeats a matter separates intimate friends.”​—Prov. 17:9, “New American Standard Bible.”

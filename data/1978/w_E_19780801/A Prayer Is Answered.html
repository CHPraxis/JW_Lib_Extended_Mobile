<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN THE South Pacific islands of Samoa, the native chiefs wield considerable influence. They hold their positions in high esteem and receive great respect from the people. Therefore, it takes strong motivation to cause a chief to give up his title and step down from his position.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Accordingly, it was a remarkable event when one of these men from the island of Savaii in Western Samoa resigned, saying that he wanted to be completely neutral as to political affairs in order to serve God. This was the more unusual, since this man was a “high-talking” chief, a spokesman, in many instances, for Malietoa, one of the kings. Whenever chiefs and kings of Samoa gathered, this man would often speak first.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This chief belonged to one of Christendom’s churches and, being interested in learning more about God, had examined the teachings of many churches. But he never felt satisfied spiritually. One day he discovered that the pastor of his church was using the church funds for his own personal purpose, buying many luxuries. He informed the church members of this, and they elected him to speak to the pastor. The pastor replied: “What I do with the money is none of your business; it is strictly between me and Christ.” On hearing this, the chief resigned from the church, never to return.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">During this time the chief prayed privately to God for help to learn the truth. One day, after he prayed in this way, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses called and a study was immediately started. In time this man wanted to devote his life to Jehovah and no longer to be part of the world’s political system. Despite the prestige and wealth that went with the title, he felt it best to be free from political connections with the world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:4-59:4:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jas. 4:4</a>) Now, as a baptized witness of Jehovah, he tries his best to help others to learn the truth.</p>

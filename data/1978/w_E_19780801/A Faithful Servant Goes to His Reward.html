<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Brother Franz Zürcher was born November 25, 1891, baptized November 18, 1918, and entered Bethel service in Switzerland on June 15, 1923. For almost 55 years he worked loyally in the Swiss branch of the Watch Tower Society, serving for a number of years as the branch overseer. After several months of illness, Brother Zürcher finished his course on earth May 13, 1978. He was well known and loved by many of Jehovah‘s Witnesses in Europe and other places, and all rejoice in his faithful service, and that he has now received his reward.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:13-66:14:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rev. 14:13</a>.</p>

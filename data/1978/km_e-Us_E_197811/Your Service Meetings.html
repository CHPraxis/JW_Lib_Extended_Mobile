<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">Outline local arrangements for field service with the tract during the rest of the week. Encourage audience: Could you put forth a special effort in the tract work this weekend? Or next weekend? Could you spend a little more time than usual because of you neighbor love and love for God?

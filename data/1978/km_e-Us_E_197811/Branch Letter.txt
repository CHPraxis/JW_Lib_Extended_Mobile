Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
Our brothers are still talking about the “Victorious Faith” International Conventions. And, of course, many are yet to be held in Central and South America, Africa and the South Pacific. For the conventions held to date in the continental United States, Canada, the Caribbean Islands, the Orient and Europe, for which we have received reports, the peak attendance is up to 1,789,414 and there were 18,754 baptized.
One of the high points of the convention everywhere has been our activity in the field service on Friday morning. A brother who attended the convention in Los Angeles said: “I was happy to share in this special work. What better way to demonstrate our love and fellow feeling toward our neighbors?” Another said: “I was proud to be among the thousands carrying our little yellow bags. That in itself was a powerful witness.” And still another: “People readily accepted the brochure. We really enjoyed the work. Let’s do it again.”
One woman had heard on TV that Jehovah’s people would be visiting persons in their homes on Friday. When a brother approached her, she said: “You aren’t supposed to come until Friday.” When the brother assured her that it was Friday she said: “Oh, so it is. Yes, I’ll be glad to take the offer.” Another woman had just been talking on the phone to a friend across town about the calls of the Witnesses when her doorbell rang. She came to the door with 25c in her hand, smiled at our brother and said: “I was expecting you and am glad to have my copies of the publications.” In Seattle, Washington, the evening news carried a film showing one of our brothers giving his presentation to a woman earlier in the day. It is apparent that a good witness was given.
When we receive news from the conventions still to be held we will be glad to pass this on to you. As you keep busy and happy in Jehovah’s service, we pray that his blessing will go with you.
Your brothers,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

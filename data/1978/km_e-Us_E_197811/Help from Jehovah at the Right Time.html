<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>In country after country, reports are being received about the increased activity of the demons. What can we do to protect ourselves against the influence of the demons? How happy we all were at the international convention this summer when we received the new booklet <em>Unseen Spirits​—Do They Help Us? Or Do They Harm Us? </em>This booklet is an aid from Jehovah at the right time!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>We are glad to inform you that we will study this booklet at our congregation book studies during the month of December.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>You may be wondering, though, why is it that we will be studying this booklet in the United States since it has been prepared primarily for the African field? The answer is that we need to be alert to demonic influence that is prevalent here, too. Yes, there are many reports appearing in newspapers and magazines telling of spiritism in this country. At no time should we feel complacent about the counsel at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:8, 9 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:7-59:4:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> James 4:7</a>.</p>

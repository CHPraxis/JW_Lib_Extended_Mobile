<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Crime increases. Food prices skyrocket. The energy crisis persists. Consideration for others declines. Why? What is the meaning of these things?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">If you wonder, read <strong>The Watchtower </strong>and <strong>Awake! </strong>They not only report current events, but explain their meaning in the light of Bible prophecy. Send only $4 (U.S.) and you will receive both magazines (four copies a month) for one year.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>for one year. I enclose $4 (U.S.). For mailing the coupon I am to receive free six timely booklets.</p>

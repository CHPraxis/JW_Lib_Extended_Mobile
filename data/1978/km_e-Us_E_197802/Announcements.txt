Announcements
● Literature offer for March: Three books for 60c. Should include two 384- or 416-page books and one pocket-size book from list on page three of January 1978 Our Kingdom Service. April: Watchtower subscription with a free 384- or 416-page book for $2.00.
● On Saturday, April 15, the Bethel home and factory and Watchtower Farms buildings will be closed for spring cleaning; so there will be no arrangement for tours on that day.
● When our present stock of not-at-home slips runs out this spring, we will start sending a new one called “Alive and Healthy Forever! Is It Really Possible?” Congregations should use up the ones now available before using the new ones. From time to time others will be provided.
● After March 15, congregations may begin ordering the Watch Tower Publications Index for 1977. The indexes are 10 cents each.
● The April 15 Watchtower and April 22 Awake! will be special issues. Be sure to place your order early for extra copies, including those that will be needed by auxiliary pioneers.
● The Society is sending a manuscript to each congregation for the discourse “The True Religion​—How to Identify It” to be delivered on March 26. The speaker assigned by the body of elders may prepare an outline from the material and deliver the talk extemporaneously if he desires.
● New Publications Available:
Holy Spirit​—The Force Behind the Coming New Order!​—Afrikaans, Dutch
A Secure Future​—How You Can Find It—​Croatian, Kissi, Sepedi, Swahili, Tshiluba, Twi

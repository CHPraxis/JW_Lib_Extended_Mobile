My Book of Bible Stories
At the right is the title of the new 256-page book of Bible stories. Its pages are the same size as this magazine. It has big type, and over 125 large pictures, most of them in multicolor. The book contains 116 stories that give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about. The stories appear in the order in which events occurred in history. You will find this really helpful to learning when, in relation to other events, things happened in history. Only $2 (U.S.), postpaid.
Please send My Book of Bible Stories and the free booklet Is There a God Who Cares? I enclose $2 (U.S.).

‘A Quiver like an Open Burial Place’
Regarding the Chaldean armies that would come against Jerusalem and the land of Judah, the prophecy of Jeremiah declared: ‘Their quiver is like an open burial place.” (Jer. 5:16) The point of the comparison appears to be that as the open burial place is filled with the dead so the quiver of the Babylonians is filled with deadly arrows.

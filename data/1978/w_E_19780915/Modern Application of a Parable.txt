Modern Application of a Parable
JESUS’ parable of the “grand evening meal” tells how those invited to it begged off from attending, offering various empty excuses. In our day one of those same excuses hindered a Norwegian farmer who was invited to study the Bible. After being offered this opportunity several times, the farmer excused himself, saying that he had bought eight bull calves that would need constant care. But he was shown the words of Jesus’ parable from Luke 14:18, 19: “They all in common started to beg off. . . . another said, ‘I bought five yoke of cattle and am going to examine them; I ask you, Have me excused.’”
Well, the Norwegian farmer was surprised, to say the least, to see his own excuse in the Bible. Two months later, he was back, saying: “I’ve sold the bulls; now I can study the Bible.” He soon made needed changes in his life to conform to Christian principles. And, to have more time for serving God, he even decided to sell his tractor and other farming equipment, and took up another kind of work.

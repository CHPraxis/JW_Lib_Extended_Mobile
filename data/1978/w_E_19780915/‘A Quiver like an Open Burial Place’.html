<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Regarding the Chaldean armies that would come against Jerusalem and the land of Judah, the prophecy of Jeremiah declared: ‘Their quiver is like an open burial place.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:5:16-24:5:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer. 5:16</a>) The point of the comparison appears to be that as the open burial place is filled with the dead so the quiver of the Babylonians is filled with deadly arrows.</p>

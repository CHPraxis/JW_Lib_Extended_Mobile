<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Brother A. Pryce Hughes, born on June 12, 1895, was a teen-ager when he became a baptized disciple of Jesus Christ on April 1, 1913. Throughout the years since then, he exerted himself to lay fast hold on the heavenly inheritance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:7-55:4:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:7, 8</a>) On July 19, 1978, Brother Hughes completed his earthly course in London, England, after having spent more than 55 years in full-time service, mostly as a member of the London Bethel family. He was also the vice-president of the International Bible Students Association. His is indeed a fine example of Christian endurance.</p>

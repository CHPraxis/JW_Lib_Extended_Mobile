<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">BECAUSE of her shameful record of idolatry, Jerusalem is described as having “the forehead of a wife committing prostitution.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:3:3-24:3:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer. 3:3</a>) This means that Jerusalem was as brazen and shameless as an adulterous woman. It was as if her faithless acts were written upon her forehead, visible to all.</p>

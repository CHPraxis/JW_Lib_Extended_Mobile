Attending Meetings Speeds One Toward Maturity
A FAMILY in Fagaalu, American Samoa, accepted an offer from missionaries of Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses to study the Bible. They rarely missed their home Bible study, but could never see the need to attend the congregation meetings. They felt that the private study in their home was sufficient. One day the missionary decided to prove to them that they needed the meetings. She brought a written review sheet from the Theocratic School, held weekly in the Kingdom Hall meeting place. This couple did not know many of the answers. It was pointed out that by coming to the meetings they would benefit in many different ways, the review being one of them. The family then made the effort to come to the meetings and today several members of this family are baptized and are very active in spreading the good news of the Kingdom to others.

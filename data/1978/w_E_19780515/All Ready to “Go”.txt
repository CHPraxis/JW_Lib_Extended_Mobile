All Ready to “Go”
JEHOVAH, our God, is the great Provider. In Isaiah 25:6-8 we read of the grand banquet that he “will certainly make for all the peoples”​—a banquet of finest ‘dishes and wine.’ A banquet of such a kind will be enjoyed by all who exercise victorious faith in Jehovah’s provision made through his Son and our Redeemer, Jesus Christ​—a delightful banquet of spiritual and material good things, for it is said of our Host at that banquet: “He will actually swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces.”
We do not have to wait, however, until the New Order, to enjoy a feast of blessings in God’s spiritual paradise. We may feast on Jehovah’s provision right now. A feast that all of Jehovah’s people are keenly anticipating is the “‘Victorious Faith’ International Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses,” to be held around the world starting June 14, 1978, and continuing on into the early part of 1979.
Are your preparations complete? Are you ready to go to this convention? Have you included all the family, as well as those newly interested, in your plans? Are you resolved to get the greatest spiritual benefit from this assembly? This you may do by being in your seat each day for the opening song and prayer, by listening intently to all the program and by staying on to say a heartfelt “Amen” to the concluding prayer of thanks. There will be a special blessing, too, in the field service of the third morning of the assembly and in daily volunteer service. On the other four days of the convention, morning and afternoon sessions are planned.
Of course, Satan would try to discourage us from getting the most out of this assembly. He would like us to think negative thoughts about the additional traveling required, the quality of the food served; or the kind of accommodations arranged and which may not be to our liking. But do we attend conventions primarily to satisfy our material wants and comforts? Far from it! We go there with the positive viewpoint of gaining the greatest benefit in a spiritual way. If some hardships or problems come our way, let us take them in our stride, even as Jesus and his apostles set the example. (John 4:6-15; Acts 14:19-22; 2 Cor. 12:10) The more we display long-suffering, kindness, goodness, mildness, self-control, along with faith, at this assembly, the grander will be our blessing.​—Gal. 5:22, 23.
The “Victorious Faith” International Convention is nearly upon us! Are you all ready to go? As you travel to the assembly, may you do so in the spirit of David, who declared: “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.’” (Ps. 122:1) Now “in the final part of the days” Jehovah’s restored worship is exalted as the one remaining hope for mankind. “To it all the nations “must stream” if they would have Jehovah’s favor and protection. As we act on Jehovah’s gracious invitation to share to the full in the blessings of the 1978 International Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses, let us be like the “many peoples” described in Isaiah 2:2-4: “Come, you people, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will instruct us about his ways, and we will walk in his paths.” Let us participate to the full in all the marvelous assembly blessings, thus testifying to our victorious faith!

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">DESCRIBED as miracles of convenience, aerosol sprays are now used to paint, manage hair, clean ovens, kill pests and most often make a person “smell good.” Yet, despite their popularity, aerosol packaging is being increasingly criticized as dangerous. Why?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">While the danger of the can’s exploding if heated has been long recognized (most aerosols have a warning on the can), recent criticism points at the vapor (mist) and the chemical content. “The fastest way to absorb a chemical into the body (aside from injecting it directly into a vein) is to inhale it,” states one report. The propellant or gas in most aerosols is a fluorocarbon, and some authorities think that inhaling it is dangerous, especially for people with allergies and lung or heart disease. In the United States, one propellant (vinyl chloride gas) has been linked with a rare form of liver cancer and so over 100 aerosol products containing it have been banned or voluntarily withdrawn from sale.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is also claimed that the propellants can burn or inflame exposed areas when, for example, a deodorant spray is applied too close to the skin. In some cases spray in the eyes can result in permanent scarring.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In addition to possible health hazards, critics also point out that the aerosol packaging is over twice as expensive as the same product in a simple container. The buyer must pay for the strong can, the spraying devices and the propellant.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But while the debate continues as to whether to outlaw these sprays altogether, how should an aerosol spray be handled if you do use one? Here the experts agree. Spray in a well-ventilated area. Keep the spray away from your eyes and then as quickly as possible leave the area where you did the spraying.</p>

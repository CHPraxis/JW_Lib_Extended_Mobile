What Can Be Done
WHAT can be done to correct religious intolerance in Argentina? The authorities themselves need to pay heed to questions such as the following:
WHEN will it no longer be a crime in Argentina just to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?
Must we wait months or years until the slow-moving wheels of justice turn out a just decision?
Will the highest authorities of the nation of Argentina personally listen, JUST ONCE, without prejudice, to Jehovah’s Witnesses’ side of the issue?
The invested authorities now have the opportunity to demonstrate before the world which role Argentina really represents on the world scene: that of a champion of freedom​—or of religious intolerance.
Fair-minded people throughout the world hope that Argentina’s leaders will decide on the side of freedom.
Argentine public opinion
Many Argentine people feel the same way. Indeed, on the whole, Argentine people in all walks of life are at a loss to explain why their government has taken such unjust actions against the Witnesses. Friends and relatives, neighbors, business and professional associates, and others whom the Witnesses meet in their daily routines, express themselves sympathetically.
Some ask: “Any news on how your case is coming along?” And they quickly say: “¡Dios quiera que salga bien!” (“God will that it work out well!”) Others comment: “Why doesn’t the government apprehend all the criminals rather than pick on you people who are doing good?” “What an injustice!” “Why don’t they prohibit some of the trash that is sold on the newsstands instead of banning the clean, instructive articles your magazines always carry?”
Worthy of special mention are the kind acts of many non-Witness neighbors and business people. On their own initiative and in goodwill, they have promptly donated food and covering for those in jail, realizing that the police would not provide such things. And they have regularly visited the imprisoned Witnesses to inquire about their needs.
True, most news media in Argentina have chosen to parrot the government’s hostile attitude toward the Witnesses. But there have been notable exceptions. The Buenos Aires Herald, La Opinión (Buenos Aires) and El Territorio (Misiones) are among the newspapers that have sought or granted interviews with Witness representatives and then honestly published their statements.
Nor should it be concluded that all police, judges and other officials have abused their authority and shown prejudice toward Jehovah’s Witnesses. That has not been the case. On many occasions the chiefs of police and other officers have expressed regret to the Witnesses, lamenting the circumstances that forced them to take action. And a number of prison officials, on releasing the Witnesses from confinement, have wished them well.
what the future holds
Jehovah’s Witnesses earth wide await true justice. They know that such will inevitably come soon through the kingdom of the righteous Judge and King, Jesus Christ.
Meanwhile, they put themselves under the protection of the same Being to whom the framers of the Argentine Constitution appealed when they penned these words in the Preamble to the Constitution:
“To assure the benefits of freedom for us, for our posterity, and for all the men of the world that want to live on Argentine soil: invoking God’s protection, Fountain of all right and justice.”
what can you do?
What is your reaction to the trampling underfoot of religious freedom in Argentina? Is there anything you can do about it? Yes, there most certainly is.
If you deplore such unjust action, you will want to write your appeal for justice. Respectfully, you can encourage the invested authorities to take the necessary steps to restore freedom to the Christian minority, Jehovah’s Witnesses.

Also, in harmony with 1 Timothy 2:1, 2, you may petition God in prayer that those “in high station” in Argentina may take a tolerant view of Jehovah’s Witnesses in that land, so that again they may lead a quiet and calm life, without the burdensome oppression of this unjust ban.

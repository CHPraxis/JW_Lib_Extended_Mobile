<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A WIDE variety of challenges can be successfully met when one applies Bible wisdom in daily events. This is noted in the following letter:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“When I was going to high school in Honolulu, Hawaii, I studied the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses for a short time but did not act on what I had learned. I decided to pursue a college education and went to Eastern Washington State College in Cheney, Washington, to major in anthropology.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“While attending college, I met my future wife, and we were married three years later. When we had been married for about nine months, we started looking around and could see that the conditions were really bad. This was in the early 1970’s when the stock market started to go down a lot. Frankly, we began getting depressed about the conditions. Often when I was reading the newspapers I would think back to what I had studied in the Bible, and I could relate what I saw in the papers about the conditions in the world to what God’s Word had prophesied about these things.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“When we did our laundry at the laundromat, there were some copies of ‘The Watchtower’ and ‘Awake!’ lying on the table, and one day I pointed out one of them to my wife and mentioned that they had some interesting articles about the conditions in the world today. She didn’t really seem interested at the time and she wasn’t too familiar with Jehovah’s Witnesses either, because of indoctrination that she had experienced in Sunday school. She had gone to the Pentecostal Sunday school and they had given her some inaccurate information, saying, for example, that the Witnesses did not believe in Christ.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“But one day, about three weeks later, she came home from the laundromat with two or three magazines, saying that she thought I might want to read them. This was in September of 1974.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“When I got home that night from my part-time janitorial job, I sat down and started reading the magazines and knew that I had to make a decision right away. So, when my wife got home from her job, I said: ‘Theresa, you just have to read these magazines.’ She read them and could see that there was a ring of truth to what they said. We were aware of the Kingdom Hall in Cheney, as it is easily seen from the road coming into town, and Theresa asked me when the Witnesses held meetings there. I told her that they had a meeting on Sunday.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“Although I was not yet ready to go to the Kingdom Hall, my wife went that very Sunday. She listened and talked to some of the people there. A nice lady asked her if she would like to have a personal Bible study, but she declined because I was not with her. She came home and asked if I would go to the next meeting with her, and I said, ‘Sure.’ I had long hair at the time, but I thought that I would go anyway. So we went the next Sunday and really enjoyed the meeting. Since then we have regularly attended all the meetings at the Kingdom Hall. A Bible study was offered again and, as we were together this time, we accepted.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">“A close friend from school was starting to look into the Bible at the same time. He didn’t know anything about Jehovah’s Witnesses. So we invited him over and shared with him what we were learning. As a result, he started coming to the meetings, participated in our discussions and shared with others the things he learned.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">“My training in anthropology was based on the evolution theory and was in direct conflict with the Bible. I had just blindly accepted what the professors told me. But I read the book ‘Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation?’ and I couldn’t argue with it. There was just no question in my mind. That little book showed all the fallacies, loopholes and gaps in the theories contained in the best textbooks the college had. It has been a big help to me in talking to other people about evolution. After studying and accepting the evolution theory for three years, and then learning the facts against evolution and in support of the Bible account of creation, I can assure all who believe God’s Word on this matter that they do not need to be apologetic about their belief. The facts are on their side.”</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">◆ War on Want, a British agency, reports that the sale of cigarettes is booming in developing lands. Sales are said to be growing by 5 percent yearly in these countries. The agency’s report, “Tobacco and the Third World: Tomorrow’s Epidemic,” also says that cancer and other smoking-related diseases will be the next epidemic to present a threat to Third World lands. Heightening the seriousness of matters is the fact that certain cigarettes being marketed in such countries “yield twice the amount of cancer-causing tar as the same brands sold in Europe and the U.S.,” reports the magazine <em>To the Point International.</em></p>

The Associated Press reported: “He was discharged from the service in 1947 after numerous psychiatric tests indicated a ‘severe neurosis and guilt complex.’ Doctors said he told them he felt responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Japanese at Hiroshima.” After the burial, the brother of the deceased man was quoted as saying: “He said his brain was on fire. He said he could feel those people burning.”</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">◆ According to the Mobil Oil Corporation, trips of 10 miles (16 kilometers) or less account for almost half the gasoline used in the United States. Mobil also points out that if you cut your driving speed from 70 to 50 miles (112.6 to 80.5 kilometers) an hour, your automobile will average 25 percent more mileage per gallon (3.8 liters).</p>

Both the muftis and rabbis prayed for the Red Army.” Regarding the Church-State relationship in the U.S.S.R., Kurochkin said: “The Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church held in 1971 to elect the present Patriarch, Pimen (Izvekov), declared that the church shall render political support to the Soviet state and social system. The council expressed satisfaction with the existing legislation on religion and the relations between the church and the state.”</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">◆ Since the British and French supersonic transport known as the Concorde began commercial flights across the Atlantic in January 1976, some passengers have become virtual “commuters.” Forty-three percent of the customers using the Concorde on British Airways have flown in the plane more than one time. “Five have each made more than 50 trips,” reports the journal <em>To the Point International, </em>adding: “The record is held by an American who has made 63 flights.”</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn">◆ In Japan the death rate for stomach cancer is 46.6 persons per 100,000, compared with 7.2 in the United States. Nitrates in foods have been linked with the high figure among the Japanese. On the other hand, in Japan the death rate for cancer of the intestine is 4.8 per 100,000, whereas it is 18.3 in the U.S. Also, while breast cancer is only 5.4 per 100,000 in Japan, the U.S. figure is 29.6.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn">◆ According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington, D.C., astronomers of the Naval Observatory recently announced the discovery of the first known moon of the planet Pluto. The satellite was discovered by James Christy while studying photographic plates of the planet <span id="page30" class="pageNum" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>that were made with the telescope at the observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. In comparing plates made during April and May 1978 with photos taken in 1965 and 1970, Christy noted an elongated blur that had changed positions. This turned out to be the previously undiscovered moon. Pluto is the farthest planet from the sun, and the newfound moon is reported to be 12,000 miles (19,000 kilometers) from the planet.</p>

Citing one case, the publication says that a year and a half after transplant treatments had been completed, “a 34-year-old man complained of buzzing in his right ear, throbbing and swelling above the ear at the site from which the last graft was taken, and blurring of vision in his right eye.” However, all these conditions vanished after the fistula was removed.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sn">◆ The White House Council on Wage and Price Stability recently reported that in the United States doctors’ fees have gone up 273 percent since 1950. Whereas U.S. residents paid $2.7 billion for the services of doctors in 1950, this outlay is expected to be $35 billion during 1978. Reportedly, 60 percent of this increase has resulted from higher fees alone. Medical doctors in the U.S. “earn four times more than other professional groups as a result of fee hikes,” reports <em>Parade </em>magazine.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sn">◆ The Australian Bureau of Sugar has found that sugarcane yields improved by almost one half in Queensland when some portland cement was plowed into acid soil a month before the crop was planted. Iron and magnesium in the cement are thought to be responsible for the greater yield. “In one test,” reports the British journal <em>New Scientist, </em>“four tonnes of cement applied per hectare [4.4 tons per 2.5 acres] increased yields by 44 per cent while a 33 per cent increase was shown by 2-1/2 tonnes [2.8 tons].”</p>

The rabbit’s owner claimed that her neighbor’s cat scared her pet to death. She contacted the animal warden. The cat soon was picked up by the police, and it was shot about three hours later at their firing range. At that, <span id="page31" class="pageNum" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>the owner sued the police because there was a local ordinance providing that animals be held for five days before disposing of them. The court awarded the owner $40 for his pet and $5,000 in the way of punitive damages.</p>

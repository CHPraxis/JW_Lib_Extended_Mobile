What Does the Bible Say About Sex?
There is a way to find out. The answer can benefit you.
The book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It frankly considers modern sexual attitudes in its chapter “Does Sexual Morality Make Sense?” It raises the question, ‘Does sex prior to marriage help make life worth living?’ You will also find the chapters “Dating and Courtship” and “Can You Succeed in Marriage?” both thought-provoking and helpful.
Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It is hard bound, has 192 pages and is only 35 cents (U.S.), postpaid.

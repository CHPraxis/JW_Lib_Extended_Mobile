● Did Jehovah God speak to Adam directly or through an angel?
Likely God spoke to Adam through his Son, who later became Jesus.
The Bible reveals that often when God spoke to humans it was through an angel, who might even be spoken of as if he were Jehovah. (Gen. 16:7-11; Judg. 2:1-4; 6:11-16; 13:15-22; compare Exodus 3:2-4 with Acts 7:30, 35.) The Scriptures pointedly say that God transmitted the Law to Moses through angels.​—Gal. 3:19; Heb. 2:2, 3.
God’s chief spokesman was his only-begotten Son, called “the Word.” God often used him to communicate with humans. (John 1:1) Through him God created all other things. (John 1:3; Col. 1:16) The Word, then, would be the one to whom Jehovah said: “Let us make man in our image.” The creation account adds that God “said to [Adam and Eve]: ‘Be fruitful and become many.’” Logically, God said this and other things to Adam and Eve through “the Word” who was so involved with humans.​—Gen. 1:26-28; 2:16; 3:8-13; Prov. 8:31.

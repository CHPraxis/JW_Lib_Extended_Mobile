<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Did Jehovah God speak to Adam directly or through an angel?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Likely God spoke to Adam through his Son, who later became Jesus.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible reveals that often when God spoke to humans it was through an angel, who might even be spoken of as if he were Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:16:7-1:16:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 16:7-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:1-7:2:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Judg. 2:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:11-7:6:16" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 6:11-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:13:15-7:13:22" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 13:15-22</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:2-2:3:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 3:2-4</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:30-44:7:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 7:30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:35-44:7:35" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 35</a>.) The Scriptures pointedly say that God transmitted the Law to Moses through angels.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:19-48:3:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gal. 3:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:2-58:2:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Heb. 2:2, 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God’s chief spokesman was his only-begotten Son, called “the Word.” God often used him to communicate with humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 1:1</a>) Through him God created all other things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:3-43:1:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:16-51:1:16" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Col. 1:16</a>) The Word, then, would be the one to whom Jehovah said: “Let us make man in our image.” The creation account adds that God “said to [Adam and Eve]: ‘Be fruitful and become many.’” Logically, God said this and other things to Adam and Eve through “the Word” who was so involved with humans.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:28" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:16-1:2:16" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:8-1:3:13" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 3:8-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:31-20:8:31" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Prov. 8:31</a>.</p>

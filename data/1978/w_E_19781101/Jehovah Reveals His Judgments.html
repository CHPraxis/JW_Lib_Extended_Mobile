<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Jehovah God does not leave people in ignorance of his judgments. The Bible book of Amos informs us: “The Sovereign Lord Jehovah will not do a thing unless he has revealed his confidential matter to his servants the prophets. There is a lion that has roared! Who will not be afraid? The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has spoken! Who will not prophesy?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:3:7-30:3:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Amos 3:7, 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An examination of the Biblical record makes it clear that God’s servants were the first to know what he had in mind doing. Noah was the first to learn that the ungodly would be destroyed in a global flood, Abraham was told about Jehovah’s view of Sodom and surrounding cities, and Israel’s prophets were repeatedly informed as to what would happen in the future. This put the prophets in a position to sound the warning, appealing to the Israelites to abandon their lawless ways.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A lion’s roar is a sound of warning, prompting fear in those hearing it. Likewise, when Jehovah spoke, revealing his judgments to his prophets, this caused a reaction in them. They were impelled to prophesy, to declare what had been made known to them.</p>

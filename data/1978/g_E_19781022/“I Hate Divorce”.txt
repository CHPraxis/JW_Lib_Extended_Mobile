“I Hate Divorce”
When people turn their backs on their Creator, they cannot expect his blessings. For example, God’s law is that, except for the reason of sexual immorality by one mate, divorce is not permitted. When the ancient nation of Israel broke God’s laws on marriage, they were told the following as to why God no longer accepted their religious sacrifices:
“You ask why he no longer accepts them. It is because he knows you have broken your promise to the wife you married when you were young. She was your partner, and you have broken your promise to her, although you promised before God that you would be faithful to her. Didn’t God make you one body and spirit with her? What was his purpose in this? It was that you should have children who are truly God’s people. So make sure that none of you breaks his promise to his wife. ‘I hate divorce,’ says the Lord God of Israel. ‘I hate it when one of you does such a cruel thing to his wife.’”​—Mal. 2:14-16, “Today’s English Version”; Matt. 19:9.

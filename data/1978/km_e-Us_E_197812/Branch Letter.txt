Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
The Service Office here in Brooklyn was happy to see how many of you responded to the invitation extended on the second day of the “Victorious Faith” International Convention to join the ranks of regular pioneers. Pioneer service was encouraged in the talk “Pioneering in the Steps of the Master.” What was the result? In August we received 741 new applications. This is the highest number received in any one month in four years. It was encouraging to note that many of these came from married couples. We hope that many more will be able to increase their service by regular pioneering.
We have also been very busy scheduling pioneers to attend the Pioneer Service School. Twenty-nine classes were held this fall, from September through November. Twenty-six were in English and three in Spanish. With few exceptions, all the traveling overseers’ wives and special pioneers have now attended in the United States.
One of the instructors made this comment: “Several students mentioned having reached a point of discouragement in their assignments, and how they felt a need for some definite encouragement and meaningful assistance.” He then quoted a student’s comment: “The Pioneer School is like an answer to a cry for help.” It was also reported that a 92-year-old pioneer sister, serving where the need is greater, was happy she was able to attend, because it taught her to be a better teacher.
We are confident that all of us will receive benefits, too, from the pioneers who have been through the school.
Your brothers,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

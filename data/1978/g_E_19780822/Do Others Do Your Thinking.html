<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Propaganda has power. Does it overpower you? Or do you have a mind of your own?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">EDUCATION teaches you how to think. Propagandists tell you what to think. True educators present all sides of an issue and encourage discussion. Propagandists hammer hard on their view and discourage discussion. Many times their true motives are hidden. They sift the facts, tell the favorable ones and conceal the others. They distort and twist facts, specialize in lies and half-truths. Your emotions, not your logical thinking abilities, are their target. Many fall easy prey because it takes no effort to feel, whereas thinking is hard labor. And the propagandist sees to it that his message is made to seem wise, the right and moral one, and gives you a sense of importance and belonging if you follow it. You are one of the smart ones, you are not alone, you are comfortable and secure​—so they say.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Propagandists have little respect for people’s thinking abilities. Hitler wrote: “The intelligence of the masses is small. Their forgetfulness is great. They must be told the same thing a thousand times.” Lenin was more discriminating. He used historical and scientific arguments to persuade the educated minority, but slogans and half-truths to arouse the masses, whom he considered unable to grasp complicated ideas. The pen may be mightier than the sword, but oftentimes it is used to prepare the way before the sword.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong><em>Tricks of Propagandists</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>Symbols </em>stir feelings. <em>Words </em>such as mother, home, justice, freedom​—all pack a wallop for the heart. <em>Slogans </em>are catchy and seem to be packed with wisdom. Favorable <em>facts </em>are exaggerated; the others are distorted or concealed. <em>Oratory </em>often substitutes for sound argument, and it diverts attention from unpleasant truths that cannot be concealed. Burn a building in one place while robbing a grocery store somewhere else, is the technique.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Tyranny of authority, ridicule, name-calling, smears, slurs, personal digs​—all such tactics are marshaled to assail your mind and take it by storm. Sound evidence, <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>reasoning, logic? The propagandist’s deadliest foes! He therefore attempts to rout reason and stimulate passion. As emotion rises, judgment declines; and, under the lash of stinging words and reckless rhetoric, the mind is herded along. Some propaganda is of this inflammatory kind, but much of it today is more subtle. Many people today are more sophisticated and see through the rambunctious oratory; so a “soft sell” is used instead.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Television commercials specialize in this. Products are associated with happy families, beautiful girls, romantic men, cuddly babies, playful kittens and puppies​—all desirable things but which have nothing to do with the products. Television programs are often propaganda, for the new morality, for materialistic goals, for selfish satisfactions. Newscasts are colored. Most situation comedies are superficial fluff.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">But even educated, sophisticated persons fall prey to a very unfair and untrue type of propaganda. This type assumes a superior air of dismissal of an opponent’s viewpoint, treating it as rather pathetic and really not worth attention. It is what many evolutionists resort to in order to evade questions that they cannot answer. They can’t prove their theory. So they resort to making assertions, and they scoff at all who dare to dispute them. And if any suggest that evolution conflicts with the Bible, these wise ones indulgently smile at the simple souls and indicate that they need this crutch, but that “intelligent persons know that God’s Word is only ancient myths.” They prove neither their assertions nor their smears, but by the tyranny of authority they pontificate their opinions, squelch objections and intimidate opposers. It works, and supposedly intelligent people who know nothing about the theory believe it because “all intelligent people believe it.” But more on this in the next article, “Creation Goes to College.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong><em>What About You?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:15-20:14:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:15</a> states: “A simple man believes every word he hears; a clever man understands the need for proof.” (<em>The New English Bible</em>) Many today are like sponges; they soak up whatever they are submerged in. It is the easy way. Exercise for the muscles is hard work; exercising the mind is even harder. It is so much easier to soak up whatever is around​—and today, for the most part, that is television, the printed page, radio and movies. There are, however, some good books, movies and television programs. They require more mental effort to read or to watch. So each individual must choose what he will feed his mind. It is said that we are what we eat, and this can apply to food for both the body and the mind. Whatever you read or watch or listen to, test whether it is propaganda or whether it is the truth. “The god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers,” that they might not know the vital truths of our time. What about you? Will you let others think for you, or will you do your own thinking? Do your own, and “thinking ability itself will keep guard over you.” At the same time, it must be admitted that we need good and proper guidance.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:4-47:4:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:6-47:4:6" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:11-20:2:11" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Prov. 2:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Ps. 36:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> Jer. 10:23</a>.</p>

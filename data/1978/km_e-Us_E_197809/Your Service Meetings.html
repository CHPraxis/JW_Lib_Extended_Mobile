(Invite young people to relate experiences where they did apply good counsel and it turned out well.)</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Do You Understand Why? Audience discussion dealing with questions that concern young people. Questions should be directed toward parents and older ones, asking them kindly to explain why certain counsel is given. Try to help young people look beyond rules and appreciate why it is wise for them to listen. Strive to be positive, helpful; avoid being critical.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Chairman: Some young people become resentful toward parents, teachers and others in authority, feeling that they are restricted in many areas without good reason. Result: resistance to counsel and a communication gap. How can we help them understand why guidelines are established to regulate their conduct? How would you answer these questions?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">(1) It is common to see use of tobacco, alcohol and drugs at schools and other places. Why are parents so concerned when they hear about such things?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:4-40:5:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 5:4</a>) Will we imitate Jehovah by comforting others?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>28 min: </strong>“Keep Comforting One Another.” Audience discussion. All of us can be a comfort to one another.

Here are opportunities to comfort from God’s Word.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">What would you do if householder says that family member recently died? Need to be discerning and tactful.

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sn"><strong>12 min: </strong>Jehovah Helps Us to Develop New Personalities. Interviews. By his spirit and Word, God helps us to change to new personality. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:22-49:4:24" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Eph. 4:22-24</a>) We sense need for more progress, yet we probably recognize that we already have come a long way.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Interview some who formerly had old personality traits such as bad temper, tendency to jealousy, being withdrawn, or too pushy.

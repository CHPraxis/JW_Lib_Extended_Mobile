<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Kingdom Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At the “Victorious Faith” International Convention, we were delighted to receive still another provision designed to increase the understanding and spread of the Kingdom message. In the past, many have inquired about recorded Bible readings from the <em>New World Translation. </em>We were pleased to learn that cassette tape recordings of the Gospel of John have been produced and are now available for our use. Why was John’s Gospel selected? It is filled with the comforting words of Jesus that warm the heart and prompt us to draw closer to Jehovah. It is understandable that this is the most widely distributed portion of the Christian Greek Scriptures.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How can these recordings be used? All of us are sure to enjoy and benefit from hearing God’s Word read with force and meaning. Those confined to a sickbed or who are in a hospital will especially appreciate them. Blind persons, as well as those with limited reading ability, will be able to put them to good use. Undoubtedly you will find that they can be used with good results in a variety of other situations.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Bear in mind that these tapes are copyrighted. Any commercial or profit-making duplication or distribution would be an infringement of the copyright. This would not necessarily apply to making a copy for personal use.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Cassette recordings to <em>The Good News According to John </em>should be ordered through the congregation. Special order blanks have been sent to each congregation with the August statement. Please do not send any remittance with the order. The recordings will be charged to your congregation’s literature account. The price is $3.00 per set. For pioneers, the rate is $2.50. Use this means to build appreciation for the Bible.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We send our Christian love.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sj">Your brothers,</p>

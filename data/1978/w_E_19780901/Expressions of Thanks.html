<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“This is just a short note to tell you how much I appreciate the recent articles in <em>The Watchtower </em>as well as those in the <em>Awake! </em>The articles in the March 1, 1978, <em>Watchtower </em>on ‘Our Incoming World Government​—God’s Kingdom’ are especially appreciated, and should help all of God’s people to see clearly the times and seasons in which we live. When I made a dedication of myself to serve Jehovah in 1923 I made a resolution that I would read every article of every issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Golden Age, </em>now <em>Awake! </em>For over 55 years I have faithfully kept that resolution and have read each and every article in both magazines. This has not been a burden but a source of much joy, comfort and education. Thank you very much for the vast amount of research, study and work that goes into the preparation of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>for our benefit, which is indeed spiritual food.”</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! For what? For the recent <em>Watchtower </em>articles ‘Something New About God’s Name.’ I grew up Jewish but never did I hear that name. Even attending Jewish camp I never heard it. The only ‘name’ I learned was <em>Adonay. </em>You can’t imagine how thrilled I was to read the irrefutable evidence in this most recent article. I cannot wait to get my hands on more copies. If there is anything I detest, it is the abuse, misuse and lack of using God’s name. This article will help me to fulfill my heart’s desire, making our wonderful Creator’s name known. Thank you! and Jehovah bless you.”</p>

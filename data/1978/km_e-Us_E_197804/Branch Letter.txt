Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
Over the years we here in the United States have enjoyed seeing thousands of new ones share in Kingdom preaching. Other lands continue seeing such growth. Already by November of 1977, Italy had a peak of 68,000 proclaimers of the “good news.” In Japan a peak of over 43,000 publishers have reported, with publishers averaging more than 15 hours.
We want to aid as many more as possible during whatever time Jehovah yet permits. At the same time, we also have a deep concern “toward those [already] related to us in the faith.” (Gal. 6:10) It is interesting to note that, in addition to the more than half a million publishers regularly sharing in the preaching work, about 100,000 others report service at least sometime during the year. Hence, many thousands who are not reporting service each month are still associating with us and still love the truth. Could it be that they are hesitant about talking extensively at the doors? They may lack confidence and thus need our help.
It is urgent that we all be alert to whatever needs our brothers may have and help them in any way we can. We want to assist all to strengthen their “hold on the real life.” (1 Tim. 6:19) Jesus knew that what lies ahead will require all of us to have the strength that comes from being active, whole-souled in our service. Hence he urged us to ‘pay attention to ourselves’ and to “keep awake” that we ‘may succeed in escaping the things that are destined to occur.’​—Luke 10:25-28; 21:34-36.
Having taken up the service of God, may we never lose our zeal and confidence. Rather, may we demonstrate that we are “the sort that have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.”​—Heb. 10:39.
Be assured of our warm love.
Your brothers,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

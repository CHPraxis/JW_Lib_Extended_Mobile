<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb">THE UNIVERSAL SOVEREIGN is “the Ancient of Days,” Jehovah. To him the glorified “Son of man,” Jesus Christ, came, in 1914 C.E., for a share in the “kingdom of the world.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The prophet Daniel foretold this, saying: “See there! with the clouds of the heavens someone like a son of man happened to be coming; and to the Ancient of Days he gained access, and they brought him up close even before that One. And to him there were given rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him. His rulership is an indefinitely lasting rulership that will not pass away, and his kingdom one that will not be brought to ruin.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Dan. 7:13, 14</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Because the Ancient of Days takes his Anointed Son Jesus into association with him in “the kingdom of the world” it becomes “the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rev. 11:15</a>) Thus all the world of mankind become earthly human subjects of the Universal Sovereign Jehovah and of his Christ.

This vision was first understood in 1935 C.E.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Today the “great crowd” well understands that “the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ” involves two main persons, namely, the Lord Jehovah and his Son, Christ Jesus; also, that this particular government to which they are subject dates, not from Pentecost of 33 C.E., but from 1914 C.E. Accordingly, the “great crowd” observes that, 63 years after Pentecost, Christ Jesus was still encouraging his spirit-begotten disciples to look forward to that kingdom, saying: “To the one that conquers I will grant to sit down with me on my throne, even as I conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:21-66:3:21" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 3:21</a>) They had yet to inherit that coming heavenly kingdom as “heirs indeed of God, but joint heirs with Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:17-45:8:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rom. 8:17</a>) Jesus Christ is the main Heir of God, and his disciples are minor heirs.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:1-58:1:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 1:1, 2</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span id="page28" class="pageNum" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span><sup>6 </sup>So the Kingdom of which those spirit-begotten disciples on earth were “joint heirs with Christ” is not something in which they had been since the outpouring of holy spirit at Pentecost of 33 C.E. For that reason the apostle Peter, writing his second letter about 64 C.E., or 30 years after Pentecost, gave his fellow Christians this admonition: “If you keep on doing these things you will by no means ever fail. In fact, thus there will be richly supplied to you the entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:10-61:1:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 7. By means of what do they have that entrance into the kingdom supplied to them, and so what temporary relationship to Jesus Christ passes away?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>In God’s due time the 144,000 joint heirs with Christ are richly supplied that entrance into the heavenly kingdom by means of the “first resurrection.” Then they will no longer be the spirit-begotten subjects on earth under “the Son of [God’s] love.” That temporary relationship with the glorified Jesus Christ will be gone forever. They will be the heavenly immortal, incorruptible kings with him.

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 8. Did the 1,000-year reign of Christ begin in 1914, and what does the foretold “sign” indicate in this regard?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>The 1,000-year reign of Jesus Christ with his 144,000 joint heirs did not begin in 1914 at the inauguration of the “kingdom of the world . . . the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.” What <em>did </em>begin there for Jesus Christ was his official, royal “presence,” or parousia, about which his apostles had asked, according to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3</a>. His “presence” in Kingdom power did not start when God used him to pour out holy spirit at Pentecost of 33 C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:2-53:2:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Thess. 2:2</a>) Only since the Gentile Times ended in 1914 has the foretold “sign” become visible to prove that the Son of God is invisibly present in Kingdom power, in the “kingdom of the world.”</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 9. From the occurring of the “sign,” the disciples were to know that what was near, and why were they to quit any dejectedness?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>This kingdom is assigned to destroy the present wicked system of things. In Jesus’ prophecy that sets out the things that make up the portentous “sign,” he referred to the Kingdom when it was about to carry out this destructive work, saying to his apostles: “In this way you also, when you see these things occurring, know that the kingdom of God is near.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:31-42:21:31" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 21:31</a>) By carrying out its assigned work, this kingdom will deliver the faithful disciples of Christ yet on earth from further oppression by the Gentile nations. This explains why Jesus said to his disciples: “As these things start to occur, raise yourselves erect and lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:28-42:21:28" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 21:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">10. When does the “deliverance” of the spirit-begotten remnant take place, and what does it include?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The remnant of spirit-begotten disciples of Christ yet on earth saw “these things” start to occur back in 1914 C.E. Their deliverance from the present wicked system of things occurs when the royal “stone” that was cut out of the mountain of God’s sovereignty strikes the “image” of worldly political rulership of the earth and destroys it in the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” at Har–Magedon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:45" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Dan. 2:44, 45;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Rev. 16:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 16</a>) Their “deliverance” also includes their later being taken from the earthly scene and being ushered into “the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” by the “first resurrection” from the dead.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Deliverance also nears for the “great crowd” of sheeplike people who are now taking their stand with the spirit-begotten remnant in favor of “the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.” But the Gentile nations have ignored the Kingdom “decree” about which they have been given notice, as set out in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:2:1-19:2:9" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 2:1-9</a>: “Why have the nations been in tumult [since 1914 C.E.] and the national groups themselves kept muttering an empty thing? The kings of earth take their stand and high officials themselves have massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one [his Christ], . . . Let me refer to the decree of Jehovah; he has said to me [Christ]: ‘You are my son; I, today, I have become your father. Ask of me, that I may give nations as your inheritance and the ends of the earth as your own possession. You will break them with an iron scepter, as though a potter’s vessel you will dash them to pieces.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:10" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 11:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">12. Despite the end of the Gentile Times in 1914, what position do Jehovah’s Witnesses take toward worldly politics?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Since 1914, the “kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ” has had a right to interfere with Gentile nations. Does this mean that Jehovah’s Christian witnesses now have a right to meddle in worldly politics? May they take sides, as Catholics and Protestants do, with this or that political party, even conspiring against established political government or stirring up revolution? Not at all! Uncompromisingly they have copied the example of the Lamb, Jesus Christ, in being “no part of the world.” They hold strictly to the kingdom that was brought to birth in heaven in 1914. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:14-43:17:14" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 17:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:1-66:12:12" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> Rev. 12:1-12</a>) In spite of the fierce persecution leveled against them because of their Christian neutrality toward worldly conflicts, they carry out the prophetic word of their heavenly Leader, Jesus Christ, when he said: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:10-41:13:10" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Mark 13:10</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>This Kingdom witness has to be done before this system of things ends and Christ’s 1,000-year reign begins. Hence, the birth of God’s kingdom in the heavens in 1914 did not mean the beginning of Christ’s millennial reign. According to Bible prophecies, much has to take place before this system of things ends, making way for Christ’s reign of 1,000 years with his 144,000 spirit-begotten disciples.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:4-66:20:4" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Rev. 20:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:6-66:20:6" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 6</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Satan the Devil is determined that, before he and his demon angels are hurled into the abyss for 1,000 years, he will drag all the nations down into destruction and thus prevent their becoming Christ’s subjects during His millennial reign. To this end he is leading all the worldly nations to the battlefield of Har–Magedon, there to fight against Jehovah God and his Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:13-66:16:16" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Rev. 16:13-16</a>) Satan the Devil will thus be responsible for the everlasting “woe” that strikes the Gentile nations there.

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">15. For refusing to march with the Gentile nations under Satan, what has been the experience of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and why?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>We must refuse to march as allies with the Gentile nations in their march to <span id="page30" class="pageNum" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>fight against Jehovah God the Almighty at Har–Magedon. Such refusal has brought great hardship upon Jehovah’s Christian Witnesses. Especially since the ouster of Satan the Devil and his demon angels from heaven, the remnant of the prospective joint heirs of Christ have been the main target of the wrathful Satan the Devil. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:13-66:12:17" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Rev. 12:13-17</a>) His aim is to break their integrity toward God.

In deference to his highness, the cry again arises from the oncoming marchers: “Raise your heads, O you gates; yes, raise them up, O you long-lasting entrances, that the glorious King may come in!” Once again the inquiry is made: “Who, then, is he, this glorious King?” Back comes the reassuring answer: “Jehovah of armies​—he is the glorious King.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:24:7-19:24:10" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ps. 24:7-10</a>.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">23. (a) Why, since 1914, is Jehovah of armies especially “the glorious King”? (b) What will he maintain at Har–Magedon, and after that what will he do for mankind?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>Today in this year of 1978 C.E. the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” at Har–Magedon approaches. Now, long since the Gentile Times ended in 1914, “Jehovah of armies” is especially “the glorious King.” Why so? Because, as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:47:8-19:47:8" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Psalm 47:8</a> foretold, “God has become king over the nations,” he again acting as the Universal Sovereign toward our earth. He will display his mightiness in further maintaining at Har–Magedon “the kingdom of the world . . . the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:18" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Rev. 11:15-18</a>) Jehovah’s Christ, the Son greater than King David, is the one whom he has enthroned to represent Him in the world government. First, Jehovah of armies, attended by his Son Jesus Christ and armies of heavenly angels, will rid the universe of today’s wicked system of things. Then he will bless mankind with righteous world rulership through his Son, Jesus Christ. This grand prospect gets nearer to its realization!</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">24. So what does this Jehovah of armies now deserve from us?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>Does not this “glorious King,” Jehovah of armies, deserve now a heartfelt welcome from us? Most certainly, Yes! Come in, then, O our glorious King!</p>

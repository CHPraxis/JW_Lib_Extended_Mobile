Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
In February of this year, thought-provoking information on pioneering appeared in Our Kingdom Service. Since then, have you considered sharing in this activity? Have any in your family expressed the desire to pioneer? It certainly is a fine thing to think seriously about the possibility of enlarging our share in the vital work of proclaiming the “good news” and making disciples. What a grand way this is to express our love for Jehovah God and our fellowman!
Although pioneering may require making adjustments in one’s daily life, and it certainly calls for hard work, many who are engaging in this service have experienced rich blessings. For example, a brother with a business was able to work out a program that enabled him to auxiliary pioneer for six out of the last twelve months. What were the results? He enjoyed conducting as many as seven Bible studies.
Though it has not been easy with a full work load, even some members of Bethel families have been able to arrange to be auxiliary pioneers. In the Philippines, 16 members of the Bethel family were able to pioneer in one month and enjoyed conducting 41 Bible studies. Also we have heard fine experiences from members of the Brooklyn Bethel family who have shared in the auxiliary pioneer work. One brother told of placing hundreds of magazines. How did he do it? He took advantage of every opportunity to speak about the truth​—at bus stops and in other places where small groups were gathered.
We hope that you, too, will continue to think about how you might increase your share in declaring the “good news.” May Jehovah’s rich blessing attend your efforts to be whole-souled in your sacred service. Be assured of our warm Christian love.
Your brothers,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

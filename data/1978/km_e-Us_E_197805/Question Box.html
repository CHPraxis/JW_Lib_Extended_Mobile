<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>‚óè How can the school overseer arrange to give private counsel after the meeting to those who have assignments in the Theocratic School?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Good cooperation of all with the school overseer will often permit his seeing most, if not all, of the four students without undue delay, right after the meeting. (It would not be necessary for the one giving the instruction talk to be present. If something needs to be brought to his attention, the school overseer can see him later.) All should understand that this is part of the instruction of the Theocratic School. We encourage all to seek out the school overseer right after the meeting. This will assist him in being of the greatest help to each one.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Occasionally, the school overseer can give brief reminders from the platform that students should see him after the meeting to pick up their counsel slips and to talk over the points on which they are working. Students who are on the program should arrive well before the meeting begins. It is  suggested that rehearsals be completed at another time, before the meeting begins. If all remember to give their counsel slips and assignment slips to the school overseer before the meeting, this will provide opportunity for him to remind each one to see him after the meeting.</p>

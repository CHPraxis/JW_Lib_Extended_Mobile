<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A YOUNG Honduran man desired very much to attend a coming assembly of Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses, since he had not missed any such assemblies since becoming a Witness. But he fell sick before the assembly and, after getting well, could not find work to earn what he needed to attend. Two days before the assembly he still did not have the money.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Then the day before the assembly he went out to the woods and was surprised to see a parrot in a tree. And, looking around, he saw two more young parrots. The determined Honduran climbed the tree and captured the three parrots, selling them for enough money to take not only himself but his mother and brother to the assembly.</p>

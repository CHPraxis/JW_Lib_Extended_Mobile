<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Millions found it can—note some actual examples:</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn"><strong>FAMILY PROBLEMS SOLVED</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><strong>Housewife </strong>filed for divorce, suffered nervous breakdown, attempted suicide. She and husband accepted Bible study. Communication improved and they are now happy, united couple.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="si">They learned the Bible says: ‘A husband should love his wife as himself and a wife should deeply respect her husband.’—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:33-49:5:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:33</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sn"><strong>FACE OLD AGE WITH HOPE</strong></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><strong>A lonely old man </strong>prepared poisonous brew. Before he drank it, two young visitors interrupted, shared hope from Bible. Their genuine friendship helped him find new meaning in life.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="si">He saw this Bible principle in operation: ‘True Christians find many real friends, who become like sons and daughters to them.’—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:29-41:10:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 10:29, 30</a>.</p>

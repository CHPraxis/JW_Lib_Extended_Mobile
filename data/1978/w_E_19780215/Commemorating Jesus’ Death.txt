Commemorating Jesus’ Death
During a simple ceremony, Jesus Christ used wine and unleavened bread as symbols of the human life that he was to sacrifice for mankind. When instituting this ceremony, he said: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”​—Luke 22:19.
Last year, 5,107,518 persons remembered Jesus by attending the memorial of his death at special meetings sponsored by Jehovah’s Witnesses. You are cordially invited to attend the Memorial observance this year at the Kingdom Hall nearest to your home. It will be held Thursday, March 23, after sunset. Check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time.

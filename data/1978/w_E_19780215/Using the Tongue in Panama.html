<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A TWELVE-year-old Panamanian girl, invalid from birth, could not use her undeveloped arms and legs. But she has a sharp mind and was allowed by her mother to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. “I was wondering how she would ever be able to turn the pages and find a Bible text,” remarked the Witness studying with the girl, “but she has no trouble at all. She lies on her stomach on the bed with her books before her and turns the pages with her tongue in a most efficient way, finding the text sometimes even before I do.”</p>

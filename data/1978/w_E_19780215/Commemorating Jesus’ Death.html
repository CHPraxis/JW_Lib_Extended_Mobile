<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">During a simple ceremony, Jesus Christ used wine and unleavened bread as symbols of the human life that he was to sacrifice for mankind. When instituting this ceremony, he said: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 22:19</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Christians are Scripturally urged to “pursue peace” and ‘maintain fine conduct.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:14-58:12:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 12:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:12-60:2:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 2:12</a>) Many benefits result from heeding this counsel. This was illustrated recently in South Africa.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● Due to unrest throughout the country, authorities at the African township of Soweto, outside Johannesburg, were doubtful about permitting Jehovah’s Witnesses to use the Amphitheater there for an assembly. But the caretaker, who knew of their conduct at previous assemblies, commented: “These are the last people to be refused the use of the theater. Their assemblies are always peaceful.” Permission to use the facilities was granted.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● Despite the unrest in the country, a fine, peaceful Christian assembly was held. It was attended by 4,620 persons, including 50 who were baptized in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah God. When the gathering was over, the caretaker remarked that the Witnesses had left the Amphitheater “clean as never before.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● How thoroughly must the outlines provided in “Your Service Meetings” be covered by those assigned?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Those handling meeting parts may find that there is more material provided than they can cover in the time allowed, especially if they work in local application of the material, including experiences, and so on. On the other hand, very small congregations with few publishers to draw on for such material may appreciate having detailed outlines. Therefore, it is suggested that the brothers handling meeting parts tailor them to the local circumstances, using the main points within each part that are applicable locally and illustrating them to the extent possible. This may mean that some of the lesser points will be eliminated to allow for thorough coverage of the main points, much as a public speaker cuts out subpoints if his talk is going overtime. However, this does not mean that the discussion should divert from the basic purpose of the meeting part as outlined.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Scriptural discussions outlined from time to time may have more material and scriptures provided than can be covered properly when personal experiences are worked in. The one handling the part will do well to allow for this by noting ahead which scriptures or points are most important and using others only as time permits. It is better to cover a few points <em>with application </em>to our lives, than to cover many points that are too general.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This is not to say that preparation for service meeting parts is not essential. Each one assigned is expected seriously to prepare his presentation, having in mind his responsibility to serve his brothers well.</p>

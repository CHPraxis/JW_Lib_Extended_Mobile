Would There Be As Many Wars If . . . ?
In a special session of the United Nations on world disarmament, Ambassador Jamil M. Baroody of Saudi Arabia made a disarming statement, according to a UPI report. He suggested limiting the armies to men between the ages of 40 and 60, suggesting also that the defense ministries be staffed by mothers. This would be a giant step toward world disarmament, he said, since middle-aged men “generally make the decisions to fight wars” and would perhaps think twice if they also had to take part in them.

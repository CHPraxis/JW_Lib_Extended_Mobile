<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE brine shrimp gets its name from being able to live in extremely salty water​—water so salty that no potential predator could survive in it. But what is even more amazing about this little creature, measuring less than a half inch (1.3 centimeters) in length, is the survival capacity of its eggs. If dried of nearly every bit of moisture and thereafter subjected to a temperature of minus 310 degrees Fahrenheit (−190 Celsius), the eggs will still hatch if placed in salt water of a reasonable temperature. At the other extreme, fully dried, brine shrimp eggs retain hatching potential even after being submitted for two hours to a temperature somewhat beyond the boiling point. What remarkable evidence this is of the hardiness with which the Creator, Jehovah God, has endowed these creatures!</p>

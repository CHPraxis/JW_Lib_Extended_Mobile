Bible Stories to Fascinate Children
Since its release last summer, My Book of Bible Stories has been fascinating young ones and older ones alike. Children delight to have the 116 stories read to them over and over again.
The book has 256 pages, a yellow-gold cover with embossed red title, and extra-large type. It is of the same page size as this magazine, and has over 125 large pictures, most of them multicolored. Only $2 (U.S.), postpaid.
Please send My Book of Bible Stories and the free booklet There Is Much More to Life! I enclose $2 (U.S.).

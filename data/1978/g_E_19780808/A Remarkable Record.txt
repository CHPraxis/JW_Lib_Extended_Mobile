A Remarkable Record
A CAMEL needs about as much water as a horse. When water is available, the animal will drink from five to seven gallons a day. However, the remarkable thing about the camel is that it can live without water for a prolonged period. Carrying a load of some 400Â pounds, it may endure without water for eight days. An exceptional record for a camel is 34 days without drinking water.

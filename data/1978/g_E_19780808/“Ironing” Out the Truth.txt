“Ironing” Out the Truth
AN ITALIAN woman worked with a group of nuns in a clinic in Manfredonia, southern Italy. “One day while I was in the kitchen,” she relates, “the mother superior told me to go to the laundry and throw away a book that she had soaked in water for a few days.” The woman went to get the book, but before throwing it away, she decided to take a look at it. The book had not lost its orange color. It was the book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.
“I delicately took hold of it,” she continued, “and went to the terrace to dry it out so that I could take it home. I carefully ironed the pages. I also let my mother see it, and each evening we read some pages. Often we found the name Jehovah, not knowing that it was the name of God. Some time afterward a lady with a baby came to my home to speak about the Holy Bible. I asked her: ‘Could you tell me what Jehovah means?’”
This sincere woman quickly accepted a Bible study and began attending the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

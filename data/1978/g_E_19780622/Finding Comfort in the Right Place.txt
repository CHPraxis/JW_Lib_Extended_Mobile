Finding Comfort in the Right Place
Calling at a home, two of Jehovah’s Witnesses found the householder upset because she had lost a check representing a large sum of money. The Witnesses expressed sympathy for her and suggested that, since they represented the ‘God of comfort,’ she get her Bible, and they would share some thoughts with her. The Witnesses mentioned that this ‘God of comfort’ has a name and she could read it in her Bible at Psalm 83:18. When the woman turned to this verse, her check fell out of the Bible. She was elated, agreed to study the Bible and the study soon was going well!

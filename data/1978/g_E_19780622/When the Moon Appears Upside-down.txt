When the Moon Appears Upside-down
HAS the moon ever appeared inverted or upside-down to you? Likely you know the experience if you have ever traveled into the southern hemisphere from the northern, or vice versa. One doing so may surprisingly exclaim: “The moon is upside-down!” Actually crossing the equator from one hemisphere to another results merely in a different vantage point of observation. Even the sun, which continues to travel in the same direction that one is accustomed to, now seems to be closer to the opposite horizon. It is merely the observer’s point of view that has changed.

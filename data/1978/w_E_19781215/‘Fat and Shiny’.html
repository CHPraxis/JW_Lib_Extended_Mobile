<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:5:28-24:5:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jeremiah 5:28</a> describes those who become prosperous by lawless means: “They have grown fat; they have become shiny. They have also overflowed with bad things.” Such wicked men were fat in the sense that they were well nourished. Hence, their skin did not hang loose as if they were suffering from malnutrition. No, it was filled out and smooth, “shiny.” But their prosperity was only temporary. Jehovah was going to hold an accounting against them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:5:29-24:5:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 5:29</a>.</p>

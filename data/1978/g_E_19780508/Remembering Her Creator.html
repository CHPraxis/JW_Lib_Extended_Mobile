<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">AT THE Papiamento assembly in Curaçao a very interesting experience was related in connection with a young witness of Jehovah speaking up for the truth at school. Her teacher told the class in great detail how man developed by means of evolution. When he had finished, the young Witness spoke up and said that she did not believe in evolution but did believe in creation as explained in the Bible. The teacher became angry and said that he was not teaching the Bible. After quite some discussion on the subject, he told her that the next week he would give her an hour to stand before the class and explain her point of view about evolution.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">So from the Bible and the book <em>Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation?, </em>the young girl prepared well and was able to defend the truth before the whole class and the teacher for an hour. She began talking in Dutch, but the teacher said that, since some of the students did not understand Dutch very well, she should talk in Papiamento, which she did. In the end the teacher marveled at her presentation and her courage and he asked the other students which one of them thought that he could stand before the class and defend his faith like that. Several of the students asked for more information on the subject, and the teacher asked for a copy of the <em>Evolution </em>book. It was an honor to Jehovah that this young student could defend the truth so well at school.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:15</a>.</p>

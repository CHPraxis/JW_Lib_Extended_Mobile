<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The food Supply</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">F</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">EW questions are of greater human interest just now than that of food. Everybody must eat to live, and all are interested to ’ know whether there is food enough in tlie world to feed its millions, and if there is how those that need it can get it</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">As a whole the American crops are excellent; and in the matter of live stock we have now 4,609,000 more swine, 350,000 more milch cows i and 287,000 more of other cattle than we had a ■ year ago. Australia has a vast surplus of food;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• and the crops in Canada, South Africa, Argentina and in many parts.of Europe were all of generous proportions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great American hen continues to do her</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I.</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> duty. Last year she produced, it is calculated, k &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23,052,000,000 eggs. That looks like a lot of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eggs; but it amounts to only 210 eggs per year,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or a little more than one every other day, for every </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ma-n</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">, women and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ch</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ild in the United.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;States. Probably the poultry raisers ate some</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eggs which have not been counted. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">»• It requires a great quantity of food to supply t 110,000,000 people for a year. A little while ago the Government disposed of what many people, thought was a large surplus of food, accumulated for the army; but somebody got to figuring on the total and estimated that the whole lot ’ did not amount altogether to a day’s supply per [ household. The Government bought this meat at wholesale and sold it at the same prices, in some instances for 50 per cent less than the j current prices charged by dealers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">' There is one article that is short, however, and ■ that is salmon. The salmon catch, all the way T?.'' from Behring Sea to the mouth of the Columbia</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Biver, is the poorest in the history of the fishing business. In the great Fraser River, of British, Columbia, the salmon pack this year was only 7,000 cases as compared with 155,700 cases iri 1915. The Canadian Fish Commission believes . that the salmon business has been ruined by a too efficient system of traps and seines in the Puget Sound region; that the fish have been . caught before they could get to their spawning grounds, and therefore reproduction has ceased. ' If this is true it is a pity; for salmon is a staple . article of food that will be missed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Chemicalized Foods</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> GOOD many of the plants that were former-■tA. ly engaged in the manufacture of alcoholic <sup>7 </sup>liquors are now being turned into “food fac* tories”, and we do not know whether to view, this with pleasure or with alarm. It alldepends upon what the chemists connected with these plants intend to do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">If they are planning further assaults upon the life insurance company’s mortality experience — tables by fixing up doctored frankfurters, cakes ’ colored with egg-yellow made. from coal tardyes, bleached fruits, processed rancid oils, cream scoured with soda ash, corned beef and <sup>1</sup> ’ smoked ham redolent with chlorine, ice cream ' colored with ribbon dyes and pies made of re- -juvenated decayed fruits, we can tell them now -that there is plenty of this kind of material on — the market and we can get along better without these things than with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Just recently we discovered that the Horse -Aid Society has a connection with a Brooklyn sausage factory,possibly the same plant, or one. of the plants, in which some 60,000 diseased</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">:attle were formerly turned into sausage annually, until the proprietors of the works were sent to the penitentiary. Now these diseased cattle are diverted; we do not know just what do&lt; s become of them. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">1 f the chemists would turn their attention to the needs of the h</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">uman</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> system they would do a great service to humanity. As an indication of possibilities along this line we note the f</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">amili</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ar fact that the human body contains some sixteen or seventeen elements; that the soil contains the same elements; and that the grain which grows on the soil contains the same elements. Yet when we make our grain into white flour we take for human use the least nutritious portion of the grain, containing only a few of the elements, and give to the cattle the outside of the grain, the most nutritious and valuable parts, and the only ones that contain the minerals needed by the system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Wiley, the food expert, recently told the House Co</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mmi</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ttee on Agriculture that it is due to the use of white wheat bread that at the *ut break of the war only sixty per cent of our . jd ng men were found to be in proper condition for military service. The human system is not properly nourished by white bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">. Milk as a Food</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE chemists or somebody else have been working away at the milk question, and 'have discovered a method for condensing buttermilk and reducing it to a semi-solid condition where it gives promise of being of great utility in baking. It is said that this solid milk can be added to bread, producing a more healthful ^oaf, and one which takes a delicious brown at a comparatively low baking temperature. This lower temperature allows the retention of a larger amount of moisture.in the loaf. It looks as though this discovery might be one of considerable value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Fo • some tine a means has been used for</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">converting fres'” milk into a dry powder which ’ can be shipped anywhere and eighty per cent ■ &quot;&nbsp;of the freight saved. This powder may be kept '. for weeks, Or even for months, and with proper i precaution can be remade into fresh sweet </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">milk </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">. J at the end of that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Milk is ideal as a food because it has all five I ui the elements necessary to human life and ! growth, ‘fats, nitrogenous substances, sugar, minerals and vitamins or growth-factors. No other food can take the place of milk for the human infant. Without its vitamins the growth is stunted, as is now so unhappily the case with the million or more of European babies that have never tasted </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">milk</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">; and there is an eSect upon the eye, called dryeye, which shows the hunger of the child’s system for just what the milk provides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Because it is pertinent to our subject, and because it is important, we mention here that where infants of under eighteen months cannot be nursed, the best available substitute for the . mother’s milk is to be had by letting good fresh cow’s milk stand until the richer portion has all . risen to the top. To this top milk add an equal volume of pure water, and to the mixture add one ounce of sugar of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">milk</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> to each quart of mixture. After the child reaches eighteen months this preparation may gradually give way to ordinary cow’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Distribution of Food &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS easy enough to criticize our present methods of distribution, but we ought to criticize them and keep on criticizing them until we do something definite to improve a plan whereby it costs from two to ten times as much to deliver foodstuffs to the consumer as it does to produce the food itself—a plan which has increased in “efficiency” until now every sixteen people in the country support a distributor, as against thirty-one people in 1870. Gambling in the stock markets has something to do with this inefficiency; and Congress ought to make it illegal for these gamblers’ quotations to pass through the mails or over the wires. In one day there is more wheat sold in Chicago than comes into Chicago in an entire year; and every time it is sold there is a tax, however slight, laid on every table in the land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Another item which enters into distribution ’ costs and the welfare of the people is the storage of food. In August, a representative of Swift and Company informed a Congressional investigation committee that the total supply of dressed meats ready for the market on June -first was sufficient to last for only ten days. But if that was the truth on June first, and if the newspapers tell the truth, which is equally uncertain, then it was not true three months later; for at that time, and with men, women and children suffering for lack of food, it was estimated that there was $2,000,000,000 worth of food stored in New York City, not altogether in the licensed warehouses, but much of it in brewery lofts and other unlicensed places.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">suddenly drop the prices so that on arrival at the charge that they had been held over three destination the shipper receives far less than</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">months with the object of increasing the price, the stock quotations had led </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> to expect The ten million eggs were seized in Detroit, and financial power of these packers is so great that there were like seizures in Buffalo and else- no competitor can hope to succeed if they use where. At that time the charge was also made their power to break down his credit that warehousemen were storing food in one</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">city as long as the law permits, and then moving </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Oddities in Food</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">it to another<sup>-</sup>city and re-entering it to storage FT1HE widespread use of the automobile has without keeping any record of the time when <sup>-</sup> -1- so reduced the demand for horses, and the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">At that time, when the Government began to get after the hoarders and profiteers in human necessities, millions of dollars worth of foodstuffs were seized in a St. Louis warehouse on it was first stored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Because of their power, the five great packers, Swift, Armour, Wilson, Morris and Cudahy, upon whom the nation specially leaned in war time to supply food to the army, are now the special objects of suspicion in the matter-of profiteering. These five packers own ninety per cent of all the refrigerator cars in the country. In 1916 they slaughtered eighty-two per cent of all the cattle, handled half the poultry, eggs and cheese, and are rapidly gaining control of all foods for man and beast. They are also making large inroads into the marketing of building material and fuel commodities.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the f- 1 in that same year he became in this has done a good work. In times of high</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">These five packers have gained control of 762 other companies. They now manufacture or deal in 775 commodities and dominate the food supply of the world. The recent boost in shoe prices is traceable to them in this way: Controlling the hide supply they took excessive profits and passed the increase on to the manufacturer, who added something more for himself, and the wholesaler and retailer followed the same course. These packers quickly dominate any field thev enter. In 1917 Armour first undertook the greatest rice merchant in the world, his sales amounting to more than 16,000,000 pounds. Immediately, the wholesale price of rice increased eighty-five per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The big packers control the stockyards to which the nation’s meat supply is shipped, control the commission men who are the producers’ only representatives at the yards, discriminate against independent packers who would use the yards, prevent new packers from getting into business, and restrict the meat supply of the nation by so manipulating the livestock prices as to discourage the producers. A favorite way to do this is to boost the market until an </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ense quantity-of stock is known to be on cars on the way to the yards, and then to growers find them so unprofitable, that the Government has sanctioned the sale of horse meat, with a view to killing off the surplus supply. It also hopes to add to the leather supply by this means. All horse meat or horse meat products must be labelled as such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The New York State Department of Farms and Markets has issued an appeal to the people of New York City to learn to eat rabbits, calling attention to the fact that at prevailing meat prices rabbits are cheap and wholesome food, and are considered a great -delicacy in many parts of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The United States Department of Agriculture has been setting forth the virtues and advantages of the goat. The goat will eat anything, stay anywhere and submit to any kind of treatment. In return it gives a rich, creamy milk that is especially good for babies and can be made up into seventeen different kirfds of cheese. Roasted kid is considered to be one of the most delectable of meats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In the foregoing, the Government has made efforts to assist the common people in providing a meat supply at prices within their means, and prices for meats we might remember the conditions in the siege of Samaria when “an ass’s head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver’*. (2 Kings 6:25) and the terrible conditions which prevailed then and at the time of the siege of Jerusalem in A. D. 70, when women even ate their own children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It is a comfort to know that these conditions of scarcity are all temporary and will give way to a better time when there will be plenty for alL</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Fear not, O land; be glad arid rejoice:Jfor the Lord will do great things* Be not afraid [of food shortage],-ye beasts of the field: for the</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Benefiting the Cripples</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">BOUT 200,000 </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">erican soldiers received such wounds during the World War that they are more or less .disabled and require special training to fit them for the future. Human nature is very forgetful of what it owes to its benefactors; and these soldiers, who might find many ready to help them today, would not find as many two years from now. Further, it can not be long, in the nature of things, before they will be expected to compete with those who are uninjured, and when they do, it is necessary that they be specially fortified by training if they would hold their positions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Government is undertaking the training of all disabled soldiers; and experience has shown that there is hardly any trade or profession that they can not master under the personal and kindly care of their teachers, provided they have the will to do so. Their compensation,. when fitted for the new work, is usually superior to that before they entered the service. While learning they are given compensation of not less than $75 per month if they live alone, and $30 for wife and $10 for each dependent child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">During the Golden Age there will be some very wonderftri healings of cripples. We read, “Then shall tfie lame man leap as an hart”. (Isaiah 35:6) We had some wonderful examples of God’s power to heal during our Lord’s ministry, and also during the days of the apostles. How thrilling must have been the scene, shadowing forth the coming glory of the V?fsianic age, now “dawning, when Peter said to the man from his mother’s womb, “Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have I give thee: In the name of Jesus <sub>t</sub>Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. And he took hiiri by the right hand and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength. And he leaping up stood arid walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping, and praising God”. (Acts 3:6-8) Immediately following this wonderful exhibition of God’s power comes St Peter’s still more</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">wonderful sermon on the Times of Restitution (Acts 3:19- 21) as a result of which thousands of Jews were converted to the Christian faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">NE OF the oil fields of the .Pacific Coast, lying within a few miles of Los Angeles, extends out into the Pacific Ocean, and a con- • siderable number of oil wells are located at £ some distance from the shore. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In England, the workings of the Cumberland <sup>1 </sup>coal field run two miles out under the sea. The ventilation of these mines is a nice engineering problem, but is successfully accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">At Workington, England,’in the year 1837, before the science of surveying was as highly developed as at present, the sea burst through and the workers were drowned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Many of the oldest mines of England, long </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ago</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> worked out and abandoned, have filled with water in the lapse of time, and constitute an ever present danger to the miners in adjacent mines, who may be drowned at any moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Coffee Shortage</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS would look nice for a headline, would it . not, in a day when we are fed with news regularly that first this item of food and then that item is not to be had at the old price because the supply is so limited f '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The facts are that there probably never was a time in the world when there was as much coffee in sight as there is at this moment About half of the coffee-users of the world have been_ without coffee for five years, and during that time the production has been the same as ever. The green coffee beans keep indefinitely, and ' get better, as they grow older. * . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Maybe somebody can tell us, atop this information, why coffee that can be bought wholesale ‘ in Brazil for 12|c should sell here at retail for . 75c, but it is hard for us to understand. It looks to us as though the system of distribution is . too well organized, so well organized that the common people have not even a “look in” un- . less they can arrange for cooperative buying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Well! Anyway! The Golden Age comes along, not all at once, but gradually. Given the . &nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">necessities of life in abundance, and statesmen ' who have a real and abiding interest in people, it will not be long before such a condition as . this will be corrected. ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The New Millionaires</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE new millionaires, created by the bloodmoney of war profits, have distinguished themselves by a display of foolishness, during the year 1919, unexampled hitherto in the ■ history of the United States, or in any other country, so far as we can judge, with the possible exception of the Boman Empire in the ' period just before its fall. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">' In the matter of personal adornment, nothing has been too rare of too costly to suit the taste of the newly rich. Dealers in gems have found it almost impossible to import sufficient quantities to keep their customers supplied, and the gems sold have been of the very highest quality. The dealers report that whereas they have two rush seasons, Easter and Christmas, this year it has been Christmas in every day of every month. This is an unhealthy state of affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">During the summer season, the most expensive hotels in all parts of the country, with rates ranging from $7 to $25 per day, were unable to care for their guests, and resorted to the construction of automobile camps to'provide shelter for those who could not be accommodated with rooms indoors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">At Saratoga, where a club seat at the ring side is $8.80, and the cheapest admission is $1.10, the grounds were packed as never before, tho gate receipts ranging from $65,000 to $100,000 per day and the daily bets at the track running as high as $2,000,000. In the great cities, bookmakers toured the sky-scrapers and placed other millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The gambling at Saratoga was not confined to horse-racing; but at the card table hundreds . of thousands of dollars were repeatedly pivoted ':rin the turn of a card. A similar mania is reported from France, where fortunes are won and lost in. a single play. It is supposed that part of this high-strung nervous tension in America and in France is due to the suppression 'of - the liquor traffic in this country and the cocaine traffic in France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The women of France and England arc reported to have lost much of their womanly modesty during the year, and perhaps the same is true to some extent in this country. In France and England the dresses are alleged to be nearing the vanishing point, and if they get much worse in this country than they- were at some of the bathing resorts, we can adopt the Japanese style of separating the men and women bathers by a line, and paying no further attention to such little items as dress. At one American resort over 500 girls were detained by the police, and word sent to their mothers to bring their daughters sufficient underclothing so that they could go home in decency, or the clothing would be supplied by the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">At the most expensive restaurant in New York, where two tablespoons of coffee cost fifty cents, the most beautiful and elaborately dressed women of the age stand in line waiting for an opportunity to obtain seats. The houses in which some of these people live have cost fabulous sums. One is alleged to have cost $5,000,000. One man used 200 tons of coal to heat Iris house during last year’s coal famine. A woman expended $60,000 for an opera cloak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Every one is willing to criticize these millionaires, but in some cases we fear the judgment is too severe. We therefore urge that our readers do not tliink too uncharitably of them. Remember that they as well as the poor are in some respects under the control of the present social system. Custom has fixed laws and barricades around their heads and hearts. False conceptions of Christianity, endorsed by the whole world, rich and poor, for centuries, have worn deeply the grooves of thought and reason in -which their minds travel to and fro. They feel that they must do as other men do; that is, they must use their time and talents to their best ability and on “business principles”. Doing this, the money rolls in on them, because money and machinery are creators of wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus they no doubt reason that having the wealth it is their duty not to hoard it all, but to spend some of it They perhaps question whether it would be better to dispense it as charity or to let it circulate through the avenues of trade,, and wages for labor. Under present wrong conditions, therefore, it is extremely fortupate for the middle and poorest dasses that the wealthy are “foolishly'extravagant”, rather thhn miserly, spending lavishly a portion</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of the flood of wealth rolling into their coffers— for diamonds, for instance, which require “dig-&lt; ging”, polishing and mounting and thus give employment to thousands who -would only add to the number out of work if the wealthy had no foibles or extravagances, but. hoarded all the money they could get.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In making these suggestions for the measure of consolation they may afford to the poorer classes, we would not be understood as in any sense justifying the selfish extravagance of the rich, which is wrong, and which the Lord condemns as wrong. (James 5:5) Can we wonder that many are envious, and some angry and embittered, when they contrast the wastefulness of the newly rich with their own family’s penury, or at least enforced economy, While we wait until the Lord shall vindicate their cause, we cannot wonder that such matters awaken in the hearts of many of the common people feelings of envy, hatred, malice and strife such as we see occasionally manifesting themselves in . the current news of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conditions of Newsboys</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">N INVESTIGATION of the industry of street marketing of newspapers in the principal cities revealed interesting facts about the newsboys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• In Cincinnati, for example, there arc 2,800 t newsboys, or 12% of the boys of the city </span><span class="font1">i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">between ten and sixteen. The boys are not</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;orphans; for 81.2% have both parents living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">They are not from very poor families; 90% of the poor families in which there are newsboys receive no charitable assistance. . The f Jews are 6% of Cincinnati’s population, but furnish 29% of the newsboys, shoving that the trading instinct is a strong factor in turning boys to the occupation. About 87% are native born. The native born are 90% in Seattle, .80% in Baltimore and 70% in Boston.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The daily earnings of, newsboys average twenty cents in Cincinnati, twenty-two cents in Baltimore and twenty-eight cents in Chicago. Jn England and Wales the earnings of 45,000 street traders are 12A cents a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Many newsboys are in constant touch with degrading or criminal surroundings. According to Maurice B. Hexter, Superintendent of the United Jewish Charities, who made the Cincinnati investigation, the boys on two papers were dealing with twenty-three supply men, of whom thirteen were colored men with extensive criminal records. In some cases the boys have to bribe these men to obtain their quota of papers. “No wonder,” says the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Journal of Education, . </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">‘flying, cheating and gambling flourish”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Human Longevity</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">NLY a little while ago we learned from the “experience tables” that the average of human life has gradually increased from 33 C, to 35 years. How is it that it is now said to be shortening? The answer is that it is shortening for those who have reached 55 or more years of age, while it is greatly lengthened for.many who would have died in infancy but for the superior care infants now receive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Between 1900 and 1910, in nine American States, the average death' rate for all persons under 35 years of age decreased 15%. For persons between 15 and 20 years of age this decrease was as great as 19%. Between 35 and 45 years of age the decrease in the death rate wafe 7%. Between&quot;45 and 55 years of age it was 2%. But over 55 years of age the death rate </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">increased</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> 9%. The causes assigned for this increase are chiefly diseases of the heart, kidneys, circulatory system and apoplexy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">These diseases of maturity, or “degenerative diseases”, as the physicians call them, show what we all know to be a fact; namely, that we are living too fast. A French surgeon believes that he has discovered a method to prevent all these diseases of old age. It consists in grafting the interstitial gland from a young animal to an old animal, causing the latter to take on youth and vigor. His first experiments were i with 120 animals, in each case with success. His next experiment was with a man over 80 years of age, upon .whom he grafted a gland taken from a monkey. The result was that in a short time the man was restored to the health, ' . vigor and mental alertness of a man of 30 years. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The time is at the door when the life of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">humanity shall be returned to its youth, but our understanding is that the restoration will ' be done by Christ; for the gift of God, eternal • life, can come only through him. (Romans G: 23) Nevertheless, the French experiments are interesting. They are adding to our fund of human knowledge and at any rate enable us to see how<sup>7 </sup>easy it will be for the Lord to perpetuate human i life indefinitely when, in due time, his kingdom shall be established in the earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark17"></a>MANUFACTURING AND MINING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Chilean Nitrates ' b</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>v</sub> t. a. h. ciarke </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">CHILI’S nitrate of soda deposits were discovered by'Indians about n hundred years ago. In building a fire they noticed that the ground took fire in various directions. Fearing that this was the work of evil spirits they took' specimens to the priest, who analyzed it and piled the unused portions in his garden. The next spring there was wonderful vegetation in the spot where the nitrate had been piled. Curiously enough, nothing grows on the nitrate beds themselves; but when nitrate is mixed with soil the results are marvelous. Experiments have shown that on soil where nitrate of soda was used the productivity lacked only about twenty per cent of being double what it was without the nitrate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The only nitrate deposits capable of being worked commercially exist in Chili, and constitute Chili’s most important article of export. Fish skeletons have been found in these nitrate deposits, and it is supposed therefore? </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">tha</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">t at some time the deposits constituted the ocean’s bed and were formed by decay of its fishes and seaweeds. The deposits are now found at eleva^ tions of 2,000 to 6,000 feet above the sea, to which they have been raised by the earthquakes that are characteristic of the region. The grounds are largely owned by the Government and are auctioned off from time to timp-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The rock in which the nitrate deposits are found is generally white, but may be yellow, gray or violet It is salty to the taste and soluble in water. The nitrate pampas are in the midst of rainless deserts. The caliche (nitrate rock) is broken up by explosives, transported by rail to rock crushers, boiled, refined, crystallized, dried and packed in 2001b. bags fur shipuj -oi. Iodine and table salt are byproducts eTihe process of manufacture. The standard nitrate used for fertilizing purposes is ninety-five per cent pure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It is estimated that 50,000 men are employed in the 167 plants engaged in the production of commercial nitrates, and that three per cent of the available deposits are being worked. During the war Chili experienced a great boom, on account of the immense quantities of nitrate used in the manufacture of munitions. The nitrate has to be lightered out to vessels often to a distance of several miles; but great efficiency in this work enables the loading of as high as.250 tons per hour, in spite of the heavy swells frequently experienced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Surely God’s ways are not man’s ways. &quot;Wliat a strange thing that, out of these desert wastes, should come something which is causing hundreds of thousands of acres of land in the United States, and elsewhere, to yield almost double their usual crops. The Lord has available all the materials wherewith to turn this earth into a Paradise again as soon as the dock of the ages has struck the time that suits his plan and purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Oil From Coal</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">MPERILED economically by the hard peace conditions, Germany is impelled to thrifty employment of her resources. A resource lacking in the German Republic is petroleum, and the Germans are establishing vast factories to convert coal into petroleum and coke. The coke will contain most of the energy from the coal, and the petroleum will be a dear addition to the national resources. According to the daims of Prince Loewenstein, a prominent chemist and manufacturer, 13$ % of the coal can be taken out and the remaining “cokelike” substance burned with only 2% loss of efficiency. The 13|% will comprise 10% crude petroleum, 1J% benzine and 2% heavy oil. The government plans to build huge plants for the process, and to utilize the “coke” in the national railroads, which hitherto have used annually about 12,000,000 tons of coal. The processing of the coal will give 18,000 tons of benzine; 24,000 -tons of heavy oil and 120,000 tons of crude petroleum for use in the nation’s industries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The distillation of coal of shale for oil is not new. A process was patented in England in 1850 and another in this country in 1854. By 1859 over sixty plants were working the American oil shales and supplying the newly invented &quot;kerosene”, to take the place of the whale and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">animal</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> oils and candles hitherto used for lighting. Up to 1860 the shale-oil industry prospered, but the discovery of petroleum in liquid form brought an end to the business.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">T N A manufacturing plant no factor is as • important as the contribution of the workers, lie ability and willingness of the worker to turn out all the work possible is all-important, j nd has been a prime mover in the efficiency I nd profitableness of manufacturing industries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">War conditions have had an interesting effect l^pon the working branch of manufacturing, iccording to a large Philadelphia manufacturer un investigation shows that the product per man per hour under identical conditions today I nd before the war is one-third less now than I 'hen. This is notwithstanding' an increase of 100% in wages. In an investigation covering * everal states the wage per man per hour had I ncreased 240% while the product per hour had decreased 62%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">। Of course, the reliability of such figures is bject to investigation as to motives that might vuntrol the investigators. What the average business man finds is liable to be what he wants</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I o find. Figures can often be &quot;adjusted” to tell I ilmost any story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">But if the figures are to be relied upon, the mtcome of easier working will result in a smaller sTolume of goods produced, less goods per capita, and higher prices for the goods that are produced. There is no question that if every worker □reduced twiefe as much there would be twice as much available for distribution among the workers, whether by the current wage system 6r under any other regime. The only way to ^pell plenty is w-o-r-k.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Perhaps some of the let-up in work is owing *o justifiable causes. Somtimes in the past the vorkers have been worked too hard, in which case ought uork less strenuously; for a workers health and well-being are of untold more importance than the product of his labor. Knowing the tendency of employers in the far and the recent past to drive labor beyond mdurance, persons of broad view are glad to-see any improvement in working conditions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Economists divide human activities into production, distribution, and consumption. Of the industries here listed, those devoted to distribution amount to 44.5%, and those devoted to production are 55.5%, showing a substantial equality between the two. If farming, commerce and finance were added, the figures would be somewhat different. <sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It is noteworthy that the one industry that has been a drag on the others—beverages— with a billion dollars investment, has been wiped out by national prohibition. It is the only one, except tobacco, whose destruction could not cause some serious consequences. It is gone, and is a good riddance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The industries of today, with an American population of a hundred million, are nothing to those of the incoming Golden Age when the billion and a half world population will in a few hundred years rise to over twenty billion. Of this incomprehensible number over a billion should be domiciled in the United States, and the industries of the country should be ten or twenty times what they are now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The contrast between those now having control of these vital and indispensable interests is suggested by two Biblical expressions: now, &quot;the workers of iniquity flourish” (Psalm 92:' 7); then, &quot;in his days shall the righteous flourish”.—Psalm 72 :,7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Short-Line Railroading</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">G</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">eorge M. BRINSON had put some $700,000 of his own money into an 88-mile railroad running out of Savannah,. Georgia. The line ran through farm and timber lands and touched no other large city. He was making the road begin to show a fair return. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It was a typical, local, rural enterprise. Mr. Brinson lyas president, general manager, and pretty much all the officers. He could pay his workers better wages than they had earned on farms or in the timber. They gladly worked hard for him, because he was a good boss. In Un emergency the shop men would put on extra Steam to get the rolling stock ready for renewed service. Others willingly worked the same way, and regarded themselves much better off than they had been. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The road-bed was not yet seasoned, and before putting good, substantial, new locomotives on the line, Mr. Brinson bought five old &quot;rattletrap* locomotives, to take the brunt of the rough service and rack themselves to pieces. The line had some cars of its own, but not enough for Uie traffic; and it borrowed the needed extra rolling stock from the big lines, which were getting new business from the Midland and glad to accomodate a new &quot;feeder*.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Brinson has appeared and testified before the House Committee on Interstate Commerce. The road had been in operation only a few years before the American-German war. Now he cannot get a shop-man to help out by speeding up when a locomotive is out of repair and is urgently needed to handle traffic. The big lines nd longer loan him their cars. The local labor receives the same wages as the Government pays everywhere. He cannot make the old deale, to induce traffic to move over his line, even if he could get the cats to carry it</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The total investment in the road is about $1,200,000, including $360,000* of bonds. Mr. Brinson says the bonds are in default as to interest payments; but the bondholders, being local people, have not foreclosed. He states that he cannot possibly, operate the road to dear expenses, to say nothing of paying interest on the bonds. The value of his $700,000 in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">stock has been largely wiped out; and there -seems not the slightest chance of ever declaring , &nbsp;&nbsp;' ; C</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">dividends on the investment</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Things look blue, if not black, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">lot</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Midland. And it is typical </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> the little roads which . ' have signed the short-line contracts governing conditions of operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Brinson's type. He is the kind of man that <sup>5</sup>. throws railroads into new stretches of country, . and opens up and develops them. The railroad development of the land is in the hands of the Brinsons, the executive heads of the hundreds ! of short-line feeders for the big systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">How much does Mr. Brinson feel like building another short-line road, like the others he has ■ built and successfully managed up to a paying position, before he sold them to others 1 What . &nbsp;&nbsp;]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is to become of the necessary expansion of the * country’s roads!

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">B. EDITOR: In your issue of October 1st, 1919, page 6, second column, you make a statement which has been called in question, viz., “Every year out railroads carry 650 tons for every man, woman, and child in the land&quot;. I would like to ask whether this can be a misprint or a misstatement If that means each man, woman, and child, and there are five in the ' average family, it would mean 3,250* tons tp be loaded find unloaded for each family, and it would look as if Dad would hav6 to hustle lively in moving freight, in addition to earning a living.—E M., Los Angeles, Calif., Oct 25,1916.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Just the kind of shot we might have expected i from A country where the climate is so perfect that houses are a nuisance, clothing is a burden and the food question is a joke I E. M. ought to</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">live up in the frozen North through one or two of our January and February water-pipe festivities, and “heft” our imitation marble slabs, our limestone-laden flour, our <sup>,r</sup>bony”-laden hard coal, our “loaded” fabrics; and then he would know why we have to have things up in this country in the winter time in order to keep alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Suppose now, E. M., that we were to get a box of oranges from the paradise where you live. It comes right through 3,127 miles to New York. To start with, let us suppose it weighed 60 lbs. Statistically speaking, when that box of oranges reaches our front steps it will weigh just 93.81 tons. You just send the box right along and see how bravely Dad runs out and lugs that 93.81 tons up the steps, and watch the smiles on the faces of the kiddies when he does so. Railroad tonnage is figured in ton-miles. 650 tons for each person means 650 tons carried one mile. But most of our things are carried many miles, and this runs up the tonnage. A ton of Scranton coal in Los Angeles would weigh, theoretically, over 3,000 tons. But, pshaw, what is the use of our sending coal to Los Angeles? They would not know what it was when they saw ft.</span></p>

In 1917 the total rice movement from China and Japan to the United States was 33,486 tons; but in 1918 one </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">erican banking company alone, through one American ■ port, imported a quantity three times as great</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1694 a vessel bound for Liverpool from Madagascar was blown so far out of her course that die had to put in to Charleston, S. C., for repairs. While there the captain of the vessel gave a small package of rice to one Thomas Smith, to use as seed. It had been supposed previously that rice would qot grow in this country, but Smith grew enough rice the first year to almost feed the whole colony, and it has been a staple crop of the marsh lands of the southern states ever since. No doubt the Lord knew how suitable is the South for rice production; and it was his hand that guided the Madagascar vessel to these far shores, and laid the basis for a part of the great food supply that will be needed by the myriads of mankind that will fill the earth in the Golden Age-</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark26"></a>POLITICAL- DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Canadian Revolution</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">N</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">OBODY jieed be alarmed when we state that a revolution is in process in the great country to the north of us. It is a peaceful revolution, but none the less real The people seem bent on no longer entrusting their interests to either of the two old parties, but of having a housecleaning, from the ground up. The work of removing all the old political elements and placing new parties and new men in charge of the country's affairs is in full swing, and apparently nothing can stop it</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">During the war the Canadians came to feel more and more a just sense of their country’s importance in the affairs of the world, and at its conclusion demanded separate representation of Canada at the peace conference and the privilege of signing the treaty on their own account. In the treaty as drawn there is no distinction between Canada and other powers sipiatory to it. This determination of the Canadians to have something to say about how they will be governed in the future is now reflecting itself in the domestic politics of the provinces and dominion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Throughout the war Canada was governed by what the Canadians have called a Unionist Government; that is, a coalition of the so-called Conservative and Liberal parties, in which all differences were merged until the war should be won. Now the common people are raising such a clamor to be heard on their own account that the old line-up of the Conservatives and Liberals has been resumed, and for the delectation of the public the Liberal leaders have been telling the people what they think of their late bed-fellows. In a statement printed in the <sup>1</sup> public press they recently denounced the Government in these words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;We charge that the Government has failed io represent the people and has outlived its usefulness. No body of men has the right to usurp power and continue to rule without submitting its policy to the consideration of the people. The Government has failed to take the people info its confidence in framing its ' policy in the past, as also in formulating its policy for the future.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Canadian people as a whole seem to believe pretty much all that the Liberals have had to say about their late bed-fellows, but they go farther and believe that the Liberals themselves are as untrustworthy as the Conservatives. They claim that the whole arrangement by which the people have been governed by orders-in-council, by which liberty of thought has been terrorized through wholesale arrests, seizure of publications, and breaking-up of meetings of law-abiding, God-fearing people, through overworking the word “patriotism’s has been, to say the least, extra-legah</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Now the Canadians seem to have reached the conclusion that, for them, terrorism shall cease to terrorize. And who shall say that they, at least, have not shown some real common sense, and some </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> patriotism? Does true patriotism mean that one may never dare to have a different opinion from that held by the person or persons who, for the moment, have the reins of power ? Or does it mean if one is really patriotic, that he must wave his arms and throw his hat in the air, and shout </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">hims</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">elf black in the face, every </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">tim</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">e such person or persons </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">give</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> expression to a new. thought or to a contradiction of an old one?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The new determination of the Canadian people to be done with old party lines first came to light in a by-election held in St Catherines, Ontario, in February, 1919. The District had always been a Conservative stronghold. There a new party, the Labor party, entered the field. It had been unknown hitherto, and a candidate was secured with difficulty. But it came~very near winning the election, and its supporters </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">claim</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> that it did win the election if the votes had been honestly counted. It was a startling indication of the temper of the people, of their determination to have a real democracy instead of an autocracy posing as a democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">During the s</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">umm</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">er there was another expression of the popular dissatisfaction with the old Canadian parties in the troubles at Winnipeg. There were many things connected with the Winnipeg troubles that have never been cleared up, and it is not generally known on this side of the line, even to this day, that the majority of the Winnipeg strike leaders were British-born, and of proven loyalty to Canada and the Canadian people, right at the time when they were being widely accused as fomentors of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">. disturbances among foreigners* In the Fall the - Canadian people had their long-desired opportunity to give an expression at the polls of just how they felt about how things have been managed by the old parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">. In October came the elections for the legislature of Ontario, the most populous, most con-aervative province in the Dominion. Besides the new Labor party, the United Farmers of Ontario, another political party only two years old,<sub>x</sub>entered the field. These farmers are.abso-</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The result was a campaign that is described -as having taken on the nature of a religious revival. The women voters leaned more and more to the side of the two new democratic parties. Prominent men who entered the con-, test on the Government side swung to the side of the people during the fight. The outcome was a surprising victory of these two brand new parties over the two bld ones. The Conservatives, who had formerly held the control by a ' total of 80 out of 111 seats, Were dethroned, j hhd the coalition of the Labor and United »Farmer parties has 56 seats, a majority of pne over all the old party candidates and independents put together. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The people of Ontario went to Considerable</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">trouble to lay emphasis Upon their disapproval of the old parties.- A so-called labor-soldier candidate was defeated apparently for no other - status of women.</span></p>

In New Brunswick the United Farmers candidate was returned by a 3,000 majority over a returned Soldier/ In Ontario the Farmers* candidate had a majority of nearly 2,000 and in Saskatchewan of nearly 4,000 votes. This shows an awakened people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Farmers' platform includes lowering of tariffs oh goods imported from other countries, especially if imported from Great Britain; reciprocity with the United States; a tariff commission; taxation of unimproved land Values; fen Income tax ranging from 2% oti $2,000 to .50% on Inoothes of $100,000; Ihherit-ahce tai; indoihe tax on corporation profits; public ownership of public necessities; abolition ~ of titles; aboHtidn of the Canadian senate; national prohibition; referendum and recall; and complete equ</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">aliza</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">tion of the parliamentary</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS plain enough that if none of us ever did anything, or produced anything, we would all be naked, homeless and starved. Until we get to work and produce something there is not much to govern, unless it be to form a sort of mutual defense society to prevent the stronger from killing and eating the weaker. 60 the fundamental fact of government is work. &quot;If any would not work, neither should he eat.” (2 Thessalonians 3:10) We must not get the idea that any kind of government mon can devise will make it unnecessary for him to work. And just now, when there is a shortage of almost everything that human beings need, due to the great waste of the war, the governments of the world are right in their conception that anything that will cause the people as a whole to produce more goods will be to the benefit of the people as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">This brings us to the question of how men can * be induced to produce more, so that there will be more to divide. The prevailing rule of thought in the past has been that the only thing that will induce the average man to put forth his best efforts is a desire to own and to hold things. And it must be admitted that there is a great deal of truth in this contention. A system which makes each 'man responsible for the care of his own wife and children will cause the average man to put forth more effort than where his work will be used for the benefit of the wives and children of others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Any man who has the idea that it would be better for the Government to own and operate all the industries of the country would do well to visit any public building in any city of the . United States and note the general shifUessness of the occupants, the dirt, disorder and indifference manifest on all sides, and then turn to any equally large building in the hands of a private concern and note the difference. The general atmosphere of the one is dirt and laziness, and of the other cleanliness and industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The average man looks upon a political job as an easy one; and while he has the job he is liable to expend most of his energies in trying to retain the job rather than in trying to render efficient service. But if he has a job with a private concern he knows that he must produce definite results,, and that if he does not do it he may lose his job. He sees other men about who are doing their best to help themselves up in the world; and his fear of what they may do to him and his family if he does not do the work expected of him leads him to put forth more effort than he might otherwise do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">So then there are some good things to be said about competition. But competition in many lines is an abosolute waste. Two telephone sys-terns or two street railways in the same community are a nuisance. Two telegraph companies render better service than one; but it is a great waste to the community as a whole to have to maintain two complete sets of offices, poles, wires and equipment Here is a legitimate field for Governmental activity—how to produce an absolutely reliable and efficient telegraph service, one equal to that provided Jby private owners, but at less expense to the public. The pubEc should pay less to the Government for such a service than to private owners because a Government ownership of telephone •poles and wires would enable the telegraph Unes to be operated in con junction with them at reduced cost. All the wires could be carried upon the one set of poles. Governmental telegraph service in European countries shows that this is a problem which, if placed in the right hands, can be handled efficiently by 'the Government, and at reduced costs to the pubEc. Besides, the Government has facilities, through the Post Office, for the dehvery of telegrams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Competition^ if it can be honestly maintained, should result in good service and low prices to the consumer. But </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">if</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> all the milk dealers, for example, gather together and agree on certain prices, competition ceases, and there is as true a monoply as though one concern did all the business. And there is the disadvantage that one concern could do all the work, and do it more efficiently and more economically than a dozen, all traversing the same streets, at the same time, with the same product. Which is better, to have a real monoply and not admit that it is such, or to admit that monoply is inescapable in such a business, and* endeavor to hold it in restraint by having the municipality itself engage in the business as a competitor 1 In numerous cities abroad </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> plan is followed with good results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Unrestrained competition is bad, too; for it leads to long hours, abominable shops and factories, adulteration of goods, false representations of merchandise, and the dishonest underselling of competitors with a view to ruining them. We must have the aid of a Government, national, state or municipal, to prevent the stronger from </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">killin</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">g the weaker by laws of their own making. Fortunately, at this stage of the game, the worker </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">self has something to say about it; and his protests against long hours, low wages and unsanitaiy working conditions all operate to the advantage of society as a whole. He would render a still further aid to humanity if he would blazon upon the housetops every act of adulteration of goods or misrepresentation of them that comes to his knowledge, even if he lost his job by doing it</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In that case the Government he has benofitted ought to aid him in securing employment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What is needed is a spring of human endeavor other than the law of selfishness, a new well of water, a law of Jove, a motive that has the interests of others more in view than one's own interests, which, however, should not be neglected. The present governments of earth are far better than none at all; and we all do well to think about their activities in constructive fashion, considering what they can reasonably do in the interests of the people as a whole without at the same time becoming intolerable nuisances by inefficiently and expensively doing what private enterprise can do better, and by attempting to decide for us just how we shall think on questions in which they are interested. The more the people expect the Government to do for them, the higher will be the taxes which must be extracted from the people in one form rr another. There is no escaping this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The thing that we all desire, whether we know it or not, is the establishment of Christ’s kingdom. “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” (Matthew 6: 10) Earth’s new King will know just what laws to put into effect, and just how to enforce them. He alone has the power to give such a government as will insure neither sickness, sorrow nor death to those who obey his just and righteous will. This is earth’s hope, and its only hope.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dehydrating Grape*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">EN tons of grapes in twenty-four hours is the record maintained by the first commercial dehydrating plant of the kind, located in Pomona, California. It is a saver of waste products; for forty-five per cent of the grapes treated would have been scrapped, because broken or otherwise injured by heavy rains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Country people are familiar with the old method of drying fruits, by exposing them, in trays, to sunlight, dust, flies, and germs. When drying attains the dignity of a manufacturing .process the old name is too commonplace and it becomes dehydration, which signifies the extraction of water, or plain &quot;drying'. Fruit of any kind may be dried by the new process, and stored indefinitely. When soaked with water, the dry cells swell up, and the fruit regains much of its original size and, according to the inventor, most of its flavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">If dehydration plants were scattered generally over the country and made as accessible to the fanner as a dairy, the over-production of any kind of fruit or vegetable could be turned from loss into profit; for the dried product might be stored until the close of the season for the fresh fruit or vegetable, and then be placed on the market, without fear of deterioration, to the advantage of farmer and consuzher and to the lowering of the cost of living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Dehydration plants make for easier work in the kitchen. If there were a'plant in a city the housewives, instead of going to the labor and expense of canning and preserving, could bring their , fruit to the plant and get it back dehydrated and in a form most convenient for preservation and use'. Doubtless many new recipes might be invented for sweetening or flavoring fruits before having them dehydrated, and hitherto unusual combinations of fruits and vegetables might be made by enterprising housewives. The existence of drying-plants in towns and cities will open up an entirely new field of enterprise and originality in home and store. Grocers would need have no fear of loss through spoiled fruit'and produce; foy anything approaching the danger line could be rushed to the dehydrating plant and.returned in its new form ready for sale immediately, or when the demand for dehydrated products would make the operation profitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Pomona grape-dehydrating plant, the grapes are placed in large trays with screen bottoms, and slipped into huge oven-like driers. Heat comes from large gas burners; and heated air is circulated over the grapes by a huge fan, which sends it through a net work of chilled pipes, on which the moisture is condensed and drips away, the dried air returning for further duty. The repeated use of the air is one of tho secrets of the economy of the plant as compared with other plants where the air is discharged into a chimney.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It is largely the California wine grapes that are being dehydrated, in order to. meet the demand that will arise for the use of such grapes for the making of wine in the home, certain officials having ruled that wine may be made for home consumption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Savings in freight, crates, tin, sugar and decay are claimed for the new process. Immense losses can now be prevented in crops that ripen quickly, or that are damaged by rain, frost or heat, and great* advantages are predicted for housewives in country, town and city, wherever the dehydrated system obtains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Poor humanity needs the help that a general economy of food would furnish, for now by tens of thousands people in war-torn Europe are being “burnt with hunger”. (Deuteronomy 32: 24) With what unspeakable relief wilL-these distracted ones welcome the day when &quot;they shall not hunger nor thirst” (Isaiah 49:10), and &quot;they shall be no more taken away with hunger in the land” (Ezekiel 34:29); for with many such improvements as that outlined above will the Golden Age be blessed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Typhus a Pestilence Now</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">P</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">UTRID fever, ship, jail and camp fever are some of the names under which typhus fever has traveled in the past, and through which it has won an undesirable reputation. It is now raging with the proportions of a pestilence in the war belt from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. Physicians are unable to cope with it; and it is pronounced to be on far too extensive a scale for even the Red Cross to meet with hope of success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The disease is rare in the United States because it is a filth disease and the Americans are one of the cleanest people in the world. When it occurs it is usually among immigrants. It is rare in European centers of population; but in filth centers, such as certain cities of Ireland, Russia, Egypt, India and Mexico, it becomes epidemic. Its presence is both a misfortune and a disgrace, because due to overcrowding, bad ventilation, poor food, and bad habits, which, are the fruits of ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Typhus is like typhoid in some respects, but is easily recognized, quarantined, disinfected and controlled. It is communicated by contact, by the breath, by germs arising from the skin, and by the dust of the room. Under favorable conditions about ten per cent of the cases die, but in centers of filth and squalor the mortality is appalling. It begins like typhoid, but develops a dull red rash. Since the treatment consists mostly in combating the causes that give rise to tiie disease, it appears that it is not well understood by physicians, who have to let the disease run its course of fourteen to twenty-one days, without being able to assist nature materially though they mitigate the suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The prospects are that with the people of the war zone exhausted, poverty stricken, undernourished, and discouraged by the miseries of war, the dreaded pestilence may spread from its present zone of Lithuania, Esthonia, Poland, Ukrainia, Serbia and the Balkan states into Hungary and Austria. Only if prosperity can be restored in other nations of Europe can the typhus be prevented from extending itself all over the continent There is a shortage of food and medical supplies, and of soap with which to</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS very manifest that in antediluvian times the entire earth’s surface was of uniform temperature and moisture—that there were no extremes of heat and cold, wet and dry as now. This means that the entire earth was in a much more fruitful condition then than now. In one certain locality—the Garden of Eden—absolute perfection prevailed. In this place the beauties and grandeur of perfection were such as to stagger the efforts of the most active imagination. The uniform temperature and moisture conditions prior to the Flood resulted from “the waters above the firmament’-air-remaining in suspension as is observed in the case of the planet Saturn today. This canopy served as a kind of hot-house condition, preventing lowering of temperature. Hence, it rained not at all, but “there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">—Genesis 2: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">This*equable climate .and uniform moisture insured an abundance of the most varied tropical vegetation, as Well as animal life. As evidence of this fact note the finding underneath glacidl ice-drifts of bodies of tropical animals ih perfect state of preservation. An antelope was found thus recently with undigested' grass in its stomach. And more recently still, during the summer of 1919, specimens of fruits, such: as oranges, lemons, bananas, cocoanuts and many kinds of edible fruits now extinct, were found in a petrified state underneath an old avalanche at the base of White Mountain in Pennsylvania. Also the petrified remains of frcr?<sub>4</sub>lizRr'i« «nd horned toads were in evidence ju same locality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">. What does this prove! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Simply that there was once an abundance of tropical fauna and flora in the present state of Pennsylvania. Then what 'magical wand hath wrought to great a transformation from tropical to low temperature conditions! The answer is, The Flood of the Bible in Noah’s day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Let us now follow “the waters above the firmament”, and see them gradually collect, under the influence of earth’s centrifugal force, about the poles until the great pull of gravity</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">there causes these waters to be precipitated in great deluges upon the earth. With the breaking of this canopy the hot-house condition of the earth was released, and the waters froze as they fell and entrapped under mountains of snow and ice many unsuspecting forms of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It might b'e well for geologists who have tried in yain to ascertain the time and cause of the great Glacial Age of history to consider again, in the light of the canopy theory as above stated, the Scriptural narrative of the Flood. It is very manifest that during the earliest periods of earth’s'development only the lowest forms of life were in existence. This is accounted for in the light of the fact that the relative proportions of the various elements of ihe earth’s atmosphere were such as to sustain only those forms of life at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">With the passing of time through the several epochs in the creation of the earth both the temperature and the component elements of the air underwent great changes. As, for instance, in the Carboniferous Age, the surplus amount of carbon-dioxide of the air at that time supplied this necessary element to the rank forests with which the earth was covered, until a dimi* nution in the amount of carbon, by reason of its absorption, caused such rank growth to cease. Ou account of the absence of animal life at that time there was no way for nature to Maintain a balance of atmospheric conditions as now. This condition resulted in the death_of the vast forests of that age. But being highly impregnated with carbon these forests did not decay; for under such conditions, without sufficient oxygen, decay was impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">With ihe descent upon the earth of this carboniferous canopy and its simultaneous consumption in the vast forests of earth, there were laid the foundations of the great coal fields, which still exist 7hese subsequently by deluges and avalanches became submerged, resulting in their being mined from beneath the earth’s surface today. At the &quot;end of the age,” the air being filtered of its surplus amount of carbondioxide and charged, instead, with an increased amount of oxygen, the earth teemed with myriads of &quot;living creatures, fowls of the air, cattle, creeping things,” etc. ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">At the psychological moment, man, the crowning act of creation, steps forth from his plastic mold “a little lower than the angels”, but the highest of earthly creations. God had prepared for him a place; and Eden was his home. In Ibis home, as already stated, it was Adam's privilege to remain forever, provided he should keep inviolate the laws of his Creator. His descendants likewise would have been born with the same privileges. And with the gradual increase of his large family, now estimated at twenty billions, he would gradually, as necessity had demanded, have extended, by subduing the earth, the limitations of the Garden of Eden until it reached that condition of world-wide paradise.—Genesis 1:26-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">This plan of subduing the earth would have been much more easily accomplished than the one upon which man has been engaged since knowledge began to increase, because the “thorns and thistles” of the earth were little in evidence until after the Flood. Besides, Adam in the beginning virtually had control over the e arth, and it was only necessary at that time to . bring it into complete subjection. But Adam lost this near-perfection control, and with it, his perfect manhood. As a result both man and the earth began a gradual decline down to the time of the Flood. After this event rapid decay of inan was manifest; and the earth swarmed with the promisee “thorns and thistles”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It becomes necessary at this stage to consider again the relative component parts of the air, and its temperature, since these determine </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">wholly</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> the variety a profusion of life on earth, and the degree 01 their vitality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The comparative absence of nitrogen in the atmosphere prior to the Flood was due to the minimum amount of decay during that time. But with the wholesale destruction of plant and animal life at the time of the last deluge, and tl.p &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decay of same, the air became</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">saiuiai-’-’A with nitrogen—the result of this decay. This intrusion of nitrogen, a by-product, into the air had the effect of upsetting its former balanced state of equilibrium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">As proof of this statement note the beginning of shortening of human life immediately following. And, of course, as death and decay increased by reason of the continued shortening of life, the amount of nitrogen in the air also increased until at the present time seventyseven per cent of the volume of the atmosphere is said to be nitrogen! With this great amount of nitrogen intruding itself in the air the original elements of oxygen and carbon-dioxide , must of necessity be much diluted. And this is now understood as having -been the immediate cause of the shortening of life after the Flood. Kot only was the air thus diluted, but it was polluted—poisoned—by reason of such con- . lamination, becoming in a sense death-dealing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Lest some may hold with the old text-books on Chemistry that nitrogen is a component part £ of the air, it only becomes necessary here to call attention to the fact that this substance undergoes no change whatever in the process of respiration. Carefully conducted experiments show conclusively that in the process of animal respiration there is an appreciable decrease of oxygen and a corresponding increase of carbondioxide. But the amount of nitrogen in both pure (so-called) and impure air remains the same. Thus we see that nitrogen has been an intrusion hi the air; but before we have finished this discussion, we propose to show how even this temporary interference will, like the permission of evil, result finally in great benefit to humanity. In the first place it hastens the “dying” penalty<sup>7</sup>; and this within itself was a blessing to man during the supremacy of evil in the age just now passing away. In the absence of conversion to Christianity and genuine reformation of life, long exposure to evil influences renders any character more depraved. All have doubtless observed that little children ordinarily are more nearly immune from common vices than are adults. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Besides this, it now appears, during these days of “increase of knowledge” that the nitrogen, stored in the atmosphere, is yet to serve a most important economic purpose in contributing to the restoration of the earth's fertility. Of late years the agricultural scientist has discovered means of extracting this element from the air and of causing it to .enter the soil of earth, where it becomes available plant food. This is accomplished by growing certain plants called legumes—peas, beans, the various kinds -of clover, etc., which, by the process of osmosis, absorb nitrogen from the air and deposit it through root nodules into the soil, where it becomes amalgamated by a kind of microbe action with the soil, setting free certain important elements 'which are at once taken up by plants, thus stimulating their growth.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Nor is this all: It has been found that nitrogen can be very profitably used in tho manufacture of high explosives. This being true, the various governments have, during the recent war, had recourse to this almost inexhaustable supply of material, constructing immense cbem-ical plants for the purpose of extracting out of the .air this necessary element But with the signing of the armistice this output 4s now being turned into an entirely different channel, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">J3</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> that of manufacturing nitrogenous commercial ■ fertilizers. This will greatly aid the earth in yielding her &quot;increase”, as foretold, and will result in another blessing to man instead of an injury. How literally true is the statement that “God is able to make even the wrath of man to praise him”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">With the increase of the food products of the earth as- a direct result of rendering the soil more productive, will come a corresponding increase in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">quality</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> of such foods. This fact has already been demonstrated by carefully conducted experiments. Two pigs from the same litter were each segregated and given exactly the same attention as to water, food and general environment. In fact, all conditions were exactly the same in every respect as to the amount of food, and each given the same kind of food. The food in each case was corn in equal weight The only difference was the quality of the com; one lot of which was grown on soil producing only fifteen bushels per acre, while the other corn came from land producing sixty bushels per acre. The test extended over a period of ’ ninety days, simultaneously conducted. The pig fed on the better quality of com gained more than twice as much increase in weight as the other pig which consumed the -time number of pounds of food containii £ the inferior quality <sub>t</sub> of corn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. It seems pertinent to note in this connection</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that of all avenues of human activities, none are making greater progress tl In that of intensive farming. The goal of this particular line of activities will have been consummated when the entire earth is fully “subdued”, and caused to become exceedingly fruitful. If any one doubts that these things wall be accomplished it is but necessary to remind such an one that these things are already being accomplished today. Consider, for instance, the tomato which only a few years ago grew in its wild state, and about the size of an ordinary marble; today; by means of proper selection, breeding and cultivation its size is increased more than seventy times, not to speak of the great improvement in its lusciousness. From everywhere come easily verified reports of the development of the pecan from the originally wild needling which required twenty to forty years to begin bearing, to the modem paper-shell of eight to ten times its original size, and bearing profitably at five to eight years of age. These illustrations are taken from the achievements of the present average crop productions, and do not consider the marvelous achievements of .such men as Burbank and other specialists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Less than twenty years ago the average farmer was contenting himself with growing hut one crop per year,' and each successive crop was rapidly depleting his soil. Today he is growing two or more crops per season—at least one a legume—and at the same time is improving from year to year the fertility of his soil And tliis without using commercial fertilizers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Who that believes in God shall doubt his word or power f He has spoken and is able to perform the same. He has said, &quot;My Word shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish the thing whereunto I have sent it”. He declares that he will make the place of his footstool— the earth—glorious ; that &quot;Jehovah who created the earth formed it not in vain, but to be inhabited”—&quot;that even the desert places shall become like the ancient Garden of the Lord”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">There remains in this connection one other thought to be considered. We have already observed the descent and precipitation from time to time of deluges of various substances upon the earth, and the effects of these deluges upon all life at that time. According to scientists of the present day, “there is yet another deluge, consisting this time of electricity, approaching the earth. This within a few years will be precipitated upon the earth, and it is claimed will result in great benefit to humanity, because its contact with the earth will destroy injurious microbes, germs and parasites. This will cause fermentation to cease and thus produce the effect of preserving for an indefinite period of time all perishable fruits and vegetables. This will in a measure partially restore antediluvian conditions, and will produce the. effect of greatly alleviating human sufferings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Finally, as a concluding thought, it remains to be shown that the presence of nitrogen in the air is for the purpose of conserving another very important use. It is claimed in the Bible that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust. The Savior himself said; “Marvel not at this; for fell that are in their graves shall come forth” Now we take this to j/iean just what it says, that the dead shall return to life. But how is this to be accomplished!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Do we expect a return of their decayed bodies out of death ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">By no means. Wo understand and hold with the Bible that their bodies have become </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">non est </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">by reason of their “return to the dust whence they came”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">But do we expect them to return as human beings!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Yes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">With flesh and bone and sinew as of yore! Exactly so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Where will their bodies come from!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">God in whose memory they are held will provide for them necessary bodies just as he did that of the first man Adam. .</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Now we return to a consideration of nitrogen and its further use in the air. It is claimed by chemists that a considerable portion of the human body is nitrogen. Then in the resurrection of the twenty billions of the Adamic family now asleep in the tomb, much of this element being at hand, long held in suspension for this very purpose, will be consumed in providing, in the general resurrection, human nitrogen from the air. This will restore its former pristine purity as it was in the days before the Flood. Under such a condition of atmospheric purity, man, breathing the undiluted invigorating oxygen, would live approximately a thousand years. In addition the perfect fruits, resulting from increased fertility of the earth as above shown, will maintain the possibilities of everlasting life. And this is exactly what the Bible teaches, and exactly what humanity instinctively desires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">With a return of the billions of humanity from the tomb back to earth, and being surrounded by the superabundance of earth’s perfect fruits of that time, disease germs having been destroyed by the descent of the electrical canopy now so close as to come almost in contact at</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">times, this battle-scarred earth, drenched in J human gore, will in time become a veritable •’ &gt;&nbsp;Garden of Eden. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' J</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Paradise, lost through Adam’s transgression, will, through the merit of the Ransom, “to be | testified in due time”, be restored. Burning and \ ' 3 frozen deserts now defying the ingenuity of man, being subdued, will be transformed into , if dreamlands of beauty and glory. Supplanting the marshalling of the hosts of war, with their instruments of destruction and death, will be the busy hum of productive machinery and the inarch of industry applying the cumulated energy of inventive genius to the harnessing Of all the hitherto latent forces of nature, and bending these into complete subjection and use for the everlasting blessing of the entire human race. Then the billions of dollars now being applied to destructive purposes will be turned into constructive channels. “Swords shall be beaten into plowshares, and spears into pruning hooks.” No more uprising of '^nation against nation”—there will be but one nation, a holy nation. Nor will war be learned any more; for Jehovah “maketh wars to cease from the river to the ends of the earth”. Then will be realized, through' the everlasting ages of eternity, the true import of the message of the angels on the hills of Judea as they sang the song of <sup>&lt;f</sup>Peace on earth, good will among men”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Wit’^ this condition of perfection - of the material earth will come logically the perfection attain perfection in every respect. Then also — “the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth as deep as the ocean”. Then shall his • “glory be revealed and all flesh shall see it together”. Then shall humanity, no longer confused, “know the truth” and thereby become . “free”. With his reason thus restored the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">d ’ of man will again become superior to matter. Since the earth was made for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">man,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> not man for the earth, he will be able to order the ' ‘ seasons at will—even the “winds and the waves , will obey him”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Apostle Peter, our Lord and all the holy prophets since the world began, declare that the human rac^S is to be restored to glorious 4 perfection, and shall again have dominion over* . earth as its representative Adam had.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;On earth peace, goad will toward men’*—Luke</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> 5:14. CHRISTMAS is regarded by many people as the date of the birth of the ba1&gt;e Jesus in a manger at Bethlehem. Whether or not the date is correct is of small importance, but the event was and is of the greatest importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethlehem is situated on an elevation overlooking a deep ravine, beyond which are fields where shepherds graze their flocks. Beautiful for location is this historic spot, particularly attractive to one of poetic mind and deep reverential heart, and doubly so since the great events, recorded in Holy Writ, which there transpired nearly nineteen centuries ago. From the surrounding hills of Judea the shepherds had brought their sheep to the field opposite Bethlehem and corralled them there for the night. While the others slept, one or more of the shepherds kept vigil over the flocks, waiting for the dawn of day. The atmosphere of Judiea' is exceedingly rarified, and the stars shine forth with unusual beanty and brilliancy, and thus the glory of the night is enhanced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Without doubt these lowly herders of sheep were men of great reverence for God, men who trusted in his promises made to their father Abraham and hence were expecting the coming of Messiah. And for their faithfulness Jehovah rewarded them with a wonderful vision. While -these humble watchers were gazing into the starlit heavens and ineditatingupon the majesty and expressed wisdom of Jehovah, there suddenly appeared unto them a star of remarkable brilliancy, standing over against Bethlehem, t. ^called the city of David. Simultaneously ths .angel of the Lord, the heavenly messenger appeared unto them, and the light of the glory of the Lord shone round about them. Then the shepherds were sore afraid. What man of reverential mind would not have been awe-struck at such a marvelous manifestation!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">To calm their fears, the heavenly messenger sweetly said to these humble men of the fields; &quot;Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all pepple.' For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be, a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.” (Luke 2:10-12) Awed by this sision and thrilled with their environment, the shepherds in wonder and amazement stood speechless before the heavenly messenger. Then suddenly there appeared with this angel a whole multitude of the heavenly host, angels bright and fair; and in celebration of this marvelous event of the ages they joyfully sang together an anthem of praise to Jehovah, &quot;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Long centuries and the burdens of earthly cares have effaced or hidden this glorious vision from the minds of most men who call themselves Christians; and today these words announcing universal peace to those of worldly mind sound as but a hollow mockery. Nearly nineteen centuries have come and gone since that heavenly messenger announced the birth of Jesus and brought a message of good tidings; and after these long years of laborious effort on the part of some men to establish ideal conditions, with dismay they witness the whole yrorld rocked from center to circumference and all kindreds and peoples engaged in the strife of tongues, tumult, distress and war. Now the great mass of so-called Christendom is trusting in the god of force and violence rather than in -&gt;hc God of peace and love. Millions of earth’s habitants, including those who pose as teachers and preachers of the Gospel, have turned'IO infidelity, disregarding the Word of God, and advise, counsel and engage in strife and violence. Alas! their faith in God and in bis precious promises is gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">How different with those who truly love the Lord and who study to show themselves approved unto God! Their diligent and prayerful search to know the meaning of these events past and present the Lord has been pleased to reward with a clear vision; and now they are privileged to mark the majestic onward tread of Jehovah in the unfolding of his marvelous plan. And thus understanding, their hearts are filled with joy; and the sweet message of that i^avenly host resounds through the corridors of the age, calling attention.to the momentous</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">events that are transpiring and the even greater ones immediately to follow. Not only do they rejoice in their own hearts, but it is the privilege of such true followers of the Master with confidence to say to the bewildered and frightened of nominal Christendom: &quot;Behold, thy God reieneth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">And now we invite all sober-minded peoples of earth—Christian and infidek Jew and Gen-, tile, bond and free—to come with us while we together briefly review this beautiful Christmas story, and ascertain its meaning and significance . to the groaning people of all the nations of earth. Its message of comfort is intended for all; for the angel of the Lord said: “Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people*'. The time is now due for the world to begin to understand the real meaning of what occurred on that memorable morning in Bethlehem; and those who do understand and avail themselves of such knowledge will be greatly blessed and comforted in heart, mind and body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Why should'the habc Jesus be born at all! Why mark his birth with such ceremony and joyful expression by the heavenly host! The answer is the old, old story, which grows sweeter the oftener told; and never so sweet as now, because the time is here for its appreciation by man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Four thousand years before the staging of this drama in the hills of Judaea, Jehovah had created a perfect pair—Adam and Eve—-and provided them with a perfect home in Eden. He had endowed them with power and authority to bring forth children, to fill the earth and to control it and to make the entire earth as a garden, a glorious spot, a fit habitation for a happy and perfect race of people. To this first pair , the Lord granted the privilege of life everlasting in a state of human blessedness, conditioned, however, upon a faithful obedience to iiis law. The wife, deceived by Satan into a violation of the divine law, in turn induced her husband to take the step of disobedience wilfully rather than be separated from her. The result of this transgression was an infliction of the penalty of the law,, which penalty is described in the Genesis account (chapter 3) as a dying condition until death was fully accomplished, a return to the dust whence the Lord had taken the elements to make man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Having judicially determined that the perfect man should die because of his disobedience to the law, Jehovah chose, as a means of enforcing this judgment, to compel man to live outside of the perfect Eden and to feed upon the poisonous elements of the. earth until complete death * would ensue. Hence he drove the two out of Eden and set a flaming sword at the garden's entrance, lest Adam might return and partake of the tree of life. For 930 years Adam battled with the elements of the earth, daily succumbing, until at the end of that time he was death</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The. secret of all the suffering, sorrow, sickness &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and death of humankind from then until now lies in what occurred in Eden and following. • While in Eden the perfect man did not exercise his power to beget children; and lienee the perfect pair never brought forth children. I* was only after undergoing the legal sentence of death, and after they had imbibed the poisonous elements of earth's vegetation, that this pair cohabited arid children resulted. It is reasonable, therefore, to see that this condemnation fell upon the offspring; and that the father, now imperfect, could not beget a perfect child; hence the offspring of Adam would be an imperfect one. For tills -reason the Psalmist wrote: &quot;Behold, I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive.me”. (Psalm 51: 5) And for the same reason the inspired witness said, “As by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; so death passed [by inherit- ' ance] upon all men, for that all have sinned&quot;. (Bomans 5:12) The ultimate result of the operation of the divine law of necessity would have meant the complete extinction of the human race. Today, instead of men living 930 years, the average life is much less than one- — tenth as long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">God foreknew the course that man would take; and before the foundation of the world ho outlined a plan for human redemption' and \ -blessing. Nearly two thousand years after the humankind had wandered in the earth in sorrow ' and distress, Jehovah spoke to his servant Abraham, likewise an imperfect man, but one who exercised great faith in God, and to him made promise that through his seed all the families, nations, kindreds and peoples of earth should have a blessing. (Genesis 12:2, 3; 22: 18; Galatians 3:16) Later, God organized the descendants of Abraham into a nation Under the name of Israel, and with that nation and people made a law covenant and from time to -</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">time reiterated his promise to bring a blessing </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the nations of earth through the seed of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham. The Israelites verily believed that</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">this promised seed was an eartldy seed. The .. promise at one time was confined to the house { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of David; and when David ascended the throne</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">■ the Jews thought that the time had come for , . the blessing of mankind. The prophets, how-</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I ever,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> foretold the coming of another and great</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">’ er</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> one; and at the time of Jesus’ birth all ' thoughtful people of Israel were looking for ' the coming of the Messiah. God through his prophet had foretold that Messiah would be bom in Bethlehem of Judma.—Matthew 2:5,6. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Here we emphasise one thing prominent , in . the message brought by the angel; namely, the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all.</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> It will be marked in the examination . of this and other Scriptures relating to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> redemption of man that God had promised to <sup>1</sup> bless </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> the families, of the earth, and that at the birth of Jesus the angel announced that | this is glad tidings which shall be brought to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all I </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">' people. It is not the thought of the Scriptures - that such a message would be brought to all at the same time; but that in God’s due time every one of the human race would hear this message - of glad tidings and would each have the opportunity of availing himself of the benefit of it;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The race was justly condemned to death because of disobedience to the law of God; and this judgment could not be set aside or reversed for the reason that God is unchangeable. His laws arc fixed. However, such a judgment could be satisfied by the demands of the law being met. In due course of time God made promise to the house of Israel, his specially chosen people, that a provision for releasing mankind from death and the effects of this judgment-would be made. &quot;I will ransom them from the - &amp;&nbsp;power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; 0 grave, ' I will be’ thy destruction/'—Hosea 13:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The word ransom means a price exactly .corresponding. A perfect man had violated God’s Jaw, and death resulted. Therefore tiic only thing that could constitute a ransom or corresponding price for mankind would be the life of another perfect man, exactly equivalent . to Adam while in Eden. In other words, the redemption and deliverance of the human race fronT'Jeath, and its restoration to human perfection and happiness, must entirely depend upon tlie voluntary submission to death of a</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">perfert human being—nothing more and nothing less. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">At once, then, we see that none of Adam's stock could meet this requirement of the law and redeem the human race because all were inperfect, having descended from Adam. And this thought is expressed by the Psalmist, who says, “None of them can by any means redeem his brother nor give to God a-ransomi for him&quot; (Psalm 49:7) Any child begotten by a member of the Adamic stock would necessarily be imperfect; hence &lt;the account concerning the conception of Mary and the birth of the babe Jesus shows that she conceived by the power, of the holy Spirit. (Matthew 1:18-25) Therefore Jesus wjis begotten not by man, but born of a woman, and when bom he was &quot;holy, harmless, undefiled and separate from sinners”. (Hebrews 7:26) When he grew to manhood's estate he was the exact counterpart of Adam prior to his disobedience. Not until we understand these things can we understand why there was so much joy in heaven among the angelic host at the birth of Jesus. The heavenly beings had been observing for four thousand years the downward course of mankind. They had seen the great degradation and sorrow that sin had inflicted upon the human family, and now they perceived that Jehovah was making provision for the redemption and blessing and uplifting of all mon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">That which man prizes above everything else is life'; for without life nothing else can be enjoyed.' The whole human race, being under the condemnation of death, ultimately must die. Why, then, did Jesus come to earth T Why was~ he bomT He answers; “That the people might have life and have it more abundantly*. (John 10:10) He “was made flesh and dwelt among us’’. (John 1:14) “Forasmuch as the'children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise partook of the same.” (Hebrews 2:14) &quot;We sec Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels [namely, a human being] for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> man.” (Hebrews 2:9) Jesus himself declared that he laid down his life for the sheep. (John 10:11,15, 16) Here.he uses the word sheep to illustrate, those who are vailing and obedient to the will of God, that they shall receive the benefit of bis sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">And this opportunity must come to all, as</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">St Paul states: “For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who will have </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> to be testified [to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all]</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> in due time.” (1 Timothy 2:3-6) Here again it is observed that it is God’s will that all men shall be saved from the condemnation of death and thereafter brought to a knowledge of God’s provision for them, which knowledge opens to them the opportunity of accepting the benefits of the ransom sacrifice. Hence, says the Apostle, these facts must be testified to all men in God's due time. As tills testimony comes to men at</span></p>
<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">different times and they understand it, they. thereof, and I ■will set it up; that the residue</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">rejoice in it because to them it is good tidings, good news of a better thing for them—an opportunity for life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Why, then, if Jesus died on the cross nearly nineteen centuries ago, should the human race continue to suffer? The Scriptural answer is clear. The promise to Abraham was that in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">his seed</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> should the blessing conic to mankind; and this seed must first be fully developed before the benefit uf the ransom sacrifice can be extended to all. It is important, therefore, to perceive what constitutes the seed and how it is developed. The Scriptural proof is that this seed is the Christ, the Messiah, composed of Jesus, the Head, and the church,' meaning the called-out class which constitute the members of the body of the Messiah class. Hence St. Paul argues: “As many of yon as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ... And if ye be Christ’s, tlici fare ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise”.—Galatians 3:27,29. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It has pleased the heavenly Father to devote the period of time elapsing from the resurrection of Jesus until the setting up of his kingdom to the work of selecting those who would be willing followers of the Master, and who would prove their faithfulness and loyalty to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> even unto death, arid to whom he would grant the privilege of joint-heirship with Christ'Jesus in his kingdom. (Romans 8:16, 17; 2 Timothy 2: 11,12) The selection of this class has been from among those who have voluntarily consecrated their lives to the Lord. Not every one who says, “Lord, Lord”, will be of that class, but only those who enter into a covenant with God by sacrifice and continue thus faithful unto death. These are pro</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mis</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ed a part in the first resurrection and an association with Christ Jesus as members of the royal priesthood. Therefore we can understand the words of the Master when he said that only a little flock (comparatively • speaking) of mankind would have this blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">—Luke 12:32. t</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The purposes of the Lord in this regard are ascertained from the words of the Apostle: g “God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">nam</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">e. And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, After this I will return, and I will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called.” —Acts 15:14-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus taught his disciples, and through them the church has been taught, that after he had ascended on high he would return in course of time and gather unto himself the saints, and then would establish his kingdom for the purpose of blessing mankind. .All Christian people have looked forward to the second coming of the Lord, and to the end of the wicked order of things and the establishment of a new and righteous order. This same thought was in the mind of the disciples when they approached Jesus just before his crucifixion and propounded to him the direct question: “Tell us when these things shall be, and what shall be the _ proof of thy coming and the end of the world </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">t” </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">—Matthew 24:3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord Jesus answered their question, and the answer is recorded in the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew and the twenty-first chapter of Luke. He describes the great stress and . trouble that is now upon the human race, w Among other things he said that there would ' be a great world war in which nation would rise against nation, to be accompanied by famine, pestilence and revolutions and a time of trouble such as never was before; and all mankind are . witnessing the fulfillment of this prophecy pt tliis very time. Again he said in answer to the &nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">same question that there would be “upon the &nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves [restless humanity] roaring; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for look- . ing after those things which are coming on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">earth: for the powers of heaven [ecclesiastical systems] shall be shaken”. (Luke 21:25, 26) All the trouble that has afflicted the nations since the fall of 1914 has been clearly in fulfillment of the prophetic utterance of the Lord. To the Christian this means (and soon all the world will learn to know that this is the meaning) that the kingdom of the Lord is at hand, that Christ is present, that he is tearing away £ the old order of things preparatory to establishing a kingdom of righteousness and peace which shall constitute &quot;the desire of all nations”. &quot;I will shake aU nations, and the desire of aU - nations shall come”.—Haggai 2:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The wars, famine, pestilence, revolutions and like disturbances that so much'distress humankind d^ not constitute any part of the glad tidings. No one rejoices in this suffering and trouble; but the Christian rejoices that these troublesome times are the proof foretold by the Lord that would precede the establishment of his kingdom of righteousness which would bring blessings to all the groaning creation. . The message that has been preached to the people for long centuries, and is yet being, preached by many, to the effect that it is the Lord’s purpose to save a few in heaven and to consign all the residue of mankind to a condition of endless torture, contains no glad tid-, ings to any one of an honest heart. Surely it could be no real joy to any person to be convinced that he would spend eternity in heavenly , bliss while at the same time some one near and 'dear to him would be spending eternity in torture. Such a doctrine is not taught by the Word of God, but is the result of a distorted interpretation of the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The divine program, which has been developing progressively for many cef furies, has now / ’about reriri;?'j:he point of time for the world of mankind to, begin to understand and appreciate some nf the lengths and breadths and heights and depths of the love of God. His inspired witness wrote: &quot;Times of refreshing shall come from the presence of Jehovah; for. he will send Jesus, who before was preached unto you, whom the heavens must retain until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began”.—Acts 3:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The word refreshing here suggests the thought of something that makes one happy after a long experience with that which is con</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">trary to happiness. The autumn season marks the dying and falling of the leaves, the trees appear bare, and the wind moans and sighs through their branches. Then follows the long, dark, cold winter, picturing in a measure the long night of suffering and death that has afflicted the human race. In the spring season the warm, gentle rays of the sun, falling upon the earth, cause the grass to spring forth, the trees to bud and leaf, followed by the blossoms and the fruit, the singing of the birds and the rejoicing of all nature because of the reviving, or coming again to life, of that which was dead. . Seemingly the Apostle had such a picture in his mind when he said that times of refreshing would come at the establishment of Messiah’s kingdom because it would mean the restoration • of that which father Adam lost for himself and all of his offspring, namely, life and all the sweetness incident thereto. The perfect man Jesus, having laid down his life and thereby providing the purchase price for the human race, now returns for the purpose of ministering to mankind by giving to him the very thing that he has long desired. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Long ago the Apostle saw this and wrote: &quot;He [God] hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man [Christ Jesus] whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto aU men in that he hath raised him from the dead”. (Acts 17:31) The assurance here then is to every man that has lived on the earth that he must have a fair and impartial trial in a time of righteous: ncss, which trial is for the purpose of giving him an opportunity to render himself in obedience to the law of God and live. It means that millions who have gone into death will return again; for &quot;there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust” (Acts 24:15) The great Master himself assures us that all in their graves shall hear his voice and awaken to the resurrection by judgments, i. e., a time of trial and opportunity for life and its blessings.—John 5:28,29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The work of reconstructing the human race will devolve upon the great Messiah, and that great work will begin as soon as the present trouble upon the earth has ended; for Jesus assures us that there never will be another time like it (Matthew (24:21) Then, under his righteous reign, every one will have a chance of hearing the sayings of Jesus and then will</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">apply his* words, “Verily I say unto you, If ' a man keep my saying he shall never see death?<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">That Scripture, like all other sayings of the Master, must have its time for fulfillment; and no one could keep his sayings until first they heard them. The millions in death could not hear until awakened out of death, and the millions now on earth could not hear until God's due time and until they are told. That due time is about at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Will that be a time, then, &gt;of rejoicing and gladness? The Lord through the prophet gives us a vision of that great time of blessing, saying, &quot;The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose/’ thus pietur-ing how the earth itself shall begin to yield that which is necessary for the sustenance of mankind and permit him -to enjoy the fruits of his labors without the intervention and oppression of the profiteers. &quot;It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Before the coming -of that glorious day, however, the prophet infers that the people would become very much discouraged and without strength. He pictures them as trembling in their knees and hanging down their hands, and for their encouragement says: &quot;Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you.” St. Paul tells us that the whole world aside from Christians are blind, and blinded by the adversary. Many people are actually blind, v’hilc practically all are blind concerning a vision of God’s plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The prophet then pictures the blessings during the reconstruction, saying, &quot;Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness. shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.” _</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Then the prophet describes a way opened for the human race to journey back to the perfection of life, of body and mind, continuing: &quot;And an highway shall be' there, and a</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">way, and it shall be called The way of holiness: the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein”. This highway is the Messiah, who is given as a mediator between &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">God and man, to load man back to the state of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">perfection; and the way to pass over it will <sup>1 </sup>be by rendering themselves in obedience to the law of the Messiah. It shall be a holy, a righteous way. No person shall be permitted to progress ip wickedness, in profiteering, in oppression, in keeping the people in ignorance or filching their pockets under the pretense of preaching the Gospel or anything else; but its object shall he the cleansing anu'ulessing of the people, and it shall be so clear and plain that every man can understand it. &quot;No lion shall be there”; that is to say, no monstrous beast, such as czars, beastly governments, oppressing corporations, or ecclesiastical, political or financial systems. &quot;Nor any ravenous beast [government of oppressive violence] shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall wall: there.” The earth and everthing in it shall be made conducive to the uplifting and blessing of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Having in mind,- then, that the Apostle assures us time and again that Jesus ransomed the entire human race, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> of them, the prophet continues: &quot;And the ransomed of the Lord shall return [meaning they shall return from the land of the, enemy, from death and from their bondage in blindness and ignorance and superstition], and come to Zion [the Messiah] with- ■ songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away”. (Isaiah 35) Indeed then all shall know the truth c-f the message that the angel brought to the shepherds as they watched their flocks—good tidings of great joy unto all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Messiah’s kingdom will establish a uirCersal peace. As the prophet declares, when his kingdom is established, then the nations shall come and say, &quot;Let us go up to the mountain* [kingdom] of the Lord, and he will teach us of his ways, and we-will walk in his paths. . And they .shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a s.word against nation, neither shall* they learn war any more. But they shall sit ever}’ man under his vine and under his fig tree; <sub>t </sub>and none shall make them afrald”.-Micah 4:1-4. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Age inaugurates a children's Bible study department There is no desire or purpose to teach the doctrines of any sect or system; but the sole purpose is to instruct the children in the Bible. To do so we have arranged this study in question and answer form,-propounding the questions and briefly answering, citing the Scriptures where the proper Biblical answer may be had. We suggest that the parents propound these questions to their children and aid them to locate in the Bible the answer, thus familiarizing the child (and incidentally the par- -ent) with the texts of the Bible and enabling them to get some insight into the glorious character of Jehovah and the Lord Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">We suggest that the child be given one question each day and that in addition to the answer here given, it be encouraged to x&gt;ok up the' Scriptures cited and any other Scriptures that, with the aid of the parent, it might find bearing on the question. As this is a primary study, we therefore begin with the subject </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">THE BIBLE</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">To assure such a lasting blessing &quot;will require, of course, nothing short of a perfect ruler.

One who loves and obeys the great Creator loves and obeys righteousness, makes a better citizen and a greater benefactor to mankind. To love and obey Jehovah one must know him. How can we know him except through his Word, and how can we know and understand his Word unless we are taught? If it is proper and necessary to send our children to th* public schools that they there may be taught concerning the selfish things of this life, with stronger reasoning is it proper and ' necessary that they .be taught concerning the things that have to do with their eternal welfare . and happiness.

Every parent owes a duty to his own child and a corresponding duty to every other child to whom he can render aid.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">6. Who can understand the Biblef</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Answer: The first thing essential is an honest desire to understand it. (Luke 8:15) Then one must be wise after God's manner of wisdom (Daniel 12:10; James </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">3:17);</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> and that kind of wisdom means that he recognizes Jehovah God as thejgreat First Cause, the Creator and the Giver of all good gifts. Then one must search the Scriptures and study them.—John 5:39; Jeremiah 29:13; Acts 17:11; 1 Corinthians 2:10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">7.</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> Is the Bible intended to be understood; or is it a book shrouded in mystery, only for one class to understand? - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">, Answer: It is a reasonable book; for God invites us to reason with him (Isaiah 1:18; Job 13:3); and the Bible gives the reason for God’s dealing with man and also the hope that man has. (1 Peter 3:15) We should reason when we study the Scriptures or talk to others about them.—Acts 17:2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">8. If reasonable, then why cannot everybody understand the Bible?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Answer: Because not every one is honest, and the dishonest will not be able to understand it (Luke 8:15) Some do not desire to be righteous and good; hence they do not understand. (Matthew 5:6) Some may be honest and desire to be righteous, but do not study. (2 Timothy 2: 15) Some are too wise in their own conceits concerning earthly wisdom and do not give God credit for knowing and stating it in his Word.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Answer: No; on the contrary, the vision (which means an understanding of God's Word) is hid from many who are wise after the manner of earthly wisdom and is made known and understood by those who humbly and honestly seek to understand, though they may be poor and have little education.—1 Corin</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">thian a</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1:20, 21, 26-29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">10. What is necessary for one to do to understand the Bible?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Answer: First, he must have an honest desire to understand it and a reverence for Jehovah as the great eternal One, the Maker of all tilings; he must have faith in God. “Without • faith it is impossible to please him.” (Hebrews 11:6) Second, he must have a sincere desire to know the truth and tell the Lord he is willing to do his will.—Proverbs 1:7; John 14:2G; 1 Cor*‘ inthians 2:12; Psalm 25:14; Romans 8:14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">11. Is it profitable to study the Bible and if &amp;&nbsp;so, in what way?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">12. Does a knowledge of the Bible enable one to do better?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Answer: See 2 Timothy 3:16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">13. Is the Bible written entirely in plain language, or is some of it in symbols? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Answer: Some of it is written in plain phrase, while many parts of it are written in symbolic language, some in parables and dark sayings. —Mark 4:32; Matthew 13:33; Revelation 1:1-3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">14. Why was not the Bible written in plain language so everybody could understand it, and without symbols or dark sayings?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Answer: God’s purpose is to reveal an understanding of his plan gradually. For instance, he had the prophets write many things which they could not understand. They merely served as clerks or writers to make a record of things they saw. (Daniel 12:8) The prophecy of the Bible is history written before it happens. Jehovah foreknew everything from the beginning to the end (Acts 15:18); and he caused it to be written in such a way that it could not be understood until the prophecy is fulfilled by^ the events t</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">akin</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">g place. Then he expected the people to understand it ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">15. Can you give an instance in which the Lord foretold something to happen that we now _ . </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">see? ‘ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fa</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Answer r Yes: He had Daniel record many centuries ago that the time would come when there would be rapid traveling across the land and a great increase of knowledge in the world, which has come within the last hundred years. (Daniel 12:4) There are many instances of this kind in the Bible, as we will find from time to time in these studies. The Lord revealed through another prophet a description of the locomotive and railway train, many centuries before any man ever thought about inventing or ' building one. We will give the description of this in some later lesson. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark61"></a>TRAVEL AND MISCELLANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Service far Travelers</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">T THE foundation of the swift, smooth travel of today is an intricate system of coordinated service. Without the surrender of the individual railroad worker’s will td that of the system, travel would be both difficult and dangerous, and civilization would sink toward the level of the semi-barbarous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Every railroad man is inspired with the ideal of as nearly perfect sendee as he can render. Service by a worker-the public scarcely hears of, the car inspector, makes sure that no car leaves the terminal in a condition that might cause an accident The engineman’s service calls for uninterrupted watchfulness and thoughtfulness over every rod of track and at every signal, to make safe delivery of the cargo at every stop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Safe and efficient service by the conductor takes a personal, sincere interest in the passengers, watches conditions, observes the dispatcher’s orders, and sees to the safety and as ' far as possible the comfort of the hundreds temporarily in his care. Service by the shopman takes care that the rolling stock is in us good condition as possible in the time allowed* for the adjustment and repair of engines and cars and is an important contribution toward the efficient operation of the system. The railroad clerk’s service contributes in some measure tq the possibility of the management’s having the records which make for the efficient operation of the system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">There is.no place where lack of the'spirit of service shows more than in the conduct of the executives. Their spirit travels through the personnel, and manifests itself in the acts of 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;ev _ . employe of the road. Governing the entire</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• systciu is the service rendered by the bankers and financiers who act as directors, appoint executives, control policies and supply the funds required in a large way to purchase materials, equipment and labor for the best maintenance and operation of the system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Modern travel is the resultant of the service of thousands working separately but all to a common end. In a successful railroad it represents the best that can be done for the money to secure the safe and comfortable delivery of passengers and freight over mile after mile of track to the destination. It is an exemplification of the Biblical maxim that “whosoever will be -chiefest, shall be servant of all”. (Mark 10:44) Presumably it is true of the personnel of a ■ system, from bankers down, if unfaithful, that _ they are liable to hear the other Biblical injunction, “Cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth”.—Matthew 25:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Big Bean</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">O ACCUSTOMED are we to the bean in a .shell that it rather surprises us to see in a display window a bean two or three feet long. This monster among beans is a butter bean originated in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">One seed of the new bean may grow into a plant 90 or 100 feet long bearing 100 beans, each up to four to six feet long and weighing ten, twenty or thirty pounds, or more. It would take a large and hungry family to dispose of one twenty-pound bean at a meal or even in a day. Just how much the big bean might help out the cost-of-living problem may be figured out by the curious by estimating how many might be raised in a city back-yard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Japanese bean first began to be used in this country after the war got under way, and is now being widely used as a staple food. It is said to be good eating when cut and fried like egg plant, or boiled and served with a white sauce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">If this is a specimen of how the field is to “yield its increase” in the Golden Age, what wonderful things may be expected when the better order is fully under way!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Disease Aggravates Shortage</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE milk shortage in Switzerland is made worse by the foot-and-mouth disease, which is epidemic. On account of danger to the people, dances and other Assemblages of the people, including funerals, are greatly restricted in the attendance permitted. No milk is allowed to reach condensed-milk factories or milk-chocolate plants; and the milk rations of children are reduced thirty per cent Cattle markets are closed, and farmers from infected districts are forbidden to enter the towns.</span></p>

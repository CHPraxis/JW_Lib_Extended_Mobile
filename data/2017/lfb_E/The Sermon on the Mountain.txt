LESSON 81
The Sermon on the Mountain




After choosing the 12 apostles, Jesus came down the mountain to a place where a large crowd was gathered. They had come from Galilee, Judea, Tyre, Sidon, Syria, and the other side of the Jordan. They brought people who were suffering from diseases and some who were tormented by demons. Jesus healed them all. Then he sat down on the mountainside and began to speak. He explained what we must do if we want to be friends of God. We must realize that we need Jehovah and learn to love him. But we cannot love God if we do not love other people. We must be kind and fair to everyone, even our enemies.
Jesus said: ‘It’s not enough to love just your friends. You also need to love your enemies and to forgive people from your heart. If someone is upset with you, go to him right away and apologize. Treat others the way you want them to treat you.’





Jesus also gave the people good advice about material things. He said: ‘It’s more important to be Jehovah’s friend than to have a lot of money. A thief can steal your money, but no one can steal your friendship with Jehovah. Stop worrying about what you will eat, drink, or wear. Look at the birds. God always makes sure that they have enough to eat. Worrying will not make you live one day longer. Remember, Jehovah knows what you need.’
The crowds had never heard anyone speak as Jesus did. Their religious leaders had not taught them these things. Why was Jesus such a great teacher? Because everything he taught came from Jehovah.



“Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for yourselves.”​—Matthew 11:29

Questions: What must we do to become Jehovah’s friend? How does Jehovah want you to treat others?

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Moses lived in Midian for 40 years. He got married and had children. One day while he was taking care of his sheep near Mount Sinai, he saw something amazing. A thornbush was on fire, but it was not burning up! When Moses went near to see why, he heard a voice from inside the bush say: ‘Moses! Do not come any closer. Take off your sandals because you are standing on holy ground.’ It was Jehovah who was talking by means of an angel.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Moses was afraid, so he covered his face. The voice said: ‘I have seen the suffering of the Israelites. I will save them from the Egyptians and bring them to a good land. You are the one who will lead my people out of Egypt.’ Don’t you think that must have surprised Moses?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Moses asked: ‘What should I say when the people ask who sent me?’ God replied: ‘Tell them that Jehovah, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob has sent you.’ Moses then said: ‘What if the people don’t listen to me?’ Jehovah gave Moses proof that He would help him. He told Moses to throw his stick on the ground. Then the stick became a snake! When Moses grabbed the snake by the tail, it became a stick again. Jehovah said: ‘When you perform this sign, it will prove that I sent you.’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Moses said: ‘I’m not a good speaker.’ Jehovah promised him: ‘I will tell you what to say, and I will send your brother Aaron to help you.’ Knowing that Jehovah was with him, Moses took his wife and sons and headed back to Egypt.</p>

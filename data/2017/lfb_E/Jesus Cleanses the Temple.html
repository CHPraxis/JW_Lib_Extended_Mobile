<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the spring of the year 30 C.E., Jesus went to Jerusalem. Many people had come to the city for the Passover. As part of the celebration, they made animal offerings at the temple. Some people brought animals with them, but others bought them in Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When Jesus went to the temple, he saw people selling animals there. They were making money for themselves right in Jehovah’s house of worship! How did Jesus react? He made a whip out of ropes and drove the sheep and the cattle out of the temple. He overturned the tables of the money changers and poured <span id="page181" class="pageNum" data-no="181" data-before-text="181"></span>their coins out on the ground. Jesus told those who were selling doves: ‘Take these things away from here! Do not make my Father’s house a place of business!’</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">People at the temple were amazed at what Jesus did. His disciples remembered the prophecy about the Messiah: ‘I will be full of zeal for Jehovah’s house.’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Later, in the year 33 C.E., Jesus cleansed the temple a second time. He would not let anyone show disrespect for his Father’s house.</p>

LESSON 82
Jesus Teaches His Disciples How to Pray




Everything the Pharisees did was to impress people. If they did something kind, it was so that others would notice. They prayed in public places so that everyone could see them. The Pharisees memorized long prayers and repeated them in synagogues and on street corners where others could hear them. So the people were surprised when Jesus told them: ‘Don’t pray like the Pharisees. They think that God will be impressed by their many words, but he is not. Prayer is between you and Jehovah. Don’t say the same things over and over. Jehovah wants you to tell him how you really feel inside.





‘This is how you should pray: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your Kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on earth.”’ Jesus also told them that they should pray for their food for the day, for their sins to be forgiven, and about other personal matters.
Jesus said: ‘Never stop praying. Keep on asking your Father, Jehovah, for good things. Every parent wants to give good things to his child. If your son asks you for bread, will you give him a stone? If he asks for a fish, will you give him a snake?’
Then Jesus explained the lesson: ‘If you know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will your Father, Jehovah, give holy spirit to you? All you need to do is ask.’ Do you follow Jesus’ advice? What sort of things do you pray about?



“Keep on asking, and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you.”​—Matthew 7:7

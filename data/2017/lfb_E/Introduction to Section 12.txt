Introduction to Section 12




Jesus taught people about the Kingdom of the heavens. He also taught them to pray for God’s name to be sanctified, for his Kingdom to come, and for his will to take place on the earth. If you are a parent, explain to your child what this prayer means for us. Jesus did not allow Satan to break his loyalty. Jesus selected his apostles, and they became the foundation members of the Kingdom. Note Jesus’ zeal for true worship. Because he wanted to help others, Jesus cured the sick, fed the hungry, and even brought people back to life. By all these miracles, he demonstrated what the Kingdom will do for mankind.

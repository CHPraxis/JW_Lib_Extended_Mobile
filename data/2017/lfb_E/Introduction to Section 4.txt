This section introduces us to Joseph, Job, Moses, and the Israelites. All of them endured much at the hands of the Devil. Some of them experienced injustice, imprisonment, slavery, and even death. In various ways, though, Jehovah protected them. If you are a parent, help your child to understand how those servants of Jehovah suffered evil without losing faith.
Jehovah used the Ten Plagues to show that he is more powerful than all the gods of Egypt. Highlight how Jehovah protected his people in the past and how he does so today.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Pharisees hated Jesus and wanted to find a reason to arrest him. They said that he should not heal sick people on the Sabbath. One Sabbath, Jesus found a blind man begging in the street. He told his disciples: ‘See how God’s power will help this man.’ Jesus mixed his own saliva with dirt to make a paste, and then he put it on the man’s eyes. Jesus told him: ‘Go and wash your eyes in the pool of Siloam.’ The man did that, and then for the first time in his life, he could see.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">People were shocked. They said: ‘Is this the man who used to sit and beg, or is it just someone who looks like him?’ The man said: ‘I was the one born blind!’ The people asked him: ‘Why aren’t you blind anymore?’ When he told them what had happened, they took him to the Pharisees.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The man told the Pharisees: ‘Jesus put a paste on my eyes and told me to go and wash it off. I did, and now I can see.’ The Pharisees said: ‘If Jesus cures on the Sabbath, his power cannot be from God.’ But others said: ‘If his power were not from God, he would not be able to cure at all.’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Pharisees called the man’s parents and asked: ‘How is it that your son can <span id="page199" class="pageNum" data-no="199" data-before-text="199"></span>now see?’ His parents were afraid because the Pharisees had said that anyone who puts faith in Jesus would be thrown out of the synagogue. So they said: ‘We don’t know. Ask him yourself.’ The Pharisees asked the man more questions until he said: ‘I’ve told you all I know. Why do you keep asking me?’ The Pharisees were angry, and they threw him out.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jesus went to find the man, and asked him: ‘Do you have faith in the Messiah?’ The man said: ‘I would if I knew who he was.’ Jesus said: ‘I am the Messiah.’ Was that not kind of Jesus? Not only did he cure the man but he also helped him to have faith.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Jesus came to earth to give his life for imperfect people. Even though he died, he conquered the world. Jehovah was loyal to his Son and brought him back to life. Right up until his death, Jesus humbly served others and forgave them when they made mistakes. After his resurrection, Jesus appeared to his disciples. He taught them how to do the important work he had given them to do. If you are a parent, help your child to appreciate that we have a part in this same work today.</p>

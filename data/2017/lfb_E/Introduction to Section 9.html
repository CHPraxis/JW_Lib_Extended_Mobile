<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This section teaches us about young people, prophets, and kings who displayed remarkable faith in Jehovah. In Syria, a little Israelite girl had faith that Jehovah’s prophet would heal Naaman. The prophet Elisha had complete confidence that Jehovah would protect him from an enemy army. High Priest Jehoiada risked his life to protect young Jehoash from his wicked grandmother, Athaliah. King Hezekiah trusted that Jehovah would rescue Jerusalem, and he did not give in to the Assyrian threat. King Josiah erased idolatry from the land, restored the temple, and led the nation back to true worship.</p>

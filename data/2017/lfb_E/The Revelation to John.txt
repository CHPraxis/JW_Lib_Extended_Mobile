LESSON 102
The Revelation to John




While the apostle John was a prisoner on the island of Patmos, Jesus showed him a series of 16 visions, or pictures, of the future. These visions revealed how Jehovah’s name would be sanctified, his Kingdom would come, and his will would take place on earth as in heaven.
In one vision, John sees Jehovah on his glorious throne in heaven, surrounded by 24 elders in white clothes and on their heads are golden crowns. Flashes of lightning and sounds of thunder come from the throne. The 24 elders bow down before Jehovah and worship him. In another vision, John sees a great crowd from all nations, peoples, and languages who worship Jehovah. The Lamb, who is Jesus, shepherds them and takes them to waters of life. Later, in another vision, Jesus begins to rule as King in heaven, along with the 24 elders. In the following vision, John sees Jesus battle the dragon, who is Satan, and his demons. Jesus throws them out of heaven, down to the earth.





Then John sees a beautiful picture of the Lamb and the 144,000 standing on Mount Zion. He also sees an angel flying around the earth, telling people to fear God and give Him glory.
In the next vision, the war of Armageddon is fought. During that war, Jesus and his army conquer Satan’s evil system. In the last vision, John sees perfect harmony in the heavens and on the earth. Satan and his offspring are completely destroyed. Everyone in heaven and on earth treats Jehovah’s name as holy and worships only him.



“I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring. He will crush your head, and you will strike him in the heel.”​—Genesis 3:15

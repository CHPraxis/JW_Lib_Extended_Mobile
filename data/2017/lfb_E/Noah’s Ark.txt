LESSON 5
Noah’s Ark




In time, there came to be many people on the earth. Most of them were bad. Even some of the angels in heaven became bad. They left their home in heaven and came down to the earth. Do you know why they did that? So that they could take on human bodies and marry women.
The angels and the women had sons together. Those sons grew up to be very strong and became bullies. They hurt people. Jehovah could not let those things continue to happen. So he decided to destroy the bad people in a flood.





But there was a man who was different. He loved Jehovah. His name was Noah. He had a wife and three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and each of his sons had a wife. Jehovah told Noah to build a big ark so that he and his family could survive the Flood. An ark is a huge box that can float on water. Jehovah also told Noah to bring many animals inside the ark so that they could survive too.
Noah immediately started building the ark. It took Noah and his family about 50 years to build it. They built the ark exactly as Jehovah told them to. During that time, Noah warned the people about the Flood. But no one listened to him.
Finally, it was time to go into the ark. Let’s find out what happened next.



“Just as the days of Noah were, so the presence of the Son of man will be.”​—Matthew 24:37

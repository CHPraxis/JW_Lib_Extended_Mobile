<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah promised Jacob that he would protect him just as he had protected Abraham and Isaac. Jacob settled in a place called Haran, where he got married, had a big family, and became very rich.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Eventually Jehovah told Jacob: ‘Go back to your homeland.’ So Jacob and his family began the long trip back. On the road some people came to Jacob and said: ‘Your brother Esau is coming, and there are 400 men with him!’ Jacob was afraid that Esau wanted to hurt him and his family. He prayed to Jehovah: ‘Please save me from my brother.’ The next day Jacob sent Esau a gift of many sheep, goats, cows, camels, and donkeys.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">That night while Jacob was alone, he saw an angel! The angel started wrestling with him. They wrestled until the morning. Even though Jacob got hurt, he would not give up. The angel said: ‘Let me go.’ But Jacob said: ‘No, not until you bless me.’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The angel finally blessed Jacob. Now Jacob knew that Jehovah wouldn’t let Esau hurt him.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">That morning Jacob looked into the distance and saw Esau and the 400 men. Jacob went ahead of his family and bowed <span id="page37" class="pageNum" data-no="37" data-before-text="37"></span>down before his brother seven times. Esau ran to Jacob and threw his arms around him. The two brothers burst into tears and made peace. How do you think Jehovah felt about the way that Jacob handled this situation?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Later Esau went back to his home, and Jacob went to his. Jacob had a total of 12 sons. Their names were Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin. One of those sons​—Joseph—​was used by Jehovah to save His people. Do you know how? Let’s find out.</p>

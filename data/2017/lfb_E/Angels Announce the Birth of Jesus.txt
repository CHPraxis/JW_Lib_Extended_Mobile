LESSON 70
Angels Announce the Birth of Jesus




The ruler of the Roman Empire, Caesar Augustus, ordered that all Jews return to their hometowns to be registered. So Joseph and Mary traveled to Bethlehem, where Joseph’s family came from. It was almost time for Mary to have her baby.
When they arrived at Bethlehem, the only place they could find to stay was a stable. It was there that Mary gave birth to her son Jesus. She wrapped him in soft cloths and laid him gently in a manger.
Near Bethlehem, some shepherds were spending the night outdoors, watching over their flocks. Suddenly, an angel stood before them and they were surrounded by the light of Jehovah’s glory. The shepherds were frightened, but the angel said: ‘Don’t be afraid. I have exciting news. The Messiah was born today in Bethlehem.’ At that moment, many angels appeared in the sky, saying: ‘Glory to God in heaven, and peace on earth.’ Then the angels disappeared. How did the shepherds react?
The shepherds said to one another: ‘Let’s go to Bethlehem right away.’ They went quickly and found Joseph and Mary in the stable with their newborn baby.
Everyone who heard what the angel had told the shepherds was amazed. Mary thought deeply about the angel’s words and never forgot them. The shepherds went back to their flocks, thanking Jehovah for all they had seen and heard.



“I came from God and I am here. I have not come of my own initiative, but that One sent me.”​—John 8:42

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">After the Passover, Jesus and his disciples traveled through Samaria on their way back to Galilee. Near the city of Sychar, Jesus stopped at a place called Jacob’s well. While he rested there, his disciples went into the city to buy food.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A woman came to the well to draw water. Jesus said to her: “Give me a drink.” She said: ‘Why are you talking to me? I’m a Samaritan woman. Jews don’t talk to Samaritans.’ Jesus told her: ‘If you knew who I am, you would ask me for a drink and I would give you living water.’ ‘What do you mean?’ asked the woman. ‘You don’t even have a bucket.’ Jesus said: ‘Whoever drinks the water that I give him will never get thirsty again.’ The woman said: “Sir, give me this water.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jesus then told her: ‘Bring your husband to the well.’ She said: ‘I don’t have a husband.’ He said: ‘You are telling the truth. You’ve been married five times, and now you live with a man to whom you are not married.’ The woman said: ‘I see that you are a prophet. My people believe that we can worship God on this mountain, but the Jews say that we can worship only in Jerusalem. I believe that when the Messiah comes, he will teach us how to worship.’ Then Jesus said something he had not told anyone else: ‘I am the Messiah.’</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span id="page183" class="pageNum" data-no="183" data-before-text="183"></span>The woman hurried to her city and told the Samaritans: ‘I think I have found the Messiah. He knows everything about me. Come and see!’ They followed her back to the well and listened to Jesus teach.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Samaritans invited Jesus to stay in their city. For two days, he taught there, and many people put faith in him. They told the Samaritan woman: ‘After listening to this man, we know that he really is the savior of the world.’</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Jehovah is King over all. He has always been in control, and he will always be in control. For example, he rescued Jeremiah from a pit of death. He saved Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego from a fiery furnace and Daniel from the mouths of lions. Jehovah protected Esther so that she could save her entire nation. He will not allow wickedness to go on forever. The prophecies of the great image and the massive tree guarantee that Jehovah’s Kingdom will soon remove all wickedness and rule the earth.</p>

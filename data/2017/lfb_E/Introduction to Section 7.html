<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This section covers the life histories of King Saul and King David, spanning about 80 years. At first, Saul was humble and God-fearing, but he soon changed and refused to follow Jehovah’s direction. Jehovah rejected him and, in time, instructed Samuel to anoint David as the next king of Israel. Jealous Saul tried many times to kill David, but David never took revenge. Saul’s son Jonathan knew that David was Jehovah’s choice, so he was loyal to David. David committed some serious sins, but he never rejected Jehovah’s discipline. If you are a parent, help your child to see the importance of always supporting God’s arrangements.</p>

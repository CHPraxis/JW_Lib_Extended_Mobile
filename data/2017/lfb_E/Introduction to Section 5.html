<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Two months after passing through the Red Sea, the Israelites came to Mount Sinai. There, Jehovah made a covenant with Israel to be his special nation. He protected them and provided everything they needed​—manna to eat, clothing that did not wear out, and a safe place to live. If you are a parent, help your child to understand why Jehovah gave the Israelites the Law, the tabernacle, and the priesthood. Emphasize the importance of keeping our word, remaining humble, and always being loyal to Jehovah.</p>

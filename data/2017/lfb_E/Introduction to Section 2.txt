Introduction to Section 2




Why did Jehovah bring about a flood that destroyed the world of that time? Early in human history, a battle began​—the battle between good and evil. Some individuals, such as Adam, Eve, and their son Cain, chose the side of evil. A few others, such as Abel and Noah, chose the side of good. Most people became so bad that Jehovah brought an end to that wicked world. This section will help us to learn that Jehovah sees which side we choose and that he will never allow the evil to conquer the good.



KEY LESSONS
  We should be peaceable, not violent like the Devil and his followers

  If we listen to God and obey him, as Noah did, we can live forever in happiness

  Jehovah sees everything that happens. Righteousness brings joy to his heart, but wickedness makes him sad

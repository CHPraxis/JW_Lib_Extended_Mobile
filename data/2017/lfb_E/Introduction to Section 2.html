<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Why did Jehovah bring about a flood that destroyed the world of that time? Early in human history, a battle began​—the battle between good and evil. Some individuals, such as Adam, Eve, and their son Cain, chose the side of evil. A few others, such as Abel and Noah, chose the side of good. Most people became so bad that Jehovah brought an end to that wicked world. This section will help us to learn that Jehovah sees which side we choose and that he will never allow the evil to conquer the good.</p>

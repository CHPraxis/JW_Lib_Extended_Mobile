LESSON 10
Remember the Wife of Lot




Lot lived with Abraham, his uncle, in the land of Canaan. Eventually, Abraham and Lot had so many animals that there was not enough land for all of them. Abraham said to Lot: ‘We can no longer live together in one place. Please choose which way you would like to go, and I will go the other way.’ That was unselfish of Abraham, wasn’t it?
Lot saw a beautiful part of the land near a city called Sodom. There was plenty of water as well as green grass. So he chose that place and moved his family there.
The people of Sodom and of the nearby city of Gomorrah were very bad. In fact, they were so bad that Jehovah decided to destroy those cities. But God wanted to save Lot and his family, so he sent two angels to warn them: ‘Hurry! Get out of this city! Jehovah is going to destroy it.’
Lot did not leave right away. He kept on delaying. So the angels took Lot, his wife, and his two daughters by the hand and rushed them out of the city, saying: ‘Run! Escape for your life, and do not look back. If you look back, you will die!’





When they arrived at the city called Zoar, Jehovah made it rain fire and sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah. Those two cities were completely destroyed. When Lot’s wife disobeyed Jehovah and looked back, she turned into a pillar of salt! But Lot and his daughters were safe because they had obeyed Jehovah. They must have been very sad that Lot’s wife had disobeyed. But they were glad that they had listened to Jehovah’s instructions.

Introduction to Section 6




When the Israelites finally reached the Promised Land, the tabernacle became the center of true worship there. Priests taught the Law, and judges guided the nation. This section illustrates the profound impact that a person’s decisions and actions can have on others. Each Israelite had a personal responsibility toward Jehovah and his fellow man. Highlight the influence that Deborah, Naomi, Joshua, Hannah, Jephthah’s daughter, and Samuel had on their communities. Emphasize that even some non-Israelites, such as Rahab, Ruth, Jael, and the Gibeonites, decided to side with the Israelites because they knew that God was with them.

  Jehovah used the judges to save his people miraculously

  Faithful ones, young and old, were rewarded for their complete confidence in Jehovah

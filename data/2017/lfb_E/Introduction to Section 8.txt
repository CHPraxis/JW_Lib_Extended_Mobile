Introduction to SectionÂ 8




Jehovah blessed Solomon with great wisdom and gave him the privilege of building the temple, but he gradually left Jehovah. If you are a parent, explain to your child how false worshippers turned Solomon away from God. The kingdom was divided, and bad kings led the nation into apostasy and idol worship. During this time, many loyal prophets of Jehovah were persecuted and killed. Queen Jezebel dragged the northern kingdom even deeper into apostasy. It was a dark time in the history of Israel. But there were still many faithful servants of Jehovah among the Israelites, including King Jehoshaphat and the prophet Elijah.

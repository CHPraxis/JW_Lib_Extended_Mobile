Introduction to Section 11




This section introduces the Christian Greek Scriptures. Jesus was born into a humble family who lived in a small town. He worked with his father, a carpenter. Jesus was the one who would save mankind. Jehovah had selected him as King of the Kingdom of the heavens. If you are a parent, help your child to appreciate how carefully Jehovah selected the family and environment in which Jesus would grow up. Consider how Jehovah protected Jesus from being murdered by Herod and how nothing can stop Jehovah’s purpose. Learn how Jehovah assigned John to prepare the way for Jesus. Emphasize how Jesus demonstrated that even from a young age, he loved Jehovah’s wisdom.

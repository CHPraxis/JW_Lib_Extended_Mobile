Introduction to Section 1




The Bible begins with its account of physical creation, opening our eyes to the beautiful things that Jehovah made, both in heaven and on earth. If you are a parent, help your child to see the amazing diversity in creation. Point out how God created humans to be far superior to animals, giving us the ability to talk, to reason, to invent things, to sing, and to pray. Build appreciation for Jehovah’s power and wisdom and especially his love for all his creation​—including each one of us.

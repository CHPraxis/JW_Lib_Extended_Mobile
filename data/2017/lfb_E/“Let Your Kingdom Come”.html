<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jehovah put Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden to live in peace and happiness. They were to worship their heavenly Father and fill the earth with their children. Adam and Eve disobeyed Jehovah, but his purpose never changed. In this book we have seen that everything God promises comes true. His Kingdom will bring wonderful blessings to the earth, just as he promised Abraham.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Soon Satan, his demons, and all bad people will be gone. Everyone alive will worship Jehovah. We will not get sick or die. Instead, we will wake up each day full of energy and happy to <span id="page239" class="pageNum" data-no="239" data-before-text="239"></span>be alive. The earth will become a paradise. Everyone will have good food and safe homes. People will be kind, not cruel or violent. Wild animals will not fear us, and we will not be afraid of them.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It will be so exciting when Jehovah begins to resurrect people. We will welcome back people from the past, such as Abel, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Moses, Ruth, Esther, and David. They will share with us in making planet Earth a paradise. There will always be lots of interesting work to do.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah wants you to be there. You will come to know him in ways you have never imagined. Let’s draw closer and closer to Jehovah every day, now and forever!</p>

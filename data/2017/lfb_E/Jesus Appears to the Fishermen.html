<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Some time after Jesus appeared to the apostles, Peter decided to go fishing in the Sea of Galilee. Thomas, James, John, and some other disciples went with him. All night long they fished but did not catch anything.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Early the next morning, they saw a man standing on the shore. He called to them across the water: ‘Did you catch any fish?’ They told him: “No!” The man said: “Cast your net on the right side of the boat.” When they did that, the net became filled with so many fish that they could not pull it aboard. John suddenly realized that the man was Jesus and said: “It is the Lord!” Immediately, Peter jumped into the water and swam to shore. The other disciples followed in the boat.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When they arrived at the beach, they saw bread and fish cooking on a fire. Jesus told them to bring some of their <span id="page215" class="pageNum" data-no="215" data-before-text="215"></span>fish to add to the meal. Then he said: ‘Come and have breakfast.’</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">After they finished breakfast, Jesus asked Peter: ‘Do you love me more than fishing?’ Peter said: ‘Yes, Lord, you know I do.’ Jesus said: ‘Then feed my lambs.’ Jesus again asked: ‘Peter, do you love me?’ Peter said: ‘Lord, you know I do.’ Jesus said: “Shepherd my little sheep.” Jesus asked a third time. Peter felt very sad. He said: ‘Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you.’ Jesus said: “Feed my little sheep.” Then he told Peter: “Continue following me.”</p>

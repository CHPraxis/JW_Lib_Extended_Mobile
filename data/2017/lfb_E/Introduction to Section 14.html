<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The early Christians spread the good news of the Kingdom to the most distant part of the earth. Jesus directed them where to preach and miraculously enabled them to teach people in their own languages. Jehovah gave them boldness and the power to overcome vicious persecution.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jesus gave the apostle John a vision of Jehovah’s glory. In another vision, John saw the Kingdom of the heavens conquer Satan and end his domination forever. John saw Jesus ruling as King and his 144,000 corulers with him. John also saw the whole earth become a paradise where everyone worships Jehovah in peace and unity.</p>

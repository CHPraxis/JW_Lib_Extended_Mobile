LESSON 75
The Devil Tests Jesus









After Jesus was baptized, the holy spirit led him into the wilderness. He did not eat anything for 40 days, and he got very hungry. Then the Devil came to tempt Jesus and said to him: ‘If you are really God’s Son, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.’ But Jesus answered by quoting the Scriptures: ‘It is written that you need more than food to live. You need to listen to every word that Jehovah says.’
Next, the Devil challenged Jesus: ‘If you are really God’s Son, jump off the highest point of the temple. It is written that God will send his angels to catch you.’ But Jesus again quoted the Scriptures: ‘It is written that you should not put Jehovah to the test.’





Then, Satan showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and their riches and glory and said: ‘I will give you all of these kingdoms and their glory if you worship me just once.’ But Jesus answered: ‘Go away, Satan! It is written that you should worship only Jehovah.’
Then the Devil went away, and angels came and gave Jesus food to eat. From then on, Jesus preached the good news of the Kingdom. It was the work that he was sent to earth to do. People loved what Jesus taught them, and they followed him everywhere he went.



“When [the Devil] speaks the lie, he speaks according to his own disposition, because he is a liar and the father of the lie.”​—John 8:44

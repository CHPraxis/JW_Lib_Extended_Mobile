<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Elizabeth had a young relative named Mary, who lived in the city of Nazareth in Galilee. Mary was engaged to Joseph, a carpenter. When Elizabeth was six months pregnant, the angel Gabriel appeared to Mary. He said: ‘Good day, Mary. Jehovah has greatly favored you.’ She did not understand what Gabriel meant. He then told her: ‘You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you must name him Jesus. He will rule as King. His Kingdom will last forever.’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Mary said: ‘But I am a virgin. How could I have a child?’ Gabriel said: ‘Nothing is impossible for Jehovah. Holy spirit will come upon you, and you will have a son. Your relative Elizabeth has also become pregnant.’ Then Mary said: ‘I am Jehovah’s slave girl. May it happen to me just as you have said.’</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span id="page165" class="pageNum" data-no="165" data-before-text="165"></span>Mary went to a city in the hills to visit Elizabeth. When Mary greeted her, Elizabeth felt the baby inside of her jump. Filled with holy spirit, she said: ‘Mary, Jehovah has blessed you. It is an honor to have the mother of my Lord in my home.’ Mary said: ‘I praise Jehovah with all my heart.’ Mary stayed with Elizabeth for three months, and then she went home to Nazareth.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">When Joseph learned that Mary was pregnant, he wanted to end the engagement. But an angel appeared to him in a dream and said: ‘Don’t be afraid to marry her. She hasn’t done anything wrong.’ So Joseph took Mary as his wife and brought her to his home.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah chose Jeremiah to be a prophet to the people of Judah. He told him to preach to the people and warn them that they needed to stop doing bad things. Jeremiah said: ‘But Jehovah, I am only a boy. I don’t know how to speak to the people.’ Jehovah told him: ‘Do not be afraid. I will tell you what to say. I will help you.’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jehovah told Jeremiah to gather the elders of the people, smash a clay jar in front of them, and say: ‘Jerusalem will be smashed just like this.’ When Jeremiah did what Jehovah said, the elders got very angry. A priest named Pashhur beat Jeremiah and put him in wooden stocks. All night long, Jeremiah could not move. Pashhur let him out the next morning. Jeremiah said: ‘I can’t take this anymore. I’m going to stop preaching.’ But did he really give up? No. When Jeremiah thought about it some more, he said: ‘Jehovah’s message is like a fire inside of me. I cannot stop preaching.’ Jeremiah continued to warn the people.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Years passed, and there was a new king in Judah. The priests and the false prophets hated Jeremiah’s message. They told the princes: ‘This man deserves to die.’ Jeremiah said: ‘If you kill me, you will kill an innocent man. I speak Jehovah’s words, not my own.’ When the princes heard that, they said: ‘This man does not deserve to die.’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jeremiah kept on preaching, and the princes got very angry. <span id="page139" class="pageNum" data-no="139" data-before-text="139"></span>They asked the king to put Jeremiah to death. The king said that they could do whatever they wanted with Jeremiah. They took Jeremiah and threw him into a deep, muddy well, hoping that he would die there. Jeremiah began to sink into the mud.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Then a court official named Ebed-melech told the king: ‘The princes have thrown Jeremiah into a well! If we leave him there, he will die.’ The king commanded Ebed-melech to take 30 men with him and pull Jeremiah out of the well. Shouldn’t we be like Jeremiah, who did not allow anything to stop him from preaching?</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">When the Israelites finally reached the Promised Land, the tabernacle became the center of true worship there. Priests taught the Law, and judges guided the nation. This section illustrates the profound impact that a person’s decisions and actions can have on others. Each Israelite had a personal responsibility toward Jehovah and his fellow man. Highlight the influence that Deborah, Naomi, Joshua, Hannah, Jephthah’s daughter, and Samuel had on their communities. Emphasize that even some non-Israelites, such as Rahab, Ruth, Jael, and the Gibeonites, decided to side with the Israelites because they knew that God was with them.</p>

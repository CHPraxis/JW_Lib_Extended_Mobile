<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Isaac was 40 years old when he married Rebekah. He loved her very much. In time, they had two children​—twin boys.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The older boy was called Esau, and the younger one, Jacob. Esau loved being outdoors, and he was good at hunting animals. But Jacob liked to stay at home.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In those days, the oldest son was given most of the land and money when his father died. That was called an inheritance. In Isaac’s family, the inheritance also included having a part in the promises that Jehovah had made to Abraham. Esau did not care much about those promises, but Jacob knew that they were very important.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">One day Esau came home very tired from a long day of hunting. He smelled the good food Jacob was cooking and said: ‘I’m starving! Give me some of that red stew!’ Jacob said: ‘I will, but first promise me that I can have your inheritance.’ Esau said: ‘I don’t care about my inheritance! You can have it. I just want to eat.’ Do you think that was a wise thing for Esau to do? No, it wasn’t. Esau gave away something very precious, just for a bowl of stew.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">When Isaac was very old, it was time to give a blessing to his oldest son. But Rebekah helped Jacob, the younger son, <span id="page35" class="pageNum" data-no="35" data-before-text="35"></span>to get the blessing. When Esau found out, he was very angry and he planned to kill his twin brother. Isaac and Rebekah wanted to protect Jacob, so they told him: ‘Go and stay with your mother’s brother, Laban, until Esau calms down.’ Jacob listened to his parents’ advice and ran for his life.</p>

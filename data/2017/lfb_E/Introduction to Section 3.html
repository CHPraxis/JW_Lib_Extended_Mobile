<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In the years following the Flood, the Bible names very few people who served Jehovah. Among those who did serve him was Abraham, who was known as Jehovah’s friend. Why was he called Jehovah’s friend? If you are a parent, help your child to see that Jehovah is interested in him personally and wants to help him. Like Abraham and other faithful men, such as Lot and Jacob, we can freely ask Jehovah for his help. We can be confident that Jehovah will keep every promise that he makes.</p>

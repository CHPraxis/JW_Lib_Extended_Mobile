<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In Galilee, Jesus met with his followers. He gave them a very important command: ‘Go and make disciples of people from all lands. Teach them the things I taught you, and baptize them.’ Then he promised: ‘Remember, I will always be with you.’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">During the 40 days after his resurrection, Jesus appeared to hundreds of his disciples in Galilee and Jerusalem. He taught them important lessons and performed many miracles. Then Jesus met with his apostles for the last time, on the Mount of Olives. He said: ‘Do not leave Jerusalem. Keep waiting for what the Father has promised.’</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">His apostles didn’t understand what he meant. They asked him: ‘Are you now going to become King of Israel?’ Jesus said: ‘It is not yet Jehovah’s time for me to become King. Soon you will receive power from holy spirit, and you will be my witnesses. Go preach in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the farthest parts of the earth.’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Then Jesus was lifted up into the sky and a cloud covered him. His disciples kept looking up, but he was gone.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The disciples left the Mount of Olives and went to Jerusalem. They regularly met together in an upper room and prayed. They were waiting for Jesus to give them further instructions.</p>

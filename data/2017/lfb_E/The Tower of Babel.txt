LESSON 7
The Tower of Babel




After the Flood, Noah’s sons and their wives had many children. Their families grew, and they began to spread to different parts of the earth, just as Jehovah had told them to do.
But some of the families did not obey Jehovah. They said: ‘Let’s build a city and stay here. We’ll make a tower so tall that its top will reach all the way to heaven. Then we will be famous.’
Jehovah was not happy with what those people were doing, so he decided to stop them. Do you know how he did it? He suddenly made them speak different languages. Since they could no longer understand one another, they stopped the building work. The city that they had been building became known as Babel, which means “Confusion.” People began to move away and live all over the earth. But they kept doing bad things in the new places where they lived. Were there any who still loved Jehovah? We will find out in the next chapter.



“Everyone who exalts himself will be humiliated, but whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”​—Luke 18:14

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Joseph and Mary lived in Nazareth with Jesus and their other sons and daughters. Joseph supported the family by working as a carpenter, and he taught them about Jehovah and his Law. The family went to the synagogue regularly to worship and to Jerusalem for the Passover each year.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When Jesus was 12 years old, his family made the long trip to Jerusalem as usual. The city was crowded with people who had come to celebrate the Passover. Afterward, Joseph and Mary began the journey home, thinking that Jesus was traveling with the group. But when they looked for him among their relatives, they couldn’t find him.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">They returned to Jerusalem, and for three days, they searched for their son. Finally, they went to the temple. There was Jesus, sitting in the middle of the teachers, listening carefully and asking good questions. The teachers were so <span id="page171" class="pageNum" data-no="171" data-before-text="171"></span>impressed with Jesus that they began asking him questions. And they were amazed by his answers. They could see that he understood Jehovah’s Law.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Joseph and Mary had been very worried. Mary said: ‘Child, we have been looking everywhere for you! Where have you been?’ Jesus said: ‘Did you not know that I must be here in my Father’s house?’</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jesus went home with his parents to Nazareth. Joseph taught Jesus how to do the work of a carpenter. What sort of person do you think Jesus was as a young man? As he grew up, Jesus increased in wisdom and in favor with God and men.</p>

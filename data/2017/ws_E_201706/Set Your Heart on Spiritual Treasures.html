<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jesus gave us the assignment to preach and teach the good news about God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>) The apostle Paul described the ministry as a treasure carried in earthen vessels, or clay jars.

But the message we preach is like a precious treasure because it can result in everlasting life for us and for those who listen to us. That is why Paul said: “I do all things for the sake of the good news, in order to share it with others.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:23-46:9:23" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 9:23</a>) Paul worked hard to teach others about God’s Kingdom. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:14-45:1:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 1:14, 15;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:2-55:4:2" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> <strong>2 Timothy 4:2</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Love for the good news helped him to keep preaching despite facing cruel persecution.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>One way Paul showed that he loved the ministry was by using every opportunity to speak to others. Like Paul and the early Christians, we too share the good news with people from house to house, in public places, and wherever else we may find them.

If we are able, perhaps we can serve as an auxiliary pioneer or a regular pioneer.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Irene, an unmarried sister in the United States, wanted to share the good news with people who spoke Russian. So in 1993, she joined a Russian group in New York City. At that time, there were only about 20 publishers in that group. After 20 years, Irene said, “I still do not speak Russian perfectly.” Yet, Jehovah has helped her and other publishers to preach to people in that language. As a result, today there are six Russian congregations in New York City. Irene studied the Bible with many people, and 15 of them got baptized. Some of them serve as Bethelites, pioneers, and elders. Irene says, <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>“When I think of other goals I could have pursued, I can’t imagine one that would have brought me more joy.” Irene really treasures her ministry!</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:19-44:14:22" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 14:19-22</a>) For example, between the years 1930 and 1944, our brothers in the United States were severely persecuted. But they still continued to preach. When the authorities tried to stop them, our brothers went to court and won many cases. In 1943, Brother Knorr mentioned one of the victories we won in the U.S. Supreme Court. He said that there would not have been any cases to bring to that Court if the brothers had not continued preaching. He added that because the brothers all over the world kept preaching, they proved that persecution is not successful. Brothers in other countries have also won similar legal cases. Yes, our love for the ministry will not allow persecution to stop us from preaching.</p>

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>13, 14. </strong>What is the “treasure store” that Jesus referred to at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:52-40:13:52" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matthew 13:52</a>, and how do we fill it?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>A third treasure that Jehovah has given to us is all the truths that we <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>have learned. Jehovah is the Source of truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:7:28-10:7:28" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Samuel 7:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:31:5-19:31:5" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Psalm 31:5</a>) And as a generous Father, he wants to share these truths with us. So far, we have learned many of these by reading his Word and our publications and by attending our conventions, assemblies, and weekly meetings. As we collect more and more truths, we will have what Jesus called a “treasure store” of truths “both new and old.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:52-40:13:52" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 13:52</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jehovah will help us to fill our “treasure store” if we search for truths the same way that we would search for hidden treasures. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:4-20:2:7" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 2:4-7</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>How do we do that?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>We need to study the Bible and our publications regularly and do careful research. This will help us to discover “new” truths, ones we did not know before. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:8-6:1:9" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Joshua 1:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:2-19:1:3" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Psalm 1:2, 3</a>) The first issue of the <em>Watch Tower, </em>published in July 1879, compared the truth to a flower hidden among many weeds. In order to find a flower like that, a person must search for it carefully. And when he finds it, he should not be content to have only one. He should continue his search to find more and more flowers. In a similar way, we should not be content when we find only one truth. We should be eager to continue searching for many more truths.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>15. </strong>Why may we call some truths “old,” and which do you especially value?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>When we started studying the Bible, we learned some wonderful truths. We may call them “old” truths because we learned them first. What are some of these truths? In the beginning, we learned that Jehovah is our Creator and that he has a purpose for humans. We also learned that God sent his Son to earth to die as a ransom sacrifice so that we could be free from sin and death. And we learned that God’s Kingdom will end all suffering and that we can live forever on earth in peace and happiness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Revelation 4:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 21:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>16. </strong>What do we need to do when there are adjustments in our understanding of Bible truths?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>At times, our understanding of a Bible prophecy or a scripture may be adjusted. When that happens, it is important to take the time to study the adjustment and meditate on it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:11-44:17:11" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Acts 17:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:15-54:4:15" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 4:15</a>) We not only need to understand the main differences between the old understanding and the new one, but we also need to pay attention to the details of the new understanding. Such a careful study will guarantee that the new truth becomes part of our collection of Bible truths. Why is it good for us to make such efforts?</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>17, 18. </strong>How can holy spirit help us?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Jesus taught that God’s spirit can help us to remember things that we learned in the past. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:25-43:14:26" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 14:25, 26</a>) How can this help us when we preach the good news? Consider the experience of a brother named Peter. In 1970, he was 19 years old and <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>had recently begun serving at Bethel in Britain. Peter was preaching from house to house and met a bearded middle-aged man. He asked the man if he would like to understand the Bible. The man was a Jewish rabbi, and he was shocked that a young man thought he could teach him the Bible. To test Peter, the rabbi asked, “So, my boy, what language was the book of Daniel written in?” Peter said, “Part of it was written in Aramaic.” “The rabbi,” Peter remembers, “was surprised that I knew the answer​—but not as surprised as I was! How did I know the answer? When I went home and checked the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines from the previous months, I found an article explaining that Daniel was written in Aramaic.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:4-27:2:4" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Daniel 2:4</a>, footnote) Yes, the holy spirit can help us to remember information that we have read and put in our treasure store in the past.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:11-42:12:12" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Luke 12:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:13-42:21:15" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 21:13-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>If we love the truths we learn from Jehovah and we are grateful for them, we will want to keep adding them to our treasure store. The more we do this, the more prepared we will feel to teach others.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Jehovah is the only Sovereign of the universe because he is <strong>the almighty God and Creator. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:11-13:29:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 29:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:24-44:4:24" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Acts 4:24</a>) In a heavenly vision, Christ’s 144,000 fellow kings said: “You are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they came into existence and were created.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 4:11</a>) Jehovah created all things, so he has the right to rule over everyone, whether on earth or in heaven.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Why does free will not give us the right to rebel against God?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Satan has not created anything. So he does not have any right to rule the universe. Both Satan and the first human couple were defiant when they rebelled against Jehovah’s sovereignty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jeremiah 10:23</a>) Did their free will give them the <strong>right </strong>to reject Jehovah’s rulership? No. Free will gives someone the right to make choices and decisions but not the right to rebel against the Creator, Jehovah. Clearly, rebelling against God is a <strong>misuse </strong>of free will. As humans, we need Jehovah’s rule and guidance.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Think about another reason why Jehovah has the right to rule. He uses his authority in a <strong>perfectly just </strong>way. He tells us: “I am Jehovah, the One showing loyal love, justice, and righteousness in the earth, for in these things I take delight.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:9:24-24:9:24" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jeremiah 9:24</a>) Jehovah does not need human laws to help him decide what is right. Instead, he sets the standard for what is right. And based on his own perfect justice, Jehovah gave laws to humans. The psalmist said: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.” So every law, principle, and decision that comes from Jehovah is right. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:14-19:89:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 89:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:128-19:119:128" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 119:128</a>) Satan claims that Jehovah is not a fair Ruler. Yet, Satan himself cannot bring justice to the world.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What is one reason why Jehovah has the right to rule?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Another reason why Jehovah has the right to rule is that he has the <strong>knowledge and wisdom </strong>to take care of the universe. We see this in the way he gave his Son the ability to heal diseases that no doctor could cure. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:23-40:4:24" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 4:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:25-41:5:29" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Mark 5:25-29</a>) Although these are miracles to us, they were not miracles to Jehovah.

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>How is Jehovah wiser than anyone in Satan’s world?</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>As we have seen, the Bible clearly shows that Jehovah has the right to rule. It also shows why he is the best Ruler. One reason is that he <strong>rules with love. </strong>We feel close to him when we think of how he is “merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:6-2:34:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Exodus 34:6</a>) God treats us with dignity and respect. He cares for us better than we can care for ourselves. The Devil says that Jehovah holds back good things from His servants, but this is a lie. God even gave his precious Son so that we could have the hope of living forever.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:84:11-19:84:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 84:11;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:32-45:8:32" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> <strong>Romans 8:32</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Jehovah loves all of his people as a group. But he is also <strong>very interested in each person. </strong>Think of what happened in ancient times. For about three hundred years, Jehovah used judges to guide his nation and give them victory over their enemies. Yet during all this time, Jehovah still paid attention to individuals. One of these was a woman named Ruth. She was not an Israelite, and she had given up many things in order to become a worshipper of Jehovah. He rewarded her with a husband and a son. But more than that, Ruth’s son became part of the family line that led to the Messiah. Jehovah also had Ruth’s life story written down in the Bible, in a book that is named after her. How do you imagine Ruth will feel when she comes back to life and learns about these things?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:4:13-8:4:13" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ruth 4:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:5-40:1:5" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Matthew 1:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:16-40:1:16" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Jehovah’s rulership is not harsh. Rather, those who obey him feel free and <strong>joyful. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:17-47:3:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>) David said of Jehovah: “In his presence are majesty and splendor; strength and joy are in his dwelling place.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:16:7-13:16:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 16:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:16:27-13:16:27" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 27</a>) The psalmist Ethan wrote: “Happy are the people who know the joyful shouting.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>The more we meditate on Jehovah’s goodness, the more convinced we become that his rule is best.

He generously gives us far more than we need. Anything Jehovah asks us to do is for our own good. Even if we have to make sacrifices, we will always be happy if we obey Jehovah.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 48:17</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>We learn in the Bible that after the Thousand Year Reign of Christ, some will rebel against Jehovah’s sovereignty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:7-66:20:8" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Revelation 20:7, 8</a>) What will cause them to do that? At that time, the Devil will try to make people behave in a selfish way. He has always done that. He may try to convince people that they can live forever without obeying Jehovah. This could never be true. But we should ask ourselves, ‘Would I believe a lie like that?’ If we really love Jehovah and are convinced that he is good and that he has the right to rule the universe, then a lie like that will be disgusting to us. We will want to live only under the sovereignty of Jehovah, who rules with love.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>We learn from the Bible that Jehovah always uses his power in a loving way. Family heads and elders who love Jehovah’s sovereignty will imitate him and not be harsh or controlling. The apostle Paul tried hard to imitate God and his Son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:1-46:11:1" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>) He did not embarrass others or force them to do what was right.

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>We can also support God’s sovereignty by the decisions we make. Jehovah does not give us a specific command for each situation in life. Instead, he tells us how he thinks. This helps us to understand what we should do. For example, Jehovah does not give Christians a list of what they should or should not wear. Instead, he explains that we should look modest and dignified as his Witnesses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:10" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:9, 10</a>) He wants us to think about how our decisions affect others.

If so, they could benefit from thinking about how Jehovah treated the ancient nation of Israel. Jehovah described himself as being like a husband to his people.

Even if there are problems in their marriage, they do not look for an unscriptural way to end it.

Sexual immorality is the only Scriptural reason why someone could divorce and be free to remarry.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> In a similar way, people can be caught. For example, the Israelites had almost reached the Promised Land when they camped on the Plains of Moab. The king of Moab promised to give a man named Balaam a lot of money if he would bring a curse on Israel. Eventually, Balaam found a way to make the Israelites bring a curse on themselves. He carefully chose the bait. He sent young Moabite women into the Israelite camp to seduce the men.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:22:1-4:22:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Numbers 22:1-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:31:15-4:31:16" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 31:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:14-66:2:14" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Revelation 2:14</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:12-58:3:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 3:12</a>) Still, they were seduced by sexual immorality.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">7, 8. What is sexual immorality? Why is it a serious matter?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Many people today have a brazen attitude and openly disrespect God’s laws on sex. In the Bible, sexual immorality refers to sexual activity between people who are not Scripturally married to each other. It includes sexual activity between people of the same gender and sex between humans and animals. Sexual activity can be sexual relations, oral sex, anal sex, or touching another person’s genitals in a sexual way.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102017578/118-120">Endnote 23</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> The Bible makes it clear that if someone continues to practice sexual immorality, he cannot remain in the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:15-66:22:15" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Revelation 22:15</a>) Additionally, an immoral person loses respect for himself and the trust of others. Immorality always results in problems. It usually leads to a guilty conscience and often brings unwanted pregnancy, marriage problems, disease, or even death. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Galatians 6:7, 8</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> If a person really stopped and thought about what immorality leads to, he probably would not want to be immoral. But often a person is thinking only about satisfying his own desires when he takes the first step toward immorality. That first step often involves pornography.</p>

Today, pornography is present everywhere​—in magazines, books, music, and television shows, as well as on the Internet. Many feel that pornography is harmless, but it is actually very dangerous.

Once a person becomes involved with pornography, he starts on a path that can lead to such things as a habit of masturbation, marriage problems, and even divorce.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:24-45:1:27" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Romans 1:24-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:19-49:4:19" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ephesians 4:19</a>; see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102017578/121-123">Endnote 24</a>.</p>

Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn sin, when it has been carried out, brings forth death.” So when wrong thoughts enter your mind, get rid of them immediately. If you accidentally see erotic images, look away! Turn off the computer, or change the channel. Do not allow wrong desires into your life.

His friends at school felt that these things were a normal part of growing up, but he said: “It damaged my conscience, and I was drawn into a life of immorality.” He realized he needed to control his desires, and with Jehovah’s help, he was able to break his habit.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>JEHOVAH has given every one of us a wonderful gift. It is the gift of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27</a>) He wants us to have the best life possible. So he has provided principles that teach us how we can make good decisions. We should use these principles to help us to “distinguish” between “right and wrong.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:14</a>) When we do so, we are allowing Jehovah to train us to think clearly.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Life can be very complicated. Situations often come up that are not covered by a direct law in the Bible. For example, we may need to make decisions about medical treatments that involve the use of blood. How can we make decisions that will please Jehovah? The Bible contains principles that teach us how Jehovah views life and blood. If we understand these principles, we will be able to make wise decisions and keep a good conscience. <span id="page90" class="pageNum" data-no="90" data-before-text="90"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:6-20:2:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:6-11</a>) Now, let’s examine some of those principles.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> The Bible teaches us that blood is sacred because it represents life. And life is precious to Jehovah. After Cain murdered his brother, Jehovah told him: “Your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:10-1:4:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 4:10</a>) Abel’s blood represented his life; when Cain killed Abel, he took his life away.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> After the Flood of Noah’s day, God told humans that they could eat meat. But he specifically said: “Flesh with its life​—its blood—​you must not eat.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:4-1:9:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 9:4</a>) This command applies to all of Noah’s descendants, including us. Plainly, to Jehovah, blood represents life. And we need to view blood the same way.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 36:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">5, 6. How did the Law of Moses show how Jehovah views life and blood?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> In the Law Jehovah gave to Moses, He stated: “If any man . . . eats any sort of blood, I will certainly set my face against the one who is eating the blood, and I will cut him off from among his people. For the life of the flesh is in the blood.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:10-3:17:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Leviticus 17:10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> The Law of Moses said that when someone killed an animal for food, he had to pour its blood onto the ground. This showed that the animal’s <span id="page91" class="pageNum" data-no="91" data-before-text="91"></span>life was given back to its Creator, Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:12:16-5:12:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 12:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:4-26:18:4" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 18:4</a>) But Jehovah did not expect the Israelites to go to extremes when they bled an animal. As long as they did all they reasonably could to remove the blood, they could eat the meat with a clean conscience. By showing respect for the animal’s blood, they showed that they respected the Giver of life, Jehovah. The Law also commanded the Israelites to offer animals as sacrifices to cover sins.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102017578/91-93">Endnotes 19</a> and <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102017578/94-96">20</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> We can see the value of blood from something that David did when he was fighting the Philistines. David’s men saw that he was very thirsty, so they went into dangerous enemy territory and risked their lives to get him water. But when they brought it to David, he refused to drink it and “poured it out to Jehovah.” David said: “It is unthinkable on my part, O Jehovah, that I should do this! Should I drink the blood of the men going at the risk of their lives?” David understood how precious life and blood are to God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:23:15-10:23:17" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Samuel 23:15-17</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> By the time of the early Christians, God’s people no longer had to offer animal sacrifices. But they still needed to have the correct view of blood. “Abstaining from . . . blood” was one of the few parts of the Law that Jehovah required Christians to keep. This was as important as avoiding immorality or idolatry.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:28-44:15:29" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s Witnesses understand that “abstaining from . . . blood” involves more than not eating or drinking it. It means not accepting blood transfusions, not donating blood, and not storing our own blood for transfusion. It also means not accepting transfusions of any of the four main parts of blood​—red cells, white cells, platelets, and plasma.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> These four main parts of blood may be broken down into smaller parts called blood fractions. Each Christian must decide whether or not he will accept blood fractions. The same applies to medical procedures that make use of a patient’s own blood. Each one must decide how his own blood will be handled <em>in the course of a surgical procedure, medical test, or current therapy.</em>​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102017578/97-114">Endnote 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">12. (a) Why are our decisions in matters of conscience important to Jehovah? (b) How can we make wise decisions regarding medical procedures?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Does Jehovah really care about our decisions in matters of conscience? Yes, he does. Jehovah is <span id="page94" class="pageNum" data-no="94" data-before-text="94"></span>interested in our thoughts and motives. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:3-20:17:3" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 17:3;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:12-20:24:12" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> <strong>24:12</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Since that is the case, when we are making a decision involving medical treatment, we need to pray for Jehovah’s guidance and then research the treatment. After that, we use our Bible-trained conscience to make our decision. We should not ask others what they would do if they were in our situation, nor should others try to influence our decision. Each Christian will “carry his own load.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:5-48:6:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Galatians 6:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:12-45:14:12" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Romans 14:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Anything Jehovah asks us to do is for our own good and shows his love for us.

Our love for Jehovah moves us to avoid blood transfusions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:20-44:15:20" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 15:20</a>) This also protects our health. Most people today know about some of the risks of blood transfusions, and many doctors believe that operating without blood is better for their patients’ health. It is clear that Jehovah’s ways are wise and loving.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:9-23:55:9" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 55:9;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:21-43:14:21" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> John 14:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:23-43:14:23" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 23</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> God’s laws have always been for the good of his people. Jehovah gave the ancient Israelites laws to protect them from serious accidents. For example, <span id="page95" class="pageNum" data-no="95" data-before-text="95"></span>one law said that a homeowner should build a low wall around his flat roof so that no one would fall off. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:22:8-5:22:8" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 22:8</a>) Another law had to do with animals. If someone owned a violent bull, he was responsible for keeping it under control so that it would not attack or kill anyone. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:28-2:21:29" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Exodus 21:28, 29</a>) If an Israelite did not obey these laws, it was his fault if someone died as a result.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> From these laws we can see that life is precious to Jehovah. How should knowing this affect us? We should show that we respect life by the way we care for our home and vehicle, the way we drive, and the way we choose our recreation. Some people, especially young people, feel that nothing bad can happen to them, so they take risks and ignore potential dangers. But that is not how Jehovah wants us to behave. He wants us to treat all life as important​—both our own life and the lives of others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:11:9-21:11:10" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 11:9, 10</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Every human life is important to Jehovah. Even an unborn baby is precious to him. Under the Law of Moses, if a person accidentally hurt a pregnant woman and either she <strong>or</strong> her baby died, Jehovah held that person guilty of manslaughter. This meant that even though it was an accident, someone had been killed and the life had to be compensated for. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:22-2:21:23" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>Exodus 21:22, 23</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> To God, an unborn baby is a living person.

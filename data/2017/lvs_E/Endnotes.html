<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sn">God’s laws are based on his principles. These principles are basic truths that we find in the Bible. They help us to understand how God thinks and feels about matters. Principles help us to make good decisions in life and to do what is right. They are especially helpful in situations that are not specifically covered by God’s laws.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 5:3</a>) If we love and trust God, we will follow his advice in all situations.

It is good for us to obey Jehovah, because he teaches us how to have a good life now and promises us that we will enjoy many blessings in the future.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17</a>.</p>

They also help us to know how to be loving, how to make good decisions, and how to be kind to others. Although the world’s standards continue to get lower, Jehovah’s standards do not change.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="sn">Since we are imperfect, it is easy for us to be selfish and proud. But Jehovah expects us to be humble.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:1-18:38:4" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 38:1-4</a>) Another important part of humility is learning to think more about others and what will be good for them rather than ourselves. Pride often makes a person believe that he is better than others. A humble person looks at himself honestly and sees both his strengths and his weaknesses. He is not afraid to admit his mistakes, to apologize, and to accept suggestions and counsel. A humble person relies on Jehovah and follows his direction.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:5-60:5:5" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:5</a>.</p>

The responsibilities of the family head include providing the family with food, clothing, and a place to live. It is very important for the family head to take the lead in helping the family to worship Jehovah. For example, he makes sure that they regularly attend congregation meetings, share in the field ministry, and study the Bible together. The family head also takes the lead in making decisions. He always tries to imitate Jesus by being kind and reasonable, never cruel or harsh.

These four main parts of blood may be broken down into smaller parts, called blood fractions.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="sn">Christians refuse transfusions of whole blood or of any of its four main parts. But should they accept blood fractions? The Bible does not provide specific details. So each Christian must make his own decision based on his Bible-trained conscience.</p>
<p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="sn">Some Christians choose to refuse all blood fractions. They may reason that God’s Law to Israel required that any blood removed from an animal be poured “out on the ground.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:12:22-5:12:24" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 12:22-24</a>.</p>
<p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="sn">Others make a different choice. Their conscience allows them to accept some blood fractions. They may reason that small fractions no longer represent the life of the creature from which the blood was taken.</p>
<p id="p102" data-pid="102" class="sn">When making decisions about blood fractions, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="su">  Am I aware that refusing all blood fractions means that I will not accept some medicines that fight diseases or that might help stop bleeding?</p>

<p id="p105" data-pid="105" class="sn"><strong>Medical procedures.</strong> As Christians, we do not donate blood, nor do we store our own blood weeks in advance of surgery. However, there are other procedures that make use of a patient’s own blood. Each Christian must decide for himself how his own blood will be handled <em>in the course of a surgical procedure, medical test, or current therapy.</em> During the course of such procedures, the patient’s own blood may be completely separated for a time from the patient.​—For more information, see <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:2000767/"><em>The Watchtower,</em> October 15, 2000, pages 30-31</a>.</p>
<p id="p106" data-pid="106" class="sn">For example, there is a procedure called hemodilution, in which immediately before surgery a portion of a patient’s own blood is removed and replaced with a volume expander. Later, during or shortly after the surgery, the blood is returned to the patient.</p>
<p id="p107" data-pid="107" class="sn"><span id="page248" class="pageNum" data-no="248" data-before-text="248"></span>Another procedure is called cell salvage.

<p id="p108" data-pid="108" class="sn">Each doctor may perform these procedures slightly differently. So before accepting any surgical procedure, medical test, or current therapy, a Christian needs to find out exactly how his own blood will be handled.</p>
<p id="p109" data-pid="109" class="sn">When making decisions about medical procedures that make use of your own blood, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p110" data-pid="110" class="su">  If some of my blood will be diverted outside my body and the flow might even be interrupted for a time, will my conscience allow me to view this blood as still part of me, thus not requiring that it be poured “out on the ground”?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:12:23-5:12:24" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 12:23, 24</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p146" data-pid="146" class="sn">In most cases, when disagreements are handled promptly and peaceably, they do not need to become major issues. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:23-40:5:26" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Matthew 5:23-26</a>) For all Christians, their first priority should be to bring glory to Jehovah and keep the congregation united.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="71-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:5" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 13:4, 5</a>.</p>
<p id="p147" data-pid="147" class="sn">If Christians have a disagreement over a business matter, they should try to settle it without taking each other to court. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:1-46:6:8" data-bid="72-1" class="b">First Corinthians 6:1-8</a> records the apostle Paul’s counsel concerning lawsuits between Christians. Taking our brother to court could reflect badly on Jehovah and on the congregation. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:15-40:18:17" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Matthew 18:15-17</a>, three steps are listed that Christians should follow to settle such serious accusations as slander or fraud. (1) They should first try to settle the matter between themselves. (2) If that doesn’t work, they can ask one or two mature members of the congregation for help. (3) Then, if necessary, they can turn the matter over to the body of elders to handle. If the situation reaches that point, the elders will use Bible principles to try to help all involved to reach a peaceful agreement. If certain individuals involved are not willing to follow Bible standards, it may be necessary for the congregation elders to take judicial action.</p>
<p id="p148" data-pid="148" class="sn"><span id="page254" class="pageNum" data-no="254" data-before-text="254"></span>There are some situations in which a lawsuit may be legally necessary, perhaps situations involving divorce, child custody, alimony, insurance compensation, bankruptcy, or wills. If a Christian uses such legal means to settle the matter as peaceably as he can, he is not violating Paul’s counsel.</p>
<p id="p149" data-pid="149" class="sn">If a serious crime is involved, such as rape, child abuse, assault, major theft, or murder, then a Christian who reports such a crime to the secular authorities does not violate Paul’s counsel.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p152" data-pid="152" class="sn">From the time of the garden of Eden, Satan has been trying to deceive humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:6" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="74-2" class="b"> Revelation 12:9</a>) He knows that if he can distort our thinking, he can influence us to do what is bad. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:4-47:4:4" data-bid="75-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="75-2" class="b"> James 1:14, 15</a>) He uses politics, religion, commerce, entertainment, education, and many other things to promote his way of thinking and make it seem acceptable.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:30-43:14:30" data-bid="76-1" class="b">John 14:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p153" data-pid="153" class="sn">Satan knows that he does not have much time left to deceive people. So he is doing all he can to mislead as many people as possible. He especially wants to mislead those who serve Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Revelation 12:12</a>) If we are not careful, the Devil could gradually corrupt our thinking. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:12-46:10:12" data-bid="78-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>) For example, Jehovah wants marriages to last. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:5-40:19:6" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Matthew 19:5, 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:9-40:19:9" data-bid="79-2" class="b"> 9</a>) But many people today view marriage as a casual agreement that can be easily broken. Many movies and television programs promote this idea too. We must make sure that we do not allow the world’s view of marriage to affect us.</p>
<p id="p154" data-pid="154" class="sn">Another way Satan tries to deceive us is by promoting an independent attitude. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:4-55:3:4" data-bid="80-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:4</a>) If we are not careful, we could lose our respect for the authority of those appointed by Jehovah. For example, a brother might begin to resist the guidance of the congregation elders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:5-58:12:5" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:5</a>) Or a sister might start to question <span id="page255" class="pageNum" data-no="255" data-before-text="255"></span>Jehovah’s arrangement of headship in the family.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:3-46:11:3" data-bid="82-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p155" data-pid="155" class="sn">We must be determined not to allow the Devil to influence our thinking. Rather, we want to imitate Jehovah’s thinking and keep our “minds fixed on the things above.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:2-51:3:2" data-bid="83-1" class="b">Colossians 3:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:11-47:2:11" data-bid="83-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 2:11</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p158" data-pid="158" class="sn">We all want to be healthy and to get the best care we can when we are not well. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:38:21-23:38:21" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Isaiah 38:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:25-41:5:26" data-bid="84-2" class="b"> Mark 5:25, 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:34-42:10:34" data-bid="84-3" class="b"> Luke 10:34</a>) Today, there are many medical techniques and treatments available from doctors and others. When we are deciding what treatment we will accept, it is important that we follow Bible principles. We remember that only God’s Kingdom will heal us permanently. We do not want to become so focused on our health that we neglect our worship of Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:16-54:4:16" data-bid="85-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 4:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p159" data-pid="159" class="sn">We must carefully avoid any treatment that appears to use power from the demons. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:18:10-5:18:12" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 18:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:13-23:1:13" data-bid="86-2" class="b"> Isaiah 1:13</a>) So before we accept any treatment or medicine, we need to find out all we can about what is behind it and what thinking it promotes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:15-20:14:15" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:15</a>) We must not forget that Satan would like to trick us into getting involved with demonism. If we even suspect that a treatment is connected with demonism, it is best to avoid it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="88-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:8</a>.</p>

For a marriage to last and be happy, a couple needs guidance from God. So let us discuss the Bible’s answer to these questions: What are some benefits of marriage?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:11-40:19:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 19:11, 12</a>) And the apostle Paul said that there are advantages <span id="page133" class="pageNum" data-no="133" data-before-text="133"></span>to being single.

You should not allow your friends, family, or culture to pressure you into getting married.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 4. What are some advantages of a good marriage?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> The Bible says that marriage too is a gift from God and that it has some advantages. Jehovah said of the first man, Adam: “It is not good for the man to continue to be alone. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:18-1:2:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 2:18</a>) Jehovah created Eve to be Adam’s wife, and they became the first human family. If a couple have children, their marriage should create a stable environment in which they can raise them. But having children is not the only purpose of marriage.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:3-19:127:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 127:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:1-49:6:4" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Ephesians 6:1-4</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">5, 6. How can a marriage be like “a threefold cord”?</p>

For if one of them falls, the other can help his partner up. But what will happen to the one who falls with no one to help him up? . . . And a threefold cord cannot quickly be torn apart.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:4:9-21:4:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> A good marriage can be the closest of friendships between two people who help, comfort, and protect each other. Love can make a marriage strong, but the marriage will become even stronger when a husband and wife worship Jehovah. Then their marriage can become like “a threefold cord,” a <span id="page134" class="pageNum" data-no="134" data-before-text="134"></span>rope of three strands tightly woven together. A rope like that is much stronger than a rope of only two strands. A marriage will be strong when Jehovah is part of it.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> After a couple get married, they can enjoy satisfying each other’s natural sexual desires. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:5:18-20:5:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 5:18</a>) However, if a person gets married only to satisfy these desires, he or she may not choose a partner wisely. That’s why the Bible says marriage should take place after a person is past “the bloom of youth,” the time in life when sexual desires are especially strong. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:36-46:7:36" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:36</a>) It is better to wait to marry until those feelings calm down.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Here is an important Bible principle to remember when choosing a husband or a wife: “Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:14-47:6:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>) This illustration is based on a practice <span id="page135" class="pageNum" data-no="135" data-before-text="135"></span>used in farming. If two animals are very different in size or strength, a farmer does not yoke them together to work in the fields. That would not be kind to either animal because both would suffer. In a similar way, a marriage between someone who worships Jehovah and someone who does not will likely result in many problems. So the Bible gives us the wise advice to marry “only in the Lord.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:39-46:7:39" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> At times, some Christians have felt that they would rather marry someone who does not worship Jehovah than be alone. But if we ignore Bible counsel, the result is often pain and unhappiness. As Jehovah’s worshippers, serving him is the most important thing in our life. How would you feel if you could not share that most important part of your life with your mate? Many have decided to stay single rather than marry a person who does not love and serve Jehovah.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:8-19:32:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 32:8</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

Take time to read and meditate on the helpful advice on marriage provided in publications from the faithful slave.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:105-19:119:105" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 119:105</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> The Bible shows that husbands and wives have different roles in the family. So it makes sense that being ready for marriage will mean something different depending on whether you are male or female. If a man is thinking of getting married, he needs to ask himself if he is ready to be the head of a family. Jehovah expects a husband to look after his wife and children materially and emotionally. Most important, the husband needs to take the lead in his family’s worship of God. The Bible describes a man who does not take care of his family as “worse than a person without faith.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:8-54:5:8" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:8</a>) So if you are a man who is thinking about getting married, think of how this Bible principle can apply: “Prepare your outside work, and get everything ready in the field; then build your house.” In other words, before you get married, make sure that you can be the kind of husband Jehovah requires you to be.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:27-20:24:27" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:27</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> A woman who is thinking about getting married needs to ask herself if she is ready for the responsibilities of being a wife and perhaps a mother. The Bible mentions some of the many ways a good <span id="page138" class="pageNum" data-no="138" data-before-text="138"></span>wife takes care of her husband and children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:10-20:31:31" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:10-31</a>) Today, many men and women think only of what a marriage mate would do for them. But Jehovah wants us to think of what we can do for our mate.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">16, 17. If you are thinking of getting married, what should you meditate on?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Before you get married, meditate on what Jehovah says about husbands and wives. Being the head of the family does not mean that a man can be a bully, either physically or emotionally. A good family head imitates Jesus, who is always loving and kind to those under his care. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:23-49:5:23" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:23</a>) For her part, a woman needs to think about what it will mean to support her husband’s decisions and cooperate with him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:2-45:7:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Romans 7:2</a>) She needs to ask herself if she could be happy submitting to an imperfect man. If she does not think she could, she may decide that it’s better for her to remain single for now.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Husbands and wives need to care more about their mate’s happiness than their own. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:4-50:2:4" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>Philippians 2:4</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Paul wrote: “Each one of you must love his wife as he does himself; on the other hand, the wife should have deep respect for her husband.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:21-49:5:33" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:21-33</a>) Both men and women need to feel loved and respected. But for a marriage to work well, a man especially needs to know that his wife respects him, and a woman especially needs to know that her husband loves her.</p>

It is also a time for them to be realistic and honest so that they can decide if they really want to spend their life together. During courtship, a man and a woman learn to communicate with each other and try to learn what is really in each other’s heart. As their relationship deepens, it is natural for them to feel physically attracted to each <span id="page140" class="pageNum" data-no="140" data-before-text="140"></span>other. But they need to control how they express these feelings before they get married so that they do not do something immoral. True love will help them have self-control and will keep them from doing something that would harm their relationship both with each other and with Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:6-52:4:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>.</p>

But remember the Bible’s illustration of a strong rope made of three strands woven together. A rope like that will not break even under great pressure. When we look to Jehovah for help, our marriage can last.

Is it realistic to have this view of an imperfect mate? Yes! Jehovah knows how imperfect we are, yet he focuses on our good qualities. Imagine if he didn’t! The psalmist said: “If errors were what you watch, O Jah, then who, O Jehovah, could stand?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:130:3-19:130:3" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 130:3</a>) Husbands and wives can imitate Jehovah by looking for the good in their mate and being quick to forgive.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:13-51:3:13" data-bid="28-1" class="b"><strong>Colossians 3:13</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

Abraham and Sarah had a long and happy marriage. When Jehovah told Abraham to leave their home in the city of Ur, Sarah was possibly more than 60 years old. Imagine how difficult it was for her to leave her comfortable home to live in tents. But Sarah was a good friend and partner to her husband, and she really respected him. So she supported Abraham’s decisions and helped to make them a success.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:12-1:18:12" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Genesis 18:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:6-60:3:6" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 3:6</a>.</p>

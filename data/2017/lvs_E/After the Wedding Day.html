One woman said: “My husband strikes me with words. I may not have visible bruises, but his constant cutting remarks, such as ‘You’re a burden!’ and ‘You’re worthless!’ have scarred my heart.” One husband said that his wife constantly put him down with her words and called him names. He said: “I can’t repeat in polite company the things she says to me. That’s why I can’t talk to her and why I stay at work so late.

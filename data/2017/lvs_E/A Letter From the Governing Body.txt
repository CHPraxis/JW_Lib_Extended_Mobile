A Letter From the Governing Body




To those who love Jehovah God and his Word, the Bible:
“You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free,” said Jesus. (John 8:32) Think of how you felt when you first found the truth from the Bible! It was exciting to know that in a world full of lies, we can learn the truth.​—2 Timothy 3:1.
Jehovah God wants us to know the truth. And because we love people, we want to tell them about it. But there is more to serving God. We must do our best to live as Christians because we deeply respect Jehovah’s principles. Jesus explained an important way that we can prove to God that we love him. He said: “If you observe my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have observed the commandments of the Father and remain in his love.”​—John 15:10.
Jesus really loves his Father, and he does everything his Father asks him to do. If we imitate Jesus in the way that we live, Jehovah will love us and we will be truly happy. As Jesus said, “if you know these things, happy you are if you do them.”​—John 13:17.
We hope that this publication will help you learn to live by the truth from the Bible and to become a friend of God. It is our prayer that you will grow in your love for God and remain “in God’s love . . . with everlasting life in view.”​—Jude 21.

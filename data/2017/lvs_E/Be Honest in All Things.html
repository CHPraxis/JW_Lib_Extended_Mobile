When a husband and a wife are open with each other, they feel secure and can really trust each other. Dishonesty in marriage can take many forms. For example, a married person could become involved in flirting or pornography or could secretly develop a romantic relationship with someone. Notice what the psalmist said: “I do not associate with deceitful men, and I avoid those who hide what they are.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:26:4-19:26:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 26:4</a>) If you are dishonest with your mate even in your thoughts, it will harm your marriage.</p>

Parents can use the Bible to teach them this. It contains bad examples of people who were dishonest: Achan, who became a thief; Gehazi, who lied in order to get money; and Judas, who stole money and later betrayed Jesus for 30 silver coins.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:6:17-6:6:19" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Joshua 6:17-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:7:11-6:7:25" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 7:11-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:5:14-12:5:16" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 2 Kings 5:14-16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:5:20-12:5:27" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 20-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:14-40:26:15" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> Matthew 26:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:6-43:12:6" data-bid="11-6" class="b"> John 12:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> The Bible also contains many good examples of people who were honest: Jacob, who urged his sons to return the money they had found; Jephthah and his daughter, who kept a promise to God; and Jesus, who was honest even in difficult situations.

Some feel that writing an agreement down could make it seem as if they do not trust their brother. But in reality, writing down the agreement can prevent many misunderstandings, disappointments, and disagreements.

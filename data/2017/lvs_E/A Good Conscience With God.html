<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IMAGINE that you are walking across a vast desert. The landscape keeps changing as strong winds blow the sand in different directions. You could easily get lost. How will you know which direction to go? You need someone or something to guide you. It could be a compass, the sun and stars, a map, a GPS (Global Positioning System), or even a person who knows <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>the desert well. Having a guide is important, because knowing where to go can save your life.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">James 1:17</a>) Let’s find out what the conscience is and how it works.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Our conscience is a wonderful gift from Jehovah. It is the sense of right and wrong that we have inside us. The Greek word used in the Bible for “conscience” means “knowledge with oneself.” When our conscience works well, it helps us examine the person we really are. It can help us to be honest about our deepest thoughts and feelings. It can guide us toward good and away from bad. And it can make us feel happy when we make a wise decision or guilty after we make a bad one.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102017578/47-49">Endnote 5</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">4, 5. (a) What happened when Adam and Eve ignored their conscience? (b) What are some Bible examples of how the conscience works?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Each of us can choose whether or not we will listen to our conscience. Adam and Eve chose not to listen to their conscience, and as a result they <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>sinned. Afterward they felt guilty, but it was too late. They had already disobeyed God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:7-1:3:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 3:7, 8</a>) Even though they each had a perfect conscience and knew that it was wrong to disobey God, they chose to ignore their conscience.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> On the other hand, many imperfect humans have listened to their conscience. Job was a good example. Because he made good decisions, he could say: “My heart will not condemn me as long as I live.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:27:6-18:27:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 27:6</a>) When Job spoke of his “heart,” he referred to his conscience, his sense of right and wrong. David, though, ignored his conscience at times and disobeyed Jehovah. Afterward he felt so guilty that it was as if his heart were “striking him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:24:5-9:24:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Samuel 24:5</a>) This was David’s conscience telling him that what he had done was wrong. By listening to his conscience, he could learn to avoid making the same mistake again.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 6. Why can we say that our conscience is a gift from God?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Even people who do not know Jehovah usually realize that there are things that are right and things that are wrong. The Bible says: “By their own thoughts they are being accused or even excused.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:14-45:2:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Romans 2:14, 15</a>) For example, most people know that it is wrong to murder or to steal. Though they may not realize it, they are actually listening to their conscience, the sense of right and wrong that Jehovah put inside of them. They are also following God’s principles, or the basic truths Jehovah has provided to help us to make good choices in life.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 7. Why may our conscience sometimes be wrong?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> But our conscience can sometimes be wrong. For example, it could be damaged by our own imperfect thoughts and feelings and could guide us in the wrong direction. A good conscience does not come automatically. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:1-1:39:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 39:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:7-1:39:12" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 7-12</a>) It needs to be trained. To help us, Jehovah gives us holy spirit and Bible principles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:1-45:9:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 9:1</a>) Let’s examine how we can train our conscience.</p>

<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>HOW CAN WE TRAIN OUR CONSCIENCE?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 8. (a) How can our feelings affect our conscience? (b) What should we ask ourselves before we make a decision?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Some people think that listening to their conscience simply means following their feelings. They think that they can do whatever they want as long as they feel good about it. But our feelings are imperfect, and they can mislead us. Our feelings can be so powerful that they affect our conscience. The Bible says: “The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate. Who can know it?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:17:9-24:17:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jeremiah 17:9</a>) So we may begin to think that something is right even though it is wrong. For example, before Paul became a Christian, he viciously persecuted God’s people and believed that what he was doing was right. In his opinion, he had a good conscience. But he later said: “The one who examines me is Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:4-46:4:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 4:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:1-44:23:1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Acts 23:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:3-55:1:3" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 2 Timothy 1:3</a>) When Paul learned how Jehovah felt about what he was doing, he realized that he <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>needed to change. Clearly, before we do something, we need to ask ourselves, ‘What does Jehovah want me to do?’</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 9. What does it mean to fear God?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> When you love someone, you don’t want to displease him or her. Because we love Jehovah, we don’t want to do anything that will displease him. Our fear of displeasing Jehovah needs to be very strong. We see this from Nehemiah’s example. He refused to use his position as governor to get rich. Why? He explained that it was “because of the fear of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:5:15-16:5:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Nehemiah 5:15</a>) Nehemiah did not want to do anything that would displease Jehovah. Like Nehemiah, we too are afraid of displeasing Jehovah by doing something wrong. We can learn what pleases Jehovah by reading the Bible.​—See <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102017578/50-52">Endnote 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">10, 11. What Bible principles can help us make good decisions regarding alcohol?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> For example, a Christian may need to decide whether or not he will drink alcohol. What principles will help him to make a good decision? Here are a few: The Bible does not condemn drinking alcohol. In fact, it tells us that wine is a gift from God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:14-19:104:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 104:14, 15</a>) However, Jesus told his followers not to get involved in “heavy drinking.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:34-42:21:34" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 21:34</a>) And Paul told Christians to avoid “wild parties and drunkenness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:13-45:13:13" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Romans 13:13</a>) He said that drunkards “will not inherit God’s Kingdom.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>.</p>

When it comes to alcohol, perhaps someone who had trouble controlling his drinking in the past chooses not to drink at all. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:38-11:8:39" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Kings 8:38, 39</a>) So if you offered someone an alcoholic drink and <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>he refused, how would you react?

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> In the apostle Paul’s day, a situation arose that showed how consciences can be different. Some of the meat sold in the markets had been used in false worship and offered to idols. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:25-46:10:25" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:25</a>) Paul didn’t think that it was wrong to buy and eat this meat. To him, all food came from Jehovah. But some brothers who had worshipped idols in the past felt differently. They felt it was wrong to eat the meat. Did Paul think: ‘It doesn’t bother my conscience. I have the right to eat what I want’?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Paul did not think like that. The feelings of his brothers were so important to him that he was willing to give up some of his personal rights. Paul said that we should not “be pleasing ourselves.” He added: “For even the Christ did not please himself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:1-45:15:1" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Romans 15:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:3-45:15:3" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 3</a>) Like Jesus, Paul cared more about others than about himself.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:13-46:8:13" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 8:13;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:23-46:10:24" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> <strong>10:23, 24,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:31-46:10:33" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> <strong>31-33</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

For example, though King David sinned, his conscience moved him to repent. He hated what he had done and was determined to obey Jehovah in the future.

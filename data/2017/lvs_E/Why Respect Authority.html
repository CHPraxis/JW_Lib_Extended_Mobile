<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> As humans, we have a tendency to be rebellious. This has been true ever since the first man and <span id="page46" class="pageNum" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span>woman, Adam and Eve, sinned. Even though they were created perfect, they rebelled against God’s authority. Since then, all humans have been born imperfect. Our imperfection is one reason why it can be difficult for us to accept direction from Jehovah and from humans. Another reason is that those whom Jehovah uses to give us direction are also imperfect humans.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:15-1:2:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 2:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:7" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3:1-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:5-19:51:5" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Psalm 51:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> Romans 5:12</a>.</p>

A man named Korah, who had served Jehovah for many years, became proud and showed great disrespect to Moses. Although Moses was leading God’s people, he was not a proud man. In fact, he was described as the most humble man alive at the time. But Korah could not accept Moses’ direction. He even convinced a large crowd to join him and rebel against Moses. What happened to Korah and the rebels? They were killed.

For example, we pay taxes and provide information that the government requires. But what should we do <span id="page55" class="pageNum" data-no="55" data-before-text="55"></span>if the government asks us to do something that goes against God’s laws? The apostle Peter said: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:28-44:5:29" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Acts 5:28, 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> If we must deal with a government official, such as a judge or a policeman, we should always be respectful. Young Christians show respect to their teachers and other school employees. At our place of work, we show respect to our employer, even if other employees do not. When we do this, we imitate the apostle Paul, who was respectful to officials although it was sometimes difficult. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:2-44:26:2" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Acts 26:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:25-44:26:25" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 25</a>) Even if others do not treat us well, we remain respectful.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:17-45:12:18" data-bid="31-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 12:17, 18;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 3:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> All over the world, people show less and less respect for others. But Jehovah’s people are different. We make it our goal to respect everyone. We follow the direction of the apostle Peter: “Honor men of all sorts.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:17-60:2:17" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:17</a>) When we respect others, they notice. Jesus told us: “Let your light shine before men, so that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:16-40:5:16" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matthew 5:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><strong><sup>21</sup></strong></span> When we show respect in our family, in our congregation, and in other areas of life, our good example may make others want to learn more about Jehovah. And by showing respect to others, we show respect to Jehovah himself. This makes Jehovah happy and shows him that we love him.</p>

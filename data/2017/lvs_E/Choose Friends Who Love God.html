<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>HAVE you ever noticed how a baby watches his parents? Even before he can talk, he is absorbing all that he sees and hears. As he gets older, he begins to imitate his parents even without trying to. It is not surprising that adults too may begin to think and act like the people they spend a lot of time with.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> From <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:20-20:13:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:20</a>, we learn: “The one walking with the wise will become wise.” Here, the idea of “walking with” someone involves choosing to spend time with him. This means more than just being around a person. One Bible scholar said that walking with someone includes the idea of loving that person and feeling close to him. We are influenced most by the people we spend a lot of time with, especially if we feel close to them.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Our friends can affect us in a good way or in a bad way. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:20-20:13:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:20</a> continues: “The one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.” In the <span id="page32" class="pageNum" data-no="32" data-before-text="32"></span>Hebrew language, to have “dealings with” someone can mean to “keep company” with that person, that is, to be friends with him.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 4. Why is it a great honor to be a friend of God? Why did Jehovah call Abraham “my friend”?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Jehovah, the Sovereign of the Universe, gives us the opportunity to be his friends. This is a great honor. Jehovah selects his friends carefully. He chooses those who love him and have faith in him. Think of Abraham. He was ready to do anything for God. Over and over again, Abraham showed that he was faithful and obedient. He was even willing to sacrifice his son Isaac. Abraham had faith that “God was able to raise him up even from the dead.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:17-58:11:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:17-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:1-1:22:2" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Genesis 22:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:9-1:22:13" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 9-13</a>) Abraham was faithful and obedient, and Jehovah called him “my friend.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:8-23:41:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:21-59:2:23" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> James 2:21-23</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Jehovah views his friends as precious. His friends care more about being loyal to him than about anything else. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:22:26-10:22:26" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>2 Samuel 22:26</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> They are loyal and obedient because they love him. The Bible says that God’s “close friendship is with the upright,” those who obey him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:32-20:3:32" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:32</a>) Jehovah invites his friends to be special guests in his <span id="page33" class="pageNum" data-no="33" data-before-text="33"></span>“tent.” He invites them to worship him and to pray to him at any time.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:15:1-19:15:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 15:1-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 6. How can we show that we love Jesus?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Jesus said: “If anyone loves me, he will observe my word, and my Father will love him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:23-43:14:23" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 14:23</a>) So to be Jehovah’s friend, we also need to love Jesus and do what he taught us to do. For example, we obey Jesus’ instructions to preach the good news and make disciples. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:15-43:14:15" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> John 14:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:21-43:14:21" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 21</a>) Because we love Jesus, we “follow his steps closely.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:21</a>) Jehovah is happy when he sees us doing our best to imitate his Son in all we say and do.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 7. Why should we make sure that our friends are Jehovah’s friends?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Jehovah’s friends are faithful, loyal, and obedient, and they love his Son. Do we choose the same kind of friends that Jehovah does? If your friends imitate Jesus and are busy teaching others about God’s Kingdom, they can help you to be a better person and to remain loyal to Jehovah.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> In the Bible, we can read about many friendships, such as the friendship between Ruth and her mother-in-law, Naomi. These women came from different lands and backgrounds, and Naomi was much older than Ruth. But they became close friends because they both loved Jehovah. When Naomi wanted to leave the land of Moab and return to <span id="page34" class="pageNum" data-no="34" data-before-text="34"></span>Israel, “Ruth stuck with her.” She told Naomi: “Your people will be my people, and your God my God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:1:14-8:1:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ruth 1:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:1:16-8:1:16" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 16</a>) Ruth was very kind to Naomi.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> David and Jonathan are another example of good friends who were both loyal to Jehovah. Jonathan was about 30 years older than David and was next in line to be king of Israel.

Instead, Jonathan did everything he could to support David. For example, when David was in danger, Jonathan helped him “find strength in Jehovah.” He even risked his life for David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:23:16-9:23:17" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Samuel 23:16, 17</a>) David too was a loyal friend.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were three young Hebrew friends who were taken away from home as children. Far from their families, they <span id="page35" class="pageNum" data-no="35" data-before-text="35"></span>helped one another to remain faithful to Jehovah. Later, as adults, their faith was tested when King Nebuchadnezzar commanded them to worship an image of gold. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to worship the image and told the king: “We will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold that you have set up.” When their faith was tested, these three friends remained loyal to their God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:1-27:1:17" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Daniel 1:1-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:12-27:3:12" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 3:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:16-27:3:28" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 16-28</a>.</p>

We have a <span id="page36" class="pageNum" data-no="36" data-before-text="36"></span>wonderful variety of brothers and sisters from many cultures and backgrounds. Some are new to the congregation, while others have been serving Jehovah for many years. It takes time for a person’s relationship with Jehovah to grow, just as it takes time for fruit to ripen.

It could be that a brother or a sister is doing things that the Bible says are wrong. Or someone may develop a complaining attitude that could damage the congregation. This does not surprise us, because even in the first century, there were problems in the congregation at times. In fact, the apostle Paul warned Christians back then: “Do not be misled. Bad associations spoil useful habits.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:12-46:15:12" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 33</a>) Paul also warned Timothy to be careful about whom he chose to be his close friends.

It keeps the congregation safe from those who do not care about Jehovah’s standards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:7-46:5:7" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:15-58:12:16" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> Hebrews 12:15, 16</a>) It helps us to show love for Jehovah’s holy name, for his high standards, and for Jehovah himself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:15-60:1:16" data-bid="38-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:15, 16</a>) And the disfellowshipping arrangement shows love for the person who is no longer a member of the congregation. This strong discipline may help him to realize that what he is doing is wrong and motivate him to change. Many who were once disfellowshipped later returned to Jehovah and were warmly welcomed back into the congregation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:11-58:12:11" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><strong><sup>21</sup></strong></span> In one way or another, our friends affect us. So it is important that we choose them carefully. If we love those whom Jehovah loves, we will be surrounded by people who can help us to stay faithful to him forever.</p>

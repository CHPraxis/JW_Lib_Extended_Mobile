<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> The apostle John wrote: “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) Satan has this wicked world under his control and would like to control Jehovah’s people too.

Many see these things as harmless fun and do not realize the danger of letting demons into their lives. A person could also become involved in demonism through things such as horoscopes, palm reading, tarot cards, and crystal balls. The Devil hides the danger and tries to make such things seem mysterious, fascinating, and fun. A person could even think that there’s no harm in watching something demonic or supernatural as long as he doesn’t actually practice demonism.

If we chose movies, music, or books about spirit mediums, magic spells, demon possession, witches, vampires, or similar subjects, Satan and the demons would know that we are curious about them.

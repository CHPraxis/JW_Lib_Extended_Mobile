Unkind words can cause emotional pain and destroy relationships. Perhaps you can recall when someone spoke unkindly to you and hurt you deeply. Yet, that proverb continues: “The tongue of the wise is a healing.” Thoughtful speech can mend an aching heart and heal friendships that have been damaged by misunderstandings. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:24-20:16:24" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 16:24</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> If we remember that our words affect others, we will use them carefully.</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">9, 10. (a) What kind of speech is very common in today’s world? (b) Why do we avoid using obscene speech?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Using <strong>obscene, or unclean, language</strong> is very common today. Many think that they need to swear and use vulgar words to get their point across. Comedians often rely on dirty jokes and obscene language to make people laugh. However, the apostle Paul said: “You must put them all away from you: wrath, anger, badness, abusive speech, and obscene talk out of your mouth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:8-51:3:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Colossians 3:8</a>) He also said that “obscene jesting” should “not even be mentioned among” true Christians.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:3-49:5:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Obscene language is displeasing to Jehovah and to those who love him. It is unclean. In the Bible, “uncleanness” is included in “the works of the flesh.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Galatians 5:19-21</a>) “Uncleanness” can include a wide variety of sins, and one unclean habit can lead to another. If a person made a habit of using extremely unclean, obscene language and refused to stop, this could indicate that he should no longer be part of the congregation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:21-47:12:21" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 12:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:19-49:4:19" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Ephesians 4:19</a>; see <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102017578/118-120">Endnote 23</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">11, 12. (a) What is harmful gossip? (b) Why should we avoid slandering someone?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> We also need to avoid <strong>harmful gossip.</strong> It is natural for us to be interested in others and to share news about friends and family. Even in the first century, early Christians wanted to know how their brothers and sisters were doing and what they could do to help them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:21-49:6:22" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:21, 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:8-51:4:9" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Colossians 4:<span id="page163" class="pageNum" data-no="163" data-before-text="163"></span>8, 9</a>) But it is easy for conversations about other people to turn into harmful gossip. If we repeat gossip, we may say things that are not true or talk about things that should be kept private. If we are not careful, this negative talk can turn into false accusations, or <strong>slander.</strong> The Pharisees slandered Jesus when they accused him of things he had not done. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:32-40:9:34" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 9:32-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:22-40:12:24" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 12:22-24</a>) Slander hurts a person’s reputation, leads to arguments and pain, and destroys friendships.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:26:20-20:26:20" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 26:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Jehovah wants us to use our words to help and encourage others, not to turn friends into enemies. Jehovah hates those “sowing contentions among brothers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:16-20:6:19" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>) The first slanderer was Satan the Devil, who slandered God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:10" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9, 10</a>) In today’s world, it is common for people to lie about one another. But this should not happen in the Christian congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Galatians 5:19-21</a>) So we should be careful about what we say and always think before we speak. Before you repeat something about someone else, ask yourself: ‘Is what I am about to say true? Is it kind? Is it helpful? Would I want the person I’m talking about to hear what I say? How would I feel if someone said this about me?’​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:11-52:4:11" data-bid="23-1" class="b"><strong>1 Thessalonians 4:11</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> At times, all of us say things we later regret. But we do not want to make a habit of criticizing others or saying unkind or cruel things. <strong>Abusive speech</strong> <span id="page164" class="pageNum" data-no="164" data-before-text="164"></span>has no place in our lives. Paul said: “Put away from yourselves every kind of malicious bitterness, anger, wrath, screaming, and abusive speech.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:31-49:4:31" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:31</a>) Other Bibles translate “abusive speech” as “evil words,” “injurious language,” and “insulting language.” Abusive speech robs people of their dignity and makes them feel worthless. Children in particular can be hurt very easily, so we want to be especially careful not to crush them with our words.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:21-51:3:21" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Colossians 3:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> The Bible warns us about a very strong form of abusive speech​—<strong>reviling.</strong> Reviling is constantly insulting others with the intention of hurting them. How sad it would be if someone treated his mate or children in that way! In fact, a person who refused to stop reviling others would no longer qualify to be part of the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:11-46:5:13" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 6:9, 10</a>) As we have learned, if we say things that are obscene, untrue, or unkind, we will harm our relationship with Jehovah and with others.</p>

Even though the Bible does not tell us exactly what we should or should not say, it does tell us to speak “only what is good for building up.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:29-49:4:29" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:29</a>) Speech that builds up is clean, kind, and true. Jehovah wants us to use our words to encourage and help others. This may be challenging. <span id="page165" class="pageNum" data-no="165" data-before-text="165"></span>It takes more effort to say positive things than to say cruel and careless things.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> If you make it a habit to look for the good in others, it will be easier to give sincere commendation. For example, perhaps you notice that someone in the congregation prepares well for his talks or makes an effort to comment at meetings. A young person may take a fine stand for the truth in school, or an older person may regularly share in the ministry. Your words of appreciation may be just what they need. It is also very important for a husband to tell his wife that he loves and appreciates her. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:10-20:31:10" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:28-20:31:28" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 28</a>) Just as plants need light and water, people need to feel appreciated.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> In some ways, entertainment is similar to that piece of fruit.

So when you choose entertainment, do you say: “It’s up to me. I can choose any entertainment I want”? Or do you say: “All entertainment is bad”?

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Everything we do in life is connected to our worship of Jehovah. Paul explained this when he said: “Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Romans 12:1</a>) Jesus said: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:30-41:12:30" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mark <span id="page77" class="pageNum" data-no="77" data-before-text="77"></span>12:30</a>) We always want to give Jehovah our best. In ancient Israel, when people sacrificed an animal to Jehovah, they were expected to give a healthy animal. If the sacrifice had something wrong with it, God did not accept it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:22:18-3:22:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Leviticus 22:18-20</a>) In a similar way, our worship could become unacceptable to Jehovah. How?</p>

Some of it is acceptable for Christians, but much of it is not acceptable. First, let’s identify what kind of entertainment we need to avoid.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span id="page78" class="pageNum" data-no="78" data-before-text="78"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Many films, websites, television shows, video games, and songs are immoral, violent, or demonic. Bad things are often presented in a way that seems innocent and even funny. But Christians are careful to reject entertainment that does not reflect Jehovah’s clean standards.

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">10. What can be the result of bad choices of entertainment?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> But some feel that there’s nothing wrong with violent, immoral, or demonic entertainment. They think: ‘What is the harm? I would never actually do these things.’ If we think this way, we are fooling ourselves. The Bible says: “The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:17:9-24:17:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Jeremiah 17:9</a>) If we are entertained by things that are unacceptable to Jehovah, how can we say that we hate these things? The more we are entertained by them, the more we will begin to accept them as normal. In time, our conscience will weaken and stop warning us when we are about to make a wrong choice.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:70-19:119:70" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 119:70;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:1-54:4:2" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 4:1, 2</a>.</p>

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">13. Why do Christians make different decisions about entertainment? But what matters to all Christians?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Often, what one Christian chooses as entertainment is different from what another does. Why? Well, we all like different things. Also, what may be acceptable to one person might not be acceptable to someone else. Even so, to make good decisions, all Christians must be guided by Bible principles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:9-50:1:9" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Philippians 1:9</a>) These will help us to choose entertainment that is acceptable to God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:11-19:119:11" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 119:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:129-19:119:129" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 129;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:16-60:2:16" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 1 Peter 2:16</a>.</p>

This can reveal how important entertainment is to us. As Christians, our service to Jehovah is the most important thing in our lives. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 6:33</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> But without realizing it, we could allow entertainment to take up more and more of our time. Paul advised Christians: “Watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, making the best use of your time.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:15-49:5:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:15, 16</a>) So we need to set limits on the amount of time we spend on entertainment <span id="page82" class="pageNum" data-no="82" data-before-text="82"></span>and always make sure that our service to God has first place in our lives.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:10-50:1:10" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Philippians 1:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">15. How do we protect ourselves from entertainment that could harm our relationship with Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Clearly, we must reject entertainment that we know is unacceptable to Jehovah. But what about entertainment that we may have doubts about? Do we still need to be careful? Think about this. If you are walking along a mountain path, do you go as close as you can to the edge? No. If you value your life, you stay far away from danger. It is similar with our choice of entertainment. God’s Word tells us: “Turn your feet away from what is bad.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:25-20:4:27" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:25-27</a>) So we not only avoid entertainment that we <strong>know</strong> is bad, but we also stay away from any entertainment that we <strong>suspect</strong> might not be good for us and might harm our relationship with Jehovah.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> The psalmist wrote: “O you who love Jehovah, hate what is bad.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:97:10-19:97:10" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 97:10</a>) The Bible teaches us how Jehovah thinks and feels. Ask yourself how what you learn can help you to view things as Jehovah does. For example, we learn that Jehovah hates “a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, a heart plotting wicked schemes, and feet that run quickly to evil.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:16-20:6:19" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>) We learn that we must avoid “sexual immorality, . . . idolatry, spiritism, . . . jealousy, fits of anger, <span id="page83" class="pageNum" data-no="83" data-before-text="83"></span>. . . envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and things like these.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Galatians 5:19-21</a>) Do you see how these Bible principles can help you to choose your entertainment?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:18-47:3:18" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>) In fact, the choices we make when we are alone often reveal the kind of person we really are.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:4-19:11:4" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 11:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:16:8-19:16:8" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 16:8</a>.</p>

In a similar way, if we do not take good care of ourselves and keep ourselves clean, people may think badly of Jehovah.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">19. What do we need to avoid?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> Even though the Bible does not name every bad habit we should avoid, it does provide principles that help us to understand how Jehovah feels about such things. He does not want us to smoke or to abuse alcohol or drugs. If we are God’s friends, <span id="page111" class="pageNum" data-no="111" data-before-text="111"></span>we will avoid doing these things. Why? Because we deeply respect the gift of life. Such habits can shorten our life, damage our health, and harm the people around us. Many people try to stop these bad habits for the sake of their health. However, as Jehovah’s friends, we have the best reason to stop​—our love for God. One young woman said: “With Jehovah’s help, I cleaned up my life and broke free from my addictions. . . . I think it would have been impossible for me to make these changes on my own.” Let’s discuss five Bible principles that will help someone to stop harmful habits.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">20, 21. What kind of habits does Jehovah want us to be free of?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> <strong>“Since we have these promises, beloved ones, let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.”</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:1-47:7:1" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>) Jehovah wants us to be free of unclean habits that could damage our mind or body.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><strong><sup>21</sup></strong></span> A powerful reason to “cleanse ourselves of every defilement” is stated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:17-47:6:18" data-bid="30-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:17, 18</a>. Jehovah tells us: “Quit touching the unclean thing.” Then he promises: “I will take you in. And I will become a father to you, and you will become sons and daughters to me.” Yes, Jehovah will love us as a father does his children if we avoid anything that would make us unclean or impure to him.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">22-25. What Scriptural principles can help us to avoid unclean habits?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><strong><sup>22</sup></strong></span> <strong>“You must love Jehovah your God with your</strong> <span id="page112" class="pageNum" data-no="112" data-before-text="112"></span><strong>whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.”</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:37" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matthew 22:37</a>) This is the most important commandment of all. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:38-40:22:38" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matthew 22:38</a>) Jehovah deserves our complete love. How can we love him completely if we choose to do something that could shorten our life or damage our brain? Rather, we do everything we can to show respect for the life he has given us.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><strong><sup>23</sup></strong></span> <strong>“[Jehovah] gives to all people life and breath and all things.”</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:24-44:17:25" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 17:24, 25</a>) If a friend gave you a special gift, would you throw it away or destroy it? Life is an amazing gift from Jehovah. We deeply appreciate this gift. So we want to use our life in a way that will glorify him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 36:9</a>.</p>

They can also hurt those around us, who are often the people we love most. For example, a person who lives in the same house with a smoker can develop serious health problems simply from breathing the smoke. But when we stop bad habits, we show those around us that we love them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:20-62:4:21" data-bid="36-1" class="b">1 John 4:20, 21</a>.</p>

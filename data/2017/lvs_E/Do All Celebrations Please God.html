One way is by confusing us about what is right and what is wrong. Notice what happened to the nation of Israel when they were camped near Mount Sinai. Moses had gone up the mountain, and the people were waiting for him to return to the camp. Eventually, they got tired of waiting and asked Aaron to make a god for them. He made a golden idol in the shape of a calf. Then the people had a festival. They danced around the calf and bowed down to it. They <span id="page173" class="pageNum" data-no="173" data-before-text="173"></span>believed that by bowing down to the calf, they were actually worshipping Jehovah. But the fact that the people viewed this event as “a festival to Jehovah” did not make it right. Jehovah viewed it as idolatry, and many of them died.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 5. What evidence is there that Jesus was not born on December 25?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> In many parts of the world, Christmas is celebrated on December 25, which most people think is the date of Jesus’ birth. The Bible does not tell us on what day or even in what month Jesus was born, but it does tell us something about the time of year. Luke wrote that when Jesus was born in Bethlehem, “shepherds [were] living out of doors,” caring for their flocks. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:8-42:2:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 2:8-11</a>) In the month of December, Bethlehem is cold, rainy, and snowy, so shepherds would not have been staying outside with their flocks at night. What do we learn from this? Jesus was born when the weather was mild, not in December. Both the Bible and historical evidence indicate that he was born sometime during the months we now know as September and October.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">6, 7. (a) How did many popular Christmas customs begin? (b) What should be our reason for giving gifts?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> So how did Christmas begin? It came from pagan festivals, such as the Roman festival Saturnalia, a celebration dedicated to Saturn, the god of agriculture. <em>The Encyclopedia Americana</em> says: “Saturnalia, a Roman feast celebrated in mid-December, provided the model for many of the merry-making customs of Christmas. From this celebration, for example, <span id="page175" class="pageNum" data-no="175" data-before-text="175"></span>were derived the elaborate feasting, the giving of gifts, and the burning of candles.” Also, the birthday of the Persian sun-god Mithra was celebrated on December 25.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> However, most people who celebrate Christmas today are not thinking of its pagan origins. They simply look forward to Christmas as a time to be with family, enjoy good food, and give gifts. Of course, we love our family and friends, and Jehovah <span id="page176" class="pageNum" data-no="176" data-before-text="176"></span>wants his servants to share with one another. As <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 9:7</a> tells us, “God loves a cheerful giver.” Jehovah does not want us to give to others only on special occasions. Jehovah’s people enjoy giving gifts and getting together with friends and family at any time of the year, without expecting anything in return. They give because they love others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:12-42:14:14" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 14:12-14</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> To support the idea of giving gifts at Christmas, many people say that three wise men brought gifts to the newborn baby Jesus in the stable. It is true that a group of men did visit Jesus and bring gifts. In Bible times, it was common to bring gifts to an important person.

Also, they did not visit Jesus when he was a newborn baby in a stable.

For example, the ancient Greeks believed that every person was protected by a spirit that was present at his birth. And they thought that spirit was connected to a god born on the same date as the person. In addition to such pagan beliefs, birthdays are also connected with astrology and horoscopes.</p>

Some Easter customs are connected with this. For example, eggs “have been prominent as symbols of new life and resurrection,” says the <em>Encyclopædia Britannica.</em> Also, rabbits have long been used as symbols of fertility in pagan worship.

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><strong><sup>23</sup></strong></span> You have probably stopped taking part in celebrations that dishonor Jehovah. But some of your family who are not Jehovah’s Witnesses might think that this means you don’t like them or want to be with them anymore. They may feel that holidays are the only time that the family gets together. <span id="page183" class="pageNum" data-no="183" data-before-text="183"></span>So, what can you do? There are many ways you can reassure them that you love them and that they are important to you.

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><strong><sup>24</sup></strong></span> If your relatives want to know why certain holidays are no longer acceptable to you, you can look up information in our publications and on jw.org that will help you to explain your reasons to them. Don’t give them the impression that you are trying to win an argument or force them to think as you do. Help your family see that you considered many factors and then made a personal decision. Stay calm, and “let your words always be gracious, seasoned with salt.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:6-51:4:6" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Colossians 4:6</a>.</p>

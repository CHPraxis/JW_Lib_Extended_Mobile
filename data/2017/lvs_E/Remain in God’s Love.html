<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> It is important for you to be personally convinced that Jehovah’s ways are best.

Ever since <span id="page227" class="pageNum" data-no="227" data-before-text="227"></span>the garden of Eden, Satan has tried to make people believe this.

No. To illustrate, imagine you are walking in a beautiful park. You notice a high fence blocking off a certain area. Maybe you think, ‘Why is this fence in my way?’ But at that moment, you hear a lion roar on the other side of the fence. How do you feel about the fence now? You are grateful that it is protecting you from being the lion’s next meal! Jehovah’s principles are like that fence, and the Devil is like that lion. God’s Word warns us: “Keep your senses, be watchful! Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> As you strengthen your relationship with Jehovah, you will “press on to maturity.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:1-58:6:1" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:1</a>) What does it mean to be mature?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> We do not become mature Christians simply by getting older. To become mature, we must make Jehovah our best Friend and try to view things as he does. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:23-43:4:23" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 4:23</a>) Paul wrote: “Those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the spirit, on the things of the spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:5-45:8:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Romans 8:5</a>) A mature person does not focus his life on pleasure or material things. Instead, he focuses on serving Jehovah and makes wise choices in life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>; <strong>read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:2-59:1:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>James 1:2, 3</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> He does not let himself be influenced to do wrong.

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">11, 12. (a) What did Paul say about a Christian’s “powers of discernment”? (b) How is becoming a mature Christian similar to becoming an athlete?</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> When we see a skilled athlete in action, we know that it took time and training for him to develop his skill. He was not born an athlete. When a baby is born, he does not know exactly how to use his arms and legs. But in time, he learns how to hold objects and how to walk. With training, he can become an athlete. In a similar way, it takes time and training for us to become mature Christians.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">13. What will help us to learn to think the way Jehovah thinks?</p>

We have learned to appreciate and love Jehovah’s standards. When we make decisions, we ask ourselves: ‘What laws or principles from the Bible apply to this situation? How can I apply them? What would Jehovah like me to do?’​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 3:5, 6;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:5-59:1:5" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> <strong>James 1:5</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> We never stop building our faith in Jehovah. Just as eating nutritious food helps us to build strong bodies, learning about Jehovah helps us to build strong faith. When we began studying the Bible, we <span id="page231" class="pageNum" data-no="231" data-before-text="231"></span>learned basic truths about Jehovah and his ways. But as time goes by, we need to understand deeper things. That is what Paul meant when he said: “Solid food belongs to mature people.” By applying the things we learn, we gain wisdom. The Bible tells us: “Wisdom is the most important thing.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:5-20:4:7" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:5-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:2-60:2:2" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 2:2</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:2-49:2:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:2</a>) Satan knows that negative thinking <span id="page232" class="pageNum" data-no="232" data-before-text="232"></span>can harm both us and our relationship with God. But Jehovah has given us something to help us fight negative thinking. He has given us hope.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:8-52:5:8" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>, the Bible compares our hope to the helmet that protects a soldier’s head in battle, calling that helmet “the hope of salvation.” Hope in Jehovah’s promises can protect our mind and help us resist negative thoughts.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">18, 19. How was Jesus strengthened by hope?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Jesus’ hope made him strong. On the final night of his life on earth, he dealt with one difficult situation after another. A close friend betrayed him. Another denied even knowing him. Others abandoned him and fled. His own countrymen rose up against him, demanding his death by torture. What helped <span id="page233" class="pageNum" data-no="233" data-before-text="233"></span>him to endure these painful things? “For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake, despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:2-58:12:2" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> Jesus knew that by being faithful, he would bring glory to his Father and prove Satan a liar. This hope brought him great joy. He also knew that soon he would be reunited with his Father in heaven. This hope helped him to endure. Like Jesus, we must focus on our hope. It will help us to endure no matter what happens.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> Jehovah sees your faith and endurance.

Satan wants you to lose hope and to feel that Jehovah’s promises will never come true. But you cannot give in to negative thinking! If you notice that your hope is becoming less real to you, ask Jehovah for help. Remember the words found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7</a>: “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.”</p>

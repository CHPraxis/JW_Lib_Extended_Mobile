<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Before God created the physical universe and the first humans, he had already created a higher order of intelligent creatures. They are more powerful than humans, and they inhabit the same realm as God himself​—a realm inaccessible and invisible to mankind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:4-18:38:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:7-18:38:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 7</a>) The Bible calls those superior beings “spirits” and “angels.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:4-19:104:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 104:4</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">How many angels exist? A huge number. The angels around God’s throne number “myriads of myriads,” or “tens of thousands times tens of thousands.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:11-66:5:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 5:11</a>; footnote) If this expression is to be taken in its literal sense, then the angels number into the hundreds of millions!</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Angels often served as God’s spokespersons or messengers.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> They are also portrayed in the Bible as carrying out God’s miraculous works. God sent an angel to bless Abraham and prevent him from sacrificing his son Isaac. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:11-1:22:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 22:11-18</a>) An angel appeared to Moses in the midst of a burning bush to deliver a life-changing message. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:3:1-2:3:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 3:1, 2</a>) When the prophet Daniel was thrown into a pit of lions, “God sent his angel and shut the mouth of the lions.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:22-27:6:22" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Daniel 6:22</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">We cannot know all that the angels are doing today. However, the Bible indicates that they are involved in helping sincere people come to know more about God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:26-44:8:35" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 8:26-35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:1-44:10:22" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 10:1-22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:7" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Revelation 14:6, 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Jehovah gave the patriarch Jacob a dream in which he saw angels ascending and descending a “stairway” between heaven and earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:28:10-1:28:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 28:10-12</a>) Jacob probably concluded from that dream what we too can conclude​—that Jehovah God dispatches the angels to the earth on missions, to act in behalf of loyal humans who are in need of his assistance.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:24:40-1:24:40" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 24:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:14:19-2:14:19" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Exodus 14:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:7-19:34:7" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Psalm 34:7</a>.</p>

<div class="groupFootnote"><div><p id="p19" data-pid="19">The Bible reveals that some spirits rebelled against God’s authority, and it calls these wicked angels “demons.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:17-42:10:20" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 10:17-20</a>.</p></div>
<div><p id="p20" data-pid="20">In fact, the original Hebrew and Greek words used in the Bible for “angel” both mean “messenger.”</p></div>

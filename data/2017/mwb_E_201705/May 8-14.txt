LIVING AS CHRISTIANS

  Song 92

  “Caring for Our Places of Worship”: (15 min.) Questions and answers by an elder. After playing the video Caring for Our Places of Worship and considering the questions, briefly interview the congregation’s representative on the operating committee. (If your congregation does not have a representative, interview the coordinator of the body of elders. If your congregation is the only one that meets in the Kingdom Hall, interview the maintenance coordinator.) What Kingdom Hall maintenance projects have been accomplished recently, and what is planned for the future? If someone has maintenance skills or would like to learn by assisting those with skills, what should he or she do? How can all of us, regardless of our circumstances, share in caring for the Kingdom Hall?

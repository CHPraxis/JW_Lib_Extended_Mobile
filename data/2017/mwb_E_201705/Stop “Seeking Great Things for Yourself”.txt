Stop “Seeking Great Things for Yourself”




45:2-5
Baruch was likely an educated official in the royal household. Although he worshipped Jehovah and faithfully assisted Jeremiah, he lost his balance at one point. He began “seeking great things,” perhaps additional prominence in the royal court or material prosperity. He needed to adjust his thinking in order to survive the approaching destruction of Jerusalem.

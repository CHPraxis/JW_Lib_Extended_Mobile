You have broken my heart.” Then he utters the words that change her life forever, shattering her dreams and hopes of a normal life.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:10-51:1:10" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Col. 1:10</a>) To serve effectively, a worshipper of Jehovah must follow a routine of Bible study. We do well to help Bible students grasp that fact. Moreover, we ourselves must be convinced of its value. In fact, we ourselves need to have good Bible study habits. So you might ask yourself, ‘When householders express opinions that are contrary to Scriptural teachings or they ask difficult questions, am I able to give answers that are based on the Bible?’ If we tell others how much we have benefited from our personal study of the Bible, we may encourage them to obtain such benefits by being diligent students of the Scriptures. <a class="xt" data-xtid="16" href="jwpub://p/E:2016609/11-12"><em>w16.08 </em>4:3, 4</a></p>

Instead, Jesus was helping his disciples to realize that <em>undue, </em>or <em>extreme, </em>anxiety does not solve problems. Each day has its own challenges, so Christians do not need to add anxious thoughts about the past or the future to the concerns of the present. Unwarranted anxiety often results if a Christian agonizes over possible future problems. However, you need not be consumed by anxiety, or worry, over events that you do not know anything about. Why not? Because things often do not turn out to be as bad as we feared they might be. Moreover, there is no situation beyond the control of the God on whom you can throw all your anxiety. You can be certain that God can reward his faithful ones and help them deal with anxiety about the past, the present, and the future. <a class="xt" data-xtid="25" href="jwpub://p/E:2016922/24-24"><em>w16.12 </em>3:13,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="26" href="jwpub://p/E:2016922/27-27"> 16</a></p>

In fact, some of those consequences would stay with David for the rest of his life.

He had to trust that when he truly repented, Jehovah would forgive him and help him endure the consequences of his actions. Being imperfect, all of us sin. Some mistakes are more serious than others. In some cases, we may not be able to undo our mistakes. We may simply have to live with the consequences.

As an example, if we enter some feature of the full-time service, what will happen to us if we get sick? What if our aging parents need our help? How will we look after ourselves in our old age? No amount of prayer or research will reveal a complete answer to questions like these. Our confidence in Jehovah will help us not only to acknowledge but also to accept our limitations. After doing research, consulting others, and praying for guidance, we need to take steps in the direction that God’s spirit is leading us.

Quoting Jehovah’s words through the prophet Isaiah, Jesus said about them: “This people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far removed from me. It is in vain that they keep worshipping me, for they teach commands of men as doctrines.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:7-40:15:9" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Matt. 15:7-9</a>) Jesus allowed God’s Word to guide not only his actions but also his teaching.

Will it bring joy and peace to my family? And will it show that I am patient and kind?’ Jehovah does not coerce us into loving him and serving him. In line with the free will that he grants us, he respects our responsibility and right to ‘choose for ourselves’ whether we will serve him.

When the last days of the present system began back in 1914, God’s servants on earth were relatively few in number. But Jehovah blessed their preaching work. During the following decades, millions of new ones learned Bible truths and became Jehovah’s Witnesses. Jehovah actually pointed forward to this outstanding growth, saying the words of today’s text and adding: “I myself, Jehovah, will speed it up in its own time.” That prophetic statement has certainly come true in these last days.

Our brothers and sisters as well as people in general should be able to see that we fittingly represent our righteous God. He has high standards, and we happily strive to reflect those standards. Commendation is in order for brothers and sisters whose appearance and fine conduct attract honesthearted people to the Bible’s lifesaving message and bring glory and joy to Jehovah. <a class="xt" data-xtid="87" href="jwpub://p/E:2016684/28-30"><em>w16.09 </em>3:18-20</a></p>

He received the fitting name Israel, (meaning “Contender [Perseverer] With God” or “God Contends”). Jacob gained the rich reward that we too are seeking​—Jehovah’s approval and blessing. Jacob’s beloved wife, Rachel, was eager to see how Jehovah would fulfill his promise to bless her husband’s offspring. But she had no children. In her day, that situation was viewed as a great affliction. How did Rachel find the emotional and physical strength to continue battling against circumstances that were discouraging but completely beyond her control? She never gave up hope. Rather, she kept contending by praying with more intensity.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:6-54:2:6" data-bid="88-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:6</a>) Jesus became the ransom sacrifice that opened the way to endless life “for many”​—men, women, and children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Matt. 20:28</a>) Indeed, the ransom is the key that unlocks the door to the fulfillment of God’s original purpose. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:19-47:1:20" data-bid="90-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:19, 20</a>) The ransom gives all faithful humans the prospect of everlasting life. <a class="xt" data-xtid="100" href="jwpub://p/E:2017286/25-26"><em>w17.02 </em>1:15, 16</a></p>

Similarly, you may at times feel overwhelmed by the problems you face. Even Jesus could have felt that way. He was the target of “hostile speech from sinners,” humiliation, and even painful execution on “a torture stake”​—surely the darkest period of his life on earth! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:3-58:12:3" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Heb. 12:3</a>) Yet, Jesus endured it all. He focused on the rewards of his endurance, particularly his contribution to the sanctification of God’s name and the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty. The darkness of Jesus’ trials was temporary, but the brilliance of his heavenly reward would be everlasting. Today, the trials you face may be painful and even crushing. But remember that your tribulations on the road to eternal life are temporary. <a class="xt" data-xtid="70" href="jwpub://p/E:2016282/19-19"><em>w16.04 </em>2:10</a></p>

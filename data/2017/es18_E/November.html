He is eager to see us surrender to our trial and withdraw our support of God’s sovereignty. When you struggle with adversity, therefore, imagine this invisible scene. Satan and his demons are on one side, pointing to your struggles and alleging that you will buckle under the pressure and give up. On the other side are Jehovah, his reigning Son, the resurrected anointed ones, and myriads of angels. They are cheering you on, delighted by your endurance and support of Jehovah’s sovereignty.

That is encouraging, for it means that a solution is usually found before the situation reaches the point where an unrepentant sinner must be removed from the congregation. Often, the wrongdoer sees his error and corrects matters. The offended person may see that he no longer has a real reason to find fault and may prefer to forgive. Whatever the case, Jesus’ words indicate that the congregation should not get involved in disagreements prematurely. The elders may intervene only if the preceding two steps have been taken and if solid evidence can be produced to show clearly what has happened. <a class="xt" data-xtid="342" href="jwpub://p/E:2016361/26-27"><em>w16.05 </em>1:15, 16</a></p>

With our situation in mind, they act on their prayers by doing research in God’s Word and in our Christian publications. This can equip them to render help tailored to our needs.

A “want” is something you would like to have, but it is not essential for everyday living. What people want may vary considerably, depending on where they live. In developing countries, many may simply want to have enough money to buy a cell phone, a motorbike, or a small plot of land. In wealthier lands, the urge may be to acquire a lavish wardrobe, a bigger house, or a more expensive automobile.

As they read, they asked questions: ‘Where in God’s Word is there mention of purgatory? of paid masses for the dead? of popes and cardinals?’ From the point of view of the church, this was an outrage. How dare the multitudes question church leaders! The church fought back. Men and women were condemned for heresy because they rejected teachings of the church. The church handed down the death sentence; the State carried it out. The goal was to discourage people from reading the Bible and questioning the church. For the most part, the scheme worked.

After a document containing the Mosaic Law was found, Josiah’s secretary began to read it to him. Guided by God’s Word, Josiah began a vigorous campaign against idolatry and arranged an unprecedented celebration of the Passover. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:22:11-12:22:11" data-bid="88-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:23:1-12:23:23" data-bid="88-2" class="b"> 23:1-23</a>) Because Josiah and other faithful leaders were guided by God’s Word, they were willing to adjust and clarify the direction they gave to God’s people. Those changes brought God’s ancient people into harmony with his will. However, not all the kings who ruled God’s ancient people followed God’s instructions. In some cases, Jehovah disciplined or replaced those leaders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:13-9:13:14" data-bid="89-1" class="b">1 Sam. 13:13, 14</a>) In his own due time, he appointed someone who would be superior to any of the men he had used thus far. <a class="xt" data-xtid="367" href="jwpub://p/E:2017282/22-23"><em>w17.02 </em>3:11, 12,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="368" href="jwpub://p/E:2017282/25-25"> 14</a></p>

Humans are capable of showing one another love, kindness, and compassion. Having been created with a conscience, people normally have an inborn sense​—albeit at times inaccurate or distorted—​that alerts them to what is right or wrong, honest or dishonest, appropriate or inappropriate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:14-45:2:15" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Rom. 2:14, 15</a>) Most people are drawn to things that are clean and beautiful. Generally, they want to live with others in peace. Whether they realize it or not, they reflect to some extent Jehovah’s glory, and for this reason, they deserve a measure of honor and respect. However, balance is needed in determining what kind of honor should be rendered to other humans and to what extent. <a class="xt" data-xtid="370" href="jwpub://p/E:2017322/12-14"><em>w17.03 </em>1:5, 6</a></p>

Yet, after observing the Ninevites’ repentant, changed attitude, Jehovah adjusted his decision. In doing so, he manifested reasonableness, humility, and compassion. Similarly, there may be occasions when it would be good for us to reconsider a choice or decision. It could be when the prevailing circumstances change. Jehovah altered his decision at times when circumstances changed.

<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="sb">If a problem arises, we ought to consider what Bible principles are involved and apply them in a balanced way. For example, a sister knows that she has the responsibility to preach the good news. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:20-44:4:20" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Acts 4:20</a>) However, suppose she plans to go out in the field service on a certain day, but her unbelieving husband wants her to stay home. He says that they have not had much time together lately, and he would like them to do something as a couple. She might consider relevant Bible texts, such as obeying God and the command to make disciples. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:29-44:5:29" data-bid="98-2" class="b"> Acts 5:29</a>) But she also needs to think about wifely subjection and being reasonable. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:22-49:5:24" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Eph. 5:22-24</a>) Is her husband completely opposed to her going out in service, or is he asking her to do something else just that one day? We need balance as we seek to do God’s will and strive to have a good conscience. <a class="xt" data-xtid="372" href="jwpub://p/E:2017326/28-28"><em>w17.03 </em>4:17</a></p>

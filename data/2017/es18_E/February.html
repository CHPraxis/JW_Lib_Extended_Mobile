It helps us to “be complete and sound in all respects, not lacking in anything.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:4-59:1:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jas. 1:4</a>) Trials often reveal our weaknesses, aspects of our personality that we need to refine. If we endure those trials, however, our Christian personality becomes more complete, or sound. For example, we may become more patient, appreciative, and compassionate. Because endurance completes the vital work of molding us as Christians, do not compromise Scriptural principles to bring an end to tests that come your way. For instance, what if you struggle with unclean thoughts? Rather than give in to temptation, prayerfully reject such desires. You will thus fortify your self-control. Are you facing opposition from an unbelieving family member? Instead of yielding under pressure, be determined to maintain your pattern of wholehearted worship. Remember: To have God’s approval, we must endure.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:3-45:5:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 5:3-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:12-59:1:12" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Jas. 1:12</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="36" href="jwpub://p/E:2016282/26-27"><em>w16.04 </em>2:15, 16</a></p>

Many stores cater to popular fashions, so it may take more time and effort to find modest skirts, dresses, and blouses or suits and slacks that are not too tight. Yet, fellow believers will likely note and appreciate the results of our sincere efforts to find attractive and appropriate clothing. And the satisfaction we have of bringing glory to our loving heavenly Father more than makes up for any inconveniences that we may face to dress so as to glorify him. <a class="xt" data-xtid="50" href="jwpub://p/E:2016684/25-26"><em>w16.09 </em>3:15, 16</a></p>

Effective illustrations can strengthen a child’s faith in the accuracy of the Bible. For example, consider today’s text. How might you show that this scripture was inspired? You could just state facts. Instead, why not stimulate your child’s imagination? Bring up the fact that Job lived long before telescopes and spaceships. Your child’s job could be to show how difficult it might be for some to believe that a very large object, such as the earth, could sit on nothing. The child could use a ball or a stone to illustrate the point by showing that objects with mass have to rest on something. Such a lesson would impress on your child that Jehovah had facts recorded in the Bible long before humans could prove them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:9:6-16:9:6" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Neh. 9:6</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="51" href="jwpub://p/E:2016688/19-19"><em>w16.09 </em>5:9,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="52" href="jwpub://p/E:2016688/22-22"> 12</a></p>

Faith in God’s means of salvation moves a believer to share the good news with others. Our prospect of enjoying eternal life in God’s new world depends on our having faith and keeping it strong. The need to keep our faith healthy can be likened to a plant’s need for water. Unlike an artificial plant, a living plant keeps changing. A live plant either withers because of a lack of water or continues to thrive with a regular supply of moisture. If deprived of sufficient water, a once healthy plant will eventually die. So, too, our faith. It will wither and die if neglected.

Accordingly, between December 1917 and early 1918, the few thousand Bible Students zealously distributed 10,000,000 copies of a tract featuring the subject “The Fall of Babylon”​—a hard-hitting indictment of Christendom. As you can imagine, the clergy were furious; but undeterred, the Bible Students kept right on with this important work.

We honor these brothers regardless of their nationality, education, social standing, or financial status. The Bible refers to them as “gifts in men,” and they are a key part of God’s arrangement to care for the needs of his people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:8-49:4:8" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Eph. 4:8</a>) Think of congregation elders, circuit overseers, Branch Committee members, and the members of the Governing Body. Our brothers and sisters in the first century had high regard for those appointed to take the lead, and we feel similarly today. We do not idolize well-known representatives of the Christian congregation or react in their presence as if angels were standing nearby. Still, we do respect and honor such brothers for their hard work and humility.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:24-47:1:24" data-bid="95-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:10-66:19:10" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> Rev. 19:10</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="67" href="jwpub://p/E:2017322/22-22"><em>w17.03 </em>1:13</a></p>

At a diplomatic function, Herod clothed himself “with royal raiment.” His adoring crowd shouted: “A god’s voice, and not a man’s!” Herod evidently basked in the praise. But “instantly the angel of Jehovah struck him, because he did not give the glory to God, and he was eaten up with worms and died.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:21-44:12:23" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Acts 12:21-23</a>) Surely, no objective observer could conclude that Herod was chosen by Jehovah to be leader. Jesus, on the other hand, gave convincing evidence of being appointed by God, and he constantly glorified Jehovah as the Supreme Leader of his people. Jesus’ leadership was not meant to last only a few years. “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth,” he declared after his resurrection. “And look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:18-40:28:20" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18-20</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="65" href="jwpub://p/E:2017282/32-33"><em>w17.02 </em>3:20, 21</a></p>

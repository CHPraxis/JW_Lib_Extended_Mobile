Immediately after the Christian congregation was formed, followers of Jesus began “devoting themselves . . . to associating together.” You likely share their desire to attend congregation meetings regularly. Nevertheless, all Christians face obstacles. Secular work, a busy schedule, or fatigue because of our daily routine can make it difficult to attend meetings. Appreciating the value of the meetings can motivate us to try to overcome these obstacles and maintain a healthy pattern of meeting attendance. Granted, some of our fellow believers are unable to attend meetings regularly because of circumstances beyond their control, such as serious illness. Elders may assist these infirm ones to benefit from spiritual programs, perhaps by helping them to tie in by telephone hookup or by recording the meetings for them. <a class="xt" data-xtid="103" href="jwpub://p/E:2016283/10-10"><em>w16.04 </em>3:3</a></p>

The various expressions of Jehovah’s kindness result in our receiving many blessings. One of them is being forgiven of our sins. Because of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, we have our sins forgiven, provided we repent and continue to put up a hard fight against our sinful inclinations.

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">Anyone can act immodestly if he allows himself temporarily to be overcome by fleshly desires. Selfish ambition, envy, and uncontrolled anger have led many to presumptuous acts. Bible characters like Absalom, Uzziah, and Nebuchadnezzar succumbed to such works of the flesh and were humbled by Jehovah for their presumptuousness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:1-10:15:6" data-bid="97-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:18:9-10:18:17" data-bid="97-2" class="b"> 18:9-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:16-14:26:21" data-bid="97-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 26:16-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:18-27:5:21" data-bid="97-4" class="b"> Dan. 5:18-21</a>) There are other reasons, though, why someone may act immodestly. Consider, for example, the following Bible accounts: <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:20:2-1:20:7" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Genesis 20:2-7 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:31-40:26:35" data-bid="98-2" class="b"> Matthew 26:31-35</a>. Were the seemingly presumptuous actions of Abimelech and Peter motivated by sinful desires? Or were these individuals simply unaware of all the facts, or were they caught off guard? Since we cannot read hearts, it is both wise and loving to avoid jumping to conclusions about other people’s motives. <a class="xt" data-xtid="128" href="jwpub://p/E:2017246/18-19"><em>w17.01 </em>3:9, 10</a></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">Like the needy widow, many of our modern-day fellow believers trust that if they seek first the Kingdom, Jehovah will make sure that they have what they need. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33</a>) Consider a brother named Malcolm. Over the decades that he and his wife served Jehovah, they experienced ups and downs. “Life is unpredictable at times, uncertain, and even hard to deal with,” he said. “But Jehovah blesses those who lean on him.” Malcolm’s advice? “Pray to be as productive and as active in Jehovah’s service as you can be. Focus on what you can do, not on what you cannot do.” As this system of things goes “from bad to worse,” we can expect to face increasingly greater difficulties. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="101-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:13-55:3:13" data-bid="101-2" class="b"> 13</a>) So it is more important than ever that we do not allow ourselves to be paralyzed by such challenges. Rather, we need to cultivate strong trust in Jehovah while taking whatever appropriate action we can. <a class="xt" data-xtid="127" href="jwpub://p/E:2017242/27-29"><em>w17.01 </em>1:17-19</a></p>

<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="sb">Dismayed that there was no “house,” or temple, dedicated to Jehovah, David wanted to build one. However, Jehovah directed otherwise, as noted in today’s text. Although Jehovah lovingly assured David that He would continue to bless him, God directed that David’s son Solomon build the temple. How did David react? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:17:1-13:17:4" data-bid="103-1" class="b">1 Chron. 17:1-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:17:8-13:17:8" data-bid="103-2" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:17:11-13:17:12" data-bid="103-3" class="b"> 11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:1-13:29:1" data-bid="103-4" class="b"> 29:1</a>) David did not withhold his support, brooding over the prospect that the credit for temple construction would not be his. The building did, in fact, become known as Solomon’s temple, not David’s. While David may have been disappointed that he could not fulfill his heart’s desire, he fully supported the project. He eagerly organized work groups and gathered iron, copper, silver, and gold, as well as cedar timbers. Further, he encouraged Solomon, saying: “Now, my son, may Jehovah be with you, and may you be successful and build the house of Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:22:11-13:22:11" data-bid="104-1" class="b">1 Chron. 22:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:22:14-13:22:16" data-bid="104-2" class="b"> 14-16</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="129" href="jwpub://p/E:2017248/14-15"><em>w17.01 </em>5:6, 7</a></p>

When we make mistakes, as we all do, we genuinely repent and turn away from practices that dishonor Jehovah. On the basis of Christ’s sacrifice, Jehovah forgives the sins of those who exercise faith. He accepts as his worshippers those who dedicate themselves to him. Jehovah declares anointed Christians righteous as his sons and those of the “other sheep” righteous as his friends.

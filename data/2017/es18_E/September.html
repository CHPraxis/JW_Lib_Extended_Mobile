<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the Bible, enduring means more than simply putting up with trials or adversity. Endurance involves our mind and heart, or the <em>way </em>we react to hardships. A person who endures manifests courage, steadfastness, and patience. Endurance is “the spirit which can bear things, not simply with resignation, but with blazing hope,” says one reference work. “It is the quality which keeps a man on his feet with his face to the wind. It is the virtue which can transmute the hardest trial into glory because beyond the pain it sees the goal.” Christian endurance is motivated by love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:7-46:13:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 7</a>) Love for Jehovah motivates us to endure anything that is in harmony with his will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:41-42:22:42" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 22:41, 42</a>) Love for our brothers helps us to endure their imperfections. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:8-60:4:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:8</a>) Love for our marriage mate enables us to endure “tribulation” that even happily married couples experience and to strengthen the marital bond.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:28-46:7:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:28</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="273" href="jwpub://p/E:2016282/11-12"><em>w16.04 </em>2:3, 4</a></p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Greek word translated “devoting themselves” implies enduring or persevering in a course with intense effort. Under Roman rule and faced with opposition by the Jewish religious leaders, those early Christians did not find it easy to attend meetings. Nevertheless, they persevered. Many modern-day servants of Jehovah have shown deep appreciation for Christian meetings. George Gangas, who served on the Governing Body for over 22 years, stated: “To me, meeting with the brothers is one of life’s greatest pleasures and a source of encouragement.” He added: “My innermost thought and desire is to attend the meetings.” Do you feel the same way about gathering together to worship Jehovah? Then be determined to endure and persevere in your earnest efforts to attend meetings regularly. You will thus show that you agree with King David, who said: “Jehovah, I love the house where you dwell.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:26:8-19:26:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 26:8</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="274" href="jwpub://p/E:2016283/27-29"><em>w16.04 </em>3:16-18</a></p>

It is not to cast part of the blame on your brother but to admit your fault and <em>make peace. </em>Being at peace with our fellow worshippers is of utmost importance. Consider Abraham and his nephew Lot. Both men possessed livestock, and their shepherds apparently quarreled about grazing land. Eager to eliminate tensions, Abraham offered Lot first choice of the areas where their respective households would settle.

Let them marry.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:9-46:7:9" data-bid="44-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:36-46:7:36" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:1-54:4:3" data-bid="44-3" class="b"> 1 Tim. 4:1-3</a>) Nevertheless, a person should not be prompted to marry because of surges of passion that may come in youth. He may not be mature enough to take on the responsibilities of married life. <a class="xt" data-xtid="284" href="jwpub://p/E:2016602/29-29"><em>w16.08 </em>1:17</a></p>

The principles that we glean from God’s Word should move us to avoid wearing clothing that is tight-fitting, revealing, or sexually provocative. That would rule out wearing clothing that exposes or accentuates private parts of our anatomy. Nobody should feel uncomfortable or forced to look the other way when seeing how we are dressed. When we are neat, clean, modestly dressed, and well-groomed, people are more likely to respect us and to be attracted to the God we worship.

And some stop believing in God because they are disappointed with religion. So when you discuss the origin of life with someone, it is usually wise to ask questions first. Find out what that person believes. If you are reasonable and willing to listen, he may be inclined to listen to you. If someone seems to be attacking your belief in creation, you might ask him to explain how life could have begun without a Creator. For the first life-form to continue, it had to be able to reproduce, to make copies of itself.

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">The very first words of the Bible make this simple but profound statement: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="83-1" class="b">Gen. 1:1</a>) It is true that we have only a little understanding of the many things God created, such as space, light, and gravity, and we have seen only a small fraction of the universe. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:11-21:3:11" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:11</a>) Yet, Jehovah has revealed to us his purpose for the earth and for mankind. The earth was to be an ideal home for men and women created in God’s image. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:26" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26</a>) They would be his children, and Jehovah would be their Father. As explained in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:24" data-bid="86-1" class="b">the third chapter of Genesis</a>, Jehovah’s purpose encountered a challenge. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:7" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-7</a>) However, that challenge was by no means insurmountable. No one can stand in Jehovah’s way. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:10-23:46:10" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Isa. 46:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="88-2" class="b"> 55:11</a>) Therefore, we can be certain that Jehovah’s original purpose will be fulfilled exactly on time! <a class="xt" data-xtid="301" href="jwpub://p/E:2017286/8-9"><em>w17.02 </em>1:1, 2</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">Since holy spirit is an invisible force, how could the Israelites discern that it was operating on Moses? Holy spirit enabled Moses to perform miracles and to declare God’s name to Pharaoh. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:7:1-2:7:3" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Ex. 7:1-3</a>) Holy spirit also produced in Moses beautiful qualities, such as love, meekness, and patience, that qualified him to lead the Israelites. The evidence was clear: Jehovah had selected Moses to be the leader of His people. Later, Jehovah’s holy spirit empowered other men whom he appointed to lead his people. “Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:34:9-5:34:9" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Deut. 34:9</a>) “Jehovah’s spirit came upon Gideon.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:6:34-7:6:34" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Judg. 6:34</a>) And “the spirit of Jehovah began to empower David.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:13-9:16:13" data-bid="93-1" class="b">1 Sam. 16:13</a>) All those men relied on God’s spirit to help them, and that spirit empowered them to perform feats that they could not have done in their own strength.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:11:16-6:11:17" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Josh. 11:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:7-7:7:7" data-bid="94-2" class="b"> Judg. 7:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:22-7:7:22" data-bid="94-3" class="b"> 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:37-9:17:37" data-bid="94-4" class="b"> 1 Sam. 17:37,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:50-9:17:50" data-bid="94-5" class="b"> 50</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="299" href="jwpub://p/E:2017282/12-14"><em>w17.02 </em>3:3-5</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">Paul set a fine example of respecting his brothers’ right of free will to make decisions. Today, when giving counsel on matters involving personal choice, the elders should follow that pattern. They are happy to share Bible-based information with others in the flock. Still, the elders are careful to allow individual brothers and sisters to make their own decisions. That is logical because those individuals will bear the responsibility for the results. Here is an important lesson: We can show helpful interest in others and call attention to Scriptural principles or counsel. Still, others have a right and responsibility to make their own decisions. When they do this wisely, they benefit. Clearly, we should avoid any tendency to think that we are authorized to make decisions for other brothers and sisters. <a class="xt" data-xtid="302" href="jwpub://p/E:2017323/20-20"><em>w17.03 </em>2:11</a></p>

Are you one of the other sheep who supports the anointed in this vital work? How happy you will feel when your Leader, Jesus, says: “To the extent that you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:34-40:25:40" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Matt. 25:34-40</a>) When Jesus returned to heaven, he did not abandon his followers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:20-40:28:20" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Matt. 28:20</a>) He knew firsthand how much the holy spirit, the angels, and God’s Word helped him to take the lead when he was on earth. Therefore, he has supplied the faithful slave today with the same assistance. As anointed Christians, the members of that slave “keep following the Lamb no matter where he goes.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:4-66:14:4" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Rev. 14:4</a>) As we follow their direction, therefore, we follow our Leader, Jesus.

But what do we do when we have to cope with smaller issues of daily life? Do we resort to human thinking by trying to solve them in our own way? Or do we look for Bible principles and try to apply them, thus showing that we rely on Jehovah’s way to solve problems? For example, on occasion you may face some opposition from your family regarding attending meetings or an assembly. You ask Jehovah to direct you and help you discern the best way to handle the situation. Or what if you lose your job, and you are having difficulty finding another? When speaking with a prospective employer, would you still inform him that you will be attending weekday meetings regularly? Whatever the problem may be, we do well to heed the words of the psalmist who said the words of today’s text. <a class="xt" data-xtid="303" href="jwpub://p/E:2017326/14-14"><em>w17.03 </em>4:6</a></p>

How can I apply this information in my life? How can I use it to help others?’ When we reflect on such questions, we will surely get more out of our Bible reading. As an example, think about the Scriptural qualifications for Christian elders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:2-54:3:7" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:2-7</a>) Since the majority of us do not serve as elders, we might initially think that this passage would have little application to our own life.

He had carefully compared the teachings of many different religions, even non-Christian religions, with what the Bible says. He soon realized that not one of those religions completely adhered to God’s Word. At one point, he met with a number of local clergymen in hopes that these men would accept the truths that Russell and his associates had discovered from the Bible and teach them to members of their congregations. The clergymen were not interested.

Satan the Devil, using a serpent, fooled Eve into disobeying her Father, Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="88-2" class="b"> Rev. 12:9</a>) Satan made an issue of the fact that God’s human children were not allowed to eat “from every tree of the garden.” It was as if he were saying: ‘You mean you cannot do what you want?’ Next, he told a blatant lie: “You certainly will not die.” Then he tried to convince Eve that she need not listen to God, saying: “God knows that in the very day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened.” Satan implied that Jehovah did not want them to eat the fruit because doing so would enlighten them. Further, Satan made this false promise: “You will be like God, knowing good and bad.” <a class="xt" data-xtid="403" href="jwpub://p/E:2017286/17-18"><em>w17.02 </em>1:8, 9</a></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">Most imperfect humans are strongly influenced by the spirit of Satan’s world. That is why people tend to <em>idolize </em>certain men or women rather than just show them appropriate honor and respect. They place religious and political leaders, sports figures, entertainment stars, and other celebrities on pedestals, often considering them to be almost superhuman. Hence, young and old alike look to them as role models, perhaps imitating their mannerisms, dress, or conduct. True Christians refrain from such a distorted view of honoring humans. Christ is the only human who ever lived whom we can consider a perfect role model. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="105-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:21</a>) God would not be pleased if we extended to humans more honor than they are due.

Ask yourself, ‘Am I determined to please Jehovah, to defend true worship, and to protect his people from any corrupting influence?’ For example, what if someone close to you has to be disfellowshipped? Would you take decisive action by ceasing to associate with that person? What would your heart move you to do? Like Asa, you can show that you have a complete heart by fully relying on God when you are faced with opposition, even some that may seem insurmountable. You may be teased or ridiculed at school for taking a stand as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Or colleagues at work may taunt you for taking days off for spiritual activities or for not often working overtime. In such situations, pray to God, just as Asa did.

And if they are reasonable, modest men, they will not fear losing respect if new, relevant information comes to their attention that indicates a need to reconsider what they had already decided. They should be ready to adjust their thinking and decisions when appropriate, and all of us do well to follow that example.

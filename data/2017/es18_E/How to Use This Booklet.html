<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">On the following pages, you will find a scripture for each day and comments on that text. Although the text and comments may be read at any time, many find it advantageous to consider them in the morning. Then they can reflect on such thoughts throughout the day. Discussing the text as a family is most beneficial. Bethel families around the world do so at breakfast time.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The comments are taken from the <em>Watchtower </em>(<em>w</em>) issues of April 2016 through March 2017. Figures following the date of the <em>Watchtower </em>issue refer to the number, in order, of each study article (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) that appears in that issue. This is followed by the paragraphs where the material is found. (See illustration below.) Additional information on the subject matter can be found in the article itself. To find where each article starts, see the second page of that issue of <em>The Watchtower.</em></p>

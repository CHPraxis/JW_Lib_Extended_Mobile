He should be treated “just as a man of the nations and as a tax collector.” Today, we would say that he should be disfellowshipped. The seriousness of this step indicates that the “sin” was not a small disagreement. Rather, it was (1) a sin that could be settled between the individuals concerned but it was also (2) a sin serious enough to merit disfellowshipping if not settled. Such sins might involve a measure of fraud or might include damaging a person’s reputation through slander.

Styles and customs vary not only in different parts of the world but also from one decade to the next. If the Bible had provided a list of acceptable styles of dress and grooming, it would now be out-of-date in that regard. For similar reasons, God’s inspired Word does not provide a lot of rules designed to govern a Christian’s choice of employment, health care, and entertainment. What should we do in situations that do not involve a direct Bible command? Under such circumstances, it is our personal responsibility to examine the details and make a choice that is guided, not by mere personal preference, but by what Jehovah will approve of and bless.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:5-19:37:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 37:5</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="309" href="jwpub://p/E:2016366/9-9"><em>w16.05 </em>3:2,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="308" href="jwpub://p/E:2016366/14-14"> 6</a></p>

He made both natural laws and moral laws to ensure that everything functions harmoniously. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:9" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Ps. 19:7-9</a>) Hence, all things in the universe have an assigned place and function according to their role in God’s purpose. Jehovah sets the standard for how his creation should work together. Thus, the law of gravity holds the atmosphere close to the earth, regulates tides and oceans, and contributes to the physical order essential to life on earth. All creation, including humans, moves and functions within these boundaries. Clearly, the order in creation testifies that God has a purpose for earth and mankind. In our ministry, can we draw attention to the Cause of this impressive order?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Rev. 4:11</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="334" href="jwpub://p/E:2017286/12-13"><em>w17.02 </em>1:4, 5</a></p>

Moses once failed to sanctify Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:12-4:20:12" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Num. 20:12</a>) Joshua neglected to seek God’s guidance before concluding a covenant with the Gibeonites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:9:14-6:9:15" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Josh. 9:14, 15</a>) For a brief period, Hezekiah’s “heart became haughty.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:32:25-14:32:26" data-bid="99-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:25, 26</a>) Nevertheless, despite the imperfections of these men, the Israelites were expected to follow their lead.

Reasonably, we would expect that a person who is worthy of such attention and respect has done something to merit honor or that he serves in a special position. So we might well ask, Whom should we honor, and why is such honor merited? As <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:13-66:5:13" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Revelation 5:13</a> indicates, “the One sitting on the throne and . . . the Lamb” surely deserve to be honored. We note in chapter 4 of the same Bible book one reason why Jehovah deserves to be honored. Exalted creatures in the heavenly realm lift their voices in praise to Jehovah, “the One who lives forever and ever.” They declare: “You are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they came into existence and were created.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:9-66:4:11" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Rev. 4:9-11</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="335" href="jwpub://p/E:2017322/8-9"><em>w17.03 </em>1:1, 2</a></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">A popular philosophy or common adage is: Follow your heart. But doing that can be dangerous. And in a sense, doing so is unscriptural. The Bible warns us not to let our imperfect heart or mere sentiment rule when we are making decisions. And Bible accounts show the sad consequences of following one’s heart. The core problem is that in imperfect humans, “the heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:3:17-24:3:17" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Jer. 3:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:13:10-24:13:10" data-bid="104-2" class="b"> 13:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:17:9-24:17:9" data-bid="104-3" class="b"> 17:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:11:9-11:11:9" data-bid="104-4" class="b"> 1 Ki. 11:9</a>) So, what could it mean for us if we simply follow our heart and let our emotions dictate our thinking and actions? For example, what might happen if we make decisions when we are angry? The answer may be obvious if we have done this in times past. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:17-20:14:17" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Prov. 14:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:22-20:29:22" data-bid="105-2" class="b"> 29:22</a>) Or is it likely that we will make sound decisions when we are discouraged?

Thankfully, though, Jehovah does not deal with us “according to our sins,” provided that we are repentant and in faith approach him humbly on the basis of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:10-19:103:10" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Ps. 103:10</a>) Yet, as David told Solomon, for our daily worship to be acceptable to Jehovah, we have to “serve him with a complete heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:28:9-13:28:9" data-bid="109-1" class="b">1 Chron. 28:9</a>) Serving God with “a complete heart” involves full devotion that does not end. In the Bible, the word “heart” usually refers to a man’s inner self. It encompasses his desires, thinking, disposition, attitudes, abilities, motivations, and goals. So a person who serves Jehovah with his whole heart does not just go through the motions of worshipping Jehovah. What about us? Well, if we, though being imperfect humans, continue to be fully devoted to God without hypocrisy, we will be serving God with a complete heart.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:19:9-14:19:9" data-bid="110-1" class="b">2 Chron. 19:9</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="338" href="jwpub://p/E:2017325/8-8"><em>w17.03 </em>3:1,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="337" href="jwpub://p/E:2017325/10-10"> 3</a></p>

<p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="sb">If we have accomplished something worthwhile, could it be that Jehovah is ‘leaving us alone to put us to the test,’ allowing what is in our heart to surface? For example, a brother may have worked hard to prepare a talk and give it before a large audience. Many praise him for what he has done. How will he react to the praise? When praised, we do well to apply Jesus’ words: “When you have done all the things assigned to you, say: ‘We are good-for-nothing slaves. What we have done is what we ought to have done.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:10-42:17:10" data-bid="112-1" class="b">Luke 17:10</a>) We can learn from Hezekiah’s experience. A haughty attitude surfaced in that he “did not respond appreciatively to the good done to him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:32:24-14:32:27" data-bid="113-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:24-27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:32:31-14:32:31" data-bid="113-2" class="b"> 31</a>) Our meditating on how much God has done for us will help us to avoid an attitude that Jehovah hates.

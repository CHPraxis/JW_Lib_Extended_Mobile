Consider: If two sheep are on a hill, two other sheep are in a valley, and still another sheep is grazing elsewhere, would we describe those five sheep as a flock? Generally, a flock of sheep stays together under the care of its shepherd. Similarly, we cannot follow our Shepherd if we deliberately isolate ourselves. We need to meet together with other Christians to be part of “one flock” under “one shepherd.” When we attend a meeting, we contribute to the unity of our brotherhood.

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb">Some have chosen study projects that involved studying Bible prophecy or the Bible’s historical, archaeological, and scientific accuracy. One fascinating prophecy to consider is <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>. That verse introduces the Bible’s primary theme, which is the vindication of God’s sovereignty and the sanctification of his name by means of the Kingdom. That one verse, using figurative language, sets out how Jehovah will solve all the suffering that humans have experienced since Eden. How might you study <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>? One way would be to prepare a time line. It could list key scriptures that show how God bit by bit shed light on the individuals and arrangement referred to in this verse and that prove that the prophecy will be fulfilled. As you see the scriptures form a harmonious unit, you will surely conclude that the Bible prophets and writers must have been “moved by holy spirit.” <a class="xt" data-xtid="218" href="jwpub://p/E:2016687/17-17"><em>w16.09 </em>4:8</a></p>

Babylon was a center of trade and commerce in the ancient world, and documents that have been unearthed indicate that many Jews learned the art of buying and selling there, while others became skilled craftsmen. Some Jews even became prosperous. Exile in Babylon was nothing like the slavery in Egypt that the Israelites had experienced centuries before.

Yes, on the basis of Jesus’ sacrifice, Jehovah can accept humans back into his family without compromising his righteousness. Is it not heartwarming to think of a time when all faithful humans will be brought to perfection? There will be complete unity between the heavenly and earthly parts of his family. In the fullest sense, we will all be children of God.

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">The July 15, 2013, issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>explained that “the faithful and discreet slave” is a small group of anointed brothers who make up the Governing Body. The Governing Body makes important decisions collectively. How so? The members meet weekly, which fosters close communication and unity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:18-20:20:18" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Prov. 20:18</a>) Each year, they rotate chairmanship at those meetings, since no member of the Governing Body is considered to be more important than the other members. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:1-60:5:1" data-bid="98-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:1</a>) Each of the six committees of the Governing Body rotate chairmanship in the same way. And each member of that body views himself, not as the leader of his fellow brothers, but as one of the “domestics,” fed by the faithful slave and subject to its oversight. The Governing Body is neither inspired nor infallible. Therefore, it can err in doctrinal matters or in organizational direction. <a class="xt" data-xtid="231" href="jwpub://p/E:2017283/20-23"><em>w17.02 </em>4:10-12</a></p>

In fact, no reasonable person should be attracted to or attached to Baal. Still, those Israelites were “limping between two different opinions.” Wisely, Elijah urged them to choose the superior way of worship​—the worship of Jehovah. Why might it have been so difficult for those Israelites to make a wise decision? First, they had basically lost faith in Jehovah and refused to listen to his voice. They had not built a foundation of accurate knowledge or godly wisdom; nor did they trust in Jehovah. Acting in accord with accurate knowledge would have helped them to make wise decisions.

Clearly, we do not want to imitate those in the world who, using social media, treat humans as if they were idols. Of course, some Christians may find pleasure in communicating with family or close friends by such means. But many in the world use social media excessively, following men or women whom they do not even know. Or they spend a great deal of time looking at pictures of or reading about such individuals. There is the danger of becoming consumed with what amounts to trivia. A Christian could even become puffed up with pride over how many like his postings, even taking offense if they cease to follow him. We can ask ourselves, ‘Do I avoid idolizing humans or using a great deal of valuable time on inconsequential matters?’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:15-49:5:16" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Eph. 5:15, 16</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="236" href="jwpub://p/E:2017325/24-24"><em>w17.03 </em>3:14,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="237" href="jwpub://p/E:2017325/27-27"> 17</a></p>

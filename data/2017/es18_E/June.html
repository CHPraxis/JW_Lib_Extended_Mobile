As long as Moses did that, Jehovah empowered the hands of the Israelites to fight successfully against the Amalekites. However, when Moses’ hands became heavy and began to drop down, the Amalekites started to win. Acting with decisiveness, Aaron and Hur “took a stone and put it under [Moses], and he sat on it. Then Aaron and Hur, one on each side, supported his hands, so that his hands remained steady until the sun set.” Yes, God’s mighty hand enabled the Israelites to win the battle.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:17:8-2:17:13" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ex. 17:8-13</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="183" href="jwpub://p/E:2016681/13-15"><em>w16.09 </em>1:5-7</a></p>

As we struggle against giving in to our own fleshly weaknesses, we can succeed. How? By imitating Paul, by fully relying on Jehovah and not on our own strength, and by having faith in the ransom. There are times when God may allow us to demonstrate the depth of our concern about a matter. For instance, what if we (or a family member) were stricken by a serious illness or we were faced with some injustice? We would show our full trust in Jehovah by supplicating him in prayer to give us the strength to keep faithful and not lose our joy and spiritual balance.

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">Some younger ones may now be coordinating activities that include older brothers. Though such younger ones have a changed role, they would do well to benefit from the wisdom and experience of older ones before making decisions. Timothy, a younger man, worked alongside the apostle Paul for many years. Paul had written to the Corinthians: “I am sending Timothy to you, because he is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my methods in connection with Christ Jesus.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:17-46:4:17" data-bid="90-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:17</a>) This brief statement points to the close cooperation between Paul and Timothy. Paul had taken time to teach Timothy his “methods.” Timothy learned well and had won Paul’s affection, and Paul was confident that Timothy could care for the spiritual needs of those in Corinth. What a fine example for elders to imitate today as they train other men to take the lead in the congregation! <a class="xt" data-xtid="198" href="jwpub://p/E:2017248/23-24"><em>w17.01 </em>5:13, 14</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">To disseminate Bible truth in various languages, Zion’s Watch Tower Tract Society was legally incorporated in 1884, with Charles Taze Russell as president. He was an outstanding student of the Bible, and he fearlessly exposed as false such doctrines as the Trinity and the immortality of the soul. He discerned that Christ would return invisibly and that “the appointed times of the nations” would end in 1914. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:24-42:21:24" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Luke 21:24</a>) Brother Russell devoted his time, energy, and money unsparingly to share these truths with others. Clearly, at that pivotal time, Brother Russell was used by Jehovah and the head of the congregation. Brother Russell did not seek glory from humans. In 1896, he wrote: “We want no homage, no reverence, for ourselves or our writings; nor do we wish to be called Reverend or Rabbi. Nor do we wish that any should be called by our name.” He later stated: “This is not man’s work.” <a class="xt" data-xtid="199" href="jwpub://p/E:2017283/18-19"><em>w17.02 </em>4:8, 9</a></p>

However, many of our decisions, the choices we make, can have a profound effect on us. Hence, the ability to make good decisions can help us to live a relatively smooth, peaceful life rather than one that is full of chaos, controversy, and disappointment. What will help us to make wise decisions? We certainly need faith in God, not doubting his willingness and ability to help us to be wise. We also need faith in Jehovah’s Word and in his way of doing things, trusting God’s inspired counsel.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:2-14:20:4" data-bid="103-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:2-4</a>) Jehoshaphat did become afraid! Yet, “he resolved to search for Jehovah.” In prayer, he humbly admitted that his people were “powerless before this large crowd” and that he and his people did not know what to do. He fully relied on Jehovah, saying the words of today’s text. Sometimes we, like Jehoshaphat, may not know what to do, even being afraid. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:8-47:4:9" data-bid="104-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:8, 9</a>) But remember that Jehoshaphat acknowledged in a public prayer how weak he and his people felt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:5-14:20:5" data-bid="105-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:5</a>) Those who take the spiritual lead in the family can imitate Jehoshaphat by turning to Jehovah for guidance and strength to cope with the problem they face. Do not feel ashamed to let your family hear such supplications. They will sense your trust in Jehovah. God helped Jehoshaphat, and he will also help you. <a class="xt" data-xtid="202" href="jwpub://p/E:2017325/21-22"><em>w17.03 </em>3:12, 13</a></p>

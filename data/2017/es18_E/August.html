<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">Jesus knew that his earthly ministry would come to an end and that others would carry on his work. Though his disciples were imperfect, he had confidence in them and told them that they would do works greater than he did. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:12-43:14:12" data-bid="91-1" class="b">John 14:12</a>) He trained them thoroughly, and they spread the good news throughout the then-known world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:23-51:1:23" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Col. 1:23</a>) After his sacrificial death, Jesus was resurrected to heaven where he was given more work to do with authority “far above every government and authority and power and lordship.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:19-49:1:21" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Eph. 1:19-21</a>) If we die faithful before Armageddon, we will be resurrected into a righteous new world, where there will be plenty of satisfying work for us to do. Now, though, there is vitally important work that all of us can participate in​—preaching the good news and making disciples. May all of us, young or old, keep on “having plenty to do in the work of the Lord.” <a class="xt" data-xtid="267" href="jwpub://p/E:2017248/28-29"><em>w17.01 </em>5:17, 18</a></p>

<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="sb">It is up to each of us to make decisions, and the wise, right choices are based on sound Scriptural knowledge. We should not give someone else the responsibility to make decisions for us. Rather, we should personally learn what is right in God’s eyes and choose to do it. How might we give in to the danger of letting others choose for us? Peer pressure could sway us to make a bad decision. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:10-20:1:10" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Prov. 1:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:15-20:1:15" data-bid="105-2" class="b"> 15</a>) Still, no matter how others try to pressure us, it is our responsibility to follow our Bible-trained conscience. In many respects, if we let others make our decisions, we are essentially deciding to “follow them.” It is still a choice, but a potentially disastrous one. The apostle Paul clearly alerted the Galatians to the danger of letting others make personal decisions for them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:17-48:4:17" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Gal. 4:17</a>) Some in the congregation wanted to make personal choices for others in order to alienate them from the apostles. <a class="xt" data-xtid="271" href="jwpub://p/E:2017323/17-19"><em>w17.03 </em>2:8-10</a></p>

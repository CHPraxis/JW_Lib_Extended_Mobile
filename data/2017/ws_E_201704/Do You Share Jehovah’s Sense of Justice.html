Why? He respectfully explained: “It is unthinkable, from Jehovah’s standpoint, for me to give you the inheritance of my forefathers.” Naboth refused King Ahab’s offer because it was against Jehovah’s law for Israelites to sell their family inheritance permanently.

<div class="pGroup">

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>When Naboth’s family and friends heard that Ahab’s family would not be punished until after Ahab died, that may have tested their faith in God. But humility would have helped them to protect their faith. Why? If they were humble, they would continue worshipping Jehovah, trusting that it is impossible for God to be unfair. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:32:3-5:32:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 32:3, 4</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>In the future, Naboth’s family will experience the blessing of seeing their loved ones in the resurrection. There will be perfect justice for Naboth and his sons.

Second, if we have observed or experienced an injustice, humility will help us to be obedient and patient and wait for Jehovah to correct the situation. The Bible says: “It will turn out well for those who fear the true God.” The Bible also says: “But it will not turn out well for the wicked one, nor will he prolong his days.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:8:12-21:8:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 8:12, 13</a>) If we remain humble, we will benefit and so will everyone involved.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:5:5-60:5:5" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 5:5</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>The early Christians in Syrian Antioch experienced a situation that tested their humility and also their willingness to forgive. Let us consider that account and use it to examine our attitude about forgiveness. It may help us to understand why Jehovah can use imperfect people without lowering his standards.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>13, 14. </strong>What assignments did the apostle Peter have, and how did he show that he was courageous?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>The apostle Peter was an elder whom most of the early Christians knew very well. He was a personal friend of Jesus and had been given important assignments. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:16:19-40:16:19" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 16:19</a>) For example, in the year 36, Peter was <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>assigned to preach to Cornelius and everyone in his house. Why was this special? Because Cornelius was not a Jew; he was an uncircumcised Gentile. When Cornelius and those in his house received holy spirit, Peter recognized that they could be baptized as Christians. He said: “Can anyone deny water to prevent these from being baptized who have received the holy spirit just as we have?”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:10:47-44:10:47" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 10:47</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>In the year 49, the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem met to decide whether Gentile Christians needed to be circumcised. At this meeting, Peter courageously reminded the brothers that he had personally seen uncircumcised Gentiles receive the holy spirit. It was Peter’s experience that helped the governing body to make their decision. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:6-44:15:11" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 15:6-11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:13-44:15:14" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 13, 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:28-44:15:29" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 28, 29</a>) Both Jewish and Gentile Christians must have been grateful that Peter had the courage to tell the facts. It must have been easy for those early Christians to trust this faithful and mature man!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>15. </strong>What mistake did Peter make while he was in Syrian Antioch? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Soon after the meeting in Jerusalem, Peter visited Syrian Antioch. While he was there, he spent time with his Gentile brothers. We can imagine how much they loved learning from Peter’s knowledge and experience. However, they must have been surprised and hurt when Peter suddenly stopped eating with them. Peter influenced other Jewish Christians, including Barnabas, to do the same. Why did this mature Christian elder make such a serious mistake, one that could have divided the congregation? More important, what can we learn from Peter’s mistake that can help us if we are hurt by the words or actions of an elder?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:29:25-20:29:25" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Proverbs 29:25</a>) Peter knew how Jehovah felt about the Gentiles. Still, he was afraid that the circumcised Jewish Christians visiting from Jerusalem would think less of him for associating with those Gentile Christians. The apostle Paul told Peter that he was being a hypocrite. Why? Because Paul had heard Peter defend the Gentiles at the meeting in Jerusalem in the year 49. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:12-44:15:12" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 15:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:2:13-48:2:13" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Galatians 2:13</a>, footnote) How would the Gentile Christians whom Peter had offended react?

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Peter was humble and accepted Paul’s correction. The Scriptures do not say that Peter lost any of his assignments. In fact, he was later inspired to write two letters that became part of the Bible. In his second letter, he even refers to Paul as “our beloved brother.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:15-61:3:15" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:15</a>) Peter’s mistake must have been painful for the Gentile Christians.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:1:22-49:1:22" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:22</a>) Brothers and sisters in the congregation had an opportunity to imitate Jesus and his Father by forgiving Peter. Hopefully, no one allowed himself to be stumbled by an imperfect man’s mistake.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>18. </strong>When may we need to imitate Jehovah’s sense of justice?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>There were no perfect elders in the early Christian congregation, and there are no perfect elders in the Christian congregation today. The Bible says: “We all make mistakes many times.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="26-1" class="b">James 3:2</a>, footnote) This is easy to recognize, but what will we do when we personally experience the imperfections of a brother? Will we imitate Jehovah’s sense of justice? For example, how will you respond if an elder makes a comment that seems prejudiced? Will you allow yourself to be stumbled if an elder thoughtlessly says something that offends or hurts you? Rather than quickly thinking that the brother should not be an elder, will you patiently wait on Jesus, the head of the congregation? Rather than focusing on the mistake, will you remember the brother’s many years of faithful service? If a brother who sins against you continues to serve as an elder or even receives more assignments, will you be happy for him? If you are willing to forgive, you show that you are imitating Jehovah’s sense of justice.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:14-40:6:15" data-bid="27-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 6:14, 15</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">“WILL the Judge of all the earth not do what is right?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:18:25-1:18:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 18:25</a>) The faithful man Abraham did not ask that question because he was in doubt. Instead, his question showed that he was confident that Jehovah would judge the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah with perfect justice. He was convinced that Jehovah would never put “the righteous man to death with the wicked one.” That was “unthinkable” to Abraham. Later, Jehovah said of himself: “The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness who is never unjust; righteous and upright is he.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:31:19-5:31:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 31:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 32:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>Why is it impossible for Jehovah to be unjust?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Why was Abraham confident that Jehovah would always do what is right? Because Jehovah is the greatest <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>example of justice and righteousness. In fact, the words “justice” and “righteousness” are often used together in the Hebrew Scriptures because they have similar meanings. So since Jehovah’s standards are always right, he will always judge matters correctly. The Bible says: “He loves righteousness and justice.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:33:5-19:33:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 33:5</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>It is comforting to know that Jehovah is always fair. However, the world today is full of injustice. For example, people have been convicted and sent to prison for crimes that they did not commit. As a result of DNA tests, some have eventually been found innocent, but only after spending many years in prison. Such injustices cause frustration and anger. However, there is another type of injustice that may be even more difficult to endure. What is it?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:1:8-62:1:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 John 1:8</a>) Even though this rarely happens, faithful Christians are not surprised or stumbled when an injustice takes place.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Consider the experience of Willi Diehl. Beginning in 1931, Brother Diehl served faithfully at Bethel in Bern, Switzerland. In 1946, he attended the eighth class of Gilead School in New York, U.S.A. After graduation, he was eventually assigned to the circuit work in Switzerland. In his life story, Brother Diehl said that in May 1949, he informed the Switzerland branch that he planned to get married. The responsible brothers told him that they were taking away all his privileges. He would only be allowed to pioneer. “I was not permitted to give talks,” said Brother Diehl. “Many no longer greeted us, treating us like disfellowshipped persons.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>How did Brother Diehl react? He said: “We knew, however, that getting married was not unscriptural, so we took refuge in prayer and put our trust in Jehovah.” Even though some brothers did not understand Jehovah’s <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>view of marriage, in time their understanding was corrected, and Brother Diehl got his privileges back.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>10, 11. </strong>(a) What injustices did Joseph experience? (b) What opportunity did Joseph have while he was in prison?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Joseph was a faithful servant of Jehovah who experienced injustice from strangers. But what hurt him the most was the injustice from his own brothers. When Joseph was 17 years old, his brothers kidnapped him and sold him as a slave. Then he was taken to Egypt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:37:23-1:37:28" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 37:23-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:42:21-1:42:21" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 42:21</a>) Later, in that foreign country, Joseph was falsely accused of trying to rape a woman and was sent to prison without a trial. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:39:17-1:39:20" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Genesis 39:17-20</a>) Joseph’s suffering as a slave and as a prisoner lasted for about 13 years. What lessons can we learn from Joseph’s experience that will help us if we experience injustice from our brothers?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>While Joseph was in prison, the chief cupbearer of the king was also sent to prison. One night, the <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>cupbearer had a dream, which Jehovah helped Joseph to interpret. Joseph explained that the cupbearer would be released from prison and would serve Pharaoh again. Then Joseph took the opportunity to explain his situation to the man. We can learn much not only from what Joseph said but also from what he did not say.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:40:5-1:40:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 40:5-13</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>12, 13. </strong>(a) How do we know that Joseph did not simply accept the injustice? (b) What did Joseph not tell the cupbearer?</p>

Joseph also said clearly that he was not guilty of the crime that he was accused of. That is why he asked the cupbearer to mention him to Pharaoh. What was his goal? He said: “In order to get me out of this place.”</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Did Joseph simply accept his situation without trying to do something about it? No! Joseph knew that he was the victim of many injustices. That is why he explained his situation to the cupbearer, hoping that the man would be able to help him. But note that the Scriptures do not say that Joseph ever <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>told anyone, not even Pharaoh, that his brothers were the kidnappers. In fact, when his brothers came to Egypt and made peace with Joseph, Pharaoh welcomed them and invited them to live in Egypt and to enjoy “the best of all the land.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:45:16-1:45:20" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis 45:16-20</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>If we think that we have experienced injustice in the congregation, we must be very careful not to gossip about the situation. Of course, we should ask for help from the elders and tell them if a brother has committed a serious sin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:5:1-3:5:1" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Leviticus 5:1</a>) However, in many cases that do not involve a serious sin, it may be possible to make peace with a brother without telling anyone else, not even the elders. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:23-40:5:24" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 5:23, 24;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:18:15-40:18:15" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> <strong>18:15</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Let us be loyal and apply Bible principles in these situations. Sometimes we may realize that we have misunderstood the situation and that we were not the victim of an injustice after all. Then we would be grateful that we did not make the situation worse by saying bad things about our brother! Remember that whether we are right or wrong, saying something hurtful will never improve a situation. Loyalty to Jehovah and to our brothers will protect us from making such a mistake. The psalmist said that there is “one who is walking faultlessly.” Such a person “does not slander with his tongue, he does nothing bad to his neighbor.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:15:2-19:15:3" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 15:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:3:5-59:3:5" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> James 3:5</a>.</p>

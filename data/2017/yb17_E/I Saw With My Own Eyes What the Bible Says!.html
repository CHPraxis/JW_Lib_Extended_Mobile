<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">I FIRST heard about the Witnesses when I was a college student in the city of Kutaisi. A neighbor told me that the Witnesses do not use icons in their worship and do not believe that Jesus is Almighty God. This contradicted beliefs I cherished as an Orthodox Christian.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">When I returned to my hometown, Tsageri, in the summer of 1992, I found out that the Witnesses were active there too. My mother had heard many positive things about the Witnesses. Because I still had a negative view of them, she told me, “Go and see for yourself what they teach.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Two pioneer brothers, Pavle and Paata, regularly visited a family in our neighborhood. Many neighbors took advantage <span id="page137" class="pageNum" data-no="137" data-before-text="137"></span>of their visits to listen to them and ask questions. So I decided to attend those discussions. Each time I raised a question, the brothers opened the Bible and asked me to read in it. That made a big impression on me​—I saw with my own eyes what the Bible says!</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">I soon joined a group with whom the brothers were studying the Bible. The following summer, ten of us got baptized. Later, my mom also became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Looking back, I am grateful that the brothers answered all my questions by letting me read the answers from the Bible. This helped me to resolve the inner conflict I faced as my own beliefs were challenged. Remembering how much opening the Bible this way helped me, I use this approach to help others appreciate the truth!</p>

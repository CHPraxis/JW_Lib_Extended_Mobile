<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">IN 1989, my husband and I met the Witnesses at our neighborâ€™s place. Brother Givi Barnadze, who was studying the Bible with our neighbor, did not have a copy of his own, because it was hard to find Bibles in Georgia at that time.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">We appreciated what we heard and desired to obtain a Bible. When my husband saw his fleshly brother, he told him that he was looking for a Bible. To his surprise, his brother replied that he had recently bought a new version of the Bible in Georgian and that he would be happy to give him this Bible as a gift.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">When Badri came back home, he sat at the table and read the Bible until nightfall. The next day, he woke up and continued reading. When I came home from work, <span id="page129" class="pageNum" data-no="129" data-before-text="129"></span>I found him sitting at the table, still reading the Scriptures. He could not stop reading! So I suggested that he take a few days off to complete his reading. Soon he had managed to read the entire Bible.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">When we later began studying the book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life </em>with Brother Barnadze, we were very glad to have our own Bible. It worked out well because we did not have a personal copy of the <em>Truth </em>book and our teacher did not have a Bible! About a year later, Badri and I were baptized.</p>

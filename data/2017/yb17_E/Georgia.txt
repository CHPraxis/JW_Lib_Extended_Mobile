Georgia




THE spread of the Kingdom message in Georgia is aptly portrayed in Jesus’ illustration of the hidden leaven. (Matt. 13:33) As was true of the leaven, spiritual growth was not discernible at first, but soon the Kingdom message spread pervasively and changed the lives of many.
Read the vibrant and motivating story of love, faith, loyalty, initiative, and courage displayed by God’s people in Georgia during both “favorable times and difficult times.”​—2 Tim. 4:2.

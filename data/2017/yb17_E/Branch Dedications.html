An audience of more than 3,000 in 18 Kingdom Halls and 5 other venues were thrilled to be tied in to the program. Stephen Lett of the Governing Body gave the dedication talk, which had the motivating theme “Serve Jehovah With a Complete Heart.” The following day a faith-strengthening program was presented to the vast majority of the publishers in the country.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span id="page28" class="pageNum" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>On Saturday, May 14, 2016, an audience of 6,435 was present for the dedication of the <strong>Armenia </strong>branch office, housed in 6 floors of a beautiful 18-story residential building. An Assembly Hall and facilities for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers were also dedicated. The talks during the program outlined the small beginnings of Jehovah’s servants in Armenia. The work had its start among Armenian immigrants in the United States in the early part of the 20th century and then in Armenia itself in the mid-1970’s, while the country was still part of the Soviet Union. More recently, the organization obtained legal registration and the branch was formed. Many of those present never imagined that they would see such thrilling theocratic accomplishments. The highlight of the event came when all in attendance wholeheartedly agreed with David Splane of the Governing Body to dedicate those beautiful facilities to Jehovah.</p>

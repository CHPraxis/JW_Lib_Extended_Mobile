<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">WHEN I heard about Bible truth back in 1989, I was a prominent member of the Communist Party in my hometown, Senaki, and I regularly sat on the Supreme Soviet of Georgia, equivalent to today’s parliament. I was also engaged to a young man, so I felt that my life was a success.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Mom and Dad instilled in me a love for God. Hence, I believed in God, even though I was a Communist. When I started studying the Bible, I found satisfying answers to all my questions, so I decided to dedicate my life to Jehovah. But my family, friends, colleagues, and fiancé did not agree with my decision.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">My new faith caused my relatives to reject me, and it was also incompatible with my political career. I concluded that I had no choice but to leave home, break off my <span id="page133" class="pageNum" data-no="133" data-before-text="133"></span>engagement, and resign from my job as well as the Communist Party and the Supreme Soviet. After my baptism, I felt even more pressure from friends and family. Because I was well-known in my hometown, I moved to the city of Kutaisi, where I immediately started pioneering.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">When people ask me if my faith was worth the hardships I went through, I answer without hesitation that I am completely happy with the decisions I made. Although my parents did not understand my choices, I am grateful that they taught me to love God and neighbor. This has helped me greatly in life.</p>

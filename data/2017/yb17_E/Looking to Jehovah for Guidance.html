<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">MY MOTHER was really upset when my wife, Tsitso, and I became Jehovah’s Witnesses. One day, she summoned all our relatives, hoping that they would persuade me not to associate with the Witnesses anymore. I was given a choice​—either change my mind or be cast out of the family.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">I made the decision to leave town. Being a metalworker, I considered moving to the second largest city in Georgia, Kutaisi, where I could easily find employment. I also knew that there was a great need for publishers in that city, so I looked to Jehovah for guidance.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Shortly thereafter, I met one of my Bible students, who lived in a small town called Jvari. When he heard that I was thinking of moving to Kutaisi, he begged me to move to his town instead. “We have an apartment,” he told me. “My wife, my children, and I will move to one room, and you and your wife can use the other one.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span id="page107" class="pageNum" data-no="107" data-before-text="107"></span>Since I was seeking Jehovah’s direction, I told him that I would temporarily accept his offer only if I quickly found both a job and a place to rent in Jvari. To my great surprise, he came back the same evening with a list of job offers.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">A few days later, my family settled in Jvari. From the very first day, I had a job with a surprisingly high salary. My new boss offered me accommodations in a large house owned by the company. Soon after, I was asked to help with the underground printing of Bible literature. We had plenty of space in our new home, so my wife and I made it available for this activity.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">For many years, our spacious house hosted the Memorial and other special events. Over 500 individuals got baptized under our roof! I am so glad that I saw evidence of Jehovah’s direction and followed it!</p>

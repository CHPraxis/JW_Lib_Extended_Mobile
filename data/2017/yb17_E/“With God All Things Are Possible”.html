<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">AT OUR meetings in the late 1980’s, only the <em>Watchtower </em>Study conductor had a copy of the magazine, and it was usually a handwritten one. I approached Genadi Gudadze, one of the elders, and suggested that we should try to print our own magazines.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Until then, the brothers had used a homemade mimeograph to produce a small quantity of publications. To produce magazines regularly, they needed a more efficient mimeograph, an experienced typist, a typewriter, and a steady supply of stencil paper. However, all printing equipment, even the paper, was registered with the government and controlled by the special security services.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">I obtained a typewriter through a professional acquaintance who had access to discarded machines that were no longer under government control. My sister was a typist and could assist us. The brothers built a new mimeograph <span id="page109" class="pageNum" data-no="109" data-before-text="109"></span>and located a source for purchasing stencils. Everything fell into place, and soon our first copy of an issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>in Georgian was produced.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">But a new obstacle arose. One day, Genadi told me, “We have to find another source of supply for the stencils.” He had seen packages of stencils in a government-run office but could not purchase them himself, as he was watched by the authorities. How could we obtain them? I repeatedly exclaimed, “It’s impossible!” To this Genadi firmly replied, “Stop saying, ‘It’s impossible.’ ‘With God all things are possible’!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:26-40:19:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 19:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">I thought about this continually as I nervously headed to the government-run office the next day. Jehovah directed me to a friendly typist who was willing to submit my request to the head of the office. He was her husband! Soon I was regularly buying stencils from this office, and after that we never experienced a problem with supplies.</p>

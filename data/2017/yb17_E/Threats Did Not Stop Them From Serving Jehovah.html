<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Our brothers and sisters were not intimidated, and they continued meeting together. Elders wisely took preventive measures to protect publishers. Brother André Carbonneau, a Canadian lawyer who defended our brothers in those years, recalls: “A brother would usually be stationed near the meeting place with a cell phone. If he saw a mob approaching, he would immediately warn the elders of a potential attack.”</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Witnesses were often misrepresented in media reports as people who break up families, refuse medical <span id="page147" class="pageNum" data-no="147" data-before-text="147"></span>treatment, and act against the State.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">John Burns, a lawyer from the Canada branch, who assisted the Georgian brothers in those years, recalls: “Local brothers and sisters who worked as lawyers made themselves available.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In the meantime, violent acts against the Witnesses continued. Therefore, beginning on January 8, 2001, the Witnesses circulated a petition that called for protection from mob attacks and for the prosecution of those who had assaulted peaceful citizens.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Brother Burns explains the purpose of the petition: “Our aim was to show that most Georgians disapproved of such violence against Jehovah’s Witnesses and that a small group of religious extremists were actually responsible for it.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Within just two weeks, 133,375 adults from all regions of Georgia​—most of whom were Orthodox—​signed <span id="page149" class="pageNum" data-no="149" data-before-text="149"></span>the petition. Although the petition was presented to President Shevardnadze, the violence did not stop. Religious extremists continued deliberately targeting the Witnesses.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">For most of her life, Babilina Kharatishvili was a devoted member of the Georgian Orthodox Church. When she was in her 30’s, she traveled from town to town and from village to village teaching people about the lives led by the saints.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">But Babilina wanted to know more about God. So she decided to attend lectures at a Georgian Orthodox seminary. On one occasion, a clergyman showed the book <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life </em>to his listeners and encouraged them to obtain a copy of it from Jehovah’s Witnesses. He told them, “This book can teach you a lot about the Bible.”</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Babilina was shocked. She had always avoided the Witnesses, and now a clergyman recommended their books! She told herself, ‘If I should learn about God from Jehovah’s Witnesses, what am I doing here?’ She immediately contacted the Witnesses in the city of Poti and started studying the Bible.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">As Babilina learned more from the Bible, she made important changes in her life. She once said: “When I saw with my own eyes that the Bible says it is wrong to <span id="page150" class="pageNum" data-no="150" data-before-text="150"></span>worship icons, I shunned all forms of idolatry. I was convinced that it was the right thing to do.” In her late 70’s at the time, she decided to become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Eliso Dzidzishvili was 28 years old when she decided to become a nun. Since there was no convent close to her hometown, Tkibuli, she moved to Tbilisi in 2001. While searching for a vacancy in a convent, she took a part-time job as a private teacher. One of her pupils happened to be the daughter of a sister named Nunu.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Eliso relates: “We often talked about the Bible. I fiercely defended the Orthodox religion, while Nunu <span id="page151" class="pageNum" data-no="151" data-before-text="151"></span>patiently showed me one verse after another. One day, she offered to read me the brochure <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>As we read paragraphs and looked up Bible verses, I realized that worshipping icons is in direct violation of God’s command.”</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Later, Eliso went to the local church and asked a priest some questions. From his answers it was clear that the church’s teachings were not based on the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:7:7-41:7:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 7:7, 8</a>) Convinced that she had found the truth, she immediately started to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses and soon got baptized.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">By 2001, a growing number of congregations needed suitable places to meet for worship. According to one estimate, some 70 Kingdom Halls were needed. Hence, a Kingdom Hall construction program was initiated despite the opposition in the country.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:3:3-15:3:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezra 3:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">In view of such opposition, how successful could the construction project be? Tamazi says: “We continued our work and finished the Kingdom Hall in three months.

In fact, the walls had just been erected and the mortar was still wet when opposers came and tore down the building.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">However, in November 2003, a new development in Georgia brought relief to our brothers and sisters. A change in government opened the door to more religious tolerance. As a result, several members of the extremist Orthodox group that had attacked Jehovah’s Witnesses were arrested.</p>

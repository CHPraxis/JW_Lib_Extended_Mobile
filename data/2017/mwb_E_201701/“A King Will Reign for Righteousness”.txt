TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | ISAIAH 29-33
“A King Will Reign for Righteousness”



Jesus, the King, provides “princes,” or elders, who care for the flock

32:1-3
  Like “a place of concealment from the rainstorm,” they work to protect the flock from storms of persecution and discouragement

  Like “streams of water in a waterless land,” they refresh those who are spiritually thirsty by offering pure, unadulterated truth

  Like “the shadow of a massive crag in a parched land,” they bring relief to the flock by providing spiritual guidance and refreshment

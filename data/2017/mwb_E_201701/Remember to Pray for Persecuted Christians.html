<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Bible prophesied that Satan would persecute us in an attempt to hinder our ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:15:20-43:15:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joh 15:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Re 12:17</a>) How can we help fellow Christians who are suffering persecution in other lands? We can pray for them. “A righteous man’s supplication has a powerful effect.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:5:16-59:5:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jas 5:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What can we pray for? We can ask Jehovah to give our brothers and sisters courage and to help them not to be afraid. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:41:10-23:41:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa 41:10-13</a>) We can also pray for the authorities to be favorably disposed toward the preaching work, “so that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:2:1-54:2:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1Ti 2:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When Paul and Peter were persecuted, the first-century Christians prayed for them by name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:12:5-44:12:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ac 12:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:30-45:15:31" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ro 15:30, 31</a>) Even if we do not know the names of all those being persecuted today, could we mention their congregation, country, or region?</p>

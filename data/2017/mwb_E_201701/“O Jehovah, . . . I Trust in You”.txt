LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
“O Jehovah, . . . I Trust in You”









It is important for us to trust in Jehovah both in good times and in bad. (Ps 25:1, 2) In the eighth century B.C.E., the Jews in Judah faced a crisis that tested their trust in God. What occurred provides many lessons for us. (Ro 15:4) After watching the video “O Jehovah, . . . I Trust in You,” how would you answer the following questions?
              What crisis did Hezekiah face?

              How did Hezekiah apply the principle found at Proverbs 22:3 when anticipating a possible siege?

               Why did Hezekiah not consider surrendering to Assyria or making an alliance with Egypt?

               How is Hezekiah a good example for Christians?

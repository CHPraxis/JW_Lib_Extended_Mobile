LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Remember to Pray for Persecuted Christians




The Bible prophesied that Satan would persecute us in an attempt to hinder our ministry. (Joh 15:20; Re 12:17) How can we help fellow Christians who are suffering persecution in other lands? We can pray for them. “A righteous man’s supplication has a powerful effect.”—Jas 5:16.





What can we pray for? We can ask Jehovah to give our brothers and sisters courage and to help them not to be afraid. (Isa 41:10-13) We can also pray for the authorities to be favorably disposed toward the preaching work, “so that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life.”—1Ti 2:1, 2.
When Paul and Peter were persecuted, the first-century Christians prayed for them by name. (Ac 12:5; Ro 15:30, 31) Even if we do not know the names of all those being persecuted today, could we mention their congregation, country, or region?
  The latest information on the persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses can be found on jw.org. (Look under NEWSROOM > LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS.)

  The jw.org article “Jehovah’s Witnesses Imprisoned for Their Faith—By Location” lists the number of those currently imprisoned in each country. (Look under NEWSROOM > LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS.

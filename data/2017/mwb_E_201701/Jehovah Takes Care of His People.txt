Jehovah Takes Care of His People




Like a generous host, Jehovah supplies us with an abundance of spiritual food.








“Jehovah of armies will make for all the peoples a banquet”

25:6
  In Bible times, when people ate a meal together, it signified peace and friendship





“Of rich dishes filled with marrow, of fine, filtered wine”

  Rich dishes and fine, filtered wine picture the very best of spiritual food that Jehovah provides for us

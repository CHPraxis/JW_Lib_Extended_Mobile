A Waiting Attitude Helps Us to Endure



What helped Jeremiah to endure with a good attitude despite intense suffering?

3:20, 21, 24, 26, 27
  He was confident that Jehovah would “bow low” over repentant ones among His people and lift them out of their sad condition

  He had learned “to carry the yoke during his youth.” Enduring tests of faith while young prepares a person to deal successfully with challenges later in life










How can I prepare for future challenges?




How can I show a waiting attitude?

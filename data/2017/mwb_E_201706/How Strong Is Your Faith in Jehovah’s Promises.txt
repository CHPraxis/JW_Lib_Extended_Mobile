LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
How Strong Is Your Faith in Jehovah’s Promises?




Joshua and Solomon both confirmed that not one word of Jehovah’s promises had failed. (Jos 23:14; 1Ki 8:56) The testimony of these two reliable witnesses adds to the solid foundation on which we can build our faith.​—2Co 13:1; Tit 1:2.
How did Jehovah fulfill his promises in the days of Joshua? Along with your family, watch the video drama ‘Not One Word Has Failed.’ Then consider the following questions: (1) How can you imitate Rahab’s acts of faith? (Heb 11:31; Jas 2:24-26) (2) How does the example of Achan prove that willful disobedience leads to disaster? (3) Even though the men of Gibeon were warriors, why did they deceive Joshua and make peace with Israel? (4) How did Jehovah’s word come true when five Amorite kings threatened Israel? (Jos 10:5-14) (5) How has Jehovah acted in your behalf as you put God’s Kingdom and his righteousness first in your life?​—Mt 6:33.
As we reflect on all that Jehovah has done, is doing, and will do, our faith in his promises will grow stronger.​—Ro 8:31, 32.

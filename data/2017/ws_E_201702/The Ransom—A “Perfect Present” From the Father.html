<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb">THE ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ makes many blessings possible. For example, the ransom arrangement opens the door for all of Adam’s children who love righteousness to become part of God’s family one day. Another blessing is that we can live forever in happiness. More than that, the ransom is connected with matters that are very important to everyone in heaven and on earth.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:1:8-58:1:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:8, 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>(a) What very important matters in heaven and on earth did Jesus include in his prayer? (See opening picture.) (b) What will we discuss in this article?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>About two years before Jesus died, he taught his disciples to pray: “Our Father in the heavens, let your <strong>name </strong>be sanctified. Let your <strong>Kingdom </strong>come. Let your <strong>will </strong>take place, as in heaven, also on earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>) Let us examine how the ransom is connected to the sanctification of Jehovah’s name, the rule of God’s Kingdom, and the doing of God’s will.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What does Jehovah’s name represent? How did Satan attack Jehovah’s name?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>First of all, Jesus prayed for Jehovah’s name to be sanctified, or treated as holy. Jehovah’s name represents Jehovah himself, who he is. He is the most powerful and righteous Person in the whole universe. Jesus also called him “Holy Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:11-43:17:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 17:11</a>) Because Jehovah is holy, everything he does and any laws he makes are holy. But in Eden, Satan slyly questioned God’s right to set standards for humans. He lied about Jehovah and attacked God’s name, or reputation.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-5</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jesus, on the other hand, truly loved the name of Jehovah and did everything he could to sanctify it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:25-43:17:26" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 17:25, 26</a>) How? By his conduct and teaching, Jesus helped others to see that Jehovah’s standards are right and that everything he asks of us is for our own good. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:40:8-19:40:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 40:8-10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Even when Satan caused him to suffer and die a painful death, Jesus remained loyal. He proved that it is possible for a perfect man to obey Jehovah completely.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How can we treat Jehovah’s name as holy?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>How can we show that we love Jehovah’s name? By our conduct. Jehovah requires us to be holy. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:15-60:1:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 1:15, 16</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>This means that we worship only him and obey him with all our heart. Even when we are persecuted, we do our best to live in the way Jehovah teaches us. By living according to Jehovah’s standards, we bring glory to his name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:14-40:5:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 5:14-16</a>) We prove that his laws are good and that Satan is a liar. We are not perfect, so we will make mistakes. But when we do, we repent and do our best to stop doing things that dishonor Jehovah’s name.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:79:9-19:79:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 79:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>Why can Jehovah view us as righteous, even though we are imperfect?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Whether we are of the anointed or of the “other sheep,” Jehovah forgives our sins if we have faith in the ransom. He accepts as his worshippers those who dedicate themselves to him. He declares anointed Christians righteous as his sons and the “other sheep” righteous as his friends. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:1-45:5:2" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Romans 5:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:2:21-59:2:25" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> James 2:21-25</a>) Therefore, even now, the ransom makes it possible for us to have a good relationship with our Father and to sanctify his name.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>In the model prayer, Jesus said: “Let your Kingdom come.” How is the ransom connected to the Kingdom of God? God’s Kingdom, or government, is made up of Jesus and 144,000 chosen from mankind. The ransom makes it possible for these humans to be resurrected to heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 5:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 14:1</a>) They will be kings and priests and will rule over the earth with Jesus for a thousand years.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jesus helped his disciples to understand the importance of God’s Kingdom. How? Immediately after his baptism, Jesus began to preach “the good news of the Kingdom of God” everywhere he went. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 4:43</a>) He also told his disciples to be witnesses of him “to the most distant part of the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:1:6-44:1:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Acts 1:6-8</a>) Today, by means of the Kingdom-preaching work, people have the opportunity to learn about the ransom and become subjects of God’s Kingdom. We show that we are loyal subjects of the Kingdom by assisting the anointed to preach the good news worldwide.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:40-40:25:40" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 25:40</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>What did Jesus mean when he next said: “Let your will take place”? When Jehovah says that something will happen, it will happen. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:11</a>) Satan’s rebellion could not stop Jehovah. What was Jehovah’s will for the earth? He wanted the earth to be filled with the perfect children of Adam and Eve. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28</a>) If Adam and Eve had died without having children, God’s purpose to fill the earth with their children would have come to nothing. So Jehovah allowed them to have children. The ransom gives all who exercise faith the opportunity to become perfect and live forever. Jehovah loves people and wants us to have the wonderful life that he intended for us.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>How does the ransom benefit humans who have died?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>What about the billions of people who died without ever having an opportunity to know Jehovah? Jehovah wants people to live. So he will even bring back to life those who have died. The ransom makes it possible for them to come back to life. Then they will be able to learn about Jehovah and to live forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 24:15</a>) Jehovah is the Source of life. When Jehovah gives life back to those who have died, he becomes their Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 36:9</a>) In the model prayer, Jesus said that Jehovah is “our <strong>Father </strong>in the heavens.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>) Jehovah has given Jesus a very important role in resurrecting the dead.

They are described as “a great crowd, which no man was able to number.” They have faith in the ransom and want to obey God. They praise him and say: “Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:9-66:7:10" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9, 10</a>.</p>

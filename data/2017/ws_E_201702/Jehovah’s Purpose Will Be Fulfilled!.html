<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">THE very first words of the Bible make this simple but profound statement: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 1:1</a>) We have seen only a few of the many things God created in the universe, and we understand very little about things such as space, light, and gravity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:3:11-21:3:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>) But Jehovah has revealed to us his purpose for the earth and for humans. He created humans in his image and wanted them to enjoy living on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:26-1:1:26" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:26</a>) They would be his children, and he would be their Father.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-7</a>) However, there is no problem that Jehovah cannot solve. No one can stand in his way.

These are very important Bible truths and are likely the first truths we learned when we began to study God’s Word. Now we want to help others to learn these very important teachings. We have a special opportunity to do so during this time of the year, when we are inviting people to attend the Memorial of Christ’s death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:19-42:22:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 22:19, 20</a>) If they come to this important event, they will learn more about God’s wonderful purpose. So now is a good time to think about specific questions that we can use to encourage people to attend. In this article, we will consider three questions: What is God’s purpose for the earth and for humans? What went wrong? And why is Jesus’ ransom sacrifice the key that unlocks the door for God’s purpose to be accomplished?</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jehovah is an awe-inspiring Creator. Everything he created is of the highest standard. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:31-1:1:31" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 1:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:10:12-24:10:12" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 10:12</a>) What can we learn from the beauty and order we see in creation? We learn that all the things Jehovah created, from the smallest to the largest, are beneficial. In addition, when you think of the amazing human cell, or see a newborn baby, or watch a gorgeous sunset, how do you feel? We admire these things because Jehovah created us with the ability to know what is truly beautiful.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:19:1-19:19:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 19:1;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:104:24-19:104:24" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> <strong>104:24</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What has Jehovah done so that all of his creation would work well together?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah carefully set boundaries for all of his creation. He made laws in nature, and he made moral laws. He made these laws so that everything in the universe would work well together. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:19:7-19:19:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7-9</a>) All things in the universe have an assigned place and function. For example, the law of gravity keeps the atmosphere close to the earth, and it controls the oceans and tides. Without gravity, life on earth would not be possible. The boundaries that Jehovah set in nature result in perfect order in the universe. This shows that he has a purpose for the earth and for humans. In our ministry, we can help others to get to know the Creator of this amazing universe.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 4:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jehovah’s purpose was for humans to live forever on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Psalm 37:29</a>) He is generous, and he gave Adam and Eve a variety of precious gifts. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>James 1:17</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jehovah gave them free will and the ability to reason, to love, and to enjoy friendships. The Creator spoke to Adam and instructed him on how to do what is <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>good. Adam also learned how to take care of himself, the animals, and the land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:15-1:2:17" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 2:15-17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:19-1:2:20" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 19, 20</a>) Jehovah gave Adam and Eve the ability to taste, touch, see, hear, and smell the good things he made for them. In this way, they could enjoy life in their beautiful home. Adam and Eve had plenty of interesting work to do. And they could keep learning and discovering new things forever.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>What else was part of God’s purpose? Jehovah gave Adam and Eve the ability to have perfect children. And their children would also have children, until humans filled the whole earth. Jehovah wanted parents to love their children, just as he loved his first perfect human children, Adam and Eve. He gave the human family the earth and all the precious and beautiful things on it. This would be their home, and it would never be taken away from them.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:115:16-19:115:16" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 115:16</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>Why did God give Adam and Eve the law found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Genesis 2:16, 17</a>?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Things did not immediately work out as Jehovah wanted. What happened? Jehovah gave Adam and Eve a simple law so that they would know the limits of their freedom. He said: “From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction. But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis 2:16, 17</a>) That law was not difficult for them to understand. And it would not be difficult for them to obey, since there was plenty of other delicious food in the garden.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>9, 10. </strong>(a) What did Satan accuse Jehovah of? (b) What did Adam and Eve decide to do? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Satan the Devil used a serpent to fool Eve into disobeying her Father, Jehovah. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 3:1-5;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Revelation 12:9</a>) Satan made an issue of the fact that God’s human children were not allowed to eat “from every tree of the garden.” It was as if he were saying: ‘You mean you cannot do what you want?’ Next, he told her: “You certainly will not die.” That was a lie. Then he tried to convince Eve that she did not need to listen to God. Satan said: “God knows that in the very day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened.” Satan was saying that Jehovah did not want them to eat the fruit because this would give them some special knowledge. Finally, he made this false promise: “You will be like God, knowing good and bad.”</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Adam and Eve had to decide what to do. Would they obey God, or would they listen to the serpent? Sadly, they decided to disobey God. They rejected Jehovah as their Father and joined Satan. Now they were on their own, without Jehovah’s protection.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:6-1:3:13" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Genesis 3:6-13</a>.</p>

Both angels and humans would have wondered whether they could depend on his word. But Jehovah is faithful to his own standards; he never violates them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:119:142-19:119:142" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 119:142</a>) Although Adam and Eve had free will, they could not avoid the consequences of rebelling against Jehovah.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>When Adam and Eve ate of the fruit, Jehovah could no longer accept them as part of his family.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) Adam took away from them the opportunity to live forever.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">PEOPLE often ask Jehovah’s Witnesses, “Who is your leader?” They wonder about this because many religions have a man or woman who is their leader. However, we are proud to say that our Leader is not an imperfect human. Instead, our Leader is Jesus Christ! And he obeys his Father and Leader, Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:23:10-40:23:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 23:10</a>.</p>

First, an angel “appeared to him in the thornbush” and gave him the assignment to free the Israelites and to lead them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:7:35-44:7:35" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 7:35</a>) Second, God used angels to give Moses the Law in order to instruct the Israelites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:3:19-48:3:19" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Galatians 3:19</a>) Third, Jehovah told him: “Lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you. Look! My angel will go ahead of you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:32:34-2:32:34" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Exodus 32:34</a>) The Bible does not say that the Israelites saw an angel do those things. However, from the <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>way Moses instructed and guided the people, it was clear that the angels helped him.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>How did angels help Joshua and Hezekiah?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Whom else did the angels help? The Bible says that “the prince of Jehovah’s army,” an angel, helped Joshua to win a battle against the Canaanites.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The angels are perfect. However, the men whom they helped were not.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup>God’s Word guided his representatives. </strong>The Bible refers to the Law given to Israel as “the Law of Moses.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:2:3-11:2:3" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Kings 2:3</a>) But the Bible makes it clear that Jehovah was the one who gave Israel the Law.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:34:14-14:34:14" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 34:14</a>) For example, after Jehovah told him how to build the tabernacle, “Moses did according to all that Jehovah had commanded him.

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>11, 12. </strong>(a) What were Joshua and the kings who ruled God’s people required to do? (b) How did God’s Word guide the men who took the lead?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Joshua had a portion of God’s Word when he became leader, and Jehovah told him: “You must read it in an undertone day and night, in order to observe carefully all that is written in it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Joshua 1:8</a>) The kings who later ruled God’s people also had to read the Law every day, write a copy of it, and obey “all the words of this Law and these regulations by carrying them out.”<wbr /><strong>—Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:17:18-5:17:20" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 17:18-20</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>How did God’s Word guide the men who took the lead? Think about the example of King Josiah. After the Law of Moses was found, Josiah’s secretary began to read it to him.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (See footnote.) “As soon as the king heard the words of the book of the Law, he ripped his garments apart.” God’s Word then motivated Josiah to destroy all the idols in the land and arrange for the largest Passover celebration ever held.

Those changes helped God’s people to obey Him.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>How were the leaders of God’s people different from the leaders of other nations?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>The leaders of other nations were guided by limited human wisdom. For example, Canaanite leaders and their people did terrible things, which included committing incest, homosexuality, bestiality, child sacrifice, and idolatry.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:19:13-4:19:13" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Numbers 19:13</a>) However, God’s people could see how their faithful leaders encouraged them to keep their worship clean, to be clean physically, and to avoid sexual uncleanness.

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>14. </strong>Why did Jehovah discipline some of the leaders of his people?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Not all the kings who ruled God’s people followed God’s instructions.

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>18, 19. </strong>How did God’s Word guide Jesus’ life and teaching?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup>God’s Word guided Jesus. </strong>From the beginning of his ministry until his death on the torture stake, Jesus allowed the Scriptures to direct him. Even when he was dying, he referred to prophecies about the Messiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Matthew 4:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:27:46-40:27:46" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 27:46;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:23:46-42:23:46" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> Luke 23:46</a>) However, the religious leaders at that time were very different from Jesus. They chose to ignore God’s Word whenever it did not agree with their teachings. Jesus quoted God’s Word when he said about them: “This people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far removed from me. It is in vain that they keep worshipping me, for they teach commands of men as doctrines.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:15:7-40:15:9" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Matthew 15:7-9</a>) Jehovah could never choose men who did not follow his Word to lead his people.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Jesus also used God’s Word when he taught others. When religious leaders challenged him, he did not use his own wisdom or experience in life to answer them. Instead, he taught <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>people from the Scriptures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:22:33-40:22:40" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Matthew 22:33-40</a>) Also, Jesus could have impressed others with many stories about his life in heaven or the creation of the universe. Instead, because he loved God’s Word, he was eager to share it with others, and “he opened up their minds fully to grasp the meaning of the Scriptures.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:24:32-42:24:32" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Luke 24:32,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:24:45-42:24:45" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 45</a>.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"><strong>20. </strong>(a) How did Jesus honor Jehovah? (b) What difference was there between the attitude of Jesus and that of Herod Agrippa I?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Even though Jesus’ listeners were amazed at the way he spoke, he always gave <strong>his </strong>Teacher, Jehovah, the honor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:22-42:4:22" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Luke 4:22</a>) When a rich man tried to honor Jesus with the title “Good Teacher,” Jesus was humble and said: “Why do you call me good?

One day, at a special meeting, Herod put on very impressive and expensive royal clothing. When the people saw him and heard him, they shouted: “A god’s voice, and not a man’s!” Herod loved to be praised. But then what happened? “Instantly the angel of Jehovah struck him, because he did not give the glory to God, and he was eaten up with worms and died.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:12:21-44:12:23" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Acts 12:21-23</a>) Clearly, Jehovah had not chosen Herod to be a leader. However, Jesus proved that God had chosen him, and he constantly honored Jehovah as the Supreme Leader of His people.</p>

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Jehovah wanted Jesus to be Leader for more than just a few years. After his resurrection, Jesus told his disciples: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth.” He added: “And look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:18-40:28:20" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Matthew 28:18-20</a>) But how can Jesus lead God’s people on earth when he is an invisible person in heaven? Whom would Jehovah use to represent Jesus on earth? And how would Christians be able to recognize God’s representatives? The next article will consider the answers to those questions.</p>

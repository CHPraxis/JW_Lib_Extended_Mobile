<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Life is a precious gift. How we use this gift each day reveals how much we appreciate it. As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we strive to use our talents and abilities to honor and glorify Jehovah, the Life-Giver. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps 36:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Re 4:11</a>) Yet, the anxieties related to everyday life in this wicked world could easily push spiritual pursuits to the background. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:18-41:4:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mr 4:18, 19</a>) Each of us does well to ask himself: ‘Am I really giving my best to Jehovah? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:14:2-28:14:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ho 14:2</a>) Where is my job or career leading me? What are my spiritual goals? How can I further expand my ministry?’ If you see room for improvement, pray to Jehovah for help and make the necessary adjustments. Without a doubt, praising Jehovah each day leads to a life of satisfaction and happiness!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:61:8-19:61:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps 61:8</a>.</p>

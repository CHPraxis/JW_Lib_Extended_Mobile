“Your Sons and Your Daughters Will Prophesy”




2:28, 29
Anointed Christians share in the work of prophesying. They speak about “the magnificent things of God” and proclaim the “good news of the Kingdom.” (Ac 2:11, 17-21; Mt 24:14) The other sheep support them by participating in this work





2:32
What does it mean to ‘call on the name of Jehovah’?
  To know the name

  To respect the name

  To rely on and trust in the One who bears that name


Ask yourself, ‘How can I support the anointed in their work of prophesying?’

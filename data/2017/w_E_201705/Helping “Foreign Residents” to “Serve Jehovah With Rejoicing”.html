<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>How did Jesus and many of his disciples become refugees?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>After Jehovah’s angel warned Joseph that King Herod intended to kill Jesus, young Jesus and his parents became refugees in Egypt. They remained there until Herod died. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:13-40:2:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 2:13, 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:19-40:2:21" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 19-21</a>) Decades later, Jesus’ early disciples “were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria” because of persecution. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:1-44:8:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 8:1</a>) Jesus had foreseen that many of his followers would be forced from their homes. He said: “When they persecute you in one city, flee to another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:23-40:10:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 10:23</a>) Fleeing for any reason is seldom easy.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>4, 5. </strong>What dangers exist when refugees (a) are fleeing? (b) are living in a camp?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Refugees may face danger when fleeing or when living in a refugee camp. “We walked for weeks, passing hundreds of dead bodies,” recalls Gad, Lije’s younger brother. “I was 12 years old. My feet were so swollen that I told my family to go on without me. My father​—not about to abandon me to the rebel forces—​carried me. We survived day by day, praying to Jehovah and trusting in him, sometimes eating only mangoes that were growing along the way.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:12-50:4:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Phil. 4:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Most of Lije’s family eventually spent years in United Nations refugee camps. Yet, they were not safe there. Lije, now a circuit overseer, comments: “Most people had no work. They gossiped, drank, gambled, stole, and were immoral.” To resist the bad influences, Witnesses in the camps needed to stay fully involved in congregation activities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:11-58:6:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Heb. 6:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 10:24, 25</a>) To stay spiritually healthy, they used their time productively, many by pioneering. They kept a positive attitude by recalling that, like Israel’s trek in the wilderness, their stay in the camp would eventually come to an end.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:18-47:4:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:18</a>.</p>

In both countries, they remain politically neutral, being “no part of the world,” and continue zealously “declaring the good news of the word.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 15:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:4-44:8:4" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Acts 8:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>While some people are displaced within their own country, many others are thrust into a totally unfamiliar environment in a new land. Governments may provide some food, clothing, and shelter, but familiar foods may be unavailable. Refugees from warm lands may encounter cold weather for the first time and may not know how to dress for it. If they come from a rural area, they may be at a loss about how to use modern household appliances.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Some governments have programs to help refugees adjust to their new circumstances. However, often within months, refugees may be expected to support themselves. The transition can be overwhelming. Imagine trying to learn a new language and to adapt to new laws and expectations regarding manners, punctuality, taxes, bill paying, school attendance, and child discipline​—all at once! Can you patiently and respectfully help brothers and sisters who face such challenges?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:3-50:2:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Phil. 2:3, 4</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Further, authorities have at times made it difficult for our brothers who are refugees to contact the congregation. Some agencies have threatened to cut off assistance or deny our brothers asylum if they refuse to accept employment that requires them to miss meetings. Frightened and vulnerable, a few brothers have given in to such pressures. Therefore, it is urgent to meet our refugee brothers as soon as possible after their arrival.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Giving refugees practical help requires, not a lot of money, but mainly our time and concern. It may be as simple as showing them how to use public transportation, how to shop for healthful but inexpensive foods, or how to obtain tools or equipment​—such as a sewing machine or a lawn mower—​in order to earn some income. More important, you can help them to become fully involved in their new congregation. If possible, offer them rides to meetings. Also explain how they might approach people with the Kingdom message in your territory. Take the refugee <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>brothers and sisters along with you in the ministry.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>When four adolescent refugees arrived in one congregation, various elders taught them to drive, type, and write résumés, as well as to schedule their time to serve Jehovah fully. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Gal. 6:10</a>) Soon, all four became pioneers.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>More than material assistance, refugees need spiritual and emotional support. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matt. 4:4</a>) Elders can help by obtaining literature in the language of the refugees and by helping them contact brothers who speak their language. Many refugees have been torn away from their tight-knit extended families, communities, and congregations. They need to sense Jehovah’s love and compassion among their fellow Christians. Otherwise, they may be drawn to unbelieving relatives or compatriots who can relate to their culture and experiences. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:33</a>) By making them feel fully accepted in the congregation, we have the privilege to share with Jehovah in “protecting the foreign residents.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:9-19:146:9" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 146:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>As with young Jesus and his family, refugees may not have the option <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>of returning to their homeland as long as their oppressors remain in power. Further, as notes Lije, “many parents who saw family members raped and murdered cannot bear to bring their children back to where those tragedies occurred.” To help those who have experienced such trauma, brothers in lands receiving refugees need to have “fellow feeling, brotherly affection, tender compassion, and humility.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:8-60:3:8" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:8</a>) Persecution has caused some refugees to become withdrawn, and they may feel ashamed to talk about their suffering, especially in the presence of their children.

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Many of today’s refugees come from countries where our preaching work is restricted. Thanks to zealous Witnesses in the lands receiving refugees, thousands of refugees are hearing “the word of the Kingdom” for the first time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:19-40:13:19" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 13:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:23-40:13:23" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 23</a>) Many who are “loaded down” are finding spiritual refreshment at our meetings and quickly acknowledge: “God is really among you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:28-40:11:30" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matt. 11:28-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:25-46:14:25" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 14:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"><strong>18, 19. </strong>How can we show wisdom when preaching to refugees?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Those who preach to refugees need to be “cautious” and even “shrewd.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:16-40:10:16" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matt. 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Prov. 22:3</a>) Listen patiently to their concerns, but do not discuss politics. Follow directions from the branch office and from local authorities; never put yourself or others at risk. Learn and respect refugees’ religious and cultural sensitivities. For instance, people from some lands have strong feelings about proper dress for women. Therefore, when preaching to refugees, dress so as not to cause needless offense.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Like the neighborly Samaritan in Jesus’ illustration, we want to help suffering people, including those who are not Witnesses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:33-42:10:37" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Luke 10:33-37</a>) The best way to do so is by sharing the good news with them. “It is important to make clear right away that we are Jehovah’s Witnesses and that our primary mission is to help them spiritually, not materially,” notes an elder who has helped many refugees. “Otherwise, some may associate with us only for personal advantage.”</p>

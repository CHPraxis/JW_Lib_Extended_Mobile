<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">IN <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:22:1-1:22:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis chapter 22</a>, the Bible says that God told Abraham to travel to a place far away from his home to offer a sacrifice. It says: “Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and put it on his son Isaac. Then he <strong>took in his hands the fire </strong>and the knife, and the two of them walked on together.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:22:6-1:22:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 22:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible does not explain how people in ancient times made fires. So did Abraham and Isaac light a fire and then carry that flame with them? One Bible commentator said that a flame probably could not have “kept going throughout the long journey.” Instead, Abraham and his son might have taken everything they would need to start a fire.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">But others say that it was not easy to start a fire in those times. So whenever possible, people would make a fire by getting a hot coal from a fire that was already burning, perhaps a coal from a neighbor’s fire. Many scholars believe that Abraham took hot coals from a burning fire before his journey. He could have put them in a container, perhaps a pot hanging from a chain, and he would have carried the pot with him when he traveled. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:30:14-23:30:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 30:14</a>) Then he could have used the hot coals and small pieces of dry wood whenever he needed to make a fire.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:2:11-20:2:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:11</a>) He gave us power, so that we can do what we have planned and reach our goals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:13-50:2:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Philippians 2:13</a>) He also gave us a conscience, a sense of right and wrong that we have inside of us.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jehovah expects us to use our abilities in a good way. Why? Because he loves us and knows that we will be happy when we use the gifts he has given us. For example, in the Hebrew Scriptures, we read: “The plans of the diligent surely lead to success,” and “whatever your hand finds to <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>do, do with all your might.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:21:5-20:21:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:9:10-21:9:10" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>) In the Greek Scriptures, we read: “As long as we have the opportunity, let us work what is good toward all,” and “to the extent that each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Galatians 6:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:4:10-60:4:10" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 4:10</a>) Clearly, Jehovah wants us to do what we can to benefit ourselves and others.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Jehovah wants us to use our abilities, but he knows that we have limitations.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:8:46-11:8:46" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Kings 8:46</a>) Also, we cannot control other people, because everyone is free to make his own choices.

One faithful sister said that when she talks to others about the blessings of God’s Kingdom, she realizes that people have absolutely no hope and that they see their problems as permanent.

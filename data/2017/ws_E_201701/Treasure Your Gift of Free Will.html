<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Jehovah has absolute freedom, and we can learn from the way he uses his freedom. For example, Jehovah chose the nation of Israel to be his people, “his special property.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:7:6-5:7:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>) He had a reason for making that choice. Jehovah wanted to keep the promise he had made to his friend Abraham. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:22:15-1:22:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 22:15-18</a>) In addition, Jehovah is always loving and fair when he uses his freedom. We can see that in the way he disciplined the Israelites when they disobeyed him. When they were truly sorry for what they had done, Jehovah showed them love and mercy. He said: “I will heal their unfaithfulness. I will love them of my own free will.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/28:14:4-28:14:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hosea 14:4</a>) Jehovah set a good example for us by using his freedom to help others!</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jehovah chose to create angels and humans with free will. Jehovah’s first creation was Jesus. He was created in God’s image and had free will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:15-51:1:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Colossians 1:15</a>) How has Jesus used his freedom? Before coming to earth, Jesus chose to remain loyal to God and not to join Satan and his rebellion. When Jesus came to earth, he made the choice to reject Satan’s temptations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:10-40:4:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 4:10</a>) Then, on the night before his death, Jesus assured his Father that he wanted to do His will. He said: “Father, if you want to, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, let, not my will, but yours take place.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:42-42:22:42" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 22:42</a>) Is it really possible for us to imitate Jesus and use our free will to honor Jehovah and do his will?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Yes, we can imitate Jesus because we too are made in God’s image. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:26-1:1:26" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 1:26</a>) However, we do not have the absolute freedom that Jehovah has. God’s Word explains that Jehovah has put limits on our freedom and that he expects us to accept those limits. For example, within the family, wives should be in subjection to their husbands, and children should obey their parents. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:22-49:5:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:6:1-49:6:1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 6:1</a>) How do such limits affect the way we use our free will? The answer to that question can determine our everlasting future.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>Give an example that shows why it is important for our freedom to have limits.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Can limited freedom ever be <strong>true </strong>freedom? Yes, it can! Why? Because limits can protect us. For example, we may choose to drive to a city far away. But imagine that there are no traffic laws, and everyone can decide how fast and on which side of the road to drive. Would you feel safe traveling on that road? Obviously not. Limits are needed in order for all to enjoy the benefits of true freedom. Let us consider some Bible examples that show how the limits set by Jehovah can benefit us.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>(a) What was one difference between Adam and the animals? (b) Describe one way that Adam used his free will.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>When Jehovah created the first man, Adam, he gave him the same gift he had given the angels, the gift of free will. But God did not give animals free will. How did Adam use his free will in a good way? Adam had the joy of naming the animals. God “began bringing them to the man to see what he would call each one.” After Adam watched each animal, he gave it a meaningful name. Jehovah did not change any of Adam’s choices. Instead, “whatever the man would call each living creature, that became its name.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:19-1:2:19" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 2:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>How did Adam misuse his free will, and what was the result?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jehovah gave Adam the responsibility to make the earth into a paradise by telling him: “Be fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving on the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28</a>) But Adam chose to eat the forbidden fruit, and by doing so he ignored the limits that Jehovah had set. Because Adam misused his free will, humans have suffered for thousands of years. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) Let us remember the serious consequences of Adam’s decision. That will motivate us to use our freedom in a good way and accept the limits Jehovah has given us.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>All humans have inherited imperfection and death from Adam and Eve. However, we still have the right to use the gift of free will. We can see that by the way God treated the nation of Israel. Jehovah gave them the choice to become his special property or not. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:19:3-2:19:6" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Exodus 19:3-6</a>) The nation chose to become God’s people and accepted the limits God set.

We can learn an important lesson from that example.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:7-58:11:7" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:7</a>) <strong>Abraham </strong>and <strong>Sarah </strong>willingly obeyed God and went to the land He had promised to give them. Even though they had the “opportunity to return” to the city of Ur, they focused on God’s promises for the future.

(Read.) </strong>In verse 19, we read that God gave the Israelites a choice. In verse 20, we learn that Jehovah gave them a chance to show how much they loved him.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Let us consider a Bible example that shows why we need to respect our brothers’ free will. Christians in the Corinthian congregation argued about eating meat that may have been offered to idols but that was later sold in a meat market. The conscience of some Christians allowed them to eat the meat because they knew that an idol was nothing. However, others who used to worship such idols felt that eating the meat would be like doing an act of worship.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>First, Paul reminded both groups that food would not strengthen their friendship with God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:8:8-46:8:8" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>) Next, Paul warned them not to allow their “right to choose” to hurt the conscience of those who were weak. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:8:9-46:8:9" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 8:9</a>) Later, he told those with a sensitive conscience not to judge those who chose to eat such meat.

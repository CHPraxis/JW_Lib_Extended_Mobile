<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">“WHO is your leader?” That is a question often put to Jehovah’s Witnesses. And no wonder! In many religions, one man or one woman acts as leader, or chief. In contrast, we are proud to tell those who inquire that our Leader is not an imperfect human. Rather, we follow the lead of the resurrected Christ, who in turn follows the lead of his Father, Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:23:10-40:23:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 23:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Nevertheless, there is a visible group of men, “the faithful and discreet slave,” who take the lead among God’s people today.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Since holy spirit is an invisible force, how could the Israelites discern that it was operating on Moses?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:7:1-2:7:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex. 7:1-3</a>) Holy spirit also produced in Moses beautiful qualities, such as love, meekness, and patience, that qualified him to lead the Israelites.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Later, Jehovah’s holy spirit empowered other men whom he appointed to lead his people. “Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:34:9-5:34:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 34:9</a>) “Jehovah’s spirit came upon Gideon.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/7:6:34-7:6:34" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Judg. 6:34</a>) And “the spirit of Jehovah began to empower David.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:16:13-9:16:13" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Sam. 16:13</a>) All those men relied on God’s spirit to help them, and that spirit empowered them to perform feats that they could not have done in their own strength.

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>Why did God want his people to respect the leaders in Israel?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>How should the Israelites have responded to clear evidence that those men were empowered by holy spirit? When the people complained about Moses’ leadership, Jehovah asked: “How much longer will this people treat <em>me </em>without respect?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:14:2-4:14:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Num. 14:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:14:11-4:14:11" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 11</a>) Indeed, <em>Jehovah </em>chose Moses, Joshua, Gideon, and David to represent him as Leader.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:3:19-48:3:19" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gal. 3:19</a>) And Jehovah told him: “Lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you. Look!

<div class="pGroup">

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>God’s Word guided his representatives. </em>The Bible refers to the Law given to Israel as “the Law of Moses.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:2:3-11:2:3" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Ki. 2:3</a>) Nevertheless, the Scriptures identify Jehovah as the actual Lawgiver, and Moses himself was subject to that Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:34:14-14:34:14" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:14</a>) After Jehovah had given instructions on how to set up the tabernacle, “Moses did according to all that Jehovah had commanded him.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>From the beginning of his leadership, Joshua had a written record of God’s Word. “You must read it in an undertone day and night,” he was told, “in order to observe carefully all that is written in it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Josh. 1:8</a>) Later, the kings who ruled God’s people followed a similar routine. They were obligated to read the Law daily, write a copy of it, and “observe all the words of this Law and these regulations by carrying them out.”<wbr /><strong>—Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:17:18-5:17:20" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 17:18-20</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>What effect did God’s Word have on the men who took the lead? Consider the example of King Josiah. After a document containing the Mosaic Law was found, Josiah’s secretary began to read it to him.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> How did the king react? “As soon as the king heard the words of the book of the Law, he ripped his garments apart.” But he did more. Guided by God’s Word, Josiah began a vigorous campaign against idolatry and arranged an unprecedented celebration of the Passover. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:22:11-12:22:11" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:23:1-12:23:23" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 23:1-23</a>) Because Josiah and other faithful leaders were guided by God’s Word, they were willing to adjust and clarify the direction they gave to God’s people. Those changes brought God’s ancient people into harmony with his will.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>What contrast existed between the leaders of God’s people and those of pagan nations?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>How different those faithful kings were from the leaders of other nations, men who were guided by human wisdom and shortsighted strategy! Under Canaanite leadership, people did detestable things, which included incest, homosexuality, bestiality, child sacrifice, and gross idolatry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:18:6-3:18:6" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Lev. 18:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:18:21-3:18:25" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 21-25</a>) Moreover, Babylonian and Egyptian leaders did not follow the scientifically sound practices on hygiene that God gave to Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:19:13-4:19:13" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Num. 19:13</a>) In contrast, God’s ancient people saw how their faithful leaders promoted spiritual, moral, and physical cleanness.

It is in vain that they keep worshipping me, for they teach commands of men as doctrines.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:15:7-40:15:9" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Matt. 15:7-9</a>) Could Jehovah really choose any of those men to lead his people?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Jesus allowed God’s Word to guide not only his actions but also his teaching. When confronted with religious controversies, he appealed neither to his vast wisdom nor to his unparalleled experience. Instead, he held up the Scriptures as the final authority. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:22:33-40:22:40" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Matt. 22:33-40</a>) And rather than regale his listeners with personal stories about life in heaven or the creation of the universe, “he opened up their minds fully to grasp the meaning of the Scriptures.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:24:32-42:24:32" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Luke 24:32,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:24:45-42:24:45" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 45</a>) Jesus loved God’s Word, and he was eager to share it with others.</p>

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>20 </sup></strong>Although Jesus amazed his listeners with “gracious words,” he gave credit to <em>his </em>Teacher, Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:22-42:4:22" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Luke 4:22</a>) When a rich man tried to glorify Jesus with the title “Good Teacher,” Jesus modestly replied: “Why do you call me good?

At a diplomatic function, Herod clothed himself “with royal raiment.” His adoring crowd shouted: “A god’s voice, and not a man’s!” Herod evidently basked in the praise. What happened next? “Instantly the angel of Jehovah struck him, because he did not give the glory to God, and he was eaten up with worms and died.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:12:21-44:12:23" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Acts 12:21-23</a>) Surely, no objective observer could conclude that Herod was chosen by Jehovah to be leader.

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><strong><sup>21 </sup></strong>Jesus’ leadership was not meant to last only a few years. “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth,” he declared after his resurrection. “And look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:18-40:28:20" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18-20</a>) But as an invisible spirit in heaven, how would Jesus lead God’s people on earth? Whom would Jehovah use to work under Christ’s leadership and take the lead among His people? And how would Christians be able to recognize his representatives? The next article will consider the answers to those questions.</p>

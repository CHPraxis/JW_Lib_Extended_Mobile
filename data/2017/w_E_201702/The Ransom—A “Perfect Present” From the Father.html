<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb">MANY are the blessings made possible by the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The ransom arrangement opens the door for all those of Adam’s children who love righteousness eventually to become part of God’s family. The ransom also makes it possible for us to have the opportunity to live forever in happiness. Still, Christ’s ransom does more than provide a blessed future for obedient mankind. Jesus’ willingness to die while upholding Jehovah’s righteousness addresses matters of universal importance.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:1:8-58:1:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 1:8, 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>(a) What matters of universal importance are found in Jesus’ prayer? (See opening image.) (b) What will we consider in this article?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Some two years before Jesus died and provided the ransom sacrifice, he taught his disciples to pray: “Our Father in the heavens, let your <em>name </em>be sanctified. Let your <em>Kingdom </em>come. Let your <em>will </em>take place, as in heaven, also on earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9, 10</a>) To heighten our appreciation for the ransom, <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>let us consider how it relates to the sanctification of God’s name, the rule of God’s Kingdom, and the accomplishment of God’s purpose.</p>

<div id="section2" class="section">
<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>“LET YOUR NAME BE SANCTIFIED”</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What does Jehovah’s name embrace, and how did Satan slander that sacred name?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Jesus mentioned the sanctification of God’s name as the first request in his model prayer. Jehovah’s name embraces the full scope of His excellence, majesty, and holiness. In another prayer, Jesus addressed Jehovah as “Holy Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:11-43:17:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 17:11</a>) Since Jehovah is holy, all principles and laws that originate with him are holy. In spite of this, in the garden of Eden, Satan slyly questioned God’s right to set standards for humans. By lying about Jehovah, Satan slandered God’s sacred name.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>How did Jesus contribute to the sanctification of God’s name?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jesus, on the other hand, truly loved the name of Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:25-43:17:26" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 17:25, 26</a>) Jesus contributed to the sanctification of the divine name. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:40:8-19:40:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 40:8-10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>By his perfect life course on earth, Jesus proved that it is reasonable and righteous for Jehovah to set standards for his intelligent creatures. Even when Satan subjected Jesus to an agonizing death, Jesus remained completely loyal to his heavenly Father. By being loyal, Jesus proved that a perfect human could maintain perfect obedience to God’s righteous standards.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How can we share in sanctifying God’s name?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>How can we show that we love Jehovah’s name? By our conduct. Jehovah requires that we be holy. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:15-60:1:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 1:15, 16</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>This means that we worship only Jehovah and that we obey him with our whole heart. Even when we are persecuted, we do our best to live according to his righteous principles and laws. By performing righteous deeds, we let our light shine and thus bring glory to Jehovah’s name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:14-40:5:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 5:14-16</a>) As holy people, we prove by the way we live our lives that Jehovah’s laws are good and that Satan’s accusations are false. When we make mistakes, as we all do, we genuinely repent and turn away from practices that dishonor Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:79:9-19:79:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 79:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>Why can Jehovah view us as righteous, even though we are imperfect?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>On the basis of Christ’s sacrifice, Jehovah forgives the sins of those who exercise faith. He accepts as his worshippers those who dedicate themselves to him. Jehovah declares anointed Christians righteous as his sons and those of the “other sheep” righteous as his friends. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:1-45:5:2" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Rom. 5:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:2:21-59:2:25" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Jas. 2:21-25</a>) So even now, the ransom enables us to have a righteous standing with our Father and to share in the sanctification of his name.</p>

The earth will be transformed into a paradise, and all faithful humans will be lifted to perfection, fully uniting the heavenly and earthly parts of God’s family.

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>(a) How did Jesus help his disciples to see the importance of God’s Kingdom? (b) How do we show our support for the Kingdom today?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>While on earth, Jesus helped his disciples to see the importance of God’s Kingdom. Immediately after his baptism, Jesus proclaimed “the good news of the Kingdom of God” far and wide. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 4:43</a>) In his last words to his disciples before he returned to heaven, Jesus instructed them to be witnesses of him “to the most distant part of the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:1:6-44:1:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Acts 1:6-8</a>) By means of the Kingdom-preaching work, people throughout the earth would have an opportunity to learn about the ransom and become subjects of God’s Kingdom. Today, we show our support for the Kingdom by assisting Christ’s brothers on earth in carrying out the commission to preach the good news of the Kingdom worldwide.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:40-40:25:40" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 25:40</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>Why can we be confident that Jehovah will fulfill his purpose for mankind?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>What did Jesus mean when he next said: “Let your will take place”? Jehovah is the Creator. Once he gives the word for something to happen, it is as good as done. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 55:11</a>) He will not allow Satan’s rebellion to derail His purpose for mankind. From the beginning, it was Jehovah’s will for the earth to be filled with the perfect children of Adam and Eve. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Gen. 1:28</a>) Had Adam and Eve died childless, God’s purpose to fill the earth with their offspring would have come to nothing. Thus, after Adam and Eve sinned, Jehovah allowed them to have children. Through the ransom, God gives all who exercise faith the opportunity to reach perfection and live forever. Jehovah loves people, and it is his will that obedient humans live the way he intended.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>How does the ransom benefit humans who have died?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>What about the billions of people who died without ever having an opportunity to know and serve Jehovah? The ransom makes possible the resurrection of the dead. Our loving heavenly Father will bring them back to life and give them an opportunity to learn about his purpose and to gain everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 24:15</a>) Jehovah wants people to live, not die.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 36:9</a>) How appropriate, therefore, that Jesus taught us to pray: “Our <em>Father </em>in the heavens.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9</a>) Jehovah has given Jesus an important share in resurrecting the dead.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jehovah’s generosity is not limited to a few privileged people, for Jesus said: <em>“Whoever </em>does the will of God, this one is my brother and sister and mother.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:3:35-41:3:35" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Mark 3:35</a>) It is God’s will that a <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>numberless “great crowd” from all nations and tribes and tongues become his worshippers. Those who exercise faith in Christ’s ransom and who do the will of God can be among those who shout: “Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:9-66:7:10" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9, 10</a>.</p>

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Rejoice in Your Hope




Hope is like an anchor. (Heb 6:19) It helps us to avoid spiritual shipwreck when we face stormy seas. (1Ti 1:18, 19) Stormy seas may include personal disappointments, material loss, prolonged illness, the death of a loved one, or any other threat to our integrity.
Faith and hope enable us to see clearly the promised reward. (2Co 4:16-18; Heb 11:13, 26, 27) So whether our hope is heavenly or earthly, we must regularly nourish it by meditating on the promises recorded in God’s Word. Then, when we are distressed by trials, it will be easier to maintain our joy.​—1Pe 1:6, 7.

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Help Your Children to Develop Unshakable Faith in the Creator




Creation declares Jehovah’s glory. (Ps 19:1-4; 139:14) However, the Devil’s world promotes God-dishonoring theories about the origin of life. (Ro 1:18-25) How can you prevent such ideas from taking root in the mind and heart of your children? Help them from an early age to develop faith that Jehovah exists and cares about them personally. (2Co 10:4, 5; Eph 6:16) Draw out their deepest thoughts about what they are taught at school, and use the many tools available to reach their heart.​—Pr 20:5; Jas 1:19.

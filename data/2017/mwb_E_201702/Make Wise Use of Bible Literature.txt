LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Make Wise Use of Bible Literature




Jesus taught: “You received free, give free.” (Mt 10:8) We adhere to that clear direction by not charging people for a copy of the Bible or our Bible-based literature. (2Co 2:17) Nevertheless, these publications contain precious truths from God’s Word. Great effort and expense are involved in printing literature and shipping it to congregations around the world. Therefore, we should take only what we need.
Use discernment when giving literature to others, even at public witnessing locations. (Mt 7:6) Instead of simply handing out literature to passersby, make an effort to converse with them to determine their interest. Can you answer yes to at least one of the questions in the accompanying box? If you are unable to determine someone’s interest, it is best to give him a tract. Of course, if he asks for a magazine or another publication, we will gladly give him a copy.​—Pr 3:27, 28.

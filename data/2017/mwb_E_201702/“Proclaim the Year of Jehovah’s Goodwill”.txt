TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | ISAIAH 58-62
“Proclaim the Year of Jehovah’s Goodwill”



“The year of Jehovah’s goodwill” is not a literal year

61:1, 2
  It is a time period during which Jehovah gives meek ones the opportunity to respond to his proclamation of freedom

  In the first century, the year of goodwill started when Jesus began his ministry in 29 C.E. and lasted until “the day of vengeance” of Jehovah when Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 C.E.

  In our day, the year of goodwill began with Jesus’ enthronement in heaven in 1914 and will conclude with the great tribulation










Jehovah blesses his people with “big trees of righteousness”

61:3, 4
  The tallest trees in the world usually grow together in forests, where individual trees support one another

  Large root systems may be intertwined, anchoring the trees and providing resistance to storms

  Tall trees provide protective shade for saplings, and leaves that fall from the trees enrich the soil beneath


All members of the worldwide Christian congregation benefit from the support and protection of the “big trees of righteousness,” the anointed remnant

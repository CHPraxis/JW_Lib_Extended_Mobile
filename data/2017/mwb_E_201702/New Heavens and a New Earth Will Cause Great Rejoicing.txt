TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | ISAIAH 63-66
New Heavens and a New Earth Will Cause Great Rejoicing




God’s promise of restoration recorded in Isaiah chapter 65 is so certain that Jehovah speaks of it as if it were already being fulfilled.



Jehovah creates new heavens and a new earth, where the former things are not called to mind

65:17
What are the new heavens?
  A new government that will bring about righteous conditions on earth

  It was established in 1914 when Christ was enthroned as King of God’s Kingdom


What is the new earth?
  A society of people from all nationalities, languages, and races who gladly submit to the rulership of the new heavenly government


How will the former things not be called to mind?
  The causes of hurtful memories​—physical, mental, and emotional suffering—​will no longer exist

  Faithful humans will enjoy life to the full and will treasure the pleasant memories of each passing day

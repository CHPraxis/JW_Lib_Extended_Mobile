TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | ISAIAH 52-57
Christ Suffered for Us



“He was despised and was avoided by men . . . We considered him as plagued, stricken by God and afflicted”

53:3-5
  Jesus was despised and charged with blasphemy. Some believed that God was punishing him, as if plaguing him with a loathsome disease










“It was Jehovah’s will to crush him, . . . and through him the delight of Jehovah will have success”

53:10
  Jehovah no doubt suffered when he saw his Son put to death. But he delighted to see Jesus’ absolute faithfulness. Jesus’ death provided an answer to Satan’s challenge regarding the loyalty of God’s servants and brought benefits to repentant humans. It thus helped to accomplish “Jehovah’s will”

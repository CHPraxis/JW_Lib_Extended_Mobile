<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Imagine how the Israelites must have felt when they were in exile in Babylon. Those who brought them there made fun of them and said: “Sing for us one of the songs of Zion.” But the Jews did not feel like singing. Jerusalem, their greatest reason for joy, had been destroyed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:137:1-19:137:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 137:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:137:6-19:137:6" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 6</a>) Their hearts were broken, and they needed comfort. But just as God’s word foretold, Jehovah helped his people. How? King Cyrus of Persia conquered Babylon and said about Jehovah: “He has commissioned me to build him a house in Jerusalem.” Cyrus also told the Israelites: “Whoever there is among you of all his people, may Jehovah his God be with him, and let him go up.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:36:23-14:36:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:23</a>) How this must have comforted the Israelites in Babylon!</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What did the psalmist say about Jehovah’s power to heal us?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah gave comfort not only to the nation of Israel but also to each Israelite. Jehovah does the same for us today. The psalmist wrote that God “heals the brokenhearted; he binds up their wounds.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:147:3-19:147:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 147:3</a>) When we are sick or depressed, we can be sure that Jehovah cares for us.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Next the psalmist looked at the sky and said that Jehovah “counts the number of the stars” and “calls all of them by name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:147:4-19:147:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 147:4</a>) The psalmist could see the stars, but he had no idea of how many there really are. Today, scientists know that there are billions of stars in our galaxy. And there may be trillions of galaxies in the universe! Humans cannot count all the stars, but the Creator can. In fact, he knows each star so well that he has given each one a name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:41-46:15:41" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:41</a>) The God who knows where each star is also knows <strong>you. </strong>He always knows exactly where you are, how you feel, and what you need!</p>

God understands our limitations, “remembering that we are dust.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:14-19:103:14" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 103:14</a>) We are imperfect, so we make the same mistakes again and again, and we may feel discouraged. How we regret certain things we have said, wrong desires we have felt, or jealous feelings we have had! Jehovah does not have any weaknesses, but he fully understands how we feel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:28-23:40:28" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:28</a>.</p>

After she moved to a new assignment, she was very discouraged. But how did Kyoko know that Jehovah understood her problems? In her new congregation, there were many people who could understand her feelings. She felt that Jehovah was saying: “I love you, not just because you are a pioneer, but because you are my daughter and dedicated to me. I want you to enjoy your life as one of my Witnesses!” How has Jehovah shown you that “his understanding is beyond measure”?</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>We all need things such as food, clothing, and shelter. Perhaps you may worry that you will not have enough food to eat. But Jehovah made the earth to produce enough food for all, even for “the young ravens that call out for it.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:147:8-19:147:9" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 147:8, 9</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>If Jehovah feeds the ravens, we can be sure that he will provide for our material needs.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:25-19:37:25" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 37:25</a>.</p>

When a tsunami hit Japan in 2011, they barely escaped death by climbing onto the roof of their house. On that day, they lost almost everything they owned. They spent the night in a dark, cold room on the second floor of their home. In the morning, they looked for something that would encourage them. The only thing they could find was the <em>2006 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </em>As Mutsuo turned the pages, he saw the title “The Deadliest Tsunamis Ever Recorded.” That section was about an earthquake in Sumatra in 2004 that caused the most destructive tsunamis ever recorded. Mutsuo and his wife wept as they read the experiences of their brothers and sisters. They felt that Jehovah was giving them exactly the encouragement they needed. Jehovah also took care of them in other ways. Their brothers in other parts of Japan provided food and clothing for them. But what strengthened them most were the visits to the congregation by brothers who were sent by God’s organization. Mutsuo says: “I felt that Jehovah was right next to each one of us and caring for us. What comfort!” God first <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>provides what we need to keep our faith strong, and then he takes care of our material needs.</p>

<div class="pGroup">

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Jehovah “raises up the meek.” He loves us and is always ready to help us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:147:6-19:147:6" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 147:6a</a>) How can we benefit from his help? We need to have a strong relationship with him. To have that, we need to be meek. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:2:3-36:2:3" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Zephaniah 2:3</a>) Meek ones rely on Jehovah to correct any injustice and end their suffering.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>We cannot fight this battle on our own. We must rely on Jehovah. Will he be pleased if we rely on things humans turn to for help? No, Jehovah “does not delight in the power of the horse.” Should we rely on our own strength or on other people? Jehovah is not “impressed by the strong legs of a man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:147:10-19:147:10" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 147:10</a>) Instead, we need to continue to pray to Jehovah for help and beg him to save us from our weaknesses. Jehovah will never get tired of hearing these prayers. “Jehovah finds pleasure in those who fear him, in those waiting for his loyal love.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:147:11-19:147:11" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 147:11</a>) Because he is loyal and he loves us, we know that he will keep helping us conquer our wrong desires.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Jehovah reassures us that he will help us when we have problems. When the Israelites returned to Jerusalem, the psalmist thought about how Jehovah was helping them. The psalmist sang: “He makes the bars of your city gates strong; he blesses your sons within you. He brings peace to your territory.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:147:13-19:147:14" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 147:13, 14</a>) The fact that Jehovah would strengthen the city gates made the psalmist feel safe.

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Do You Forgive Yourself?




It can be difficult to forgive ourselves for past mistakes that Jehovah has already forgiven. This matter was considered at the 2016 “Remain Loyal to Jehovah!” Regional Convention by means of a talk and a video. Use the JW Library app to watch the video again, and then answer the following questions:





How long was Sonja disfellowshipped?

What scripture did the elders share with Sonja, and how did it help her?

How did the congregation treat Sonja when she was reinstated?

What feelings did Sonja struggle with, and how did her father help her?

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">ALL of us are imperfect and make mistakes. Thankfully, Jehovah has provided the ransom and is ready to forgive us. So if we are humble and repentant, we can ask him for forgiveness. We can be sure that Jehovah will not deal with us “according to our sins.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:103:10-19:103:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 103:10</a>) Still, we must “serve him with a complete heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:28:9-13:28:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>) How can we do so even though we are imperfect?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>To help us, we can compare the life of King Asa with that of King Amaziah. Both kings did good things, but they also made mistakes because they were imperfect. Yet the Bible says that “Asa’s heart was complete all his life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:15:16-14:15:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 15:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:25:1-14:25:2" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 25:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:17:3-20:17:3" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Proverbs 17:3</a>) He always tried to please Jehovah <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>and was “completely devoted” to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:28:9-13:28:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>, footnote) Amaziah, though, did not serve Jehovah with “a complete heart.” After he defeated God’s enemies, he brought their idols back and began worshipping them.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:25:11-14:25:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 25:11-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>A person who serves God with “a complete heart” deeply loves Jehovah and wants to worship him forever. In the Bible, the word “heart” usually refers to who we are on the inside. It includes the way we think, what we love, what we would like to do with our life, and why we do the things we do. Even though we are imperfect, we can worship Jehovah with a complete heart. We serve him because we truly want to, not because we have to or because it is just a habit.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:19:9-14:19:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 19:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>We can understand more clearly what it means to serve God with a complete heart by considering the life of Asa as well as the lives of three other faithful kings of Judah. These were Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah. Although these four kings made mistakes, they still pleased Jehovah. He saw that they served him with a complete heart. Why did God view them that way, and how can we imitate them?</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What did Asa do when he became king?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Asa was the third king of Judah after the nation of Israel was divided into the kingdom of Israel and the kingdom of Judah. When Asa became king of Judah, he was determined to remove false worship and disgusting sexual immorality from his kingdom. He destroyed the idols that the people were worshipping and expelled the temple prostitutes. Asa even removed his grandmother from the position of “queen mother, because she had made an obscene idol.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:15:11-11:15:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Kings 15:11-13</a>) Asa also encouraged the people “to search for Jehovah” and to obey “the Law and the commandment.” Asa did all he could to help others worship Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:14:4-14:14:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 14:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>How did Asa react when the Ethiopians invaded Judah?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>During the first ten years of Asa’s reign, the kingdom of Judah had no wars. Then the Ethiopians came to fight against Judah with one million soldiers and three hundred chariots. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:14:1-14:14:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 14:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:14:6-14:14:6" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:14:9-14:14:10" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 9, 10</a>) What did Asa do? He had no doubt that Jehovah could help his people. So he prayed to Jehovah to help them win the battle. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:14:11-14:14:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>2 Chronicles 14:11</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>At times, Jehovah chose to give his people victory over their enemies <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>even when the kings were not faithful to him. He did this to show that he was the true God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:20:13-11:20:13" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Kings 20:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:20:26-11:20:30" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 26-30</a>) But this time, Jehovah helped his people because Asa relied on him.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:14:12-14:14:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 14:12, 13</a>) Asa later made a serious mistake when he asked the king of Syria for help rather than Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:15:16-11:15:22" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Kings 15:16-22</a>) Even so, Jehovah could see that Asa loved him. His heart “was complete with Jehovah all his life.” How can we imitate Asa’s good example?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:15:14-11:15:14" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Kings 15:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>7, 8. </strong>How can you imitate Asa?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>How do we know if we are completely devoted to Jehovah? We can ask ourselves: ‘Will I obey Jehovah even when it is difficult? Am I absolutely determined to keep his congregation pure?’ Think how much courage Asa needed in order to remove his grandmother from her royal position! At times, you may need to be courageous like Asa. For example, what if a member of your family or a close friend sinned, did not repent, and had to be disfellowshipped from the congregation? Would you be determined not to associate with that person? What would your heart move you to do?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Like Asa, at times we may feel that everyone is against us. Perhaps your schoolmates or teachers make fun of you because you are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Or maybe people at work think you are foolish because you take time off to go to an assembly or because you do not often work overtime. In such situations, rely on God, just as Asa did. Pray to Jehovah, be courageous, and keep doing what is right. Remember that God strengthened Asa, and he will strengthen you too.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>How can we please Jehovah when we preach?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Asa did not just think about himself; he encouraged others “to search for Jehovah.” We too help people to worship Jehovah. He notices when we speak to others about him. How pleased he must be when he sees that we are doing so because we love him and because we care about people and their future!</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Today, Jehovah wants people worldwide to be taught about him, and all of us can help with this work. Is it your goal to have a share in this work every month? Would you like to teach the Bible to others so that they too can begin to worship Jehovah? Is that something you pray about? If you make the effort, Jehovah can help you start a Bible study. Would you be willing to study with someone even though you may have to give up some of your free time? And just as Jehoshaphat tried to help others to begin serving Jehovah again, we can try to help those who have become inactive. Also, the congregation elders arrange to visit and offer help to disfellowshipped ones in the congregation territory who may have left their past practice of sin.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>12, 13. </strong>(a) When Jehoshaphat felt afraid, what did he do? (b) Why should we follow Jehoshaphat’s example?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Like his father, Asa, Jehoshaphat relied on Jehovah when a large army came to fight against Judah. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:20:2-14:20:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>2 Chronicles 20:2-4</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>He was afraid and asked Jehovah for help. In prayer, he admitted that they could not defeat the enemy. He also said that he and his people did not know what to do. Jehoshaphat had no doubt that Jehovah would help them. He said: “Our eyes are toward you.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:20:12-14:20:12" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 20:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Like Jehoshaphat, sometimes we may not know what to do about a problem, and we may even be afraid. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:8-47:4:9" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:8, 9</a>) But remember what Jehoshaphat did. In front of all the people, he prayed to Jehovah and told him how weak they felt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:20:5-14:20:5" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 20:5</a>) Family heads can imitate Jehoshaphat’s example. Ask Jehovah to help you and your family to cope with the problem and to know what to do. Do not feel ashamed to let your family hear these prayers. They will realize how much you trust in Jehovah. He helped Jehoshaphat, and he will help you too.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>14, 15. </strong>How did Hezekiah rely on God completely?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Hezekiah was another king who “held fast to Jehovah.” He did so even though his father set a bad example and worshipped idols. Hezekiah “removed the high places, smashed the sacred pillars, and cut down the sacred pole. He also crushed the copper serpent that Moses had made,” doing so because the Israelites were worshipping it. Hezekiah was completely devoted to Jehovah. “He <strong>continued </strong>to keep the commandments that Jehovah had given to Moses.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:18:1-12:18:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Kings 18:1-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>While Hezekiah was king, the powerful Assyrian army invaded Judah and threatened to destroy Jerusalem. The king of Assyria, Sennacherib, made fun of Jehovah and tried to get Hezekiah to surrender. During that dangerous time, Hezekiah fully trusted in Jehovah and prayed for his help. He knew that God was much more powerful than the Assyrians and could save his people. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:37:15-23:37:20" data-bid="25-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 37:15-20</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>God answered his prayer by sending an angel to kill 185,000 Assyrian soldiers.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:37:36-23:37:37" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Isaiah 37:36, 37</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>16, 17. </strong>How can you imitate Hezekiah?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Later, Hezekiah became sick and was dying. During that difficult time, he begged Jehovah to remember his faithfulness and to help him. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:20:1-12:20:3" data-bid="27-1" class="b"><strong>2 Kings 20:1-3</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jehovah heard Hezekiah’s prayer and healed him. We know from the Bible that today we cannot expect a miracle from God to heal our sicknesses or to make us live longer. But like Hezekiah, we can rely on Jehovah for help. We can tell him: “I beg you, O Jehovah, remember, please, how I have walked before you faithfully and with a complete heart.” Do you believe that Jehovah will always take care of you, even when you are sick?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:41:3-19:41:3" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 41:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>How else can we imitate Hezekiah? Perhaps something is getting in the way of our relationship with Jehovah or taking time away from serving him. For example, many today treat humans as if they were idols. They admire celebrities and other people they do not know. Many spend a lot of time reading about such people and looking at their photos. Or they often use social media or other tools to communicate with people on the Internet. Of course, we may enjoy communicating with family or close friends by means of such tools. But we could waste a lot of time on social media. We might even become proud if many people indicate that they like the photos or comments that we have put on the Internet. Or, if we realize that some have stopped looking at them, we may become offended. We could learn from the examples of the apostle Paul, Aquila, and Priscilla. Do you think they spent time each day finding out every little thing people did, especially people who were not serving Jehovah? The Bible says that Paul was “intensely occupied with the word.” And Priscilla and Aquila spent their time preaching and explaining “the way of God more accurately” to others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:18:4-44:18:5" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Acts 18:4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:18:26-44:18:26" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 26</a>) We can ask ourselves: ‘Am I careful not to treat humans as idols?

Then one day, the high priest found the book of God’s Law in the temple. This was probably the book that Moses himself had written! When the secretary read it to Josiah, he realized that he needed to do more to serve Jehovah completely. He also encouraged others to do the same.

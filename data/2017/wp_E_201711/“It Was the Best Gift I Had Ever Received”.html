<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">That is how one 13-year-old girl felt when she received a pet dog as a gift. A successful businesswoman said that a computer her father gave her when she was in high school was a gift that changed her life. And a newlywed husband felt that his wife’s handmade first-anniversary card was the best gift he had ever received.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Each year, many people spend time and effort searching for that “best” gift for a friend or a relative on a special occasion. And most would love to hear a response like those mentioned at the outset. What about you? Would you like to be able to give or receive gifts that are truly appreciated?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">That prospect can be very appealing, not only because of the effect a gift can have on the receiver but also because of the way it can make the giver feel. After all, the Bible says: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>) Of course, the happiness gained from giving may be enhanced if the gift is highly valued by the receiver.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">How, then, can you make your gift-giving a source of true happiness for you and for the receiver? And if giving the “best” gift is not possible, what can you do so that your gift will be truly appreciated?</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Bible does not teach that each individual has a guardian angel. True, Jesus once said: “See that you do not despise one of these little ones [Christ’s disciples], for I tell you that their angels in heaven always look upon the face of my Father who is in heaven.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:10-40:18:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 18:10</a>) However, rather than implying that each person has a guardian angel, Jesus was simply saying that angels take an active interest in each of his disciples. Hence, true worshippers do not take unwise and careless risks, presuming that God’s angels will protect them.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Does that mean that angels do not help humans? No. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:91:11-19:91:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 91:11</a>) Some feel quite strongly that God has provided them with angelic protection and guidance. Kenneth, mentioned in the opening article, is one who feels that way. Though we cannot be dogmatic, he may be correct. Jehovah’s Witnesses frequently see evidence of angelic intervention as they engage in their preaching work. However, because angels are invisible, we cannot say to what extent God uses them in helping individuals with various matters. Nevertheless, we cannot go wrong by thanking the Almighty for whatever support he may have provided.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:15-51:3:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Colossians 3:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:17-59:1:18" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> James 1:17, 18</a>.</p>

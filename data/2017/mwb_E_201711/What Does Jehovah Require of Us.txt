What Does Jehovah Require of Us?




6:6-8
Jehovah understands our limitations and never requires more of us than we are able to give. From God’s standpoint, our relationship with our brothers is an important part of true worship. If we want Jehovah to accept our sacrifices, we must treat our brothers with love and respect.

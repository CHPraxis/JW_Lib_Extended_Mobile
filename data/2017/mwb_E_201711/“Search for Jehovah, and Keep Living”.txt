“Search for Jehovah, and Keep Living”




5:6, 14, 15
What does it mean to search for Jehovah?
  It means that we continue to learn about Jehovah and to live according to his standards


What happened to the Israelites when they failed to search for Jehovah?
  They stopped ‘hating what was bad and loving what was good’

  They focused on pleasing themselves

  They ignored direction from Jehovah







What has Jehovah provided to help us search for him?

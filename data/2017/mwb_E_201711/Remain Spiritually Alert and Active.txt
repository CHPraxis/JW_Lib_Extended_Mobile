TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | NAHUM 1–HABAKKUK 3
Remain Spiritually Alert and Active




Hab 1:5, 6
The impending destruction of Judah by the Babylonians may have seemed unlikely. Judah was under the powerful influence of Egypt. The Chaldeans were not stronger than Egypt, were they? In addition, it was unthinkable to many Jews that Jehovah would allow Jerusalem and its temple to be destroyed. Nonetheless, the prophecy would come true, and Habakkuk needed to keep in expectation of it by remaining spiritually alert and active.





What convinces me that the end of this system of things is very near?
How can I remain spiritually alert and active?

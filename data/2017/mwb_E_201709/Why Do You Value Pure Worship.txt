LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Why Do You Value Pure Worship?




Jewish exiles were encouraged by Ezekiel’s temple vision because it gave them hope that pure worship would be restored. During these last days, pure worship has “become firmly established above the top of the mountains,” and we are among those from all nations who have streamed to it. (Isa 2:2) Do you regularly reflect on your privilege of knowing and serving Jehovah?

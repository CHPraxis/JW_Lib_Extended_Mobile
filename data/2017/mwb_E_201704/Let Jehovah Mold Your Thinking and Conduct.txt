TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | JEREMIAH 17-21
Let Jehovah Mold Your Thinking and Conduct








Respond favorably to Jehovah’s molding

18:1-11
  Jehovah shapes our spiritual qualities through counsel or discipline

  We need to be malleable and obedient

  Jehovah never forces us to do things against our will





A potter may change his mind about what to do with a vessel

  Because Jehovah has given us free will, we can choose either to accept his molding or to reject it

  Jehovah adjusts his dealings with people according to the way they respond to his direction










In what ways do I need Jehovah to mold me?




DID YOU KNOW?





Clay was a common material in Bible times. When moist, clay is soft and pliable, and it will maintain the impressions made on it. But clay, even when baked hard, is not a strong material.

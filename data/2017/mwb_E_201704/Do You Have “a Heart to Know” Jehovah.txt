TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | JEREMIAH 22-24
Do You Have “a Heart to Know” Jehovah?








Jehovah compared people to figs

24:5
  Faithful ones among the Jewish exiles in Babylon were like good figs


24:8
  Unfaithful King Zedekiah and others who did what was bad were like bad figs





How can we develop “a heart to know” Jehovah?

24:7
  Jehovah will give us “a heart to know” him if we study and apply his Word

  We must honestly inspect our heart and root out attitudes and desires that jeopardize our relationship with Jehovah





Consider: Do I have “a heart to know” Jehovah? How can I develop one?

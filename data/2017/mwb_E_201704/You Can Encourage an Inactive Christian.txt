LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
You Can Encourage an Inactive Christian









On Tuesday, April 11, many inactive Christians will attend the Memorial. They started running the race for life but have slowed down for various reasons, some of which are addressed in the brochure Return to Jehovah. (Heb 12:1) Yet, inactive ones remain precious to Jehovah, who purchased them with the blood of his Son. (Ac 20:28; 1Pe 1:18, 19) How can we help them return to the congregation?
Congregation elders seek to find and help inactive Christians just as a shepherd diligently searches for sheep that have strayed from the flock. (Lu 15:4-7) This reflects Jehovah’s loving care. (Jer 23:3, 4) All of us, not just the elders, can encourage such ones. Our efforts to show kindness and fellow feeling are pleasing to Jehovah and can be very rewarding. (Pr 19:17; Ac 20:35) Therefore, think about whom you can encourage, and do so without delay!

  Why should we approach the elders if we are thinking of helping someone who is inactive?

  How did Abbey prepare to visit Laura the second time?

  How did Abbey demonstrate persistence, patience, and love while trying to encourage Laura?

  What can we learn from Jesus’ illustration found at Luke 15:8-10?

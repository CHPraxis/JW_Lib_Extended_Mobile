Kingdom Songs Inspire Courage









Paul and Silas praised God with song while in prison. (Ac 16:25) In modern times, fellow believers sang Kingdom songs while in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Nazi Germany and while in exile in Siberia. These examples illustrate the power of songs to inspire courage in Christians who are facing trials.
Many additional languages will soon have the new songbook entitled “Sing Out Joyfully” to Jehovah. Once we obtain a copy, we can etch the lyrics in our mind by practicing the songs during family worship. (Eph 5:19) Then holy spirit will help us to recall them when trials arise. Kingdom songs can help us to focus on our hope. They can inspire us when we are facing trials. And when we are in good spirits, the uplifting lyrics enable us to “sing out joyfully” because of the good condition of our heart. (1Ch 15:16; Ps 33:1-3) Let us by all means make good use of our Kingdom songs!

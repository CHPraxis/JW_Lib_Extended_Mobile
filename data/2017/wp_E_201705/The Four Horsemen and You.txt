COVER SUBJECT | THE FOUR HORSEMEN​—HOW THEIR RIDE AFFECTS YOU
The Four Horsemen and You




They burst forth, hooves thundering! The four mighty horses and their riders make a picture so vivid that it almost seems to leap from the pages of the Bible! The first horse is white​—its rider a glorious, newly crowned king. Behind him comes a horse the color of fire, bearing a rider who takes peace away from all the earth. There follows a third horse, black as midnight, carrying a rider who holds aloft a pair of scales as a doleful message is proclaimed about a lack of basic foodstuffs. The fourth horse is a sickly pale color, a harbinger of disease and other lethal threats, ridden by Death itself. And the Grave, the common grave of mankind, follows closely, reaping a terrible harvest of lives!​—Revelation 6:1-8.
“I was scared the first time I read about the four horsemen. I felt that Judgment Day was coming and that since I was not ready, I would not survive.”​—Crystal.

“I was fascinated by the four distinctive riders on different-colored horses. Once I understood what the vision meant, it all made sense.”​—Ed.

Can you identify with the way Crystal felt about the four horsemen of the Apocalypse? Or do you feel the way Ed did? In either case, the epic ride of those horsemen forms one of the best-known scenes in Revelation, the last book of the Bible. Did you know that you can benefit personally by understanding this vision? How? God promises that you can find real happiness by reading, learning from, and living by the things written in that prophetic book.​—Revelation 1:1-3.
While some are frightened by the vision of the four horsemen, it is not designed to scare you. In fact, millions have found that this vision strengthens their faith and even points them to the hope of a bright future. It can mean the same for you! Please read on.

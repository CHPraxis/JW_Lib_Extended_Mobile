<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Ezekiel’s temple vision reveals that Jehovah’s people would make voluntary offerings. How can we personally share in making sacrifices of praise?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:15-58:13:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb 13:15, 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">One excellent way is to serve as an auxiliary pioneer. The 2018 service year contains several months that have five Saturdays or five Sundays. This is especially helpful to those who work full-time secularly and participate in the ministry mostly on the weekends. Additionally, publishers may choose either a 30- or a 50-hour requirement during the months of March and April and during the month of the circuit overseer’s visit.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What if our circumstances do not permit us to share in the auxiliary pioneer service? We can certainly strive to improve the quality of our ministry and perhaps increase the quantity as well. Whatever our circumstances, may love for Jehovah impel us to offer him our best during the 2018 service year!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:14:2-28:14:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ho 14:2</a>.</p>

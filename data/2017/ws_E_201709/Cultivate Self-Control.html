<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"><strong>1, 2. </strong>(a) What can result from a lack of self-control? (b) Why do we need to discuss the subject of self-control?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb">SELF-CONTROL is a quality that Jehovah God can help us to cultivate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>) Jehovah has perfect self-control. However, we do not because we are imperfect. Actually, a lack of self-control is responsible for many of the problems people have today. It may cause a person to delay doing things that are important or cause him to perform poorly at school or at work. A lack of self-control may also lead to verbal abuse, drunkenness, violence, divorce, unnecessary debt, addiction, time in jail, emotional pain, sexually transmitted disease, and unwanted pregnancy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:11-19:34:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 34:11-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>People who do not have self-control cause problems for themselves and for others. And as time goes by, it is clear that people have less and less self-control. This should not surprise us, though, because God’s Word foretold that a lack of self-control would be one proof that we are living in “the last days.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-3</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Why do we need self-control? There are two important reasons. First, people who can control their feelings and emotions generally have fewer problems. It is also easier for them to have wholesome relationships and to avoid feeling angry, anxious, or depressed. Second, to remain God’s friends, we need to resist temptation and control wrong desires. That is what Adam and Eve failed to do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:6-1:3:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 3:6</a>) Like them, many people today have terrible problems because they do not have self-control.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>What should be encouraging to any who are struggling to control their wrong desires?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jehovah understands that we are imperfect and that it is difficult for us to have self-control. But he wants to help us dominate our wrong desires. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:8:46-11:8:50" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Kings 8:46-50</a>) As a loving Friend, he kindly encourages those who sometimes find it difficult to control their feelings and desires. In this article, we will learn from Jehovah’s example of self-control. We will also discuss examples from the Bible, both good and bad, and review practical suggestions that can help us.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Think about how Jehovah reacted when Satan rebelled in Eden. Likely, the Devil’s claim caused all of God’s loyal servants in heaven to feel shock, anger, and contempt. Maybe you feel the same way when you think about all the suffering Satan has caused. But Jehovah did not overreact. He responded in just the right way. Jehovah has been slow to anger and fair in dealing with Satan’s rebellion.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>(a) Where can we find good examples of self-control? (b) What helped Joseph to resist temptation when Potiphar’s wife tried to seduce him? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>What Bible examples highlight the value of self-control? One you may think of is Jacob’s son Joseph. He resisted temptation when he was serving in the house of Potiphar, the chief of Pharaoh’s guards. Potiphar’s wife found Joseph attractive because he was “well-built and handsome,” and she tried to seduce him several times. What helped Joseph to resist temptation? He probably took time to think carefully in advance about what would happen if he were to give in to her. Then, when she grabbed him by his clothes, he ran away from her. He said: “How could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:6-1:39:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Genesis 39:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:9-1:39:9" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 9</a>; <strong>read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:10-20:1:10" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 1:10</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>How can you prepare yourself to resist temptations?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>What do we learn from Joseph’s example? If we are tempted to break one of God’s laws, we need to resist the temptation. Before becoming Jehovah’s Witnesses, some struggled with overeating, heavy drinking, smoking, drug abuse, sexual immorality, or other problems. Even after baptism, they may at times be tempted by those things. If this happens to you, stop and think about how your relationship with Jehovah would be damaged if you gave in to the temptation. You can try to identify situations that might be tempting for you and decide how you can avoid them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:26:4-19:26:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 26:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Proverbs 22:3</a>) If you are ever tested like that, ask Jehovah to give you the wisdom and self-control to resist the temptation.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>10, 11. </strong>(a) What happens to many young ones at school? (b) What can help young Christians to resist the temptation to break God’s laws?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Something similar to what happened to Joseph happens to many young Christians today. One example is Kim. Her classmates would often brag about having sex over the weekend. Kim did not have any stories like that to tell. She admits that being different made her feel “abandoned and alone” at times and that her classmates thought that she was stupid because she did not date. But Kim was actually wise. She knew that the temptation to have sex can be very strong when we are young. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:22-55:2:22" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:22</a>) Other students would often ask whether she was still a virgin. That gave her the opportunity to explain why she chose not to have sex. We are proud of young <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>Christians who are determined to resist pressure to be sexually immoral, and Jehovah is proud of them too!</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>The Bible also gives us examples of people who did not resist the temptation to be sexually immoral. And it shows the bad results when we do not have self-control. If you are in a situation similar to Kim’s, think about the foolish young man described in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:7:1-20:7:27" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Proverbs chapter 7</a>. Think, too, about Amnon and the terrible results of his behavior. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:13:1-10:13:2" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Samuel 13:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:13:10-10:13:15" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 10-15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:13:28-10:13:32" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 28-32</a>) Parents can help their children to develop self-control and wisdom by discussing those examples during family worship.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>(a) How did Joseph control his feelings toward his brothers? (b) In what situations do we have to control our feelings?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>On another occasion, Joseph again set a good example of self-control. This was when his brothers came to Egypt to buy food. To understand what they were really thinking, Joseph did not tell them that he was their brother. And when his feelings became very intense, he left his brothers so that he could cry in private. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:43:30-1:43:31" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Genesis 43:30, 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:45:1-1:45:1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 45:1</a>) If a brother or a sister does something that upsets you, imitating Joseph’s example of self-control will help you to avoid saying or doing something you might later regret. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:32-20:16:32" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:27-20:17:27" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 17:27</a>) Or maybe you have disfellowshipped relatives. If so, you will need to control your feelings in order to avoid unnecessary contact with them. This can be difficult to do. But it will be easier if you remember that you are imitating Jehovah’s example and doing what he commands.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>We also benefit from King David’s example.

We know this from reading about his sin with Bath-sheba and his reaction to Nabal’s greed.

But the man continued to yell. So Luigi wrote the man’s insurance details down and left while the man was still shouting. A week later, Luigi was making a return visit on a woman. Her husband was the other driver! The man was embarrassed and apologized for his bad behavior. He offered to contact Luigi’s insurance company so that Luigi could get his car fixed sooner. The man joined the Bible discussion and really enjoyed it.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:4</a>) If you see that your children are lacking self-control, ask yourself whether you are setting a good example. You can set a good example by being regular in the ministry, in attending meetings, and in conducting family worship. And do not be afraid to say no to your children when necessary! Jehovah set limits for Adam and Eve. Those limits could have helped them to learn respect for Jehovah’s authority. In a similar way, when parents discipline their children and set a good example for them, it can teach children self-control. Love for God’s authority and respect for his standards are some of the most valuable things that you can help your children to have.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:5-20:1:5" data-bid="28-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 1:5,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:7-20:1:8" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> <strong>7, 8</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> <strong>1. </strong>What convinces you that God’s Word has power? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb">JEHOVAH’S people are convinced that his word, his message to humans, “is alive and exerts power.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>) We have seen the Bible’s power in our own life and in the lives of others. Before becoming Witnesses, some were thieves, drug addicts, or sexually immoral. Others had fame or money but still felt that something was missing in their life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:2:3-21:2:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 2:3-11</a>) Happily, many who were hopeless and lost now have direction and hope. In <em>The Watchtower, </em>we have read and enjoyed many such experiences in the series of articles “The Bible Changes Lives.” And even after becoming Christians, people must continue to strengthen their relationship with Jehovah with the help of the Bible.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>How did the power of God’s Word affect people in the first century?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>It is not surprising that many people make big changes when they learn the truth. Our brothers and <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>sisters in the first century who had the heavenly hope made such changes. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 6:9-11</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>When Paul spoke of those who would not inherit God’s Kingdom, he added: “That is what some of you <strong>were.” </strong>God’s Word and his holy spirit helped those people to change. But even after becoming Christians, some of them made serious mistakes that affected their relationship with Jehovah. For example, the Bible mentions one anointed brother who had to be disfellowshipped. Later, he made changes so that he could again be part of the Christian congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:1-46:5:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:5-47:2:8" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 2:5-8</a>) It is encouraging that our brothers and sisters have been able to make so many changes because of the power of God’s Word.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>God’s Word is very powerful. Since Jehovah has given it to us, we want to make sure that we use it well. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:15-55:2:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:15</a>) This article will discuss what we can do to use the power of the Bible (1) in our own life, (2) in our ministry, and (3) when we teach from the platform. What we learn here will help us show our love and gratitude to our heavenly Father, who teaches us to benefit ourselves.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>To allow God’s Word to affect us, we need to read it regularly. We should try to read it every day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Joshua 1:8</a>) Most of us have very busy lives, but we should not let anything, including our responsibilities, stop us from reading the Bible. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:15-49:5:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 5:15, 16</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>We may find the time early in the morning, sometime during the day, or later on at night.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>How can our meditation be effective?

How <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>am I already applying what I read in my life?

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>It is important that we use God’s Word frequently when we preach and teach. One brother said, “If you were preaching from house to house with Jehovah himself, would you do all the talking or would you let him speak?” When we read from the Bible to someone, we are letting Jehovah speak to him. A well-chosen scripture is more powerful than anything we might say. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:13-52:2:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>) When you are in the ministry, do you try to read from the Bible as often as you can?</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>Why do we need to do more than just read scriptures when we preach?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>However, reading a Bible verse to those to whom we preach is not enough. Most people do not understand the meaning of the Bible. This was true in the first century, and it is true today. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:2-45:10:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Romans 10:2</a>) We should not assume that the householder understands the scripture we read. We can help him by repeating main words or ideas from the verse and then explaining what these mean. In this way, God’s Word can reach people’s mind and heart.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:32-42:24:32" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 24:32</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>How can we help people respect the Bible by what we say before reading a scripture? Give an example.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>What we say before we read a scripture can also help the householder to respect the Bible. For example, we might say, “Let’s see what our Creator says on this subject.” Or if we are speaking to someone from a non-Christian background, we could say, “Let’s see what the Holy Writings tell us.” If we meet a person who does not care about religion, we could ask, “Have you ever heard this ancient saying?” If we remember that every person has his own background and beliefs, we will do all we can to make our introduction appealing.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:22-46:9:23" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 9:22, 23</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Many have found that using God’s Word can have a powerful effect on people to whom they preach. For example, one brother visited an elderly man who had read our magazines for many years. One day, instead of just giving him the latest <em>Watchtower, </em>the brother decided to read a scripture. <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>He read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 1:3, 4</a>, which says: “The Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort . . . comforts us in all our trials.” These words touched the elderly man so much that he asked the brother to read the verses again. Then the man said that he and his wife really needed comfort. Because of this scripture, he wanted to know more about the Bible.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:16-43:7:16" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 7:16</a>) So be very careful that <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>the way you give your talk and the experiences or illustrations you use do not attract more attention than the Bible. Also, remember that <strong>reading </strong>from the Bible is not the same thing as <strong>teaching </strong>from the Bible. In fact, if you read too many scriptures, most people will not remember them. So carefully choose the scriptures you want to use. Then take time to read, explain, illustrate, and apply them well. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:8-16:8:8" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8:8</a>) When a talk is based on an outline, make sure that you study the outline and the scriptures it uses.

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sc">For many years after Victoria learned the truth, she felt that it was not possible for God to love her. What convinced her that God truly loved her? Here is her story:</p>
<blockquote><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sc">“A turning point came about 15 years after I was baptized. During a talk at the Kingdom Hall . . . , the speaker referred to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:23-59:1:24" data-bid="25-1" class="b">James 1:23, 24</a>. Those verses liken God’s Word to a mirror in which we can see ourselves the way Jehovah sees us. I began to wonder if what I saw in myself was different from what Jehovah saw. At first, I resisted this new idea. I still felt that loving me was too much to expect of Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="sc">“A few days later, I read a scripture that changed my life. The verse was <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:18-23:1:18" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where Jehovah is quoted as saying: ‘Come, now, you people, and let us set matters straight between us. . . . Though the sins of you people should prove to be as scarlet, they will be made white just like snow.’ I felt as if Jehovah were speaking to me, saying: ‘Come on, Vicky, let’s set matters straight between us. I know you, I know your sins, I know your heart​—and I love you.’</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sc">“I was unable to sleep that night. I still doubted that Jehovah could love me, but I began thinking about Jesus’ ransom sacrifice. All of a sudden, it dawned on me that Jehovah had been patient with me for so long, showing me that he loved me in so many ways. Yet, I was, in effect, saying to him: ‘Your love is not great enough to reach me. Your Son’s sacrifice is not enough to cover me.’ It was as if I had been throwing the ransom back at Jehovah. But now, at last, by meditating on this gift of the ransom, I began to feel loved by Jehovah.”</p>

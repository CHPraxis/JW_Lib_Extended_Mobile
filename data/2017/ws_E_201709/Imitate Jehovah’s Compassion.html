<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb">ON ONE occasion, God revealed himself to Moses by declaring His name and some of His qualities. Jehovah could have emphasized his power or wisdom, but instead, he first spoke of his mercy and compassion. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:5-2:34:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Exodus 34:5-7</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Moses needed to know if Jehovah would support him. So Jehovah emphasized qualities that show that he really wants to help his servants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:33:13-2:33:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 33:13</a>) How does it make you feel to know that Jehovah cares so much for us? This article will focus on compassion, which is sympathy for the suffering of others and the desire to help them.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"><strong>2, 3. </strong>(a) What shows that it is natural for humans to feel compassion? (b) Why should you be interested in what the Bible says about compassion?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jehovah is compassionate, and humans were made in his image. So it is natural for humans to care about others. Even those who do not know Jehovah often show compassion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:27" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27</a>) In the Bible, we find many <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>accounts of people who showed compassion. For example, when Solomon needed to find out which of two women was the mother of a baby, he tested them by ordering that the baby be cut in half. The mother felt deep compassion for her baby, so she pleaded with the king to let the other woman have him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:3:23-11:3:27" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Kings 3:23-27</a>) Another example of compassion is Pharaoh’s daughter. When she found baby Moses, she realized that he was a Hebrew and was supposed to be killed. But “she felt compassion for him,” and she decided to raise him as her own son.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:2:5-2:2:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 2:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Why should we learn more about compassion? Because Jehovah wants us to imitate him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:1-49:5:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:1</a>) Even though we were created to be compassionate, we are imperfect and tend to be selfish. Sometimes it may not be easy for us to decide whether to help other people or to focus on ourselves. What can help us to be more interested in others? First, let us examine how Jehovah and others have shown compassion. Second, let us see how we can imitate God’s compassion and why it is good for us to do so.</p>

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>(a) Why did Jehovah send angels to Sodom? (b) What can we learn from the experience of Lot’s family?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The Bible contains many examples of Jehovah’s compassion. For example, think of what he did for Lot. Lot was a righteous man who was “greatly distressed” by the immoral people in Sodom and Gomorrah. Those people had no respect for God, and Jehovah decided that they deserved to die. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:7-61:2:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:7, 8</a>) Jehovah sent angels to Lot to tell him that Sodom and Gomorrah would be destroyed and that he needed to flee. The Bible says: “When [Lot] kept lingering, then because of Jehovah’s compassion for him, the [angels] seized hold of his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, and they brought him out and stationed him outside the city.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:16-1:19:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 19:16</a>) Just as Jehovah understood Lot’s situation, we can be sure that he understands any difficulties we go through.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:7-23:63:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 63:7-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:11-59:5:11" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> James 5:11</a>, footnote; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:9-61:2:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How does God’s Word teach us how to show compassion?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah has also taught his people to show compassion. Think about one of the laws that he gave to Israel. If someone owed money to a lender, the lender could take the person’s garment as a guarantee that he would pay the money back. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:22:26-2:22:27" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Exodus 22:26, 27</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>But the lender had to return the garment to the person by sunset so <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>that he could stay warm during the night. Someone who was not compassionate might not have wanted to give the garment back, but Jehovah taught his people to be compassionate. What does the principle behind this law teach us? Never ignore the needs of a fellow Christian. When we can help a brother or a sister who is suffering, we want to do so.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:12-51:3:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Colossians 3:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:15-59:2:16" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> James 2:15, 16</a>; <strong>read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:17-62:3:17" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>1 John 3:17</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What can we learn from Jehovah’s compassion for the sinful Israelites?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jehovah felt compassion for the Israelites even when they sinned against him. We read: “Jehovah the God of their forefathers kept warning them by means of his messengers, warning them again and again, because he felt compassion for his people and for his dwelling place.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:36:15-14:36:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:15</a>) In a similar way, we should feel compassion for those who do not yet know Jehovah but who may still repent and become his friends. Jehovah does not want anyone to be destroyed in the coming judgment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:9-61:3:9" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:9</a>) So while there is still time, we want to share his warning message with everyone we can and help as many as possible to benefit from God’s compassion.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"><strong>7, 8. </strong>Why did one family believe that Jehovah had shown compassion to them?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Today, many of Jehovah’s servants have experienced his compassion. For example, during the 1990’s in Bosnia, various ethnic groups were fighting and killing one another. One family living there included a 12-year-old boy we will call Milan. Milan, his brother, his parents, and other Witnesses were traveling on a bus from Bosnia to Serbia. They were going to a convention, where Milan’s parents were planning to get baptized. At the border, some soldiers noticed that the family was from a different ethnic group and made them get off the bus. Then they let the rest of the brothers on the bus continue their trip. For two days, the soldiers would not let the family go. Finally, the officer in charge called his superior officer and asked what he should do with them. The family was standing right there and could hear the superior officer reply, “Just take them out and shoot them!”</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>As the soldiers were talking, two strangers approached the family. They whispered that they were Witnesses too and that the brothers on the bus had told them what had happened. The two Witnesses told Milan and his brother to get into their car to cross the border because the soldiers were not checking children’s papers. Then the brothers told the parents to walk around the back of the border post and meet them on the other side. Milan was so scared that he did not know whether to laugh or cry. His parents asked, “Do you think they are just going to let us walk off?” But as they walked away, it seemed as if the soldiers did not even see them. Milan and his brother met their parents on the other side of the border, and they <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>went on to the convention. They were convinced that Jehovah had answered their prayers! We know from the Bible that Jehovah does not always directly protect his servants in such a way. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:58-44:7:60" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 7:58-60</a>) But in this case, Milan said: “It seemed to me that the angels blinded the soldiers and that Jehovah rescued us.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:97:10-19:97:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 97:10</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Jesus was an excellent example of compassion. He felt pity for the people because he saw that “they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.” So, what did he do? “He started to teach them many things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:36-40:9:36" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 9:36</a>; <strong>read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:34-41:6:34" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>Mark 6:34</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>In contrast, the Pharisees were not compassionate and did not want to help the people.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>This does not mean that it is always appropriate to show compassion. For example, King Saul may have thought that he was showing compassion when he did not kill Agag, who was the king of Amalek and an enemy of God’s people. Saul also did not kill all the animals of the Amalekites. But Jehovah had told Saul to kill all the Amalekites and all their animals. Because of Saul’s disobedience, Jehovah rejected him as king.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:6-53:1:10" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 1:6-10</a>) That will not be the time for Jehovah to show compassion to the wicked. However, by destroying them, he will show compassion for the righteous, whom he will save.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Of course, it is not our job to judge whether people should live or die.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup>Be helpful in everyday life. </strong>Jehovah requires that Christians show compassion to their neighbors and to their brothers.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:17-60:2:17" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:17</a>) For example, a Japanese sister lived in an area that was damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. She said that she was “very encouraged and comforted” when she saw volunteers come from different parts of Japan and from other countries to repair homes and Kingdom Halls.

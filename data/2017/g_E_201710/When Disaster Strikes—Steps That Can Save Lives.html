<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">  <strong>Learn about disasters </strong>that can happen in your area. Know where shelters are.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">“When fire broke out, most people didn’t panic​—they delayed,” relates Joshua, quoted at the outset. “Some turned off a computer or filled a water bottle. One man said, ‘Maybe we should just wait.’” Despite the hesitancy of others, Joshua shouted: “We need to get out of here <em>now!” </em>At that, <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>his coworkers snapped out of denial and followed him down the stairs. “If anyone falls, pick him up and keep moving,” Joshua kept calling out. “We’re all going to make it!”</p>
<ul><li><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="su">  <strong>In a fire. </strong>Stay close to the floor, and move quickly to the nearest exit. Smoke makes it hard to see, and most fire deaths are caused by smoke inhalation. Leave behind personal items. Seconds can make the difference between life and death.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="su">  <strong>In an earthquake. </strong>Get under sturdy furniture or next to an inside wall. Expect aftershocks, and get outside and away from buildings as soon as you can. Trained rescuers may not arrive for hours, so try to rescue others if you can.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="su">  <strong>In a tsunami. </strong>If the water suddenly rushes away from the shore, move <em>quickly </em>to higher ground. Expect more and larger waves.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="su">  <strong>In a tornado or a hurricane. </strong>Go to a storm shelter without delay.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="su">  <strong>In a flood. </strong>Stay out of flooded buildings. Avoid wading in or driving through water. Floodwater can contain sewage and conceal dangers, including debris, open manholes, and downed power lines.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="su">  <strong>Did you know? </strong>Two feet [0.6 m] of moving water can carry a car away. Most deaths in a flood result when people try to drive through moving water.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="su">  <strong>If the authorities order evacuation, </strong>leave immediately! Let friends know where you are, or they may risk <em>their </em>lives looking for you.</p>

In case of an outdoor chemical, biological, or nuclear accident or attack, stay indoors, turn off ventilation, and seal all doors and windows. In a nuclear event, go to the lowest internal part of your building to reduce exposure to radiation. Listen to local TV or radio news.

<ul><li><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="su">  <strong>Stay with friends, </strong>if possible, rather than in a camp.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="su">  <strong>Keep your living space sanitary.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="su">  <strong>Use personal protective equipment </strong>when cleaning up debris. If possible, wear gloves, sturdy shoes, a hard hat, and a dust mask. Beware of electrical wires and hidden embers.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="su">  <strong>Keep your daily routine </strong>as normal as possible. Your children need to see that you are calm and hopeful. Do school lessons, play, and worship as a family. Do not dwell on news coverage of the tragedy, and do not take out your anxiety or frustration on family members. Accept help, and help others.</p>

<li><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="su">  <strong>Acknowledge that disasters cause loss. </strong>Government and other relief efforts focus on helping people to survive, not on replacing everything that was lost. To survive, we need clean water, food, clothing, and shelter from the weather.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:7-54:6:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:7, 8</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="su">  <strong>Recognize and address emotional injury. </strong>This often surfaces after the initial shock has passed. Symptoms include anxiety, depression, and mood swings, as well as difficulty thinking, working, and sleeping. Talk to caring friends.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Although Joshua survived the fire in his workplace, many of his acquaintances did not. He received assistance from Christian elders and mental-health professionals. “They assured me that my grief was part of a natural healing process and that it would pass,” Joshua says. “After six months, the nightmares lessened. Other symptoms have lasted longer.”</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Disasters assault our very sense of justice. In response, some people mistakenly blame God. Many, like Joshua, experience “survivor’s guilt.” “I still wonder if I could have saved more people,” he says. “I am comforted by my belief that God will soon bring complete justice to the earth and will right all wrongs. In the meantime, I cherish each day of life and do what I reasonably can to preserve it.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4, 5</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

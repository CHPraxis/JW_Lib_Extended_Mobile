<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What approach will help you to enjoy your Bible reading and get the most out of it? Take note of five suggestions that have worked for many.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Create the right surroundings. </strong>Try to find a setting that is quiet. Minimize distractions so you can focus on what you read. Good lighting and fresh air may help you to get the most from your reading.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Have the right frame of mind. </strong>Since the Bible is from our heavenly Father, you will benefit the most if you have the attitude of a child who is ready to learn from a loving parent. If you have any negative, preconceived ideas about the Bible, try to set them aside so that God can teach you.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:25:4-19:25:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 25:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Pray before you read. </strong>The Bible contains God’s thoughts, so it is not surprising that we need his help to understand it. God promises to give “holy spirit to those asking him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:13-42:11:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 11:13</a>) The holy spirit can help you to understand God’s thinking. In time, it will open your mind to grasp “even the deep things of God.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:10-46:2:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Read to understand. </strong>Do not read just to cover material. Actively think about what you are reading. Ask yourself such questions as these: ‘What qualities do I see in the person I am reading about? How can I apply this in my life?’</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Set specific goals. </strong>To be rewarded by your Bible reading, set out to learn something that will truly enrich your life. You may set goals like the following: ‘I want to learn more about God himself.’ ‘I want to become a better person, a better husband or wife.’ Then select portions of the Bible that will help you reach those goals.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

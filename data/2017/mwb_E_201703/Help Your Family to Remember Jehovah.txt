LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Help Your Family to Remember Jehovah




Jeremiah was commissioned to warn the Jews of an impending destruction because they had forgotten their God, Jehovah. (Jer 13:25) How did the nation get to this sad spiritual state? Israelite families had lost their spirituality. Evidently family heads were not following Jehovah’s direction recorded at Deuteronomy 6:5-7.





Spiritually strong families contribute to the stability of our congregations today. Family heads can help their family to remember Jehovah by means of a regular and meaningful Family Worship program. (Ps 22:27) After watching the video “These Words . . . Must Be on Your Heart”—Family Interviews, answer these questions:

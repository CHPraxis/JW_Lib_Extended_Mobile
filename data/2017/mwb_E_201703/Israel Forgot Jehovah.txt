TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | JEREMIAH 12-16
Israel Forgot Jehovah




Jeremiah was given a challenging assignment that would illustrate Jehovah’s determination to bring to ruin the stubborn pride of Judah and Jerusalem.








Jeremiah bought a linen belt

13:1, 2
  The belt clinging to the waist symbolized the close relationship that was possible between Jehovah and the nation





Jeremiah took the belt to the Euphrates River

13:3-5
  He hid it in the cleft of a crag, and he then returned to Jerusalem





Jeremiah returned to the Euphrates River to retrieve the belt

13:6, 7
  The belt was ruined





Jehovah explained the matter after Jeremiah carried out the assignment

13:8-11
  Jeremiah’s heartfelt obedience in what may have seemed trivial played a role in Jehovah’s efforts to reach the hearts of the people





DID YOU KNOW?
The distance from Jerusalem to the Euphrates River was some 300 miles (500 km). To complete both journeys, Jeremiah would have had to travel about 1,200 miles (2,000 km), likely walking for months.

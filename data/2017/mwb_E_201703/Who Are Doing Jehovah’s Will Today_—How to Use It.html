<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The brochure <em>Who Are Doing Jehovah’s Will Today?</em> was designed to be considered with Bible students at the beginning or at the end of each study session.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Lessons 1 to 4 familiarize students with us as a people, lessons 5 to 14 help them learn about our activities, and lessons 15 to 28 show them our organization in action. It is generally best to consider the lessons in order unless a particular one deals with something of immediate interest. Each lesson is only a page long and can be discussed with most students in from five to ten minutes.</p>

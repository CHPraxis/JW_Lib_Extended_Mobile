TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | JEREMIAH 5-7
They Stopped Doing God’s Will




7:1-4, 8-10, 15
  Jeremiah boldly exposed the Israelites’ sins and hypocrisy

  The Israelites considered the temple to be a talisman that would protect them

  Jehovah let it be known that ritualistic sacrifices did not make up for wrong conduct


Consider: How can I make sure that my worship is in harmony with Jehovah’s will and does not become formalistic?








Jeremiah in the gate of the house of Jehovah

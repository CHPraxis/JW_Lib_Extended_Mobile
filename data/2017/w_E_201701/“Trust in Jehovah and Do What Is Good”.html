<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">JEHOVAH created humans with remarkable abilities. He gave us thinking ability to solve problems and plan for the future. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:2:11-20:2:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 2:11</a>) He gave us power to carry out our plans, enabling us to work toward proper goals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:13-50:2:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Phil. 2:13</a>) He also created us with a conscience<wbr />—an inborn sense of right and wrong—<wbr />that can help us avoid wrongdoing and correct our mistakes when we fall short.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:2:15-45:2:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 2:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jehovah expects us to put our abilities to good use. Why? Because he loves us, and he knows that it brings us satisfaction when we employ these gifts. Through his Word, Jehovah repeatedly admonishes us to use our abilities for good. For example, in the Hebrew Scriptures, we read: “The plans of the diligent surely lead to success”; and “whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:21:5-20:21:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Prov. 21:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:9:10-21:9:10" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Eccl. 9:10</a>) <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>In the Christian Greek Scriptures, we are told: “As long as we have the opportunity, let us work what is good toward all”; and “to the extent that each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gal. 6:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:4:10-60:4:10" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 4:10</a>) Clearly, Jehovah wants us to do what we can to benefit ourselves and others.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>At the same time, Jehovah knows that humans have limitations. On our own, we can never eliminate imperfection, sin, and death; neither can we control other people, for all have free will.

At the same time, we should do what we can, taking appropriate action to solve problems and help others. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:3-19:37:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 37:3</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>In short, we need both ‘to <em>trust </em>in Jehovah and to <em>do </em>what is good’; we need ‘to <em>act </em>with faithfulness.’ In this regard, let us consider what we can learn from the examples of Noah, David, and other faithful servants of God who relied on Jehovah and took appropriate action. As we will see, this involved distinguishing between what they <em>could not </em>do and what they <em>could </em>do and then acting accordingly.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup><em>What Noah could not do: </em></strong>Although Noah faithfully preached Jehovah’s <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>warning message, he could not force wicked people around him to accept that message, nor could he make the Flood come any sooner. Noah had to trust that Jehovah would keep His promise to end wickedness, believing that God would do so at just the right time.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:17-1:6:17" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 6:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>We too live in a world filled with wickedness, which we know Jehovah has promised to destroy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:17-62:2:17" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 John 2:17</a>) In the meantime, we cannot force people to accept the “good news of the Kingdom.” And we cannot do anything to speed up the start of the “great tribulation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 21</a>) Like Noah, we need strong faith, trusting that God will soon intervene.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup><em>What Noah could do: </em></strong>Instead of giving up because of what he could not do, Noah focused on what he <em>could </em>do. As “a preacher of righteousness,” Noah faithfully proclaimed the warning message he had been given. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:2:5-61:2:5" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:5</a>) No doubt, doing so helped Noah keep his faith strong.

Above all, we stay busy in the preaching work, knowing that this work strengthens our hope for the future. One faithful sister put it this way: “When you talk to others about the blessings of God’s Kingdom, you realize that your listeners have absolutely no hope and that they see their <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>problems as permanent.” Indeed, sharing in the preaching work fortifies our positive view of the future and our resolve not to give up in the race for life.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:9:24-46:9:24" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:24</a>.</p>

Introduction




Today, many people are extremely busy, to the point that sometimes relationships are strained and families suffer.
How can we be balanced in our use of time?
A wise man once wrote: “Better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of hard work and chasing after the wind.”​—Ecclesiastes 4:6.
This issue of Awake! provides practical suggestions on making wise use of our time, which includes setting practical priorities.

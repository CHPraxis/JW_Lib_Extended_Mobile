<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">FIRST-CENTURY Christians made great efforts to reach as many people as possible with the “good news of the Kingdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) Some even traveled to foreign countries. For example, the apostle Paul went to the region where modern-day Turkey is situated and preached there extensively during his missionary journeys.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Some 2,000 years later, in 2014, Turkey was once again the focus of a special preaching campaign. Why was the campaign organized? Who shared in it?</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">There are over 2,800 publishers in Turkey, but the country has a population of 79 million. This means that the publisher-to-population ratio in Turkey is nearly 1 to 28,000. As you can imagine, the publishers have been able to contact only a small number of the inhabitants of this country. The aim of the special preaching campaign was to reach as many people as possible in a short time. About 550 Turkish-speaking brothers and sisters from other countries traveled to Turkey and preached alongside the local publishers during the campaign. What was achieved?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>A widespread witness was given. </em>One congregation in Istanbul wrote: “When people saw us, they asked: ‘Is there a special convention here? We see Jehovah’s Witnesses everywhere!’” A congregation in the city of Izmir wrote: “A man working at a taxi stand approached a local elder and asked, ‘What’s going on? Have you increased your activity?’” Yes, the campaign was noticed.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The foreign participants thoroughly enjoyed the preaching work. <strong>Steffen, </strong>who is from <strong><em>Denmark, </em></strong>said: “Every day, I was able to preach to people who had never heard about Jehovah. I felt that I was really making Jehovah’s name known.” <strong>Jean-David </strong>from <strong><em>France </em></strong>wrote: “We preached on just one street for hours. It was wonderful! Most people didn’t know Jehovah’s Witnesses. At almost every door, we were able to start a conversation, show one of our videos, and leave literature with the householder.”</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><em>Zeal for the ministry increased. </em>The special activity had a motivating effect on the local brothers. Many started thinking about full-time service. In fact, the number of regular pioneers in Turkey increased by 24 percent during the 12 months following the campaign.</p>

I am very shy when it comes to preaching informally. But thanks to the special campaign, the example of the local brothers, and many prayers, I was able to do what I couldn’t do before. I even preached and placed tracts in the subway! Now I am not as shy as before.”</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><em>The publishers drew closer to one another. </em>The love and unity among the brothers from different countries made a lasting impression. “We ‘tasted’ the brothers’ hospitality,” said Jean-David, mentioned earlier. He added: “They accepted us as their friends and as part of their family. They opened their homes to us. I knew that we are an international brotherhood; I had read it many times in our literature. But this time, I experienced it firsthand. I felt even more proud of being one of Jehovah’s <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>people, and I thank him for this wonderful privilege.”</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">By means of the special preaching campaign in Turkey, the good news reached many more people. Yet, there is still a vast untouched territory. Every day, need-greaters who moved to Turkey meet people who have never heard about Jehovah. Would you like to serve in such a territory? If so, we encourage you: “Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:35-43:4:35" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 4:35</a>) Could you assist in a part of the world where the fields are “white for harvesting”? If so, begin taking practical steps now toward reaching that goal. One thing is sure: Having an increased share in spreading the good news “to the most distant part of the earth” will bring you rich blessings beyond compare!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>.</p>

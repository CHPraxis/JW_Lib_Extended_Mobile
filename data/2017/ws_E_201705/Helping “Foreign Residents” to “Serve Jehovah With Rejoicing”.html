<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Jesus and his parents became refugees in Egypt after Jehovah’s angel warned Joseph that King Herod wanted to kill Jesus. They stayed there until Herod died. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:13-40:2:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 2:13, 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:19-40:2:21" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 19-21</a>) Many years later, Jesus’ disciples “were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria” because of persecution. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:1-44:8:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 8:1</a>) Jesus knew that many of his followers would be forced to leave their homes. He said: “When they persecute you in one city, flee to another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:23-40:10:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 10:23</a>) Fleeing home for any reason is never easy.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>4, 5. </strong>What are some of the dangers when refugees (a) are fleeing? (b) are living in a camp?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>When refugees are fleeing from their home or are living in a refugee camp, they face various dangers. “We walked for weeks, passing hundreds of dead bodies,” says Gad, Lije’s younger brother. “I was 12 years old. My feet were so swollen that I told my family to go on without me. My father​—not about to abandon me to the rebel forces—​carried me. We survived day by day, praying to Jehovah and trusting in him, sometimes eating only mangoes that were growing along the way.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:12-50:4:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Philippians 4:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Most of Lije’s family spent many years in United Nations refugee camps. But there were dangers there too. Lije, who is now a circuit overseer, explains: “Most people had no work. They gossiped, drank, gambled, stole, and were immoral.” To protect themselves from the bad influences, the Witnesses needed to stay busy in the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:11-58:6:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 10:24, 25</a>) They used their time wisely so that they could stay strong in the truth, and many began pioneering. They reminded themselves that eventually their time in the refugee camp would end, just as Israel’s time in the wilderness ended. This helped them keep a positive attitude.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:18-47:4:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Some refugees are forced to live in another part of their own country. However, many others must go to a new country that is not familiar. It is true that governments may give refugees some food and clothing and a place to live, but there are still challenges. For example, the food may be very different from what they are used to. Some refugees who come from warm countries may not know how to dress for cold weather. Others may have to learn how to use modern appliances for the first time.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Some governments have programs to help refugees adjust to life in a new country. But often the refugees are expected to care for themselves after a few months. This can be very difficult. Imagine the things they are expected to learn all at once: a new language, new customs, and new laws about such things as paying bills and taxes, school attendance, and even child discipline! Can you patiently and respectfully help our brothers and sisters who have challenges like these?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:3-50:2:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Philippians 2:3, 4</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Sometimes authorities make it difficult for our brothers who are refugees to contact the local congregation. Some government organizations threaten to stop helping our brothers. They may say that they will not allow them to live in the country if they refuse to accept a job that prevents them from attending meetings. Because they are afraid and feel helpless, some have taken those jobs. So it is urgent to meet our refugee brothers as soon as possible after they arrive. They need to see that we care about them.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>We do not need a lot of money to help refugees. What they need most is our time and love. For example, you can show them how to use public transportation or how to shop for healthy but inexpensive foods. You can also show them how to get things such as a sewing machine or a lawn mower so that they can use them to earn a regular income. Most important, you can help them to become a part of their new congregation. If possible, offer them transportation to meetings. You can also explain the best way to preach to people in the territory, and you can work with them in the ministry.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Galatians 6:10</a>) Soon, all four became pioneers.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Refugees need more than food and clothing. They need emotional support and encouragement from the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 4:4</a>) Elders can help by getting literature in the language of the refugees and by helping them to contact brothers who speak their language. This is very important because many refugees have been forced to leave behind everything they were familiar with. They are missing their family, community, and congregation. They need to sense Jehovah’s love and compassion among their fellow Christians. If they do not, refugees may look for help from others who are from the same country but who do not serve Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>) When we make them feel part of the congregation, we work with Jehovah to protect “the foreign residents.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:9-19:146:9" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 146:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Jesus and his family could not return to their home as long as those persecuting them were still ruling. For similar reasons, refugees today may not be able to return home. Others, however, may not want to return home. Lije says that many parents who saw family members raped and murdered in their country do not want to take their children back there. To help our brothers, we need to show “fellow feeling, brotherly affection, tender compassion, and humility.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:8-60:3:8" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:8</a>) Persecution has caused some refugees to avoid associating with others, and they may feel ashamed to talk about their suffering, especially if their children are near.

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Many of today’s refugees come from countries where our preaching work is restricted. Thanks to zealous Witnesses, thousands of refugees are hearing “the word of the Kingdom” for the first time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:19-40:13:19" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 13:19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:23-40:13:23" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 23</a>) Many who are “loaded down” are finding comfort and relief at our meetings and are quick to say: “God is really among you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:28-40:11:30" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 11:28-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:25-46:14:25" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 14:25</a>.</p>

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>We need to be wise and “cautious” when we preach to refugees. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:16-40:10:16" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matthew 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Proverbs 22:3</a>) Be patient as you listen to refugees when they speak, but do not discuss politics. We should follow directions we receive from the branch office as well as local authorities so that we do not put ourselves or others at risk. Because refugees come from different religions and cultures, we need to learn about and respect their feelings and opinions. For example, people from some countries have very strong opinions about how women should dress. So when we preach to them, it is good to dress in a way that will not offend them.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>We want to help people who are suffering, even those who do not serve Jehovah. When we do, we are imitating the good example of the Samaritan in Jesus’ illustration. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:33-42:10:37" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Luke 10:33-37</a>) The best way to help people is to teach them the good news. One elder who has helped many refugees said that it is important to tell them right away that we are Jehovah’s Witnesses.

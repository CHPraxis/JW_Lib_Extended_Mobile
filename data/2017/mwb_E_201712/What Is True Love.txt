What Is True Love?




Jehovah designed marriage to be a permanent bond between a man and a woman. (Ge 2:22-24) Divorce would be an option only in cases of sexual immorality. (Mal 2:16; Mt 19:9) Since Jehovah wants marriages to be happy, he has provided principles that can help Christians to select a mate wisely and to maintain a happy marriage.​—Ec 5:4-6.

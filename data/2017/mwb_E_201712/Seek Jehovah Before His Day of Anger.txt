TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | ZEPHANIAH 1–HAGGAI 2
Seek Jehovah Before His Day of Anger




Zep 2:2, 3
In order for Jehovah to conceal us on the day of his anger, we must do more than dedicate ourselves to him. We must obey the direction that Zephaniah gave to the Israelites.
  Seek Jehovah: Maintain a warm personal relationship with Jehovah in association with his organization

  Seek righteousness: Uphold Jehovah’s righteous standards

  Seek meekness: Humbly submit to God’s will and accept his discipline


How might I seek Jehovah, righteousness, and meekness to a greater degree?

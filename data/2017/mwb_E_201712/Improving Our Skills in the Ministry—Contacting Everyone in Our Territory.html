(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:8:23-38:8:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Zec 8:23</a>) But who will teach them? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:13-45:10:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ro 10:13-15</a>) We have the privilege and responsibility to share the good news with everyone in our territory.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="21" href="jwpub://p/E:1102014939/14-15"><em>od </em>84 ¶10-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>HOW TO DO IT:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">  Prepare. Do you encounter people who speak another language? You can use the <em>JW Language </em>app to learn a simple presentation. Or using your mobile device, you can show a person how he can find more information in his language on jw.org</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  Be observant. If you are working from house to house, do not overlook opportunities to witness to passersby or those waiting in cars. If you are involved in public witnessing, stay focused on your objective to give a witness</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">  Be diligent. Keep trying to reach those who are not at home initially. Make an effort to contact someone at every residence, perhaps at a different time of the day or on a different day of the week. Some householders may need to be contacted by letter, telephone, or street witnessing</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">  Follow through. Return promptly to follow up on any interest shown. If the person speaks a different language, try to find someone who is qualified to help him in his language. You should continue calling on the person until he is contacted by publishers who speak his language.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="22" href="jwpub://p/E:1102014939/50-51"><em>od </em>94 ¶39-40</a></p>

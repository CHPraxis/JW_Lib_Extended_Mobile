Stay in “the Valley of the Mountains”




14:3-5
Jehovah formed “a very great valley” in 1914 when he established the Messianic Kingdom, a subsidiary “mountain” to his universal sovereignty. Since 1919, God’s servants have found safety in “the valley of the mountains”
How do people “flee to the valley” of protection?
14:12, 15
Anyone outside the symbolic valley will be destroyed at Armageddon
How do I stay in the valley of protection?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● An Israeli teacher, M. Segal, has taken it upon himself to rewrite the Hebrew Scriptures, because, he said, something had to be done to make the good book popular, as it was in danger of being forgotten in Israel. In rewriting the Bible, however, he left in very little about God, because he claims the Bible is only history. He deleted four of the Ten Commandments, the ones dealing with the relationship between God and man. He left out the idolatrous dance around the golden calf and the smashing of the tablets on Sinai. Mention is made of the plagues against Egypt, but he inserts his idea that God had nothing to do with them. He has accepted the same lack of appreciation of pure worship that caused Israel’s downfall in 607 B.C., when the nation was “destroyed for lack of knowledge”. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:6-28:4:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hosea 4:6</a>) This is shown in the Associated Press report, which said: “In some parts of Segal’s work God appears briefly, but apparently only for the sake of art.”</p>

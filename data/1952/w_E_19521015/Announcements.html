<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>“HOLD A GOOD CONSCIENCE”—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:16-60:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>1 Pet. 3:16</strong></a><strong>, <em>NW.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A good conscience toward God is what all lovers of eternal life must have. It is won not merely by putting away fleshly filth and sin, but by positive right-doing, serving God, based on faith in the blood of Christ Jesus, of which Paul says, “How much more will the blood of the Christ, who through an everlasting spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works that we may render sacred service to the living God?” During November this “sacred service” on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses will take the form of presenting to the people the three bound books <em>What Has Religion Done for Mankind? “Let God Be True” </em>and <em>“This Means Everlasting Life”, </em>on a contribution of 50c each. This splendid combination of books presents a wide field for profitable Bible study that will help people to attain and hold a good conscience. Join in the special effort by introducing these books to others, and by reporting your activity to the Society at the conclusion of the month.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>WHAT DO YOU THINK OF RELIGION TODAY?</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Why do you think your religion is the best? Naturally you do or else you would not practice such religion. But did you ever stop to think that there are millions of people practicing a multitude of different religions and all believing that their particular religion is best? Can everyone be right? The teachings of modern religions are so diversified and contrary one to another that common sense tells us they cannot <em>all </em>be right. How are we going to weigh their respective merits? By examining their fruits—the results they have produced. The 352-page book <em>What Has Religion Done for Mankind? </em>sets forth the evidence of the effects of religion practiced by millions. It is available to you on a remittance of 50c, postpaid.</p>

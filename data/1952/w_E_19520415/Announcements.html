<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>HEALING FOR LIFE IN THE NEW WORLD</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“On this side of the river and on that side there were trees of life . . . And the leaves of the trees were for the curing of the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:2-66:22:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rev. 22:2</a>, <em>NW</em>) Note, these trees are in evidence while there is still need for “curing” or “healing” the nations, that is, people of all nations. Actually the provision for life and healing is that which flows from the Word of God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:18-20:3:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 3:18</a>) The <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures </em>makes access to this “tree” more readily available. Why? Because it offers in understandable English the life-giving truths taught by the Lord and his disciples. This translation, together with the study aid <em>What Has Religion Done for Mankind? </em>is a remarkable means of bringing spiritual health to those seeking it. These two books constitute the offer to be made during the month of May. The contribution for this excellent combination is only $2. Obtain it and present it to others at every opportunity, and so share in new world service, reporting your activity to the local company of Jehovah’s witnesses, or to this office, at the close of the month.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Is it proper for men to tip their hats to women?—G. S., Missouri.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Some say hat-tipping started in the days of armored knights. In a book on customs we read: “In the presence of his superior officer the ordinary soldier would indicate his inferiority by removing his protecting helmet. Until the day that armor was laid aside forever no man dared appear helmeted before his king. Again habit became custom, and when equals met each knight removed his metal casque out of respect to the other.” Another book on the subject indicates it started even before that time: “Some authorities suppose that this custom did not originate until the days of chivalry and knighthood during the Middle Ages, but there is evidence that it was common among the Greeks, Romans and certain other ancient peoples. At any rate, it is believed that later it became customary to remove the headgear to show deference to a superior or as a mark of respect to a person of distinction. It was only a step further to lift the headdress as an act of politeness or gallantry to ladies. After the introduction of men’s hats a few centuries ago, raising the hat or completely removing it became a general method of greeting women. The practice retains some of its earlier significance and many people still take off their hats to salute distinguished persons of either sex. Respect for the national flag is shown in the same manner.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Incidentally, not only is patriotic significance given to this gesture as shown by its being done for the flag, but also religious significance is accorded to it in that Catholic men tip their hats when they pass the Catholic church. They do this as an act of worship toward the bread and wine that is inside the church and which according to their belief becomes the actual flesh and blood of Christ. So in doing this they believe they are paying homage to Jesus Christ, who they think is inside the church in the consecrated wafer.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Man and woman were not created equal in power and glory; the man came first and was given special prerogatives. As Jehovah is the head over his wifely organization, and as Christ is the head over his espoused church, so the man is the head over the woman. It is the woman that is commanded to show respect and recognition of the man’s position of headship, and women who rebel at it are not so much rebelling against men as they are against God.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:16-1:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:2-46:11:10" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 11:2-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:33-49:5:33" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Eph. 5:33</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But in his world Satan has reversed matters. Starting in Eden, he has pushed the woman ahead of the man, exalted her above man and used her to bring about the downfall of men dedicated to Jehovah. He has flouted God by reversing the position of the sexes. But he is very subtle about it, camouflaging his work under the guise of harmless custom. Many customs are harmless, but when they contradict a theocratic principle Satan is behind it to discredit God. He is a past master at such deception. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:14-47:11:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:14</a>) In this particular matter of hat-tipping he appeals to the vanity of women and the so-called gentlemanly qualities of men, and any man who does not comply with the subtle custom is considered crude and discourteous, disrespectful of womanhood. So out of a fear of what others may think the majority fall into conformity.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:25-20:29:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 29:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">To refrain from tipping the hat to a woman does not mean one disrespects her. Frequently it is the ones who are excessively courteous and gallant to women who show the least respect for womanhood. They use these flattering gestures and forms of outward courtesy hypocritically, as an opening wedge for improper advances <span id="page255" class="pageNum" data-no="255" data-before-text="255"></span>that ultimately show disrespect and lead to misuse of women. It is not good to flatter people, to turn their head; it is to their harm. Specifically, why would a woman want this special show of respect from a man? One woman said in response to this question: “You don’t know how important it makes a woman feel to have a man tip his hat to her.” That is sufficient reason for Christians to refrain from the custom. It is not in the interests of the individual to make him feel important, whether the individual is male or female.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Some might argue that the friendly nod of the head came from the practice of bowing—but the nod is given regardless of sex, by both men and women. It does not exalt the woman. If hat-tipping were done by both men and women to each other, as mutual greeting and show of respect for each other, at least it would not be exalting one above the other. When a customary show of respect is performed between men as well as between man and woman, when it does not set the woman apart for special honor because of her sex, then it does not seem Scripturally objectionable. Hat removal would be too inconvenient for the woman? Then why is it the man that is supposed to rise when a woman enters a room or comes to or leaves the table, and never the woman? Is it too inconvenient again? Is she pinned to the chair, as the hat is pinned to her head? What custom does exist whereby women show respect to men? The absence of any is not just by chance, but is by satanic design to untheocratically elevate the woman above the man. In many ways Satan has taken the woman from the position assigned her by God, taken her from the home and its duties and put her into politics and commerce and religious leadership, and thereby caused much of the modern breakdown on the family front.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:4-58:13:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 13:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:20-66:2:20" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Rev. 2:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The surface courtesies that are flattering to human vanity are not what real Christian women want; instead they cherish the respect and love of one Christian toward another, and which are shown in weightier ways than the untheocratic customs of Satan’s lustful world. Both men and women should stay in the place God assigned them, in human relationships and divine worship. Only such as are content with these assigned places will live in the new world. Open or subtly disguised creature worship and exaltation will have no place there. It has no place with true Christians now.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"><strong>● What did Jesus mean when he said Christians had to hate their father and mother?—C. D., California.</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">This instruction is given at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:26-42:14:26" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 14:26</a> (<em>NW</em>): “If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own soul, he cannot be my disciple.” Jesus’ words were addressed to his followers who would take up the “torture stake” just as he did, as shown in the next <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:27-42:14:27" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Lu 14 verse 27</a>. The hate was to include the individual’s own soul or life, and not just the members of his family. Now what do the anointed followers of Jesus Christ do? To go down in sacrificial death with him, what do they do about their human soul? By agreeing to sacrifice it they are hating it, are they not? Jesus said: “He that finds his soul will lose it, and he that loses his soul for my sake will find it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:39-40:10:39" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 10:39</a>, <em>NW</em>) They hate their soul, they lose it, let go of it; they agree to its being sacrificed and forever afterward they forego all hopes of living in earthly life in the new world paradise. Jesus said they had to put on the same level as their soul their earthly relations. They must be willing to leave them forever, leave the earth and go to heaven, and never let father, mother, brother, sister, wife, children or even their own earthly life interfere with their following the Word and will of God. They hate earthly relatives and their own life to the extent of being willing to sacrifice them if that be God’s will and never allowing them or their own life to interfere with faithful performance of their conditions with Jehovah God. So it does not mean we are to hate father and mother in the usual sense of the term, no more than we are to hate our own body. We love ourselves; we are to similarly love our neighbors, including the members of our household. But nothing is to stand in the way of the anointed followers of Christ leaving earthly scenes and earthly ties to go to heaven and reign with Christ.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><strong>● Do the “other sheep” have as much of the Lord’s spirit as the anointed remnant, and as clear an understanding of Jehovah’s purposes as the anointed have?—A. M., Colorado.</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">If they are filled with holy spirit, how could any others have more than that? If a container is full, how can it hold more? Both classes must be equally faithful, under the same trying conditions. <span id="page256" class="pageNum" data-no="256" data-before-text="256"></span>It is only by Jehovah’s spirit that any of us can stand. So if the “other sheep” do not have as much of the Lord’s spirit, yet have to endure the same tests and prove the same high quality of faithfulness as the anointed, they would be operating under a great disadvantage in the test of integrity. Jehovah God does not so handicap them, but gives them equal help for similar tests. Faithful men of old had Jehovah’s spirit, to write inspired scriptures, to cure lepers, to raise the dead, to cause rain or drought, to pull down pagan temples, to slay lions and bears, and to perform many other powerful works possible only with the help of God’s active force. Though not of the anointed class, they were filled with holy spirit.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The “other sheep” today perform the same preaching work as the remnant, under the same trying conditions, and manifest the same faithfulness and integrity. They feed at the same spiritual table, eating the same food, absorbing the same truths. Being of the earthly class, with earthly hopes and a keen interest in earthly things, they might interest themselves more in scriptures relating to earthly conditions in the new world; whereas the anointed remnant, with heavenly hopes and strong personal interest in the things of the spirit, might study more diligently those things in God’s Word. So because of these different personal interests the two classes might show greater interest in different features of the message, and comprehend more in those fields because of their special study of them; yet the fact remains that the same truths and the same understanding are available to both classes, and it is just how the individuals apply themselves in study that determines the comprehension of heavenly and earthly things they acquire. The Lord’s spirit is available in equal portions to both classes, and knowledge and understanding are offered equally to both, with equal opportunities for absorbing it.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">So rather than the determining factor’s being whether one is of the anointed or other sheep class or not, it lies with the individual himself. One may be more willing to receive the Lord’s spirit and its guidance in his life than another, who may be quenching the spirit by not walking wholly according to its guidance. One may spend more time studying or naturally have greater mental capacities for learning than another, who may neglect study and mental training.</p>

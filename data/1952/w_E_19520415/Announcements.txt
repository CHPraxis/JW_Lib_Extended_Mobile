HEALING FOR LIFE IN THE NEW WORLD
“On this side of the river and on that side there were trees of life . . . And the leaves of the trees were for the curing of the nations.” (Rev. 22:2, NW) Note, these trees are in evidence while there is still need for “curing” or “healing” the nations, that is, people of all nations. Actually the provision for life and healing is that which flows from the Word of God. (Prov. 3:18) The New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures makes access to this “tree” more readily available. Why? Because it offers in understandable English the life-giving truths taught by the Lord and his disciples. This translation, together with the study aid What Has Religion Done for Mankind? is a remarkable means of bringing spiritual health to those seeking it. These two books constitute the offer to be made during the month of May. The contribution for this excellent combination is only $2. Obtain it and present it to others at every opportunity, and so share in new world service, reporting your activity to the local company of Jehovah’s witnesses, or to this office, at the close of the month.
WILL RELIGION MEET THE WORLD CRISIS?
The seriousness of the world situation has caused many persons to review religion and its claims as a solution of the pressing problems involved. The role that religion has played in the past, as well as its present status, calls for unbiased consideration. The booklet Will Religion Meet the World Crisis? gives candid consideration to these matters. No unwarranted claims are made and no unfounded assertions are expressed. A well-presented and amply supported analysis of the subject is set down, which leads to a reasonable and satisfying conclusion. All thinking persons should read it. Available on a contribution of 5c.

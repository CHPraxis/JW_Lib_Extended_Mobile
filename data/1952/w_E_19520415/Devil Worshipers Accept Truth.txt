Devil Worshipers Accept Truth
● About a year ago a number of us were preaching the good news of God’s kingdom from door to door in a certain village in the Calabar province of Nigeria. I was turned away from the first door with “I am not a Christian, I am for Ekpo”. (Ekpo is a secret, devil-worshiping society.) After trying in vain to break through this shell I went to the next door, where I got the same response. Suddenly we heard a loud shout and almost immediately we were surrounded by about thirty young men, armed with machetes, who had jumped out of the bush. They were Ekpo members and tried to frighten us by menacing gestures. Seeing our complete lack of fear some went away, but others seized us and dragged us back to where we had left the other ministers. They mocked and jeered us as we went and expressed their determination that no further preaching would be done in the neighborhood. However, to their disappointment they found that preachers had already covered the rest of the village and had left literature with a number of the people. They then assembled in a compound belonging to an Apostolic Church member and took counsel on what to do next. But Bible questions were asked by this man, and we had the privilege of answering from the Bible in the presence of these devil worshipers. Today, more than a year later, the once-Apostolic Church member is going from house to house himself, as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. More than eighty of the one-time mockers have turned up for the four public talks recently given in this same village. And now there are fourteen Christian ministers who are preaching regularly where a year ago there was only one. A new congregation has been formed. Truly “Jehovah knows those who belong to him”.—From a circuit servant in Nigeria.

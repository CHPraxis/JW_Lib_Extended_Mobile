<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When the Almighty Creator, Jehovah, commissioned his servant Isaiah to “Go, and tell this people, . . . Until cities be waste without inhabitant”, Jehovah did not force Isaiah to obey. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:9-23:6:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 6:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:11-23:6:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 11</a>, <em>AS</em>) No, Isaiah volunteered gladly; obediently he responded and offered himself. Today, as in Israel, when a like condition exists in Christendom that calls’ for a similar message, there are persons who willingly follow Jehovah’s commands, and these give the warning message from God’s Word. Whatever may be the response, their kindly purpose is to announce the kingdom of salvation and to give advance warning of the evil to follow a rejection of that kingdom. Why not associate with an organization so engaged, abandon doomed Christendom and turn to Jehovah? In view of the divine command, there is no need to hesitate or wait. The time is limited. So take the wise and profitable course, engage in this telling work, with Jehovah’s witnesses and offer the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine on a subscription basis of $1 per year. Share in this world-wide work starting in the month of January. Then report your activity to the local company of Jehovah’s witnesses, or send it in to us.</p>

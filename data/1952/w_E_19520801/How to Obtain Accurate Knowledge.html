<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Mentioned on the next page is the special effort to be made during September to introduce an exceptionally fine combination of literature for religious study. It is the <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures </em>and the book <em>What Has Religion Done for Mankind? </em>The first listed is a modern-day rendering <span id="page480" class="pageNum" data-no="480" data-before-text="480"></span>of the writings of the apostles and disciples of Christ, closely following the most authentic manuscript copies. The other, a Bible study aid, gives information about the major non-Christian religions of today and shows the superiority of the Bible truths. The two will prove invaluable in learning of Godâ€™s purposes. The combination, postpaid, $2.</p>

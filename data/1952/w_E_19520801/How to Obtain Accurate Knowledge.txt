How to Obtain Accurate Knowledge
Mentioned on the next page is the special effort to be made during September to introduce an exceptionally fine combination of literature for religious study. It is the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures and the book What Has Religion Done for Mankind? The first listed is a modern-day rendering of the writings of the apostles and disciples of Christ, closely following the most authentic manuscript copies. The other, a Bible study aid, gives information about the major non-Christian religions of today and shows the superiority of the Bible truths. The two will prove invaluable in learning of Godâ€™s purposes. The combination, postpaid, $2.

“BE TRANSFORMED BY MAKING YOUR MIND OVER”—Rom. 12:2, NW.
Aware of the transforming power of God’s Word of truth, Jehovah’s witnesses and their associates world-wide desire to have this power work in their behalf. It aids them to make their minds over, no longer fashioning their lives after this present system of things, but learning to know and to do the “complete will of God”. Jehovah’s witnesses want to assist others also to gain life-giving knowledge. During September they will collectively put forth a special effort to make calls on those who have obtained literature published by Jehovah’s witnesses and encourage them to start home Bible studies. To this end they will present the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures and the book What Has Religion Done for Mankind? on a contribution of only $2. The New World Translation and the companion book are of unequaled value in the field of Bible study and research, as they give in understandable present-day English the sacred secrets of God’s Word. You, too, may learn these precious truths and have a share in passing them on to others. Send your inquiries to the branch office in your country. See list on second page.

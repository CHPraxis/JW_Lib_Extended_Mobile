<p><span class="font33" style="font-weight:bold;">Free Speech—for Ministers Too</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">W</span><span class="font0">HEN law ceases to protect law-abiding citizens it is either a bad law or it has fallen into bad hands. The ancient psalmist warned of God-defying men in places of authority who would even seek to stifle the preached Word of God behind the pious cloak of law, even claiming the blessing of God while doing so. He asked: “Can evil rulers have thee for an ally, who work us injury by law, who make an onset upon honest men, and doom the innocent to death?” (Psalm 94:20, 21, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt) </span><span class="font0">Vicious conspirators with law carried the principle to the highest extreme in framing the Son of God thereby. Afterward they haled into court his intimate followers and sought to still their preaching that was “upon the basis of Jesus’ name”; but were told by these fighters for liberty, “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.” (Matthew 26:59-66; Acts 5:40, 29, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,)</span><span class="font0"> In modem times totalitarian states have drenched carefully schemed laws with Christian blood. But, worst of all, in even democratic, Christianity-professing United States, the same principle, though to less violent ends, has been leveled against Christian activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">More than twenty years ago in Green River, Wyoming, there was bom a law designed ostensibly to control house-to-house peddlers. Shamefully, numerous municipalities throughout the land have since fashioned similar ordinances, outlawing uninvited door-to-door callers, and then aimed them against itinerant ministers of the gospel. In the ensuing fight for civil rights the Christian minority, Jehovah’s witnesses, came to' the fore as champions of the right to speak in the apostolic manner, “publicly and from house to house,” without asking for the privilege. In the words of Paul the apostle they rose in courts all over the country to say: “We are not peddlers of the word of God.” (Acts 20:20; 2 Corinthians 2:17, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,)</span><span class="font0"> This fight interested more and more of the watching populace as the fact became clear that the rights of all were intertwined with the rights of these few. The pace quickened when two of Jehovah’s witnesses, Elsie McCready and Lillian Lawson of Denver, Colorado, were arrested on such “Green River” basis in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and it appeared that a showdown fight would follow in the ordinance’s home state. Arrest occurred while these ministers were attending a circuit assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in June, 1951; and convictions in the Cheyenne Police Court were appealed to the District Court in November.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The defendants, although not previously invited by the householders to call, contended with the apartment house owner and the police, who demanded that they stop preaching, that they were not subject to the ordinance because ministers are not solicitors or peddlers. Notwithstanding their remonstration they were arrested and prosecuted. Stipulation was made that Cheyenne’s Green River ordinance was not enforced to halt unsolicited calls by the Community Chest, Red Cross, other local charities and clergymen who called at doors of the general public or their parishioners without prior invitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The prosecution appealed in questionable logic to the fact that the ordinance’s long endurance proves its worth. Cheyenne’s city attorney alleged that the defendants’ asking for contributions in return for literature brought them under the terms of commercialism stipulated by the ordinance, However, he failed completely to establish a case and Judge Thompson rendered a swift judgment favoring freedom of speech—for ministers too—after which he added an opinion from which the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“This is a Christian organization and fortunately in this Country we have most of these organizations that attempt to deal with spiritual questions are Christian organizations and this is one branch of Christian work. . . . There is a Green River ordinance but it is the impression of this Court, its viewpoint as a matter of public policy that the greatest freedom possible under the law should be extended to religious organizations. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“I am inclined now to say that in the opinion of this Court that this ordinance ought to be interpreted rather as a commercial activity controlling ordinance rather than a religious activity controlling ordinance. If we interpret it as a religious controlling ordinance, . . . then we are going to run right into these Constitutional provisions that have been mentioned. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“But I think it is very important that perhaps some activity of this kind be permitted. . . . Why? Because I feel that from the mouths of babes truth may come and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I listened. And this activity here while it is annoying, takes people’s time, keeps them away from the people on the radio or conversation with a neighbor who has come in and talking about some mutual interest yet I believe in view of the importance of spiritual understanding maybe it is a good thing that we do not curtail this kind of activity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This opinion reflects good judicial sense and, more important, a,proper respect for true godliness and Christian worship. It is certainly a much wiser position than that expressed by the Sunday issue, November 25, 1951, of the Rock Springs (Wyoming) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rocket-Miner,</span><span class="font0">namely: “There are many who believe that this religious organization has been chosen to carry the ball for more powerful commercial interests, It is believed that attempts may be made to have the results of these preliminary cases used as precedents in having the law declared unconstitutional and thereby paving the way for large-scale house-to-house selling, soliciting, and peddling.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rightly, some of Jehovah’s witnesses locally sent to the paper a letter which was published and which flatly denied this charge. The letter called attention to the Christian, charitable purposes for which the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is incorporated, to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus. Respecting treatment of those spreading this gospel, Judge Thompson’s course reflects the wisdom of the first-century legal mind, Gamaliel, who said of the apostles of Christ: “Do not meddle with these men, but let them alone; (because, if this scheme and this work is from men, it will be overthrown; but if it is from God, you will not be able to overthrow them;) otherwise, you may perhaps be found fighters actually against God.”—Acts 5:38,39, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">by and large “essentially ^-^2 ignorant of the history and literature of the religious tradition to which they claim allegiance'’. And commenting on the foregoing Harry Emerson Fosdtck, one of America’s foremost clergymen, states: “Concern about this matter, especially in regard to our public schools, has been mounting rapidly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In an effort to combat this religious illiteracy many well-meaning persons advocate that children be released during the regular public school hours to take religious instruction, a plan which had its beginning back in 1913-1914. At present its advocates claim that about 3,000 communities in the United States have such a plan in operation, affecting some three million school children in 46 out of 48 states. Also that upward of 25 cities with populations above 250,000 make use of the released-time provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Unequivocally for the plan is the Roman Catholic Church. Opposed to it is American Jewry, the American Civil Liberties Union, Ethical Culture Societies, etc. Divided on the justice and wisdom of the plan are Protestants, educators and state courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The New York State court ruled in 1925 that such a plan violated the Constitution. However, two years later that verdict was overruled. Since then on nine different occasions this matter has been brought before it, and each time it has ruled in favor</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Mus Instruction r&gt;\\</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">\ \ of released time. Just a few rj \ i years ago the Circuit Court |J । of Missouri ruled the oppo-_ / / site; that released time was &amp;/ / a violation of the constitu-<sub>z</sub> / tional principle of separa-/ tion of church and state. In</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1948 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled, in JfcCoftum v. Board of Education, that the Constitution forbade the practice of releasing school children for the taking of religious instruction within the school building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arguments Pro and Con</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Arguing for released time the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Digest^</span><span class="font0"> May, 1950, stated: “Released-time advocates say the child is under his parents' control 24 hours a day, whether he is at home, at church or at school.” In the denial of released time it sees an attempt to undermine the authority of the home, E. S. Greenbaum, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation^</span><span class="font0"> February 9, 1952, argues for “the parent’s right to choose”. To forbid released time “would prevent parents from fully exercising their rights to give their children religious instruction in the faith of their choosing*'. He claims that teachers should excuse children for religious instruction just as they do for music lessons or for religious holidays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The February 1951 issue of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Education </span><span class="font0">featured religious education and in “The Case for Released Time” argued that Church and State “must co-operate on behalf of the children” and khat “if parents have the right to send their children to private or parochial schools for full time, they certainly have the right to send them for one hour a week”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But is the child under the parent’s control 24 hours each day? Not at all. The state demands that the child receive atn elementary education in the “three R’s”, etc., and no parent may exercise control of his child in such a way as to deny its child such an education. The state decides what the child must learn five hours each day, for five days a week during the school term, and unless matters of conscience are involved the parent may not interfere. And since 'religion is wholly exempt from cognizance by Civil Society’, according to James Madison, it is difficult to see how church and state can co-operate in teaching religion to children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">True, parents have the right to send their children to private or parochial schools if they so wish, but they have no right to demand that the state’s public and secular schools co-operate with them in teaching religion to their children. The state is not denying the parents the right to teach religion to their children; it merely states that it will not co-operate therewith and that during school hours. The state is not concerned with whether a child gets religious training. That is the business of the parent and the church. If it were to assume that responsibility it would have to decide which religion, decide the standard of the teachers of religion. Could it do that properly for all religions? Could it do it without doing injustice to some? Of course not!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Releasing children from public schools to take religious training is boring a hole or making a door in the wall of separation between church and state. It is a case of the church enlisting the powers of the state for its own ends. The state can compel children to go to secular and public schools; but it cannot teach religion nor compel children to study religion. The church, on the other hand, can teach religion but it is wholly without power to compel anyone to study it Clearly it was the purpose of the founding fathers of the United States to keep compulsion and religion separated; to do otherwise would bring two great evils upon the people, that of inflicting injustice on some of the people and that of abetting hypocrisy. By releasing children from public school, where they are compelled to go, on the condition that they take religious training elsewhere, is utilizing the compulsive powers of the state, intended solely for secular and general ends, for special and religious purposes. Such is clearly a violation of the principle of the Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Basic Question</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The mere question of whether the religious instruction is held on school property is thus seen to have no bearing on the matter—the position taken by the Circuit Court of Missouri: “The differences are inconsequential. The controlling fact in both cases is that the public schools are used to aid sectarian groups to disseminate their doctrines. Whether these sectarian classes are conducted in school buildings or elsewhere can make no difference, since attendance upon them during compulsory school hours is deemed attendance at school. Failure to exercise supervision over the instruction of religion and to require the proper attendance records does not make the program legal; it merely indicates laxity on the part of the school authorities. The fact that any sect may participate in this program is immaterial; the public school cannot be used to aid one religion, to aid all religions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The mere fact that religious education is denied during school hours is not an injustice nor does it work hardship upon the children. The government dictates the hours and what may or may not be taught, since it pays the bills. Such is right so long as no questions of conscience are involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this matter of released time it is not a matter of conscience or principle but solely of convenience. All the state asks is for 11 per cent of the child’s time to give it secular education. Surely in the 89 per cent left the church and parent can find one-half of one per cent of time, or one hour weekly, for religious instruction. Educators opposed to the released-time provision point out that while subjects raught in schools have doubled and trebled, in recent years, not one minute has been added to school time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That the crux of the whole matter is the use of the power of compulsion of the public school, that is, of the state, to force religious education on children is apparent from the fact that the advocates of released time are unwilling to consent to dismissed time, that is, of having the entire school let out one hour earlier so that those who wish may have religious instruction while others are free to go elsewhere. No, that would not suit'the released-time advocates, for they well know that the question is not just one of time, or else they would find one hour in the remaining 143 hours each week to give the children religious instruction. They know that were they to agree to dismissed time very few children would find their way to the places where religious instruction is being offered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Disadvantages of the Plan</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The basic principle of the Constitution as applied in this matter is just. It avoids working an injustice to those who do not wish to avail themselves of religious instruction, or are unable to do so because of lack of facilities, as would be the case in very small sects. That the plan does bring with it injustices is seen from the following examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Chicago, where less than 10 per cent of the children are enrolled for released-time Instruction, principals and teachers have been instructed that “nothing significant shall be taught children not taking religious instruction so that those taking it shall not be penalized for their absence”. Apparently our religious released-time advocates are so determined to have their own way that they are willing to waste one hour of 90 per cent of the class just so one hour of instruction in religion will be given to the 10 per cent of the children availing themselves of their arrangement. In New York it is estimated that 25 per cent are enrolled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That released time does interfere with the studies of those who do not accept it has been recognized in more places than one where it was tried. In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the board of education observed that “in order to meet this problem there must be curtailment of activities in the school which are often the actual character-building agencies of the school itself”. After three years’ trial it discontinued released time because it “neither met the needs of religious education nor justified the effect upon the public school program”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rejecting the plan, the San Diego, California, Board of Education issued a report, which, among other things, stated: “8. The year’s trial of ‘Released time for religious education’ has demonstrated that the program interferes with the progress of school work during the entire day, increases the work of principals and teachers, and results in certain confusion and loss of time to all children in the grade, both those who are released and those who remain. The evidence does not show growth of character or desirable behavior beyond that of the children who did not participate in released-time program. The results do not justify a continuation or extension of the plan.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On three different occasions, the Public Education Association of New York conducted a study of the released-time setup since the plan was put into operation some ten years ago, and as a result it has consistently opposed released time. Among the weaknesses it noted were truancy increase, exertion of pressure on the part of schoolteachers to have children participate, and waste of time of both children and teachers, All of which, incidentally, clearly demonstrates that released time for religious instruction cannot be placed in the same category as the excusal of an occasional pupil for music or dancing lessons or for religious holidays such as Good Friday or Yom Kippur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Latest Example of</span></p>
<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">S. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Supreme CourVs Inconsistency</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Everson</span><span class="font0"> case the Supreme Court ruled that New Jersey's law, which provided free use of public school buses for pupils attending Catholic schools, but defiled such use to school children attending all other private or parochial schools, did not violate the principle of separation of church and state. In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">McCollum</span><span class="font0"> case it held that to hold religious classes in public schools and to use the state’s compulsory school machinery to provide classes for religious instruction by sectarian groups was in violation of that principle. In March 1952 it claimed to see no constitutional question involved in the daily reading from the Bible as practiced in New Jersey's public schools. And on April 28, 1952, it approved of the New York State’s released-time program on the basis of the fact that the classes were not held in school buildings; entirely overlooking or choosing to ignore the fact, however, that the state’s compulsory school machinery was being used to provide such classes with pupils, a thing which it expressly condemned as incompatible with the principle of separation of church and state in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">McCoUum</span><span class="font0"> case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Endeavoring to gloss over this inconsistency the majority opinion (6-3) stressed that '‘we are a religious people”, and pointed to prayers in legislative halls, reference to God in courts, Thanksgiving Day proclamations, etc. It held that the question was a matter of degree and that the First Amendment “does not say that in every and all respects there shall be separation of church and state”; and that the state “can close its doors or suspend its operations as to those who want to repair to their religious sanctuary for worship or instruction”, for “we cannot read into the Bill of Rights a philosophy hostile to religion”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The three dissenting opinions had, however, by far the better of the argument. Justice Black pointed out that the use of the state’s compulsory school machinery, which the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">McCollum</span><span class="font0"> opinion denied to sectarian groups, is &quot;exactly what the court [now] holds New York can do”. “It is only by wholly isolating the state from the religious sphere and compelling it to be completely neutral, that the freedom of each and every denomination and of all nonbelievers can be maintained.” “State help to religion injects poHtical and party prejudices into a holy field. It too often substitutes force for prayer, hate for love, persecution for persuasion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And Justice Jackson, in his dissent, among other things stated: “Here schooling is more or less suspended during ’released time’ so that nonreligious attenders will not forge ahead of the churchgoing absentees. But it serves as a temporary jail for a pupil who will not go to church.” “It is possible to hold a faith with enough confidence to believe that what should be rendered to God does not need to be decided and collected by Caesar. We start down a rough road when we begin to mix compulsory public education with compulsory Godliness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Justice Frankfurter emphasized his concurring with Jackson's dissent by adding such observations as the following: “The court relies upon the absence from the record of evidence of coercion in the operation of the system . . . but the court disregards the fact that . . . the petitioners were not allowed to make proof of it. . . . Petitioners sought an opportunity to adduce evidence in support of these allegations at an appropriate trial.... When constitutional issues turn on facts, it is a strange procedure indeed not to permit the facts to be established,” The fact that release^-time advocates would not agree to closing the schools entirely, he opined, &quot;betrays a surprising want of confidence in the inherent power of the variqus faiths to draw children tu outside sectarian classes.**</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In view of the foregoing it is apparent that the released-time program has neither logic, nor facts, nor the Constitution to support it, the Supreme Court of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding. Actually the program is an admission that the churches and the parents have failed in their efforts to teach the children religion during the 89 per cent of the time that the children are not in the public schools, and therefore they are resorting to a crutch. If the sectarian groups clamoring for released time would teach what the Bible has to say regarding parental responsibility they would not have any occasion to resort to that crutch.—Deuteronomy 6:6,7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Mama Cello, arrived from extra-mundane regions on the Island of the Sun, in the midst of Lake Titicaca. Hence, the lake had great sanctity, and on the island of their origin there was later built a temple of great beauty. They and their offspring founded the Inca dynasty and built ah empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">History, however, has it that the first Inca was chieftain of the Quechua tribe of Indians that ruled over Cuzco about A.D. 1200. He was worshiped as the Son of the Sun. About 100 years before the arrival of conquistador Pizarro the ninth Inca had extended his empire as far north as Ecua-</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">this mighty empire, for there was no written language, not even hieroglyphics, as a dependable source of information. Their system of communication was by knotted cords made of llama or alpaca wool, dyed in varying colors, the significance of which was known to the magistrates. This </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">quipu </span><span class="font0">was knotted in such a way as to represent the decimal system and was fastened at close intervals along the principal strand. Thus messages regarding crops, taxes col-</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">lected, or the advance of an enemy could</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">be spelled out by trained runners. Interpretations of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">guipu</span><span class="font0"> as well ns the history depend on the memory or imagination of those interviewed by the first Spanish chroniclers and there exists much ambiguity with respect to dates and events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Huayna Capac, the last unconquered Inca, died in December of 1527, and his illegitimate son, Atahualpa, set himself up as Inca, aided and abetted by the army in Quito, Ecuador. In Cuzco the legal son, Inti Cusi Hualpa, or better known as simply Huascar, became Inca. The four years of civil war that followed resulted in triumph for Atahualpa, but he had only a year to enjoy his victory as he basked at the delightful hot springs of Cajamarca. On September 24,1532, he was invited to visit Pizarro, but on arriving as honored guest of the Spaniards, his troops were hewed down by well-equipped soldiers, and Atahualpa was seized and imprisoned. Recognizing the enemy’s thirst for treasure, Atahualpa offered to fill his prison room with riches in exchange for his release, a bargain that was readily accepted by Pizarro. The royal command went forth. Gold and jewels poured in, even gold-encrusted walls of sacred temples being stripped to meet the demand. The room was gorged with treasure, but it only served to show Pizarro the power and therefore the danger of this empire to his own fond dreams of domination. On a trumped-up petty charge, Atahualpa was condemned and executed in the public plaza of Cajamarca. Thus Cuzco, once holy city of the Incas, became subjected to the plundering, conquering Spaniards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Skilled Stone Masons</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Incas were skilled as stone masons. The buildings of the second Inca period were patterned by absolutely symmetrical stones with smooth polished surfaces joined with such uncanny precision that a penknife cannot be inserted between them. Cuzco’s museums are enthralling. Outstanding among the exhibits are the mummies, their positions of burial being similar to that before birth, elbows resting on knees. Many of these mummies show evidence of scalp operations where a silver plate replaced the part removed. Also the surgical instruments used to perform such delicate operations are on display. Some years ago, in this same city of Cuzco, an American surgeon performed a successful operation with these same instruments, highly commending their flexibility and adaptability. To think that these surgical instruments were used during the thirteenth to the fifteenth century!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Inca fortress of Sacsahuaman, meaning, in the Quechua tongue, “Falcon Rock,” is truly a renowned fortress, which rises in stony majesty over the city, and evokes the most extravagant adjectives as its ruins stand in broken, yet arrogant grandeur, How its creators came by the science of such military fortification, with what tools they cut out such gigantic stones, and especially by what means they dragged them to the desired position, are questions that still plead for an answer. The “Falcon Rock*’ is a combination fortress and palace with three tiers of zigzag construction that leave one gasping to examine soiree of those monoliths, which are said to weigh as much as 130 tons apiece. Whether it is Inca or pre-Inca is still a subject of debate among archaeologists and historians, but a definitely undebatable fact is the foresight of those Incas in their choice of the most advantageous positions for their fortresses, and this bears mute testimony to a lost culture and civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Not far is La Piedra Cansada, or “Tired Stone”. This stone is said to weigh over 1,000 tons and was to have been part of the main wall of the fortress, but in the process of orientation 300 workers were crushed to death by it. After that it was [eft strictly alone. The fortress was built by 25,000 men during a period of fifty years. It was garrisoned by the Spaniards in 1533, taken by the armies of Inca Manco in the Indian uprising in 1535, and recaptured soon after by the Spaniards, who afterward maintained a garrison there through the sixteenth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Peculiar to Inca-land are the herds of llamas, quaint animals very aptly described by one writer as “miniature, incorrectly-designed camels”. They seem to be disdainful of everything in general and nothing in particular. Natives contend that llamas will stubbornly refuse to accept a load of more than fifty kilos, or 113 pounds, and if forced to do so, they sit down or spit at their would-be oppressors. They are very profitable animals, not only for their wool and burden-bearing capacity, but also because they eat so little and can go as long as five days without water. Their droppings are used for fuel, firewood being very expensive. One should not speak disparagingly of so worthy a creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1911 and 1912 Hiram Bingham, famous archaeologist and Yale University professor, discovered and unearthed the “Lost City of the Incas”, situated on top of towering Macchupicchu, which means “Old Peak”. The scenery here is breathtaking. Rio de Janeiro has only one jagged peak. Macchupicchu has half a dozen rising out of the midst of overpowering natural beauty. The yawning gorge below is said to equal the Grand Canyon. The mist plays queer tricks with the mountains, first becoming a beautiful frame and then wrapping the whole scene in swaddling clothes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Little is known of the history of this stone city, but the evidence of its past grandeur bespeaks an unusual people with a vast knowledge of architecture, agriculture, and engineering. With stone implements an important city was carved and quarried out of a granite mountaintop, surrounded by scores of terraced gardens, and water was channeled into this almost impregnable citadel. A labyrinth of roofless white buildings of smooth polished stones perfectly joined together blends in silent harmony with the mountains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The stone city had quarters for the military and the intellectuals, for the religious and the workers. The residence of the nobility, the apartment of the princesses, was built with stone staircases leading to the Priest’s Divan and the King’s tomb. Farther on is the city prison and a special place of punishment for erring women, cunningly contrived to break the neck. From the solar observatory, at the very top of the ruins, one can see a panorama of natural grandeur that begs description, mountains piled on mountains, steep crags and perpendicular cliffs with drops of thousands of feet to the gorge below, and wild orchids of indescribable colors vying for attention. Here, too, is the Reloj del Sol, an immense sundial carved out of a single huge stone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">System of Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Incas had a wonderful system. The head of each family was given a piece of land for cultivation and for each son bom an additional plot, but for a daughter, a plot only half the size. Upon the death of the owner the land was returned to the community. Most interesting is the fact that Inca rule required that all the land be returned for redistribution at the end of every fifty years, so that none could lord it over his neighbor. The three major crimes were laziness, lying and theft. These called for the death penalty. Rigid, but generous, were the laws that governed the subjects of the Inca empire which once embraced fourteen million people. Their system of marriage afforded little opportunity for love matches. On a set day in the year a festival was proclaimed and all youths who had reached their majority of twenty-four years were lined up opposite the maidens of eighteen years in the main plaza of the city. The Inca himself walked through the file and, grabbing at random the hand of a male prospect, joined it to that of the nearest female. This simple ceremony granted them all the rights of matrimony. There was a similar ceremony performed by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cacique,</span><span class="font0"> or chief of the tribe, on behalf .of those of lower rank, the Inca personally caring only for those of the nobility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the time of the harvest the Inca himself began the work as an example to his subjects. All of this reminds one of Jehovah’s Jubilee system that operated in Israel under theocratic government Then a glorious fiftieth year of redistribution, restoration and plenty crowned their efforts. Today God’s glorious theocracy and its nearness are discussed in Inca-land, perhaps for the first time. The people are told that in the new world without end there will be no Spanish invaders, no thirst for gold, nor inglorious execution to satiate such thirst, but instead “they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid”. (Micah 4:4) Legend and mystery will yield to truth and reality. As one views this dead city in a setting of living beauty, a prayer of gratitude is offered to Jehovah that the &quot;mountain of the Lord’s house” is now being established on the top of the mountains, and that people of all nations are seeking refuge therein.</span></p>

<p><span class="font27" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vatican City, 10, (AJ&gt;.)—Pope Pius XII J. said that there was a constant need of study- \ Ing the Bible in order that “the eternal truths ? contained in It may illuminate and warm the / minds and hearts of men”. The pope spoke &gt;&nbsp;before a group of forty members of the So- &gt;&nbsp;ciety of Old Testament Studies, of Great Britain, who were received by the High Pontiff In &lt;&nbsp;a special audience. Said group, comprised of / Protestants and Roman Catholics, has just '■ completed a series of conferences and studies \ in the Institute of the Pontifical Library in &lt;' 1</span><span class="font27"><sup>1</sup></span></p>

The pope said: “The garden of Saint Chrysostom is beautiful, but even more beautiful is the study of the Holy Scripture. In the meadows we And flowers, but these rapidly wither; tn the Holy Scripture we find words that will endure forever. The reading of the Holy Scripture provides the soul with advantages that have an eternal value.” But those spiritual advantages, said the pope, “will be genuine and solid in proportion to the certain and exact knowledge of what the holy author has said.” The high pontiff added: &quot;hence the constant need of devout students, who with an untiring eagerness to make a wise and judicious use of the vast mechanism of the Biblical teachings related to philosophy, geography, archaeological history, textual criticism, and natural sciences, may succeed in making the eternal truths shine with all their splendor to illuminate the minds and the hearts of men.” Then the pope said: “When men have searched and found peace with God, they will also And the way to enjoy true peace among the nations.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">I</span><span class="font0">T SEEMS improbable that the bathing suit will get larger and impossible for it to get smaller. What will next year’s styles be? Expert designers predict changes. Manufacturers reserve comment. They are careful not to predict which way the swimming suit is going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The modem bathing suit had its start some forty-three years ago, when Annette Kellerman tossed away the “extras’* for a form-fitting suit. Her creation shocked the world. She very simply stated: “I want to swim. And I can’t swim wearing more stuff than you hang on a clothesline.” And swim she did, all up and down the country’s beaches—incidentally, of course, displaying her new bathing suit. For this she was denounced as a wanton and dark- predictions were painted concerning the future of America. Despite the strong opposition to her style of bathing suit the “new creation” stuck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The “new look” of 1909 was a suit with trousers two inches above the knees and sleeves that hung a little below the shoulders. A far cry from the G string that is worn today. Before the turn of the century bathing suits were costumes capable of shielding one through a Canadian winter. To be in fashion on the beach meant to be dressed in trousers, skirt, blouse, long stockings, shoes and a hat with a knitted tassel. Also a cape with the wearer’s name or initials on the back was worn. To swim with this paraphernalia on was not much of a pleasure. Still as far back as the Romans and the Assyrians the costume worn on the street was used for bathing. The toga was just as long and full.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bathing and Regulations</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ocean bathing did not become popular until the late nineteenth century. Prior thereto, swimming was confined to pools. These pools were originally walled about to save passers-by the embarrassment of seeing bathers. Those walls also afforded women bathers protection from “Peeping Toms”. But even with such protection the suits that were furnished had an apron fringe at the bottom for men, and baggy bloomers and knee-length skirts for women. The law required the skirt to extend within “four inches of the patella” because of conservative public opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The rules for safeguarding public morals and decency on municipal bathing beaches, promulgated in 1917 with due solemnity by the American Association of Park Superintendents, was reported in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The American City</span><span class="font0"> of May of that year, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“No all-white or flesh-colored suits, permitted, or suits that expose the chest lower than a line drawn on a level with the arm pits.” For the ladies: “Blouse and bloomer suits may be worn, with or without stockings provided bloomers are full and not shorter than four inches above the knee.” And for the men: “Men’s suits must</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">have skirt ar skirt effect, or shirt worn outside of. trunks, except when flannel knee pants with belt and fly front are used. Trunks must not be shorter than four inches above the knee, and the skirt or shirt must not be shorter than two inches above the bottom of the trunks.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">About the end of World War I, men’s bathing suits took a modern swing. The shirt had a wide neck and the trousers were considerably shorter. Women began to ape their men. Their suits got briefer, though they retained the skirts and somewhat higher neckline. They did, however, throw away their long black stockings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Around 1923 another howl went up and down the land, cries of moral indignation, and again the future of America was being weighed in the balances and sealed by such who insisted on wearing the new elastic wool bathing suit. The suit clung close to the body, especially when wet. About this time too, Hollywood turned a new leaf in styles and went in for the form-fitting industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another seven years, and more drastic changes were made. Some brave manufacturer dropped the skirt off men’s suits. Women’s suits retained them for the most part. The top of men’s suits took the shape of our modem T shirt. Then, from France, came the shocker of them all—two-piece suits for women! “What’s this world coming to?” people were saying. But a glance at today’s beaches shows the &quot;oldsters” and youngsters alike enjoy the two-piece bathing suit. Styles were being revolutionized about as quickly as public opinion could be molded to accept them. Another courageous manufacturer came out with something different, a man’s suit with a detachable top. A zipper held it to the trunks, but if a swimmer wanted, he could take it off. Many of them did, and some of those were arrested for indecent expo</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">sure. But men insisted on topless bathing suits. The increased demand revolutionized the entire industry so that today it is difficult for a man to buy a suit with a top.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Bikini</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some Frenchman remarked: “Iz zer anything about zee body or zee love to conzeal?” And with this the French Riviera suit, the Bikini, was bom. The two-piece women’s suits became not only daring—they were almost nonexistent. It is hard to imagine, but neither the top nor the bottom piece is much wider than a man’s double-sized hatband and they could easily be placed in an ordinary pamphletsized manila envelope and be mailed almost anywhere in the world for a dime. The Bikini did not become a sensation. The suit made ladies appear considerably more naked than nothing at all. Only those with the most sensational figure could wear them with ease. But even the shapely women cared little for them, because the tops would fall down without the slightest provocation, such as simply by exhaling. The bottoms would ride up, making an already revolting condition even worse. Or they would ride down too, showing unattractive areas. Abdominal scars were exposed. This has caused many women to shun the suit. As one observer commented: “Wish French people over twenty-five would get themselves some American-type bathing suits. The human body can be mighty revolting after age sags in.” Although not all women look the way they would like to in bathing suits, they do, however, enjoy wearing a suit that is a little flattering anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Toward the close of the “forties” a new sensation was created. For about sixty centuries clothes have been draped, tied, buttoned, pinned and buckled on the human form, but for the first time in history were arrangements made to glue clothing to the flesh; Strapless, wireless, and back-less tops for the bathing suit were made. The cups are held to the body by a thin but strong adhesive provided around their rims. They are said to be durable, dependable and offer the usual support yet are painlessly removable. The claim is made that these cups will stick even though the wearer plunges from a ten-foot diving board. Those who have worn them say they are left with an unusual sense of freedom. This new type of top gives the wearer a startling look especially when she is seen from the rear; but the new support cannot be worn by people allergic to surgical tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For those who find it difficult to stay afloat, a new revolutionary swim trunk was invented, known as float-ee. The suit has air pockets concealed within the suit. Even if you cannot swim, you float. Even if you drown you float with float-ee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Men’s suits have, in recent years, stayed much the same, in cut if not in color. Boxer trunks have become popular lately, but the basic male swimming suit is still much the same as it was before World War II. Those in the manufacturing end do not predict any drastic changes in some time to come. However, back in 1948, a United Press dispatch from Hollywood reported a Hollywood designer as saying: “Within five years bathing beauties will be wearing grandma’s long black suits.” Irene, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s fashion expert, at the time, said: “The new look was bound to get down to the beach. Every fashion trend pointed to resurrection of the black jersey bloomers that used to cover bathers from the wrist to the knee.” But two years later found fashion dictum number one, in point of world interest, the fact that there will be less suit acreage per wearer, with necklines pursuing the downward plunge of the past few years, and with a new gimmick in the way of front-and-center zippers. At the present Irene, who designs for top stars at the studio and wealthy socialites in her own salon, is working on white lace, fringe and feathers. If she gets no more ideas, she may have to drag out the long drawers. She has encouraged the fashion toward $100 bathing suits, which is rather a stiff price for a garment that does not keep one warm or cool, nor protect one from the wind or rain. It does not shield one from the sun nor keep one dry. Nor would one want to wear it down Broadway or Fifth avenue. About the only thing that it does is keep one out of jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">According to the New York Times magazine of August 26, 1951, &quot;The American male will pay an.average of about $3.25 for his suit, though he could spend up to $8.95 if he wished. The American female will pay an average of about $7 for hers, and she may pay up to about $50 if she has the money. Twenty-five years ago both sexes would have had the same choice of colors, or black and blue. Today 14 per cent of the suits will be pale green, 13 per cent a strident yellow, 5 per cent will be white, 5 per cent will be a throbbing magenta and a somewhat smaller percentage will be a screaming cerise which the trade calls iridescent. Black suits, except in the expensive high-fashion woman’s models, have dropped to about '4 per cent of the total sales, and though blue still sells well, the blues of today are gay pastel shades.” Americans spent over $6 million for bathing suits alone in 1951.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Prices have changed considerably in the last few years, but the styles have not. Will the swimming suit get smaller? Impossible! Will it get larger? Improbable. From all appearances the swimming suit is one garment that will for some time to come remain as it is, and, what there is of it, where it is!</span></p>

Oscar is the unborn offspring of a finback whale that met the harpooners in Antarctic waters. Described as a &quot;New York apartmentsized whale”, scientific interest surrounds Oscar because, as a six-week-old fetus, he looks very much like a whale. At birth he would have been 22 feet long.

<p><span class="font27">Since the mid-nineteenth century the world has witnessed </span><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font27">far more than casual drift away from belief in the Bible, The doctrine of evolution ha<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark18">1</a></sup> permeated edueaUon and culture. A so-called wave of &quot;modernism” has taken cai&gt; tlve great bodies of the clergy, many of whom have made <sup>1</sup> open sport of the Scriptures, The Bible left in the hands of &quot;fundamentalists'' proves an inept tool because mutilated and misconstrued by absurd sectarian creeds. Today, great masses of the population In general, their leaders in rell-glon, polities and society and cynical writers laugh off such accounts as that of the flood of Noah's day and relegate them to the folklore status of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; or &quot;Peter Pan”. But in an age that boasts of Its Intellect all this could never have occurred without the assistance and blessing of science. In the following article </span><span class="font27" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font27"> Investigates the past century's trends in modern geology, and Questions the factors that have led to disavowal of the Bible's account of a global flood by so many current scientists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ly decreed that as a result of his studies of the Scriptures he had concluded that creation took place on October 26 of the year 4004 B.C., at nine o'clock in the morning. Unhappily for Bible truth this assertion came to be inserted in the marginal reference of the King James Version Bible, where it soon influenced religious creeds; and sectarian Christendom generally adopted the idea that the earth with all its features was no more than 6,000 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the time of Archbishop Ussher and into the early nineteenth century the leading men of science believed the Bible; but we should not conclude from this that they necessarily believed in the archbishop's marginal reference or that they based their scientific principles on that. They did, however, accept the Noachian flood and regarded it as the last of a series of catastrophes to overwhelm the globe since its creation. Allowing for the previous cataclysms with long periods in between did no violence to the opening chapter ot Genesis, which provided for such periods with its reference to creative “days” of unstated a literal interpretation upon the record In the rocks, which revealed disrupted and upturned stratified layers of rock and pro duced, on probing, the carcasses of animals given the quick-freeze treatment In the last of such catastrophes. Outstanding spokesman for this school of thought was Baron “Georges&quot; Cuvier (1769-1832), who stated summarily:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Life, therefore, has been often disturbed on this earth by terrible events—calamities which, at their commencement, have perhaps moved arid overturned to a great depth the entire outer crust of the globe, but which, since these first commotions, have uniformly acted at a less depth and less generally. Numberless living beings have been destroyed by sudden inundations, others have been laid dry in consequence of the bottom of the seas being instantaneously elevated. Their races even have become extinct, and have left no memorial of them except some small fragments which the naturalist can scarcely recognize.”<sup><a href="#bookmark18">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As long as this belief prevailed nothing would obstruct belief in the Bible with its account of successive creative periods with various forms of life beginning with the third and each period separated by or even interspersed with apparent cataclysmic events that wiped the slate clean and paved the way for further development. Belief in the Noachian flood would be ably substantiated. Where the Bible allowed for time periods science would be at liberty to fill out the picture with estimates of the exact length </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">if</span><span class="font10"> sufficient grounds for such estimates turned up. However, a new school of geology arose which resorted to very vast expanses of time to establish an entirely new and opposing theory, a theory that has since become the prevailing geological principle. The new school of thought ridiculed prevailing scientists as old-fashioned, making their harmony with the Bible a prime target. But the new minds gained only a surface victory, bringing to grief features like Ussher's chronology, but not harming true Bible teachings. Still this was sufficient to gain the confidence of the layman, blinded by what he thought was “scientific progress”. Such an attitude has grown until this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A typical modern text, after having described the fomier ideas about catastrophism, continues: “To the uprooting of such fantastic beliefs came the Scottish geologist Hutton, whose </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Theory of the Earth<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark19">2</a></sup></span><span class="font10"> presented m 1785, marked a turning point in thought on this subject. Hutton argued that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">the present</span><span class="font10"> is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">the key to the past</span><span class="font10"> and that, if given </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">time,</span><span class="font10"> the processes now at work could have produced all the geologic features of the globe. This philosophy, which came to be known as the doctrine of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">uniformitarianism,</span><span class="font10"> is now universally accepted by learned men. It demands an immensity of time.” To which uniformi-</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">• Not to </span><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font27">confused </span><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font27">Cuvier's work by the same </span><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">tarfans quickly add that Hutton meant not that each process has acted at a uniform rate, but that no processes have ever operated in the past which are-not somewhere in operation now.<sup><a href="#bookmark19">2</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">We Have the Time—</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Do They Have the Proof?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If Hutton was the founder of uniformitarianism, Sir Charles Lyell (1797-1875) has been accurately called its “high priest”. In fact, it was Lyell that polished the idea and succeeded in selling it. His </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Principles of Geology</span><span class="font10"> scoffs catastrophism, asserting that it sought to “foster indolence and to blunt the keen edge of curiosity”. He contended for uniformity as new, modem. No fault can be found with LyelFs scholarship. He was certainly a splendid example of the “learned men” referred to above. His was a restless desire for facts and he gave himself without restraint to a painstaking assembly of the fossil record by which he hoped to establish the gradual blending of life forms from one stratum to the next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To have done so surely would have obviated a uniformitarian explanation of geology, since such an uninterrupted linking between life eras could not tolerate periodic destructions of all earthly life. This quickly shows us something else, that the uniformitarian theory was the resort of men who direly needed it to support a sister theory that likewise came to prominence halfway through the last century, Darwin’s doctrine of evolution. Byron Q Nelson, Th.M,, says bluntly: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“The theory of evolution has become united with the theory of uniformism to form the philosophical structure upon which modem geology rests</span><span class="font10"> &quot;f</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As just stated, Lyell wanted facts. But facts are helpful only when allowed to tes-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tify for themselves. Otherwise they are no better than the interpretations scientists choose to place upon<a name="footnote3"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark20">3</a></sup> them. Now let us examine this argument of time. The Bible certainly does not restrict geologists in this department to the narrow limits of time that some Bible believers argue for.<sup><a href="#bookmark20">3</a></sup> Through use of the uranium clock scientists have of late estimated quite accurately that the earth must be approximately 1,800,000,000 years old.f In order to make their uniformitarian theory at all plausible, modem geologists are forced to claim virtually all of this time for the evolution of life on earth and the gradual seesawing of the continents and ocean beds up and down, as one land mass sinks, another rises, and slowly, <sub>f</sub> ev</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">er so slow</span><span class="font0">ly</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;"><sub>T</sub></span><span class="font0"> one </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">stratum is </span><span class="font0">laid in place upon its predecessors. <sup><a href="#bookmark20">3</a></sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">* It Is true that one school of flood proponents, distinguished from, the mentioned early teachers of catastrophism, believes that the creative “days&quot; of Genesis chapter one are literal days of twenty-four hours each. Thus, to explain the presence of so many stratified layers of rock containing various forms of fossil life, authorities of this mind attempt to prove that they'were all laid down during the last of the great world catastrophes, the flbod of Noah's day. This seems to be straining tn order to satisfy certain sectarian religious creeds, and is certainly not necessitated by the Bible, which allows for these “days&quot; to be long periods.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">But since we are letting the evolutionary geologists take all the time they want of what the uranium clock allows them, the most vital question is, Art the features of one geological period adding toward the eventual sum the uniformitarians require?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Noiiy, again, cautions: “Let us not give in to the temptation of saying: many things can happen in 100 million years.

<p><span class="font0">Howorth, above cited, was thorough beyond reproach and exhaustively quoted and analyzed the arguments of his uniformitar-ian opponents. Furthermore, he held no brief for the Bible record, so that his contention for a global flood and previous like cataclysms was totally free of any charge of prejudice on this account. <sub>w</sub>He </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">pointed to the moon, the present placid state of which is entirely out of harmony with its crater-scarred surface bespeaking aLviolent pas</span><span class="font0">t.

Building up with lesser examples, Howorth, pointing to earth occurrences out of harmony with presently known uniform actions, suddenly asks: “Who is prepared to say that the riven and twisted and up-heaved masses of the Himalayas and the Andes, the huge faults like that of Durham, the vast cliffs and chasms of the Alps where the tertiaryt beds are thrown up on end, etc., etc., are comparable in extent and degree in any way with phenomena of which man has had direct cognisance or which are within the capacity of any forces of which he has had direct knowledgep</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Such mighty topographical eruptions </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">uniformitarians usually ascribe to erosion £y glaciers.</span><span class="font0"> In an earlier book Howorth quotes Mr. J. C. Russell, whom he describes as “a great champion of glacial erosion”, yet who says: “Those who attribute the formation of the Yosemite and other similar valleys to glacial erosion, should be required to point out the moraines<sup><a href="#bookmark21">4</a></sup> deposited by the ice streams that are supposed to have done the work/’t Howorth observes that debris piles of the size sufficient for such a magnificent task are absent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ice-age uniformitarians become almost amusing by their shunning the word catastrophe while describing great sheets of ice thousands of feet thick creeping gradually down over Europe and North America. Howorth declares: “A great Ice Age on the scale required, with ice working in the mode represented, I have always urged, is as much outside the range of uniformity as any catastrophe can possibly be.”i He further derides the ice proponents who assume that giant boulders tossed great distances, even up steep hills far from their bedrock, got to their unnatural locations by means of ice and explains why:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ &quot;Assuming the specific gravity of the ice to have been 875 compared with water at 1,000/ stays Jamieson, ‘then the weight of a mass of ice 1,000 feet thick would be 378 lb. to the square inch, or equal to fully 25 atmospheres, and would amount to 678,675,690 tons on every square mile. If the ice were 3,000 feet thick it would, at this rate, amount to 2,000 million tons on the square mile’ </span><span class="font27" style="font-style:italic;">{Geol. Mag.<sub>}</sub></span><span class="font0"> 1865, p. 403). It is this gigantic weight against which the stones would have to push and against which the stones would have to be lifted if they were to be pulled out of their sockets. The process seems as likely as that St. Paul’s Cathedral should proceed to dig up its own foundations. It is one of the hypotheses of despair/<a name="footnote5"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark22">5</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Surely not against such an opposing pressure, certainly not by any means so slow-moving as a creeping glacier, but only by a lashing force of prodigious dimensions and propelled by a torrent of virtually irresistible power were the tremendous rock formations Howorth describes at length whipped, crushed and strewn abroad. Great driving waves of water in violent motion are assuredly the most feasible force of nature to accomplish this<a name="footnote6"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark23">6</a></sup>! It becomes only a matter of which kind of catastrophe you choose to have explain the facts- But no laboring, tortoiselike glacier or ice sheet would be up to the Gargantuan task that the earth’s topography says occurred.</span></p>

This fact is no secret to informed biologists and geologists. Nelson speaks of “the way fishes by the millions are entombed in the rocks of England, Scotland, Wales, Germany, Switzerland, the American Rockies; the way elephants and rhinoceroses are buried by the millions in Alaska, Siberia, England, Italy, Greece; the way hippopotami are buried by the thousands in Sicily; the way reptiles are buried by the millions in western Canada, the United States, South America, Africa, Australia, to mention only a portion of such instances”.

<p><span class="font0">instances “absolutely require the eXplana-tion of great catastrophes for their elucidation<sup><a href="#bookmark23">6</a></sup>.<sup><a href="#bookmark23">6</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In his book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The New Diluvialism^</span><span class="font0"> H. W. Clark collects a wide selection of authoritative sources relating to the mysterious death of numerous life types of past ages. Many tiny creatures contribute their bit. “Trilobite fossils are discovered rolled tightly up into a ball . .. preserved in the defensive spasm into which they threw themselves as death began to overtake them.”f Crinoids like the coral have formed vast limestone deposits. Numerous flourishing families of cephalopods met sweeping and sudden destruction. Again we are told: “The dynasty of the ganoids was at one time coextensive with every river, lake, and sea. The all but entire disappearance of the ganoids from creation is surely a curious and not unsuggestive circumstance. ”t The outstanding voice for evolutionary (science possessed by H. F. Osborn once related the sudden, confounding disappearance of a vast array of reptiles that lived luxuriously in a land of fabulous vegetation: “We have no conception as to what world-wide cause occurred. . . , We can only observe that the worldwide effect was the same: The giant reptiles of sea and land disappeared.”®</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Those who doubt that facts such as these suggest global catastrophes need'only try to explain them by the slow, gradual methods of uniformitarianism. The impossibility of this is ably indicated by I. P. Tolma-choff, another esteemed modem authority.® He does so with reference to perhaps the most outstanding proof of all for catastrophism, the frozen remains of extinct mammoths found in Siberia. These giants of the past have been found imbedded in the frozen ground in standing or sitting positions, their last meals in their stomachs or their mouths, their flesh perfectly composed, with even the glassy texture yet retained in their eyes! Tolmachoff does not advocate catastrophism, but he honestly admits the failure of uniformitarianism to provide an adequate solution for these animals’ death riddle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He lists the possibilities that have been advanced: (1) The mammoths were exterminated by man; (2) they were eliminated by deficiencies in organization and adaptation to surroundings; and (3) they perished as a result of physico-geographical changes. The first suggestion virtually discards itself. Ho worth and others he cites point to the futility of primitive weapons (even granting that tribes lived in the vicinity of the mammoth finds at the time the beasts perished) against such monsters. Furthermore not a trace of eligible weapons is found in these vicinities.<a name="footnote7"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark24">7</a></sup> In his work cited above (p. 68) Tolmachoff answers the second proposed cause with the point that organizational faults in one species would not affect others, yet a simultaneous obliteration of life types took place when the mammoths went. And as for the third possibility, that they succumbed, to oppressive changes in their physico-geographical surroundings, we have only to note that the frozen behemoths are anything but puny. Apparently in the prime of life they perished with sound health and well-filled stomachs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Something Happened—What?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tolmachoff then sums up the difficulties: &quot;Thus no one of three possible lines of explanation of extinction of the mammoth can stand criticism and give a satisfactory solution of a problem which, in the opinion of the writer, must be considered from quite a different point of view, namely, as an example of a very well-known phenomenon of extinction, in different geological periods, of species, genera, families and even of faunas. In all these cases a group of animals was replaced by another one, when physico-geographical conditions did not become destructive for the former, which was sufficiently proved by the survival of the isolated representatives of the first group. . . . We know that the extinction must have a character of a momentary catastrophe when suffering animals would be destroyed in volume, geologically speaking.” Yet modem scientific trends will not permit this learned man to admit that one of these “momentary catastrophes” was the flood of Noah’s day. Shunning this answer to his problem, he says lightly of the diluvial opinions of Howorth and others:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“In a rather curious way these theories repeat, in somewhat modernized form, the tales of Siberian natives, reflected in Siberian folklore, and old Chinese traditions. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Unfortunately we are unable to replace them by new ones which could harmonize with all accumulated data and stand criticism from different quarters, but must be satisfied with more or less probable suggestions . . . </span><span class="font0">. We must explain the extinction of an animal which was living in great numbers, apparently very prosperously, over a large area in variable physico-geographical conditions to which it was well adapted, and which died out in a very short time, geologically speaking.”—Pp. 69, 65; italics ours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Lyell, the “high priest” of uniformity, was wrong. The world of geology has embraced his ideas only to find that uniformity, not catastrophism, ‘fosters ignorance,’ ‘blunts the keen edge of curiosity.’ Bound to the theory that nature must </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font0"> have</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">operated in any way not now evident, the “learned merw” that follow it find themselves imprisoned in a scientific “Dark Ages”. Thus Osborn had “no conception as to what world-wide cause” obliterated great families of life, though tantalized with the knowledge that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">something</span><span class="font10"> happened. Is this not a blank admission that this “something” is not now taking place? Tolmachoff relegates the flood theory to folklore while admitting his inability to replace it with anything better, and that uniformitarianism fails miserably to do so! And for what reason is this plucked and battered scarecrow theory propped up and maintained despite logic, clear evidence and common sense to the contrary? Simply because without it the whole doctrine of evolution and all the phases of science based on or influenced by evolution would crumble forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Those who believe in God and his Word are not surprised when ungodly, atheistic creeds fall utterly flat, devoid of proof. Though suppressed by popular sentiment today, volumes could be written, in fact, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">have been written,</span><span class="font10"> concerning the scientific truthfulness of the Bible’s earth-wide flood. So much is there to say that we must leave the task for further articles.</span></p>

In March this year it was announced that four weapons had been &quot;found alongside the bones of an imperial mammoth, an extinct variety of elephant, uncovered near Santa Maria Tepexpan, about thiriy-five miles north of Mexico City<sup>1</sup>'—as the New Yorit </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9"> reported on March 20.

<p><span class="font9">&lt;L Continuing in regard to the newest find, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9"> said: &quot;The four weapons, according to scientists here, have supplied final proof to destroy a long-held theory that human beings and the prehistoric animals that roamed the Western Hemisphere jungles could not have existed together.&quot; Linking man with the mammoth’s death, a later paragraph in the TiTnes' account stated: &quot;The weapons found were not powerful enough to kill, if the animals ran free. The scientists have deduced that ancient hunters chased the animals</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">&lt;L One of the discoverers, Dr, Martinez del Rio, director of the prehistoric section of the National Institute of Anthropology and History, was quoted: &quot;This is the first time that human manufactures have been found in precisely the same place as the animal bones and even in a position which clearly indicated that the instruments were used to kill the animal”. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font9"> magazine (March 31), covering the same story, ran the date for man and mammoth’s coexistence in Mexico up to a possible 16,000 years ago; and, in much stronger language than that used by the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font9"> said that the discoverers &quot;located the bones oFtan imperial mammoth with weapon-points em* bedded in its ribs and prehistoric knives and scrapers nearby”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&lt;L But before the facts could be nourished yet further by more retelling, Dr. Martinez announced publicly that he had been misrepresented by the sources responsible for the story of the discovery. As quoted in the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9"> of March 28, Dr. Martinez declared that &quot;other such discoveries have been made, notably in the United States, and full credit to the discoveries was given in my book on the early peopling of America.

<p><span class="font5">“Giving Thanks Always for All Things&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RAYER, above all else, is a matter of faith. Whether it consists of praise because Of what and who God is, or of thanksgiving because of what God has done for us, or of petition to God for help in time of need, prayer is a matter of faith. “He that approaches God must believe that he is”; that requires faith, because “no man has seen God at any time”, nor in fact can see him and live.—Exodus 33:20; John 1:18; 1 Timothy 1:17; Hebrews 11:6, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New </span><span class="font0">World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Faith, however, includes more than merely the giving of a mental assent to the fact that God exists* “You believe there is one God, do you? You are doing quite well. And yet the demons believe and shudder.” They believe God exists, but they do not have faith. Those who really have faith will please God, for faith includes the confidence that God “becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him”; and the way we demonstrate that confidence is by our works. That is why James says that without works our faith is dead.—James 2:19, 17, 18, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Too often professing Christians think of prayer only as a petition, an asking for something. In this way they betray how seldom God is in their thoughts. Of course, there is nothing wrong with going to God in prayer in times of need; in fact, God himself, through his Word, encourages us to do so. (Psalm 50:15) But if we go to him in prayer only when we are in particular need of his help, there is something radically wrong with us. We thereby show that we are greatly lacking in gratitude and love. Do we not owe our very life to the great Fountain of life, Jehovah God? And has he not given us all things necessary to sustain and enjoy that life? Is he not the Giver of every good and every perfect gift?—Psalm 36:9; James 1:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So, when we awake in the morning after a refreshing night’s sleep, should we not thank God for the rest we enjoyed? for the light of another day? and for the opportunities that another day brings with it of doing something to his honor, something for the benefit of our fellow swathing for our own welfare? And as we get ready to retire at night should we not want to express our appreciation for the things we were permitted to do, for the blessings and happiness that the day brought; thanking God for both the bitter and the sweet, since we need both to continue in the way of righteousness?—Hebrews 12:5-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Every time we sit down to eat we should express our thanks to God for providing for us our bread for the day. Not merely a mechanical “saying grace” but a sincere expression of gratitude. (Matthew 6:11, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font0"> If we imagine that we are too busy to take time to thank God then we simply are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">too busy&gt;</span><span class="font0"> like the little child who asks its parent for some delicacy and can only wait to receive it to be off to play again, having no time to even say “Thank you!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nor should our prayers be limited to the times of rising and retiring and to mealtimes. The mental attitude of thanksgiving should become a habit with us. We thank God for food, but do we also thank him for</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font31"><a name="bookmark28"></a>a glass of water? We can live longer without food than without water! And do we thank him for the air we breathe? It is</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">or water, is it not? God “makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous”. Do we thank God for the sunshine and the rain?—Matthew 5:45, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Scriptures, particularly the psalms, contain many prayers of thanksgiving. “Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!” “I will give thanks unto thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: wonderful are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.” Do we thank God for the use o^ our mental faculties? for the use of our senses? the use of our tongues to speak and sing and for the use of our limbs to get about and perform useful work? In fact, life under the most adverse of conditions still provides a basis for thankfulness because it offers the Christian the opportunity to demonstrate his love of God as </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">did Job. </span><span class="font10">—Psalm 107:8; 139:14; Job 1:21,22, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Humility and thankfulness go hand in hand. And unless we are humble we cannot expect to receive God’s undeserved kindness. In the first place it takes humility to be willing to accept kindness from others and it takes humility to express appreciation for kindnesses received. Some in the apostle Paul’s day did not appreciate the fact that all they had came from God; and they became proud, and it was necessary for Paul to reprove them: “Indeed, what do you have that you did not receive? If, now, you </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">did</span><span class="font10"> indeed receive it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?” Particularly if we are Christian ministers, let us ever bear in mind that any success we might have in our labors depends more upon</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font31"><a name="bookmark30"></a>God's blessing than upon our own efforts. —1 Corinthians 4:7, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">We are counseled to pray incessantly. We can </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">approach God anywhere, anytime, </span><span class="font10">under any circumstances. It follows therefore that the posture taken in prayer is not the vital thing. Certainly there is nothing in the Bible to warrant the folding of the hands or intertwining of the fingers with an air of sanctimoniousness when talking to God. And while humility and earnestness may at times indicate a kneeling or even prostrate position before our Maker, standing while praying is likewise fitting. —1 Samuel 1:12, 26; Psalm 95:6, 7; Matthew 6:5; Mark 11:25; Acts 9:40; 1 Thessalonians 5:17, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nor do we need to go to some “church building” to be heard of God. He does not dwell in temples made with hands. The heart condition is what counts.—Nehemiah 2:1-6; Psalm 34:15; Acts 7:48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The matter of expressing appreciation to God for blessings received is forcibly brought home to us in the case of a certain ten lepers whom Jesus cleansed. “One of them, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">when he saw he</span><span class="font10"> was </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">healed, turned </span><span class="font10">back, glorifying God with a loud voice. And he fell upon his face at Jesus’ feet, thanking him; furthermore, he was a Samaritan. In reply Jesus said: ‘The ten were cleansed, were they not? Where, then, are the other nine? Were none found that turned back to give glory to God but this man of another nation?’&quot;—Luke 17:13-18, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Where do we fit in? Are we like the nine Israelites, unappreciative, thankless, thinking only of ourselves and the blessings we receive? Or are we like the one lowly Samaritan, appreciative, thankful, and expressing our thanks, not only to God but to the ones he may use to bestow his favors upon us, “giving thanks always for all things”?—Ephesians 5:20, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Philippines</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font10">HE Philippine Republic has been called the “show window of democracy in the Far East”. The larger democratic powers hope to present such a pleasing display In this “window” that other Asiatic lands may be won over to their fold. Many eyes, particularly of Communist China, are on this republic. What do they see?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Foremost exhibit is the Constitution on which the Republic rests. It is closely patterned after the Constitution of the United States, guaranteeing fundamental individual rights. Next to catch the eye is the public press, which is one of the freest in the world and generally fair in presenting both sides of any public dispute. Education is also a popular attraction although it still has far to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All this, although inadequate, might be encouraging were it not for a national revolutionary movement which has thrown the country into turmoil: “The People’s Army of Liberation,” or </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Hukbalahap,</span><span class="font10"> in the abbreviated native dialect, or the “Huks”, as they are generally called. This movement extols communism and wants to “liberate” the Filipinos. Many people in the provinces have had to evacuate their homes because of the guerrilla warfare. Frightened people flock Into the already overcrowded centers, including Manila, to get away from the strife. In combating this evil the government at times makes short shrift of such constitutional guarantees as habeas corpus. No wonder the people are terrified, discouraged and long for a better condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Their longing for, liberty is not going unheeded. Jehovah’s witnesses in the Philippines as elsewhere are saying to the prisoners &quot;Go forth!” by pointing them to the liberty of Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ Jesus. As a result the ranks of the witnesses in the Philippines have increased from 2,902 in 1947 to 15,300 in 1952.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are approximately 400 congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses in the Philippines. Those who compose these come mostly from the poorer classes of the people, the kind that recognize their spiritual need. Most of their assembly places, or Kingdom Halls, are in private homes, very much like the assembly places of early Christians in. apostolic times, fcven in Manila, which has a population of about one and a half million, the seven congregations meet in private homes. Sometimes more than 300 crowd into these Kingdom Halls to hear a public lecture. A common sight during these meetings.is the assorted heaps of wooden shoes at the bottom of the stairs leading to the hall. The owners go into the hall barefooted and pick up their shoes on the way out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The ministry of Jehovah’s witnesses is carried on in the Philippines the same way as it is in New York city. In addition to holding public lectures, they also go from house to house, finding the average Filipino, however, much more willing to discuss matters than the average New Yorker, for the Filipino certainly likes to talk. And Jehovah’s witnesses can be seen every Friday and Saturday afternoon on the main streets of Manila presenting the Watchtower and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazines to passers-by. This activity so impressed a newspaper</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">columnist that he wrote the following In his column, “My Daily Bread”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“On the west side of Rizal' avenue, between Bustos and Ronquillo streets, you will often see two or three girls who approach strangers meekly yet firmly, offering for sale Christian magazines that seek to pave the way for man’s return to God. These girls do not shout. They do not force their magazines on people the way other girls sell sweepstake tickets. They just pick on you and say, ‘May I disturb you for a minute, mister?’ Well, one of these girls may have approached you and you, like many others, may have thought they were a crazy lot. Imagine peddling Christian magazines, of all things, and expecting people to buy them. A magazine with a girl in a bathing suit on the cover would be something else, of course. And yet, these girls represent something which seems to have been lost to mankind, today, and that iS zeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“We may say we are Catholics. Would we do as much to spread our faith? We say we love democracy. How many of us would have the courage to peddle democratic literature in the streets? Oh, we have other kinds of courage, of course. The courage to criticize, to speak out, or even to face bullets in times of war. But most of us are cowards in the face of a people that scoff and laugh at meekness and humility. We who would not be ashamed to sell a scandal sheet would have no courage to peddle the voice of God/'—Sunday </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font0"> August 5, 1951.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Public meetings are well attended and especially such as are held in connection with their regional conferences known as circuit assemblies. During 1951 these often provided much excitement because of mobbings. Read the following from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Evening News,</span><span class="font0"> April 21,1952:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Tuguegarao, Cagayan, April 21, PNS— Two persons were killed and 32 others were </span><span class="font0">wounded when unknown persons went into a shooting and stabbing orgy disrupting the closing exercises of the three-day conference of the Watchtower Society, a religious organization, at Solana, this province, at around 7 p.m, yesterday. Soldiers immediately rushed to the scene and restored order* They were reported holding the mayor and the police chief for investigation. Reports reaching here said a volley of fire believed coming from outsiders, started a commotion among the conferees who numbered about 4,000. Then the shooting and stabbing orgy believed also coming from the outsiders ensued. The conference hall was reportedly bathed with blood?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah’s witnesses in the Philippines at preGent also have to deal with the flag salute problem. A former secretary of justice, Roman Ozaeta, ruled that compulsory flag salutes were unconstitutional; in this following the lead of the U. S. Supreme Court, which is customary. However, his successor, Bengzon, reversed this ruling, expressing himself very critically Qn the U. S. Supreme Court ruling on the matter. He subsequently resigned and the present secretary of justice is waiting for the courts to rule on the matter. In the meantime there have been expulsions from school, some of which children have been permitted to return pending final ruling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Philippines, many happy Moros, Igorots, Cebuanos, Uocanos and others forget about their national and tribal origins as they come together at their circuit assemblies, “happy as a bunch of kids.” This is the most thrilling exhibit that the Philippine show window has to offer to Communist lands. It is the evidence that the everlasting theocracy by Christ Jesus is on the increase, of which increase there will be no end. (Isaiah 9:6, 7) Many Godfearing Filipinos now have this hope and are joining in taking it to others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font27">Two Bloody Years in Korea &lt;$&gt; In 1950 a terse cable to the tl. N. secretary-general said: &quot;Government of Republic of Korea states that about 04:00 hrs., today, 25 June, attacks were launched in strength by North Korean forces all along Thirty-Eighth Parallel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">In the first year the U. N. was driven almost into the sea, then sent the Reds reeling back almost into Manchuria, was driven back down across Korea, and finally pushed the Communists up across the 38th parallel. The second year was primarily a propaganda battle over the truce, during which time the Communists rebuilt and strengthened their armies. They now have twice as many troops as the U. N, and approximately an equal number of planes and tanks. Five hundred U. N. bombers lashed out at Communist rearmament (6/23) when they smashed five large North Korean power plants that supply 90 per cent of North Korea’s power, and much of Manchuria’s. Included was the famed Suiho plant on the Yalu river, within 1,000 yards of Chinese territory, that had thus far been purposely spared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">As the third year of war began, the cost totaled $10 to $15 billion for the U. S. alone, and 420,683 casualties to the anticommunist forces. It had spurred rearmament, increased Aslan unrest, and elevated Communist China to the role of. a decisive Asian power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">Rearmament Spurred</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">&lt;$&gt; Preparations for war have increased tremendously since blood started flowing in Korea. The first outstanding development was in December, 1950, when large-scale mobilization was ordered in the U. S. Then in February, 1951, General Eisenhower set up SHAPE headquarters in Europe. In September a Japanese peace treaty was signed, and Japan, the Philippines and Australia joined a mutual defense setup. In February, 1952, Greece and Turkey joined NATO, and in May agreements were signed to restore German sovereignty. In June the U. S. agreed to increase its military aid to IndoChina, and U. S. ambassador to Russia, George Kennan, reported serious concern over the organized &quot;hate America” campaign, which has been stepped up to a point more intense than attacks on Hitler before the Nazi invasion in 1941. Russia charged the U. S. with employing germ warfare, slaughtering thousands of prisoners, preparing for extermination of 700 million people, being &quot;inhuman beasts” with &quot;master-race” ideas, and being worse than the Nazis. The new campaign is not directed so much outside Russia, as others have been, but to the Russians themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">A Mouse but Not a Tiger</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">&lt;$&gt; New Zealand<sup>f</sup>s Sir Carl Berendsen helped found the U. N„ was New Zealand’s chief delegate, and Is a great and good friend of the organization, according to Time (6/30), but is not bound to its drawbacks. He said, on returning to Wellington, &quot;The flow of speech and the spate of words in the United Nations are quite incredible and in time become insupportable. , . . Votes are bought and sold, not for money, but by a system of bargaining which some think part of the democratic system but which I and many others think disgusting, ... I say with amazement, agony and fury that millions of worthy but simple people act as if they believed it Is possible to keep the peace by words and good intentions,” He said that &quot;if we did not have it we would have to invent something very like it”, but &quot;we established at San Francisco an organization which could no doubt protect the world against a marauding mouse but not against any real danger from a tiger&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">U. S. Senators and Patronage</span></p>
<p><span class="font27" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;$&gt; Patronage: The offices, contract s<sub>f</sub></span><span class="font27"> ftonofSj etc., </span><span class="font27" style="font-style:italic;">which a public official may bestow by favor.—</span><span class="font27">Webster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">U.S. senators had an excellent opportunity to lay aside some of their patronage (6/18) which many people believe is responsible, at least to some degree, for many of the current political scandals, but they chose not to do so. They overwhelmingly defeated the long-discussed bill to put 21,000 postmas ter ships, 94 U. S. marshals and 54 customs collectorships under civil service instead of politics, apparently wishing to retain these traditional political plums for election use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mma</span><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;"> FHMtn Break lu Brezil </span><span class="font27">$ It was Friday afternoon (6/20) and prisoners were cut-ting firewood on Anchieta Island, just off the coast of Brazil, Suddenly they revolted, overpowered five guards, took their guns, stormed the prison arsenal, seized 10 machine guns, 60 rifles, 200,000 rounds of ammunition, and soon subdued the island’s garrison, killing 17 guards and civilian employees. They then freed all the prisoners who wanted to break for freedom, headed for the mainland, and terrorized several small towns. Federal troops, air force planes and navy boats were called into action, and within three days </span><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">had </span><span class="font27">rounded up more than 200 of the 300 escapees. Hunger and cold forced some to give upi Others were believed drowned during the dash for the mainland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">Religious Murder In Colombia &lt;t&gt; There are only 30,000 Protestants in Colombia’s population of 11 million. For almost two decades of a democratic (and mildly anticlerical) gov. emment they were not molested, but with a new government in 1949 priests began preaching inflammatory sermons and police officers became aggressive. Religious murder followed. Bibles and tracts were seized and burned, 500 cases of religious persecution were listed- Dr. Luis A. Quiroga of Colombia’s Evangelical Confederation said, in New York (6/16), the hands of Roman Catholics who deplore the situation “are tied because of an alliance between the ruling Conservative party and the Catholic hierarchy”. Pope Pius delivered a special radio address to the Colpmbian people (6/20), saying, “It is your Father in Rome who speaks to you, it Is the Vicar of Christ who turns to you.” However, he did not take the opportunity to speak aa Christ and condemn their murder of Protestants, that was not his subject. His counsel was against overthrowing the present political sltuation^the situation that made such possible!</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">Sweden versus Russia</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">&lt;$► Five times within three years Russia has fired on planes from other nations in a policy directed against any plane they suspect of violating their territory. Sweden, neutral for more than a century, fell victim when Russia shot down a Swedish plane (6/16) that was searching for a DC-3 that had not returned from a training flight. Russia claimed the Swedish plane fired first. Sweden said this was Impossible because the rescue plane was totally unarmed. Thousands of angry Swedes demonstrated outside the Soviet embassy in Stockholm with cries of “Hang Stalin!” “Down with Russia!” They believed the missing DC-3 had also been shot down and Swedish fighter planes and the naval search fleet were ordered to open fire on any Soviet plane or vessel that Interfered with the rest of the search.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">Italian Fascism</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">and Communism</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">&lt;$&gt; Hie rising again of Fascism in Italy through the Motrhnen-to SociaZe </span><span class="font27" style="font-style:italic;">Italiano</span><span class="font27"> (M.S.I.) has caused much concern in recent months. Two enemies, Premier De Gaaperi’s Christian Democrats and the Communists, got together to fight it and pooled their votes In late June to put through an antiFascist bill which imposes penalties of three to ten years in jail for Fascist activity; three months for the Fascist salute. The tanporary alliance lasted only long enough to pass the law. When a Communist speaker denounced Gen. Ridgway, De Gasperi threatened the Communists with the same action: “Remember this! As long as I remain in this place, I shall not recognize that you have a right to prepare a revolution in Italy- U present laws are not sufficient to curb you, we shall make new ones.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">Labor Wins Holland’s Vote</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">&lt;$► While the U. S. election campaign sizzled with oratory, the Netherlands, with praise-worthy orderliness, quietly went to the polls (6/25) and made a slight shift In the Second Chamber of the States-General, which amounts to the greatest change in Holland’s politics since the war. (The Second Chamber corresponds to Britain's House of Commons or France’s National Assembly.) The Labontes gained three sests, the Catholic party lost two, and they stood neck-and-neck with 30 seats each in the 100-member assembly. The Communists lost two seats, suffering losses in Amsterdam, the center of their strength. This was the first time in any postwar election that Catholic bishops stayed out of the country’s politics and did not advise their parishioners how to vote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">Central African Federation</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">For several months a Central African Federation, composed of Northern and Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, has been under discussion. Most of the area's 169,000 whites strongly support it, but representatives of the 6 million natives were vigorous in their opposition. A British White Paper (6/18) gave a plan for a “Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland” in Central Africa, which would have a 35-member federal assembly (at least six of whom would be Nhgroes) and an African Affairs Board made up of white and Negro representatives to safeguard the Negroes' interests. Native objection has been over fear that white settlers would close the door on eventual native self-government, and fear that Southern Rhodesia's color bar would be extended to the other two areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">Protest in South Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">&lt;$&gt; In planned nonviolent defiance of South Africa’s new rad al restrictions 30 rtonwhites pushed past waiting police (6/26) and used an entrance and bridge in Port Elizabeth that were reserved for whites only. They submitted quietly to arrest. Near Johannesburg 50 volunteers notified a magistrate they would break racial regulations, and likewise submitted willingly to arrest for trying to do so. It was reported that 10,000 have volunteered to risk imprisonment in such protest demonstrations in a “continuous struggle* against “unjust laws”. South Africa’s nonwhite population outnumbers the whites four to one, and although almost all of South Africa’s whites favor some kind of control, many object strenuously to the present method of doing this. Their objections are based on political considerations rather than on good principles of justice and equality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">Holy Day Store Ban Illegal</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">When Montreal bowed to one religion and made it illegal for stores, whether Roman Catholic or not, to sell on Catholic holy days, that was just a little too much for seven of Montreal’s largest stores, and nearly 500 smaller shops. They flouted the law last December 8 (the Roman Catholic Feast of the Immaculate Conception), and 200 of them were fined $40 each and costs. Those who respect the right of men to hold whatever religion they choose, without being forced by the state against their will, will rejoice to know that Canada’s Superior Court upheld the stores (6/17) and declared the city had no right to enforce this religious law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">The Solution</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">&lt;$&gt; What do you think when you look at the world? That everything is fine or that things are in such a mess that no one knows what to do about them? At least it could certainly stand improvement. But who has the solution? Did the U. N. when it ^vent to Korea? Does the Western camp by rearming? Was New Zealand’s delegate right about the U. N/s weaknesses? Will either Britain’s or South Africa’s current plans actually solve the color question? Actually, the solution for the world’s problems is so simple few will accept it The Bible indicates conditions are as bad now as before God destroyed corruption in Noah’s day, and the Bible proves He is going to bring just such a destruction of wickedness in our day. Despite the scoffers, that alone will open the way for a righteous new world. —2 Peter 3.3-13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">O YOU ever feel that life is not worth living? There are times when an individual gets to feel that way. Particularly in this trialsome period of human history, no doubt, many ask, &quot;What’s the use?” But there need be no such attitude. No, not when these very conditions, prevalent now, were long ago foretold and shown to be a &quot;sign” of a better &quot;system of things” at hand. It becomes apparent that life can be very interesting and worth-while. Viewed from the standpoint of the Bible, life becomes meaningful.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>GIVING GOD’S WORD FIRST PLACE IN OUR LIVES</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“How can a young man keep his path pure? By heeding thy word. I find joy in thy statutes; I will not forget thy word.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:9-19:119:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 119:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:16-19:119:16" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 16</a>, <em>AT</em>) This is pre-eminent counsel for both young and old and shows the attitude one should take toward God’s Word. Honest and sincere persons today seek to know and do God’s will. The study of God’s Word is essential for such. They learn precious truths from the perusal of its pages, and then also seek to share the knowledge gained with others, near and far. Accordingly, during the months of June, July and August, Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the world, will make a special effort to get into the isolated and more-difficult-to-reach places with the message of God’s kingdom. You, too, may share the knowledge you have with others, calling on your friends and neighbors. If you desire further particulars, contact Jehovah’s witnesses in your vicinity or write the Society. Giving God’s Word the first place will bring you joy.</p>

“LET YOUR KINGDOM COME” WITNESSING PERIOD—Matt. 6:10, NW.
For many centuries and in many languages millions of persons have been praying the Lord’s prayer, including the petition “let your kingdom come”. Many more millions have sincerely, though unknowingly, longed for the time when that prayer will be answered, when God’s will shall “come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth”. How mankind groans, hopes for and needs that blessed time! Yet how few really know just what the petition requests and what it will mean to God-serving persons. If you have been granted this blessed knowledge, and appreciate what it will result in for those who sincerely pray for it and work toward having a part in its blessings, then you will want to do all you can to pass on to others the same comforting truths by participating in the “Let Your Kingdom Come” Witnessing Period during August. Present to your friends, relatives, acquaintances and neighbors the three-bound-book combination published by the Watch Tower Society, that includes What Has Religion Done for Mankind? “Let God Be True” and “This Means Everlasting Life” (or any other one), all three on a contribution of $1.50. Write to the branch office listed under cover for full particulars as to this activity.

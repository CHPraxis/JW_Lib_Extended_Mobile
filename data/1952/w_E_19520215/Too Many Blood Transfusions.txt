Too Many Blood Transfusions
● A doctors’ journal questioned today the need for so many blood transfusions in British hospitals. “If things continue at this rate,” the Medical Press warned, “it would seem as if a time must soon come when one fraction of the population will be living on the blood of the remainder.” The journal said the amount of blood transfused in hospital cases in this country has more than doubled in the last five years.—Associated Press dispatch in Washington, D.C., Evening Star, December 19, 1951.

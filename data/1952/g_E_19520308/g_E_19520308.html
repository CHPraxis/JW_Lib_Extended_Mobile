<h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font23"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Hoover Asks Return of <sup>w</sup>01d” Virtues</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">H</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">erbert Hoover is the only living expresident of the United States. According to the New York </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font1"> August 31, 1951<sub>f</sub> Mr. Hoover, in his speech the day before at Des Moines, Iowa, made some very frank observations regarding honor in public life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mr. Hoover told how politicians have overworked the word “new<sup>0</sup> in &quot;trying to get out of this age of misery from our thirty-seven years of hot and cold wars, with only intervals of hot and cold peace&quot;. The remedy, he averred, is always something ''new”, but too often the “New Testament” is omitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mr. Hoover’s concern was not about these pseudo “new” things. According to him: “Some of these <sup>f</sup>old’ things are slipping badly in American life. And if they slip too far, the lights will go out of America, even if we win these hot and cold wars. We might explore some of the things that have happened to the 'old' virtues of integrity, and truth, and honor in public life a little further. During the recent past we have had a flood of exposures by Congressional committees, by state legislatures, by grand juries in scores of cities, and in the press.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He wondered what the fifty-six Founding Fathers of America “would say about the procession of men in responsible positions who have come before [the] Congressional committees in this day. What would they have thought of the 'sacred honor* of the five percenters, the mink coats, the deep freezers, the free hotel bills ? Or favoritism in government loans and government contracts? Or failures to prosecute evildoers for widespread cancerous rackets and gambling rings with their train of bribed officials all through the land?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“We have a cancerous growth of intellectual dishonesty in public life which is mostly beyond the law,” continued Mr. Hoover. “One of the chief instruments is corrupt propaganda. There has been such propaganda by foreign governments, and even our own government, designed to get us into wars. Then we have propaganda to keep up our pep. Then the habit continues in peacetime. And some pressure groups have learned this trick to get something they ought not to have. The mildest form of corrupt propaganda is a process of persuasive half-truths. At times it even rises to the high moral levels of selling snake oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“But the most malignant form of propaganda is the spread of deadly poisons^ Its process is to create suspicion, and hate and fear. Its purpose is less to persuade than to conceal the truth and to crush opposition. The machinery of propaganda is made of certain standardized gadgets by which you can detect it.’*</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Among these gadgets he listed the use of slogans and smears*, the pollution of the integrity of the language by insinuating new meanings to old, simple and well-understood expressions, and the cries of “Unity! Unity!” for the purpose of stifling free discussion. And still worse than the use of the gadgets of propaganda, according to Mr. Hoover, is the concealment of the truths relative to commitments, such as were made at Yalta and Teheran, which “sold the freedom of half a billion people down the river”. Then again making a bid for the “old” virtues he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“And I would like to explore this ‘old’ virtue of truth, and integrity and honor in public life a little further. The Congress can well widen the laws so as to clutch the ‘new’ kinds of bribes and benefits that they have recently discovered. But Congress cannot reach into intellectual dishonor. Part truth, concealment of public commitments, propaganda and its gadgets, the failure to enforce the law, the failure to keep promises are all but part of them. There are group pressures also ‘to get theirs' which smell from the decay of integrity and the rotting of patriotism. And some persoqs arrive at their njorals with a sort of divining rod that measures morals in terms of votes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The Congress, from its own inquiries, is confronted with the fact that sacred honor cannot be tested by legality nor can it be enforced by law. In its frustration, the Congress is groping for some sort of a code of ethics, which with the prefix ‘new’ might protect the citizen from his own officials. Might I suggest that we already haMB some old and tested codes of ethics? There are the Ten Commandments, the Sermon on the Mount, and the rules of the game which we learned at our mother’s knee. Can a nation Eve it these are not the guides of public life? . , ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“When people are dishonorable in private business, they injure only those with whom they deal or they may injure their own chances in the next world. But when there is a lack of honor in government, the morals of the whole people are poisoned. The drip of such poisons may have nothing to do with dishonor in some college athletics or the occasional policemen on the beat. But the rules of the^game have been loosened somewhere by somebody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">'“Some folks seem to think that these are necessary evils in a free government. Or that it is smart politics. These are deadly sleeping pills. No public man can be just a little crooked. There is no such thing as a no-man’s land between honesty and dishonesty. Our strength </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">is not in politics, in </span><span class="font1">prices, or production, or price controls. Our strength lies in * . . public sensitiveness to evil. Much as the Congress has my good wishes, something stronger than a new code of ethics is needed in American life. The issue today is decency in public life against indecency. Our greatest danger is not from invasion by foreign armies. Our dangers are that we may commit suicide from within by complaisance with evil. Or by public tolerance of scandalous behavior. Or by cynical acceptance of dishonor. These evils have defeated many nations many times in history.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In thus analyzing the moral plight of America, Mr. Hoover not only corroborates the fulfillment of Bible prophecy concerning the perilous times of these last days, but also gets at the cause, even as the prophet long ago foretold: “The wise shall be abashed, they shall be dumbfounded and taken; for lo, they have spurned the word of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Lord, and</span><span class="font1"> what wisdom, then, have they?” Those who are wise will heed Jehovah’s instructions: “Stand ye in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.” The old paths and the good way are found in God’s Word, the Bible.—Jeremiah 8:9, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer, Trans.;</span><span class="font1"> Jeremiah 6:16, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan, Ver.; </span><span class="font1">2 Timothy 3:1-5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">I</span><span class="font1">N THE winter of 1950-1951 the Israel</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Philharmonic Orchestra made a goodwill tour of the United States. While in Providence, Rhode Island, a reception was given in its honor at which Dr. Henry M. Wriston, president of Brown University, lauded the new state of Israel as &quot;the force of a magnificent idea” and stated that in it “an ideal, frustrated for centuries but tenaciously held, has finally found expression, even in a hostile environment”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the spring of 1951 the prime minister of Israel, David Ben-Gurion, visited the United States- He was feted by Jewish groups, and made a favorable impression in Washington. Officials there spoke of Israel as “our devoted ally”, “a natural ally,” and alluded to the possible role in defense that it could play as an outpost of democracy in the Near East. Late in the year the United States allotted Israel a $64,000,000 grant in aid- The American Christian Palestine committee is giVing help of another kind to Israel By endeavoring to create good will toward it among American Protestants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What kind of country is Israel? What is taking place there, and why? Does it indeed represent “the force of a magnificent idea”, thus deserving the help it is getting from religious, political and financial circles in America? Or may it be that there is another side to the picture, that of its “hostile environment”, the Arab nations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first Jewish agricultural colonies of modem times in Palestine were established in 1840, Some fifty years later the Zionist movement came into being with the goal of a “publicly and legally assured home in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Palestine” for the Jewish people. The establishing &lt;of a British mandate over Palestine at the close of World War I ended four centuries of Turkish domination and restored the immigration of Jews,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For about thirty years England had a real job trying to preserve the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pax Britannica</span><span class="font1"> in Palestine between the Jews and the Arabs. Ironically, it had the most difficulty with the ones it had favored most, the Jews. Fanatical Jewish groups murdered hundreds of British officials and soldiers to lend weight to their demand that the British get out. Finally England’s patience gave way and she announced her withdrawal from Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The date of England’s withdrawal, May 14, 1948, marked the birth of the stafe of Israel. As nations go, it is small indeed, at present consisting of less than 8,000 square miles, or about the size of the state of Jersey. Its 1951 population □f less than one and a half milliop is about half that of Brooklyn, New York. Its chief cities are Jafla-Tel Aviv, with a population of 400,000; Haifa, with 150,000, and Jerusalem (New), with 110,000. About 12 per cent of all the Jews in the world reside in Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ideological, Religious, Political Problems</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The birth of the state of Israel has crystallized a wide ideological rift in world Jewj-y. On the one hand are the Jews who hold th#t being a Jew is a matter only of religion and not nationality; and on the other hand are those who hold that Israel is the homeland of all Jews. Holding this latter view is Israel’s premier, who told the recent World Zionist Congress at Jerusalem, “The state of Israel differs from all other states in that it is not only the state of its citizens alone but of the entire Jewish people, of every Jew wherever he lives/<sup>1 </sup>This view is repudiated by many American Zionists, one of whom countered with “American Jews are not candidates for mass immigration”. In fact, years ago American Jews went on record that “America was [their] Palestine, and Washington [their] Jerusalem”. Further bearing this out is a New York </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font1"> November 28,1951, dispatch from Jerusalem, telling that while American tourists flock to Israel “American Jews who come here as immigrants and remain are rare”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Israel, religion and politics are joined in a Judaistic democracy. As pointed out by the world chairman of the Jewish Miz-rachi society, those who would divorce these issues “do not face reality”. In order to form a government, the Mapai, leading political party of a socialistic labor nature, had to take into its coalition the religious parties. This meant acceding to their demands which “covered religious education, a Sabbath law, opposition to the importation of nonkosher meat and a ban on compulsory mobilization of women for military service”. Because of the radical nature of this small religious bloc and the controversial questions involved, the government has not gone ahead with its plans for drawing up a permanent constitution. This religious bloc, though small, is powerful; it was able to force the resignation of the previous coalition on a church versus state issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This coalition of the liberal and religious parties at present has 65 of the 120 seats of Israel’s assembly or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Knesset,</span><span class="font1"> Due to the balloting’s being on a national basis instead of according to states or constituencies, a great many small parties have seats in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Knesset.</span><span class="font1"> However, only two others are of any importance: the General Zionists, which is in favor of “free enterprise”, and the Mapam, which goes to the other extreme and Is divided on just how far it should be influenced by the Kremlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Economic Problem</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Enthusiastic and optimistic Israelis point with pride to the industrial progress their country is making. Since its founding it has almost tripled its textile, building material, food products and metal industries. A large auto assembly plant is in operation, recently a new tire and rubber plant was opened, iron and steel plants are nearing completion and extensions are being made on chemical, fertilizer and other industrial plants; all aiming to make Israel as economically self-sufficient as possible, even though the country has very few natural resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, in spite of all such magnificent progress, the fact remains that Israel has an extremely adverse trade balance; or is it </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">because</span><span class="font1"> of such industrialization? Year after year its imports are upward of six times as great as its exports. Israel has made use of every conceivable means to alleviate the strain of such an adverse trade balance on its national economy; in keeping therewith being the floating of a half-billion-dollar loan in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the root of Israel’s economic plight is its policy of unrestricted immigration. Aiming to have a nation of 2,500,000 within five years, it has been using mass air transport to achieve its goal. Its “Operation Magic Carpet” brought in fifty thousand Yemenite Jews; it has just about completed bringing in 100,000 Jews from Iraq, and hopes to bring in 70,000 of Iran’s 100,000 Jews in the near future- Concerning this immigration an Israel </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Newsletter</span><span class="font1"> stated: “This is a moral responsibility and one of the main reasons for its existence as an independent state.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But an Increasing number of Israelis are pressing for immigration restriction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To make matters worse, many of the immigrants do not like farming and so quit the wilderness settlements for the cities. “The people now coming to Israel . . . have not the background nor the enthusiasm for the tasks they must undertake?’ Why should they do hard manual labor when, as one immigrant of 30 put it, “we can get along very nicely with the black market.” A New York </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font1"> dispatch from Tel Aviv, dated November 21, 1951, told of 150 disillusioned Jews from India staging a sit-down strike; because of bad treatment and color discrimination they demanded that they be returned to India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">*'Zn </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a Hostile Environment”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To understand why this “magnificent idea&quot; of the state of Israel finds itself “in a hostile environment”, it is necessary first of all to appreciate the viewpoint of the Arab nations surrounding Israel. These Arab nations consider Israel a protege of imperialistic England, a recent intruder, a usurper and robber of Palestine territory. What right did Great Britain have to allow the Jews to settle in Palestine? True, the Jews were being persecuted in the rest of the world, but is that any reason why the Arabs should surrender their sovereignty of Palestine to the Jews? Jews could go to the North and South Americas, or to Australia; why must they come to Palestine? The mere fact that 3,000 years ago the Jews held the land is no argument why they should be entitled to claim it today! Have not the Arabs been in possession of the land for many centuries? After all, modem law provides a time limit during which one can press a claim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Oh yes, the Arab continues, the Jews have sentimental and religious reasons and base their claim on the history of the Bible. But since when are the modem nations basing their power politics on that Book? And while the Jews claim the land as theirs because they are the descendants of Abraham through Isaac, the Arabs counter with the claim that they are Abraham’s descendants through Ishmael. Why were a million Arabs compelled to sit idly by while foreigners gained control of the land, even thotigh they were willing to pay for it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No question about it, the infant nation of Israel is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">persona non grata</span><span class="font1"> as regards the Arab nations of the Near East. And it is being spoiled by an indulgent United Nations organization. Repeatedly this tiny country of less than one and a half million has defied its parent. It gave a striking example of this in 1949 when the U. N., by a more than two-thirds majority vote, adopted a resolution placing Jerusalem under an international regime. That did not suit Israel and so it did not submit. Instead it moved its capital from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and then rejected the U. N. demand that it move its government out of there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is not surprising therefore to repeatedly read of the U. S. and the U. N. rebuking the belligerent little offspring. &quot;U. N. aide holds that Tel Aviv obstructs efforts to settle Huleh marshes dispute.” “U. S. urges Israel to soften stand,&quot; dealing with the same subject And again, “U. S. rebukes Israel for bombing Syria in border incident,&quot; in which the U. S. observed that the bombing was in no way justified, and reminded Israel that in the long run its position in the Near East depended on the development of friendly relations with the Arab states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In February 1951 an Israeli army raiding force crossed the border into the state of Jordan, blew up houses and killed a number of Arabs, causing four Hebrew professors at Jerusalem to issue a protest which concluded with the words: “Is this the Jewish tradition on which we believed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the state of Israel was founded? Is this the regard for human life on which the Jewish people stood when they were not yet a political nation? Is this the way of proving to the world that our nation upholds the principles of justice?*'</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Under the heading “Israelis Oust 12,000 Arabs from 2 Villages; Occupy Territory Under Armistice Accord*’, a New York Times dispatch told how the Israelis made an armed attack at three o’clock in the morning. “The residents of the two villages . . - said they had farmed the land for generations and had no advance </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">notice </span><span class="font1">of the occupation. They said the Israelis had not exercised their right to move up to the new boundary until the acres of wheat and barley had been ready for harvesting*'* And while taking all it can under the 1949 armistice accord, Israel refers to the 1947 line of demarcation when that suits her best! She deals w<sup>T</sup>ith her neighbors on a “Heads I win, tails you lose*’ policy*</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Refugee Problem</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Much justifiable criticism has been directed against Israel’s treatment of the Arab refugees* These, according </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to Life, </span><span class="font1">November 17, 1951, number 880,000, with 467,000 in Jordan, 199,000 in Egypt, 106,-000 in Lebanon, 84,000 in Syria and a controversial number in Israel. The plight of these refugees is every bit as bad as ever was that of the European Jews. True, these refugees-were caused by the Arab-Israel war, but the fact remains that according to a long-standing U. N. Security Council resolution refugees have the right to return to their own land, a right which Israel refuses to grant them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These refugees are now the pawns in the Israel-Arab conflict. Israel has offered to take 100,000, if the rest of the Arab states will absorb the rest, but the Arab states insist that the refugees be permitted to choose. Israel does not want all these refugees, for both economic and political reasons; and her fears that they may become a fifth column may not be altogether groundless. (According to a U* N. head, to rehabilitate the refugees in new homelands would cost $1,500 per family*) And while Israel and the Arab States haggle over these wretched refugees and refuse to do anything for them, ‘Truman asks the U. S. Congress for $5 million for Arab relief as interim aid to ease tension in the Near East.* And there is no relief in sight. Because </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of the “rigid positions<sup>1</sup>* taken by </span><span class="font1">both the Arabs and the Israelis, the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine announced on November 21, 1951, its decision to end current mediation efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Clearly, from the foregoing it is apparent that much can be said on both sides of the Arab-Israel controversy and that Israel leaves much to be desired as the “force of a magnificent idea”. No wonder many Americans express concern over the U. S. policy of favoring Israel when its case is so weak from both a moral and a practical standpoint* Israel has yet to give proof that she will face her economic problems realistically; and why push the Arab nations into the Kremlin’s orbit for purely sentimental regard for Israel?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Human nature is ever the same. It craves justice and mercy when oppressed, but fails to mete such out when tables are tumed* Labor unions long complained of the tyranny of big business, but now labor union czars are tyrannical with the power they have gained. Negroes complain of discrimination, but they practice color discrimination among themselves. Israel is no exception. Since such is the case, how can anyone claim that it is the Messianic nation? But for a discussion of this phase of the subject we refer the reader to page 25 of this issue.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">A</span><span class="font1"> NAKED hollow-eyed child stares at you from behind sunken sockets. Her mouth is wide open but too weak to cry. Her arms are bent but no strength is left to chase the flies away that crawl on her ulcerous sores. Her chest is sunken and stomach swollen. Crouched beside her on the hot brick is her mother, with one hand holding the child so it will be able to stand, and with the other hand begging for food and life.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19520308_files/g_E_19520308-7.png" alt="" style="width:137pt;height:144pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">In the streets are plump, vigorous, healthy monkeys, big white cows, fat hissing snakes and strutt ing peacocks. As you stand wondering why people should be starving when there is an overabundance of meat everywhere you turn, the child lets out a pleading cry that sends chills down your spine. Animals and men turn to watch the baby writhe in pain. Its knees buckle, its head slumps forward as the mother catches the limp body in her arms and slowly lays the child beside her. The baby is dead. A truck with a regular corpse removal squad comes along. The men pick up the body and toss it on the truck as if it were a piece of lumber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Multiply this scene a million times if you wish to capture in your imagination what is happening to India. Why should starvation gnaw at the vitals of a nation that maintains almost a third of the world’s total cattle population? Why should men, women and children die of malnutrition when the nation’s potential milk and meat capacity .could easily exceed the production of the temperate zone ? Why should monkeys live in luxury and people in filth and degrading poverty? Why should sick cows and worthless peacocks rob the starving multitudes of their bread? Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Strangely enough, the answer is a religious one. It is one involving man’s exercising proper dominion. In all seriousness, India needs to consider the truthfulness of the Creator’s words in the book of Genesis, that man must exercise “dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth”, including cattle. Today in India the animal vyorld dominates man, Until the reverse comes true, her situation will remain critical if not disastrous. India’s greatest single cause for poverty is her sacred monkeys and sacred cows. It is either monkey and cow that must be sacrificed, or the nation. Which will it be?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Until a few years ago the country was self-sufficient, but now it must import hundreds of thousands of tons of food a year. Her soil has been denuded. Open gullies, eroded fields and miles of empty wasteland are everywhere. Food production does not keep pace with a population</span></p><img src="g_E_19520308_files/g_E_19520308-8.png" alt="" style="width:268pt;height:124pt;">
<p><span class="font1">which increasesby about four million each year. The masses move about like living skeletons In search of food. Most of them </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font1">destined to a cruel life of aemlstarva-tian. The cause? Sacred cows and sacred monkeys, say officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Monkey Business</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some estimate that monkeys alone eat or destroy $2,000,000 worth of foodstuffs every day, that they consume about 1,000,-000 tons and destroy another 2,000,000 or more tons of grain each year. India’s monkey business runs high, costing more than $190,000,000 for grain alone. Their nature makes them natural-bom saboteurs. They form a simian fifth column looting homes, tearing up crops, stealing food from restaurants, biting babies and committing murder. One tossed a piece of masonry on a man, killing him; another snatched an infant from his mother’s arms and threw it out of the hospital window, killing it. Others pickpocket, mimic and tease their victims, men, who are powerless to retaliate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Why are monkeys considered sacred by Hindus? Legend has it that Hanuman, a monkey chief, once led a horde of monkeys to save a beautiful princess named Sita, who was carried off by a demon. With Kis army Hanuman built the bridge of boulders joining India to Ceylon and rescued the queen. In respect to his tribe for this deed, the purple-black-faced monkey with the white ruffs has become a sacred member of the animal kingdom. In evezy street, in every alley, on country roads, one will encounter graven images of the monkey god Hanuman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To put an end to this religious monkey hazard, the government in a drive for more food ordered all states to kill them and placed a 5-rupee bounty on every monkey head. No longer does monkey find safety behind the skirts of mythology. A starving Indian is liable to cash legend for loot and earn himself 5 rupees, if monkey is not careful. Over 200,000 have already been turned over to the altar of sacrifice. Many have taken to the jungles for cover, sensing that India wants no more of this monkey business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sacred Snakes and Peacocks</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Milk and food offered to sacred snakes and grain fed to peacocks could help ease the starvation grip. But the native looks upon the snake as an incarnation of God. Special room is kept in a home for snakes that may wish to dwell there. The cobra is considered the most sacred to Hindu snake worshipers and is often called &quot;the good lord”. Yet snakes are known to cause the death of over 50,000 persons every year. It is sacrilege to even think of killing a snake. When bitten by one natives dread to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mention it for</span><span class="font1"> fear that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">they might</span><span class="font1"> incur the wrath of the gods. They usually refer to it as a briar scratch or something of the kind. It is from such superstitions that men must free themselves before they can exercise dominion over the animal creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cow or Country</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, to stay famine the slogan might well read, *For cow or country?* Some have gone all out for cow and nothing for country. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rajrishi</span><span class="font1"> (King of Saints) Purushottamdas Tandem, white-bearded and frail candidate for the presidency of India’s dominant Congress party, said: “Cow protection is part of Indian culture and as such ,,. the cow should be afforded full protection even if it leads to the collapse of the country’s economy.” In other words, sacrifice the people, but not the cow. Unlimited cow protection became a hot and debated political issue in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">She maintains some </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">215,000,000</span><span class="font1"> cattle out of the world’s total cattle population of 690,0(X),000. Facts show many of these sacred cows are sick and aged and are a burden to the country. Other cows mature slowly and are very low in milk production. Improvement by selective breeding could change the picture greatly. But religion says No! As a result, there is a great surplus in cattle, but the food production is very low. The cows compete with the growing population for the produce of the land, with the result that both suffer. To remedy this, the sick, diseased and aged animals ought to be slaughtered for beef and fed to the starving. But beef is repugnant to the Hindu. Killing cows, whether healthy or sick, is looked upon as a great sin. Yet Mahatma Ghandi, who was worshiped by Hindus as being next in greatness to Buddha, set aside this superstition by killing a sick sacred cow to spare it from agony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to many Hindus Ghandi was not condemned for what he did. His act showed mercy. He is said to have gone ‘directly to the seventh heaven of his faith and achieved mystic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nirvana</span><span class="font1"> or oneness with God without further transmigrations'. The people are in agony for want of food, and not pagan mythology. Will India sacrifice her sacred cow to save her people, or sacrifice her people to save her cow? In some states they have*changed the cow to a horse, thus making it possible for the native to kill. How was this possible? Simply by changing two letters the cow became a horse. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nehil Gae,</span><span class="font1"> meaning “blue cow”, was changed to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nehil Goa,</span><span class="font1"> meaning “blue horse”, which made the difference between life or death for the animal, and food or starvation for the native.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But the answer is still one of proper dominion, God over man and man over animal. Only by acting upon the Creator’s commands at Exodus 20:3-6 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Stan, Ver.)</span><span class="font1"> and Genests 1:28 will India find her answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font24">Strange Phenomenon of the Undernourished Bridge</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font16">N THE summer of 1948 Quebec province’s dictator-premier, Maurice Duplessis, opened his proud &quot;Duplessis Bridge&quot;, a nine-span structure connecting hfs home town of Three Rivers, Quebec, with Cap de la Madeleine. (See </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Awake/</span><span class="font16"> issue of September </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">22,</span><span class="font16"> 1951.1 But the bridge was due for an ill-fated history. Throughout most of 1950 it was closed for repairs. Then on January 31, 1951, reported as the coldest day of the year in the vicinity, four of Its spans collapsed and plunged four persons to icy death in the St. Maurice river, ♦ A United Press dispatch reveals that a two-man commission appointed by Premier Duplessis to investigate the calamity has been unable to find a cause after examining forty-three witnesses and sixty-nine exhibits. The commission lays the blame to either sabotage or to a strange phenomenon of which its report says cryptically:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">♦ &quot;We may conceive there was a phenomenon, not yet defined, through which the Duplessis Bridge would have carried in itself the cause of the collapse; in other words, a phenomenon which goes beyond the present knowledge of the science of engineering.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">4 </span><span class="font16">Investigating commissions should, of course, be interested in all of the facts. Noteworthy is the fact that the bridge’s contract had been let privately to Duplessis' own associates. Furthermore, the commission is said to be satisfied that steel girders in the span were not &quot;up to standard&quot;. Indeed It does appear that the bridge “carried in itself the cause of the collapse”. This it apparently carried in place of sufficient-quality steel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">+ With the commission’s findings, many may well &quot;conceive there was a phenomenon . . . which goes beyond the present knowledge of the science of engineering”. However, observers outside the Duplessis-appointed investigation comndssion may conceive that it is a phenomenon well known to the science of political graft.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font16">HE men who were instrumental in mak- I ing the United States a free nation felt keenly about establishing freedom of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In American colonies before 1776, ministers of certain religious sects were frequently arrested on the charge of ('disturbing the peace&quot;. Among the foremost opposers of such interference in freedom of worship were Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and Patrick Henry. In one instance Patrick Henry traveled fifty miles to defend certain Baptist ministers who had been arrested. A historian recorded:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">• &quot;He [Mr. Henry] entered the court house while the prosecuting attorney was reading the indictment. He was a stranger to most of the spectators; and being dressed in the country manner, his entrance excited no remark. When the prosecutor had finished his brief opening, the newcomer took the indictment, and glancing at it with an expression of puzzled Incredulity, began to speak in the tone of a man who has just heard something too astounding for belief :</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">* &quot;&nbsp;‘May it please your Worships, I think I heard read by the prosecutor, as I entered the house, the paper I now hold in my hand. If I have rightly understood, the king’s attorney has framed an indictment for the purpose of arraigning and punishing by imprisonment these three inoffensive persons before the bar of this court for a crime of great magnitude,—as disturbers of the peace. May it please the court, what did I hear read? Did I hear it distinctly, or was it a mistake of my own? Did I hear an expression as of crime, that these men, whom your Worships are about to try for misdemeanor, are charged with—with—with what?'</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">* &quot;Having delivered these words in a halting, broken manner, as if his mind was stag-gfering under the weight of a monstrous idea, he lowered his tone to the deepest bass; and assuming the profoundest solemnity of manner, answered his own question: </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>(</sup>Preaching the gospel of the Son of Godf<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font16">• &quot;Then he paused. Every eye was riveted upon him, and every mind intent , . . Amid a silence that could be felt, he waved the indictment three times around his head, as though still amazed, still unable to comprehend the charge. Then he raised his hands and eyes to heaven, and in a tone of pathetic energy, | wholly indescribable, exclaimed, 'Great God!’ , , . The orator continued:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">• ** 'May it please your Worships, in a day like this, when Truth is about to burst her fetters; ... at </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">such</span><span class="font16"> a period, when Liberty, Liberty of Conscience, is about to wake from her slumberin^s, and to inquire into the reason of such charges as I find exhibited here today in this indictment. ... If I am not deceived,—according to the contents of the paper I now hold in my hand,—these men are accused of preaching </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">the gospel of the Son of Godr . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">• &quot;■May it please your Worships, there are periods in the history of man when corruption and depravity have so long debased the human character, that man sinks under the weight of the oppressor’s hand,—becomes his servile, abject slave . . . But may lb please your Worships, such a day has passed. From that period when our fathers left the land of their nativity for these American wilds,— from the moment they placed their feet upon the American Continent, from that moment despotism was crushed, the fetters of darkness were broken, and Heaven decreed that man should be free,—free to worship God according to the Bible. In vain were all their offerings and bloodshed to subjugate this new world, if we, their offspring, must still be oppressed and persecuted. But, may it please your Worships, permit me to inquire once more, For what are these men about to be tried? This paper says, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">for preaching the gospel of the Saviour to Adam’s fallen race!<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font16">• &quot;Again he paused. For the third time, he slowly waved the indictment round his head; and then turning to the judges, looking them full in the face, exclaimed with the most Impressive effect,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">* &quot;'What laws have they violated?'</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">• “The whole assembly were now painfully moved and excited. The presiding judge ended the scene by saying, 'Sheriff, discharge these men.'&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">• In view of the foregoing we can well appreciate why the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States begins with: &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font27" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Nature's</span><br><br><span class="font27" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Thermometers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">A</span><span class="font1">GES before science designed the telethermoscope or the thermograph, nature's thermometers were registering temperatures with astonishing accuracy and beyond the perceptibility of the most modem scientifically developed instruments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Eastern moccasins and copperheads used their built-in thermometers to find their prey. Old Dobbin kept to the road in the blackest night even when blindfolded, detecting the difference in road temperature. The largemouth bass thrives in waters of 80 degrees Fahrenheit, while lake trout prefer a cooler pool of 50 degrees. Worms and caterpillars find their food by skin sense, and specialize in foretelling weather months in advance. Birds and bees will flock together in regions of low humidity and falling temperatures. Crickets wilt chirp so many chirps per minute according to air temperature and begin their song of love each day within five minutes of the original hour selected. Possibly if all nature’s thermometers were known man would have no difficulty in approximating the temperature every hour of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Insect Thermometers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Perhaps the best and most accurate thermometers in nature’s world are those belonging to the insect family. The cricket, the grasshopper and the katydid are among the most accurate and reliable. The bee, the housefly, ichneumons and the sawfly belong to another family (the Hymenop-tera, membrane-winged group). These are mute but show definite reactions to changes in temperature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The male katydid argues throughout the night that Katy “did!” and whether she “did” or “didn’t” time may never tell. But Katy’s case shows Mr. Katydid to be very sensitive to air temperature. In a single tree can be heard the “did’s” and the “dldn’t’s”. This is because the temperature varies in different locations of a tree. On the warmer side are the “did it’s!” her accusers, and in the cooler sections the “didn’t’s!” her defenders. The little lady is mute and has nothing to say for herself. Some say she can’t hear her admirers, but nature has not denied Katy this pleasure. In the front shin of Katy’s anatomy a minute slit has been found, and in this opening is what we might call an eardrum with which Katy listens to and thrives on th&amp; advances of her many admirers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As thermometers they are fairly accurate. The careful study by Cleve Hallen-beck, as reported in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Natural History </span><span class="font1">magazine of June 1949, shows the katydid thermometer to read something like this: 77 degrees and on up, he is sure that she “did it!” From 74 to 76, after the third or fourth call, signs of weakness.are detected with a “didn’t!” here and there. From 67 to 69, fatigue sets in. Chirps are slower and less pronounced. Below 66, a chirp once or twice and a pause. At 63, he sounds raspy and worn out. From 58 to 60, a weak “take me back, Katy” is heard as he fades away. Below 57, she evidently takes him back because no more is heard. At 55, case dismissed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The grasshopper is a daytime thermometer. He loves the blazing sun and the wide</span></p><img src="g_E_19520308_files/g_E_19520308-9.png" alt="" style="width:307pt;height:152pt;">
<p><span class="font1">open spaces. A sensitive weather reporter, but difficult to gauge because he is always on the go. A cool 39 degrees will slow him down to the point that he cannot hop. In temperatures from 47 to 60, he will hop but not fly or sing. His “b-z-z’s” and “z-z-z’s” will begin when the air warms up to a good 65 degrees, and they will mount In force until the thermometer reads 85. His wing motion will be rapid and audible, but in temperatures around 65 degrees his wing motions are slow^nough to be counted and too slow to be heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Temperature Cricket</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of all nature’s thermometers the cricket responds best to temperature changes. At least one has been accurate enough to be called *‘temperature cricket”. One entomologist reports that at 63 degrees a cricket will chirp 100 times a minute. In warmer weather the “b-z-z’s” are much faster, and, as does his cousin the grasshopper, he increases the tempo with the rising temperature. Dr. Dolbear and Dr. Edes timed crickets against thermometers and found that the dark field cricket responded well. Dr. Dolbear's formula was to count the number of chirps it made in 14 seconds and add 40, which sum would equal the air temperature, Dr. Frank E, Lutz’s formula required counting the chirps in 15 seconds and then adding 40, which sum total would equal the degrees in Farhenheit</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hie catch is to get the dark or black cricket to chirp for 14 seconds. He seldom does. The wisest thing to do is count his chirps in 7 seconds, double the number and add 40, which total would equal the day’s temperature. For a more reliable chirper try the snowy tree cricket, alias temperature cricket. He sings in the same spot and almost every day throughout the summer. When the temperature rises to 55 degrees his day begins and when it drops below 55 degrees his day ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These chirpers have been critically checked against the latest scientific temperature recording instruments and have been found as reported in the June, 1949, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Natural History:</span><span class="font1"> '‘The chirps were counted every 5 minutes, and for greater accuracy were counted for 60 seconds and then multiplied by 14/60 in order to obtain the number for 14 seconds. . . . Thus for the first count, at 7:30 p.m,, there were 132 chirps in one minute, which reduced to 30.8 for 14 seconds. Instead of a thermograph, a telethermoscope was used—a quite accurate instrument which measures temperature In terms of electrical resistance. On only four of the 25 counts were the chirps and the temperature record not in practical agreement.... It is quite possible that the difference, which in no case amounted to more than one-fourth of a degree, was due to a slight lag-error in the instrument and to the fact that the cricket was more quickly responsive to temperature changes than was the thermal coil of the instrument—which is not remarkable when we remember that a cricket isn’t one-twentieth the size of the thermal coil of a telethermoscope.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bymenoptera Family insect</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the Hymenoptera family the bee is the most sensitive to temperature changes. When temperatures drop below 57 degrees, the bees will bunch up and buzz to keep warm. Cold weather makes them very temperamental. A cool 50 degrees makes them fighting mad, while a warm 85 degrees makes them very loving and affectionate. Hie busy bee Is not always busy. He is a loafer when it is 90 or 100 degrees and no shade. Can’t blame him, either.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The beetle, housefly and the firefly all respond to temperature changes. The insects vary their flight speed according to degrees Fahrenheit., They can speed up when excited, nervous or angry. In no case do they fly in temperatures lower than 40 degrees. When the thermometer drops below 65 degrees their voice is faint and at 55 degrees they are mute. In below-freezing temperatures all insects lie dormant but not dead. In extreme heat the Insect will remain voiceless although very active.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fuzzy Forecaster</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A woolly bjear caterpillar, which is now being studied by the American Museum of Natural History in New York, is said to forecast what the ensuing winter will be like. It all depends upon whether the brown strip in the middle of this familiar caterpillar, black at both ends, is wide or narrow. Dr. C. H. Curran, curator of insects and spiders at the museum, is wondering whether these little creatures by their coloring do actually foretell the character of winter. For three years they have been right. This year they would seem to indicate that the winter will be mild. Another admirer of this fuzzy creature asserts that in the years from 1913 to 1939 inclusive, “Fuzzy” was right 26 years out of the 27. That isn’t bad even if “Fuzzy” was guessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sensitive Thermometers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For sense incredibly keen to temperature the sensitive sensory perception of the “pit viper&quot; is considered. The following is enough to shame us humans with all our great gifts of intellectuality and intricate inventions. It is quoted from the August, 1946, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reader’s Digest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Scientists at the American Museum of Natural History made tests on snakes of the ‘pit viper’ group, which includes copperheads and rattlers, and which derives Its name from the little indentations or pits in the reptiles’ facial structure. These pits are the organs by which the snakes sense temperature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“In a series of experiments, using two suspended light bulbs which were identical except that one was slightly warmer than the other—snakes will always strike at the warmer of two available targets—the investigators progressively lessened the de* gree of heat-difference between the two bulbs. Thy found that the snakes would still strike at the warmer of the two swinging bulbs rather than the cooler one when the temperature-difference between them had been narrowed to less than two-tenths of one degree centigrade. Incredulous, the scientists undertook further experiments, using the warm bodies of dead mice. The snakes having been blind-folded and their nostrils plugged, they were tested to see how well they could detect the mousebodies just by their radiation of heat. The snakes not only could unerringly sense the warmth at distances at which no human being could detect it at all but they could sense it even at distances at which delicate scientific thermometers were too gross to record any change.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Church of God overseer “Bishop” Homer A, Tomlinson has announced his candidacy for president of the nation in the general election of 1952. Declaring that he is seeking election on a “platform of righteousness”, the bishop has been busy getting a head start on all rivals by means of an energetic speaking tour. He quotes the prophecy of Daniel, infers that the kingdoms of this world are to be given to the &quot;saints of the most high God&quot;, and contends that “the time Is at hand for this fulfillment”. On last July 4 this same &quot;Bishop” Tomlinson carried his extravaganza to perhaps its dizziest heights </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">bo</span><span class="font16"> far In recommending General Douglas MacArthur as future “King of All Nations”. Claiming that he spoke &quot;in dead earnest”, Tomlinson exclaimed that “the world needs a great king over all the nations of men”. He said that the free nations “must needs have one man to symbolize their hope”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Y</span><span class="font1">OUR chance to escape treatment in a mental in-stitution during your life is less than one in fifteen. Facts show more than half of the patients in all U.S. hospitals are mental cases. There is not a medium-sized town or rural county that could not put a mental hygiene clinic to good use. Studies show that at any one time there are at least 1,000,000 persons sufficiently disabled by mental illness to warrant hospitalization, although, because of lack of facilities, only a little more than 600,000 actually obtain it. These are the seriously ill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is estimated that 3,000,000 of the 30,000,000 children now in school suffer from serious emotional and behavior prob* lems. The number of children under 15 be* coming mental patients is alarming. Perhaps three children in every average classroom of thirty pupils are destined to spend part of their lives in a mental hospital. One out of every 10 persons in the nation is suffering from mental ailment, and each year more than 150,000 persons are admitted to mental institutions. One per cent of the nation’s\population are mentally ill and only 10 per cent of them are in hospitals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The tragedy becomes greater when we consider that ope-third of the 350,000 disabling accidents occuring each year are due to mental factors. Mental sickness plays a predominant role in the 1,700,000 crimes committed yearly in the United States, as well as the problems of some 400,000 children under 18 who are sent to juvenile courts each year, the 600,000 cases of chronic alcoholism in this country, and</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">the one divorce granted for every three marriages performed. Of all illnesses that</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">afflict the nation, mental disease is the most widespread and the most dangerous. It is the least understood of all diseases and the least suspected and cared for. It is a greater threat than all other diseases combined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Official statistics show mental disease is on the increase. Mental wards are crammed to the walls. Beds are crowded so close together that patients must crawl over the beds to get out. Some patients sleep two in a bed or on the floor. And there is a waiting list at every institution. Surgeon General Leonard A. Scheele of the Federal Public Health Service reported publicly that state mental hospitals were almost 15 per cent overcrowded in 1948, Dr. Scheele said that if figures for 1949 and 1950 were available they would show added overcrowding corresponding to the increase in population. The estimates on overcrowding were made by officials of twenty-seven states. About 43 per cent of the nation’s mental hospitals reported overcrowding in excess of 20 per cent. Fourteen were 50 per cent or more overcrowded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The number of admissions to state mental hospitals was 664,000. Of these some 173,000 were said to be hospitalized for dementia praecox (schizophrenia is the general term, including dementia praecox which appears in three forms: the hebephrenic type, characterized by silly behavior; the paranoid type, by delusions; and the catatonic form, by taking rigid and often peculiar positions and postures without moving for hours). Other afflictions of those making up the total of 664,000 are senility, mental infirmity due to old age, over 74,000 were listed; manic-depressive insanity, intense mood swings from elation to depression, listed at 72,000; psychoneurosis, malfunctioning of personality, with conflicts, anxiety, disturbed human relations, over 42,000; over 38,000 with paresis, syphilis of nervous system; involutional psychosis, a deep depression often at menopause, listed at 33,000; alcoholism, excessive drinking as an escape from reality, numbered 28,000; cerebro-sclerosis, 89,000; and others, 115,000,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Officials point out that the majority of the patients remain in hospitals for five years when they could be cured or improved in six weeks to three, months, if proper facilities were available* There is immediate need for 20,000 psychiatrists; only some 4,465 are on hand. Fourteen thousand psychiatric social workers are needed. A mete 1,011 are now in service. Psychologists numbering 15,000 and more could be used at once, but only some 849 are in hospitals. Schools need trained psychiatrists or mental hygienists to help children. Local authorities are demanding psychiatrists to help curb crime and delinquency. Equipment, homes and hospitals are in demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1946 all 48 states spent less than $190 million to maintain their hospitals. Today the state of New York alone is spending $1,200,000 on special research projects. The 1951-5Y budget is $143,000,000; and the construction fund is $125,000,000. Of all federal medical funds 40 per cent is spent on mental illness, and the U. S. tax* payers are paying $1,500,000,000 for the upkeep of mental institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conditions in Institutions</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With all the money that is poured Into reconstruction and upkeep of mental hospitals the taxpayer should expect at least halfway decent hospitals for the feebleminded. What do the facts show? Crooked legislation and public neglect have allowed its mental institutions to degenerate below the stench of Dachau’s concentration camp. The dilapidated, overcrowded, undermanned hospital is far from a thing of the past. Naked inmates, milling around in their own filth and dung, in rooms completely bare, or bound lying on bare concrete floors with their bodies gaping with sores, still can be seen. The stench of garbage and old cooking odors enough to flip the strongest stomach fill dingy, ill-ventilated rooms. Inadequate plumbing and heating systems, walls without plaster, and conditions more gruesome than the “black hole of Calcutta” are still a part of the mental tragedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In a mental institution for Negroes, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reader’s Digest</span><span class="font1"> reported, “Little children, adult mental defectives, epileptics, schizophrenics and tuberculars, all mixed in the same wards.” Representative Walter A. Lynch charged that in a New York institution some 575 children were sleeping on mattresses on the floors or in dayrooms. He blamed political bungling as being responsible for the condition. “The^sorry fact is, that other plans for helping our mentally ill have been abandoned left and right. .And on top of that the existing institutions from one end of the state [New York] to the other are badly understaffed and overcrowded. It is a sorry deplorable condition.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In view of the appalling increase at the present and the tremendous cost for the maintenance of mental institutions, the question arises as to what relation world conditions have to this mental decline. Proof is abundant that war or tensions of modem life have materially boosted the</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">insanity rate. War brings Its anxieties, its, fears, its burning hatred, undoubtedly breeding psychosis, as well as psycho-neurosis and .simple neurosis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Dr. Robert P. Knight, medical director of the Austen Riggs Foundation in Stock-bridge, Massachusetts, said the number of casualties in Korea resulting from psychiatric problems was high. During World War H mental or emotional unfitness caused more than half of all discharges from military service, and disqualified another two million. Half of the beds in Veterans Administration Hospitals are occupied by men and women suffering from mental troubles, men and women who passed the physical examination for military service. Fifty per cent of all pensions paid by the Veterans Administration for disability are necessitated because of psychiatric disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The great increase of insanity during fairly peaceful periods, however, indicates that war is not the entire cause. “In far more cases than would be supposed, insanity is precipitated by some actual physical condition, injuries to the brain, epilepsy, brain tumors, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), cerebral palsy, and many others.*’ This bears out the truthfulness of the statement found in the work,, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Mental Illness, A Guide for the Family:</span><span class="font21"> “The most important thing for your patient’s chances of recovery and for your own peace of mind is to realize that mental illnesses are illnesses like any others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The tempo of modern living is too great. Problems seem to multiply faster and reach critical climaxes more sharply. World changes affecting the living of millions are abrupt. Not enough time is allotted the mind to catch up to the reality of the change. Plus overwork, nerve strata, lack of proper food and rest, equals ulcers, jittery stomach, a nervous breakdown or a mental crack-up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">How can insanity and neurosis be prevented? The number of books and movies that have catapulted psychiatry into the news have not brought the desired peace of mind or the oneness between the mind and body. Nor have the countless experiments through hypnotic medicine paraldehyde, electric shock, miracle drugs, barbiturates or bromides, group therapy, vapor baths and countless other methods to produce relaxation of tension. Some can produce harmful effects. Dr. Jules H. Massev-man of the University of Chicago Psychiatric Clinic said experiments showed that “unlike most drugs, electro-shock produced permanent impairment of behavioral efficiency and learning capacity”. He notes a “growing conviction among psychiatrists” that, while perhaps useful in some forms of acute insanity, drastic treatments of this type do lasting damage to the brain and may Involve “potential tragedy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The old-fashioned remedies still seem the best. Dr. Wexler explained: “Love in all its myriad forms still stands as the principal prescription for the treatment of schizophrenia.” “Affection and sympathy, tenderness and approval; these are the medicines of choice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">These are also the fruits of the spirit which only a mind fed on God's Word can produce. While the world struggles to keep itself from falling to pieces, those turning to the Kingdom promise of God’s Word find great peace for both the mind and soul. “Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth faith may enter in. Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee; because he trusteth in thee. Trust ye in Jehovah for ever; for in Jehovah, even Jehovah, is an everlasting rock.” (Isaiah 26:2-4, Afi) For protection from neurosis and insanity and for peace of mind turn to the Word of God. It alone is your hope.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>The Animal9<sup>r </sup>Undertaker?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">A</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">lan Devoe, naturalist authority, has offered an explanation as to why so few' bodies of furred or feathered friend are discovered lying where death overtook the victim by one means or another. With the coming of nightfall the scent of death is picked up by a creature quaintly known as the “sexton beetle”. Shortly, amid a flurry of wings, the air-borne mortician is at</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the side of the deceased. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">_____ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;L The sexton is small, about the size of a finger joint, and attired in a dignified</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">black-and-orange ensemble. His six stout legs are much needed, for though the animals he cares for are of the smaller variety (the rabbit, for example), they are much larger than he. At the scene of his night*s work, the sexton first touches the body in numerous places with its feelers as if “running its fingers” over the corpse in a most professional manner, (Is this an</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">autopsy?) Whatever the precise reason for this, when he has the needed information the sexton slides his own body under the dead animal with his back to the ground. This will give him the maximum strength from his legs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;L The exerting pedaling motion of the beetle’s legs which follows jiggles, jerks and budges </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font1">corpse toward its goal perhaps a half inch at a time. Almost certainly a female sfcxton will join the male and immediately assume her work of pulling from the opposite side while the male pushes as before. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Though </span><span class="font1">the enterprise may take several </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">hours, </span><span class="font1">the tireless sextons labor </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font1">until they reach the nearest </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Soft </span><span class="font1">ground. There they dig away underneath the rabbit, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">what</span><span class="font1">ever their “customer’*, until it is</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">they must be simmering in a canine quarter of thoroughly covered.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">&lt;L Here you might think the sexton’s work is</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Q. </span><span class="font1">As ridiculous as all this is, it is little worse ihan the confusing versions of heaven presented for so long by Christendom’s many religions.

They pluck some of the animal's fur, make it into a ball, and dig a tunnel, where the female will lay her eggs and feed on the dead animal while waiting for the eggs to hatch.

<p><span class="font2">B</span><span class="font1">EING beautiful is a billion-dollar business. By the end of this year close to $900 million will have been spent on cosmetics; another $850 million on treatment and service. Over 68 million heads will have received permanent waves and some 120,000 will have worn their first pair of artificial eyelashes. Another $25 million will have been poured into milk-foam baths, electric massages, postures, etc.; and an additional $50 million will have been turned over for making the ladies slender and shapely; while $21,500,000 will have been spent for beautifying the hands, $28 million for the right shade of lips; and four out of every ten American women will have had their hair colored, face lifted or lips tattooed. This is big business in any man’s language!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Into the beauty business is pooled the genius of ages, of art, of skill, of advertising, and of industry. For milady’s beauty the drugstore, the Fifth Avenue department store, the five-and-ten, and even the little grocery store around the comer sell powder, paint and perfume. For her added convenience, tens of millions of dollars are poured into newspaper ads, movies, television, magazines, billboards and research.

<p><span class="font1">Once entering the innermost sanctums where this mystic magic is performed, beauty is softly touched to try a new course which will take a minimum of 90 hours for only $250. Under the spell of suave beauticians and their magic, a new face, a new figure, a new personality, a new beauty is to emerge! So they say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Behind the portals of this strange world are every type of gadget and device that you could possibly think of. Special fitting contraptions for the buttocks, abdomen, hips and limbs, right down to the ankles. Gadgets for reducing, reshaping and renewing the anatomy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Beast Ui Beauty Business</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">More than a legitimate business, it is a realm of subterfuge and well-trained hypocrites, a world of fakers and outright crooks. Peter Morell, in his book Poisons, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Potions and Profits,</span><span class="font1"> says that the beauty business is the “rankest of all our commercial rackets”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Woman*s urge to be beautiful is what makes the beauty business buzz. Deception is the primary bait of the business. Glaring ads are printed to attract attention: <sup>&lt;f</sup>Permanent complete with hair styling at a very </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">special</span><span class="font1"> low cost.” Once inside the portals of the salon, emphasis is placed on business and not beauty. Every beautician a supersalesman, and every customer a potential victim. The velvet touch with an iron hand of persuasion is applied and the unsuspecting patron often leaves the store equipped with special styling at extra cost plus a permanent costing far more than she expected to spend. A professional beautician makes the following statement: “The main difference in waves is the color of the solution, the different names used and mainly the difference in price.” For a $50 wave, you receive a velvet jewel box and a little more ballyhoo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Gentle Touch</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When madame comes in for her special cold wave, as advertised, the expert operator, with a suave Charles Boyer approach, will say, “Madame, this wave, it eez not for you, no, no, no! I have’jusst zee wave for you—Aloow me to be zee judge, Yes? You have sussh beee-uuu-tee-ful hair, such looo-vely color—How sharming you will look in our very special Zerto Wave. It eez jusst for you. In fact, it eez a personalized wave.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Madame realizes she must decide on a different wave, so reluctantly she asks the cost of such a wave. When told it will cost much more than she had planned she asks for something just as good at a lesser figure. The calculating operator has made the cost high enough so that by reducing the price ever so slightly the patron is satisfied. It did cost much more than she expected to pay, but she is satisfied It is just for her. She' consoles herself with the thought, “After all, I spend so little on myself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hair tinting and facials are all big profit getters. All overhead expenses can be paid by a few good dye customers. A facial under the soothing touch of magic hands will make the customer lose all thought of cost. All special masks and lubricants used only add to the bill, not to the skin. Rigid muscles, the frown, harassed tense nerves— all snap back when madame gets the bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">This Business of Being Deceitful</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Those that cannot afford the luxuries of the beauty parlor make beauty boom on the toilet counters. Special cosmetic preparations for everything, from reducers to rejuvenators. But the path of beauty promised by magic and mysterious potions is strewn with deceit and deadly poison. Misrepresentations are everywhere. In hair dyes, growers, restorers and removers, in deodorants, dandruff removers, in lipsticks and rouges, in cold creams, cleansing and face creams, in hormone cosmetics and face bleaches. Those that call for special attention are wrinkle eradicators, contour preparations, skin foods, nourishing creams, skin tonics and conditioners, host developers and bust reducers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is absolutely no means known to science whereby original color of hair can be restored once it begins to turn gray, no true hair grower or restorer, no known dandruff cure-all. No substance or combination of substances capable of fulfilling benefits these words imply: eyelashgrower, skin-conditioner, scalp food and wrinkle-remover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another &quot;cbme-on” is to exaggerate vitamins in cosmetics. &quot;Vitamin D” and &quot;vitamin F” (not a vitamin but an acid) have been sold to the gullible public. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the American Medical Association</span><span class="font1"> reports: &quot;It is the opinion of several investigators that use of vitamins in soap has no value locally or systemically?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hie greater the hoax the better the seller. So long as its exaggerated drivel promises something new and something different it will sell. This is it! It's a hit! Sales prove it! But is it good? Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, the drug evaluating unit of the American Medical Association, said: &quot;The advertising claims that use of such cosmetics will remove wrinkles, make the skin more soft and pleasant to observe and change older looking persons to younger appearing, attractive and even glamorous people . . . Some promoters incorporate hormones, such as estrogenic hormones. Others use impressive statements about lanolin, carbamide or some so-called special stimulating factor. The end result, regardless of the product and the sales approach, is the same-*—a useless outlay of considerable sums of money by purchasers who still believe in the development of ‘miracle’ compounds.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not only is deceit used, but the profit margin is enough to mafce any head swim. Dusting powder used after bath that costs lie to make retails at 80c; lipstick costing 2c to make sells for $1.00 or more; face powder worth 3c sells for $1.00. These prices are less your 20 per cent federal tax. No wonder beauty business is second in national advertising, while eighty-fifth on the list of American industries. It can afford to spend millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Statistics show beauty business is almost completely dependent upon young women for the bulk of sales. Being beautiful is her primary active problem. At about 30 the average woman has been married 8 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Romance Is secondary to family problems. The urge to be glamorous begins to fade. Beauty is left for only special occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But facts show men are not attracted to capsuled beauty or to a face that looks like something out of a meal bag or ready for a television show. A recent survey conducted by the Atlanta Division of the University of Georgia reports: &quot;Both men and women chose character as a mate’s first quality. Intelligence came second in the list Third was congeniality and compatibility; fourth was personality. In fifth place, men put understanding fair play, and co-operation; sixth, they wanted their wives to be healthy; and seventh, dragged in as an afterthought, was beauty.” For too many years, too many girls have been led to believe that men are more interested to what is outside her head than what she has on the inside. This is no longer true. The late Dorothy Dix, supposed matriarch of human affections/ said: &quot;The truth is that while men like to be seen out with a living picture, they have no desire to hang it on their walls for keeps.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If women believe beauty rather than a pleasant personality and intelligence is what men desire, then they should at least strive for a natural beauty, neatness, cleanliness, and a healthy body. The secret formula for these is, a good toothbrush, a good hairbrush, a good fingernail file, and a good bar of soap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A radiant mind, a charming facial expression, a genuine smile, tinted with love and clothed in the simple garment of modesty, will strike through all deformity of features and eclipse any beauty queen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Christian women will not make beauty their main business in life, but will ornament themselves with the spirit of Christ, perfecting holiness with devotion to God. When they are dressed in the garments of simplicity and humility, beauty will emerge first, not the traits of a peacock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Letter to Churchill on Malayan Discrimination</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">January 4, 1952 Prime Minister</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Rt Hon. W. L. S. Churchill, O.M., C.H., M.P. House of Commons, London, S. W. 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The faculty and staff of this school, assem-bled with 200 members of the Ithaca, New York, congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses, wish here, with to voice a protest and also to present you with some facts in regard to the treatment accorded the Christian missionaries of Jeho. vah's witnesses </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">by</span><span class="font16"> the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Malayan officials,</span><span class="font16"> in causing their deportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">These men, personally known to us all, R. J. Ward, L. Atkinson, R. G. Moffatt and L. McLean, graduated from this school, hence we are able to personally vouch for their Chrijs-tian character and conduct. Therefore, it was a shock to us and other thousands who read this news. Especially disturbing is the fact that even native Malayans who are Jehovah's witnesses are slandered by the Executive Council’s policy that Jehovah’s witnesses are &quot;persons not welcome” in Malaya. That a law formulated as protection against bandits and Communists was invoked to accomplish this is beyond comprehension.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Are the Malayan officials themselves infected with communistic taint, that they are taking such action against Christianity? May we expect to see all Christian missionaries driven from that land ? You have doubtless read of the banning, imprisonment and death sentences imposed on Jehovah’s witnesses in communistic Poland, Eastern Germany and Russia. Why does Malaya imitate these iron-curtain countries? Or has the government acted on the advice of religious enemies of Jehovah’s witnesses, perhaps the religious organization of Vatican City, which has been unable to keep communism out of its own back yard?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is the official legal agency of Jehovah’s Witnesses. This society has been thoroughly investigated by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has declared them to be entirely free from communism. Operating under this society, our school here helps meh and women to carry out the purpose stated in the Society’s charter, paragraph 3, “to improve men, women and children mentally and morally by Christian missionary work and </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">by charitable</span><span class="font16"> and benevolent instruction of the people on the Bible and incidental scientific, historical and literary subjects.” Who can object to such work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">For this cause, in democratic countries Jehovah's witnesses are recognized as Christian ministers. Since the inception of this school in 1943 about 1,700 missionaries have graduated and have gone to nearly 100 lands all over the globe. Not in one case have these been charged with promoting or fomenting communism or any other political ideology. They are Christians, and uncompromisingly champion the high principles of freedom and the Bible in these lands. Persons are not selected to attend this school unless they have an unbroken record </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">oi</span><span class="font16"> at least two years’ full-time ministry. They are not sent out to other lands unless they prove in thair advanced ministerial training here that they have the qualities of Bible understanding and love, and integrity toward the Bible’s standards of righteousness. Then they are qualified to do the educating </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">oi persons oi </span><span class="font16">good will toward God that world-wide reports show they have been doing. The Malayan government, by its action, is saying that it does not want to s^e enlightenment and reading of God's Word by every citizen of the nation, which is the goal of these missionaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This official action by the Malayan government strongly belies any claims they make of being friends of democracy, and appears suspicious to democratic j^oples, in these dark days when world democracy and freedom </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">is being </span><span class="font16">encroached on by those who would subtly crush it out. Perhaps it is a mistake on the part of those responsible. If so, we trust that they will restore the faith of freedom-loving peoples in their good intentions by reversing their actions toward these Christian missionaries whose educational work among the Malayans can only strengthen against communistic tendencies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">We echo the sentiments of hundreds of thousands of lovers of freedom as we unanimously make this protest. And we </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">strongly urge</span><span class="font16"> you to use your offices to see that this error is adjusted immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Respectfully,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">E. A. Dunlap [Signed] Member of the Faculty</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Is Israel the Messianic Nation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">M</span><span class="font1">ANY Bible students today are interested in the state of Israel in Palestine. They believe that prophecy is being fulfilled and that Israel is or will be the Messianic nation. Said one of these, Dr. Carl H. Voss, of the American Christian Palestine Committee, in a tribute to Israel’s minister of religious affairs:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“For us Christians, joint heirs of the Judaic tradition, there is awe hi our hearts as we remember the words: ‘He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root. Israel shall blossom and bud and shall fill the face of the world with fruit? ‘Thou shalt be a blessing . . . and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed? ‘The wilderness and the solitary places shall be glad for thee; and the desert shall rejoice and blossom like the rose? ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If such scriptures apply to modern Israel, then it is the Messianic nation. And if it is the Messianic nation there should be evidence of divine power’s being used on its behalf; its structure would necessarily be theocratic; and its very purpose as well as its accomplishments would have to be according to the divine purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When Moses and Joshua led the Israelites out of Egypt, through the wilderness and into the land ‘flowing with milk and honey’, there was no question about their having divine backing. In fact, this entire movement was Jehovah’s idea, not theirs. And one miracle followed another: the ten plagues, the separation of the waters of the Red sea, the destruction of Pharaoh and his hosts, the falling of the walls of Jericho, etc. The law of the nation was received by Moses from Jehovah God and the people had no part therein except to agree to keep that law. And by all this more than one divine purpose was served: ‘to execute judgment against the gods of Egypt,’ ‘to redeem a people unto Jehovah and to make for himself a great name?—Exodus 12:12; 19:5-8; 20:1-17; 2 Samuel 7:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And in the return of the Jews to their land after the Babylonian captivity there likewise was abundant proof of divine backing and of the divine purpose’s being served. The deliverance came exactly on time, at the end of the 70 years, even as foretold; the very one used to release the Jews, Cyrus, had been named in Bible prophecy as the one to do this; and the. purpose was to build a temple in Jerusalem and restore the true worship there, and that purpose was realized. A theocratic rule was inaugurated. As a result the Jews were kept a people apart to whom the Messiah could come. And when the Messiah came, he established himself as such by the fulfillment of many prophecies and the performance of many miracles.—Ezra 1:1-6; Nehemiah 4:6-17; 13:19-27; Isaiah 45:1-4; Jeremiah 25:11; Luke 24:25-27; John 10:38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Instead of the intervention of divine power, terrorist tactics, political pressures and economic considerations were responsible for the formation of the state of Israel. Its structure is not theocratic, but a combination of democratic and Judaistic principles and laws. Even if it strictly followed the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Torah,</span><span class="font1"> it could not be considered theocratic. Why? Because </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">theocratic</span><span class="font1"> means “according to God’s law”, and with the coming of the Messiah a new arrangement replaced the old law arrangement</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The purpose of the state of Israel is not to promulgate the pure worship as was the case with Israel when leaving Egypt and when returning from Babylon. (Exodus 3:18) As Dr. Herzl, founder of Zionism, discovered, Jewish interest in returning to Palestine was largely on a materialistic basis; the more wealth the Jews had the less they were interested in returning to Palestine: the more they were oppressed, the more they wanted to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Israel today not only is burdened down with acute religious, political and economic problems, but is also making serious problems for the rest of the world by its flouting of United Nations’ authority, by its intransigence and retaliatory methods in dealing with its Arab neighbors and by its treatment of the Arab refugees. Hardly the role of the Messianic nation!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Christian Greek Scriptures abound with proof that Christ Jesus is indeed the promised Messiah, See Matthew 1:1-3, 22, 23; 2:1-6, 15-18; 21:4, 5; 26:15. (For a comprehensive list see </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Equipped for Every Good Work”,</span><span class="font1"> page 21.) The nation of Israel rejected him as their Messiah and thereby lost the opportunity of becoming the Messianic nation. Jesus plainly told therti that their house was abandoned to them and that the Kingdom would be taken from them and given to a nation producing its fruits. Thereafter it became apparent “that God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him”. Also that Jehovah God was turning “his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name”.—Matthew 21:42-45; 23:37, 38; Luke 19:41-44; Acts 10:34, 35; 15:14, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But is not Israel causing the ‘desert to rejoice and to blossom as the rose’? (Isaiah 35:1-6) True, by means of modem irrigation methods, Israel is causing some of Palestine’s desert country to become fruitful, but are not many other nations doing the same thing? Such would not therefore mark Israel as the Messianic nation. Besides, a careful study of the Scriptures reveals that Isaiah chapter 35 has its primary fulfillment in a spiritual sense, which is also true of many other prophecies that speak of Israel’s restoration and prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yes, the Messianic nation is not the natural seed of Abraham, but the spiritual seed- “Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. It says, not, ‘And to seeds,’ as in the case of many such, but as in the case of one, *Ai)d to your seed/ who is Christ.” And associated with him are his anointed followers: “Moreover, if you belong to Christ, you are really Abraham’s seed, heirs with reference to a prom-ise/’-Galatians 3:16, 29, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Likewise, it is not the earthly and natural Israel, Zion and Jerusalem, but the superior, heavenly and spiritual Israel, Zion and Jerusalem that are the Messianic nation. “Jerusalem today ... is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother/* And again, “For you have not approached that which can be felt . , . But you have approached a mount Zion and a city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem/’ Anti spiritual Israel is limited to 144,000. These will reign with Christ 1,000 years for the blessing of all mankind as the spiritual seed of Abraham. —Galatians 4:25, 26; Hebrews 12:18-22; Revelation 7:3-8; 14:1-3; 20:5, 6; 21:1-4, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Today, a remnant of this spiritual Israel is still on earth, upon whom the prophecies of restoration and prosperity have had and are having fulfillment. In light of the foregoing, let sincere students of the Bible, who have been interesting themselves in the state of Israel, investigate the activity of Jehovah’s servants and be convinced.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Ingerprints!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">^ABSERVE,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">V7 </span><span class="font1">Watson!” said the deep, melhw voice in its obvious British accent. The voice's owner cast a familiar silhouette against the wall. It was that of a tall, thin figure with long, pointed nose and large pipe in mouth, the personification of all detective lore, the legendary Sherlock Holmes. And as this fabulous hero symbolizes that field, so has fingerprinting come to provide the starting point in criminal investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Though Orientals of centuries $go are known to have taken finger impressions, it is conceded that their purpose was probably for superstitious or ceremonial reasons. First known mention of the distinctive nature of fingerprints is credited to Marcello Malpighi, anatomy professor of the University of Bologna, in 1686. First scientific notation of the permanent character of the prints came forth from J. E. Purkinje, professor of physiology at the University of Breslau in 1823. But even thereafter general recognition was slow. Sir William Herschel put the first workable plan into effect in the 1870's when he introduced fingerprinting into the courts of India to prevent false impersonation. Finally, Sir Francis Galton founded the present basis for fingerprint identification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fingerprinting answered a long-standing need in the field of criminal investigation. Prior to its adoption, specialists in various lines contributed their respective bits in search of the foolproof system. Dentists came forth with their suggestion: noting the difference in the shape of numan jaws, men of this field suggested that plaster casts of the jaws be made. It can be appreciated that had this become the universal means of tracking down criminals, the Federal Bureau of Investigation would be burdened with quite a space-consuming operation in Washington. Anatomists called attention to the distinct nature of the ears and wanted photographs of these organs to be used for identification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Perhaps more ambitious than any of these would-be benefactors of criminology was the French anthropologist, Alfonse Bertillon (1853-1914), a member of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Surety.</span><span class="font1"> He theorized that the size of certain bony parts of the human anatomy remained constant during adult life. Hence, he took measurements of various bone structures of the body and subdivided them into three major groups: small, medium and large. Next, he classified these through a filing system all his own. Additionally, he prescribed definite rules for recording personal description such as weight, color of hair and eyes, scars, tattoos, etc. Remains of the Bertillon system linger, though the system has long since been generally discarded. During time of bone growth and development, the system has no use whatever, since the structures are not stable. It would certainly bog down, therefore, in tracing today's youthful criminals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One striking advantage of fingerprinting over all of these proposed methods is the obvious fact that no self-respecting crook would be likely to leave behind a cast of his jaw, a photograph of his ears or his skeletal measurements at the scene of the crime. But the most shrewd malefactor has found his undoing literally at the tips of his fingers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That fingerprints are a reliable, unchanging way of identification is now recognized. But what makes this possible? Over the skin surface of the fingers’ endjoint bulbs run friction ridges and alternate depressions. Though prints are classified into four main types, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">arches, loops, whorls</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">composites,</span><span class="font1"> and their subtypes, the exact pattern is unique with each individual. A fountain pen in a skilled hand might easily forge a handwritten signature. But when you leave your fingerprint behind, you have signed your name with ineffaceable ink in lines that no forger in the world can imitate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of course, many have tried. Those who espouse crime as a career have an understandable dislike for this automatic signature. In numerous cases, attempts to deface the papillary ridges failed to alter the print. Scientists point out how, through use of a zinc plate, an alteration can be produced. However, this fopls only the layman or the novice detector at best. Experts invariably note the ruse. Skin grafting has been tried, but it proves virtually impossible to hide the graft. Anyway, the mere presence of the grafted skin is sure to raise suspicion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Demonstrating how long any sign of grafting remains on the print is the interesting case cited by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Science News Letter </span><span class="font1">in 1950, Nearly forty years ago, a young girl sliced away a portion of her finger in a machine. She carefully replaced it, taking care to match the ridges of the skin. Her finger healed following home treatment, but to this day traces of the grafting are evident on her prints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How are fingerprints left on surfaces? This seems to occur through the presence of moisture on the fingers. The moisture results from secretions of salts, water and fatty substances by the sweat glands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such prints are called “latent”. Though they cAn be transferred frofn one surface to another, experts after once comparing an original with a transferred print, can always tell the difference. A mercury powder (mixed with chalk) is applied, then brushed gently away with a camelhair brush. But it was reported in 1949 that English policemen engaged in fulltime fingerprint work had contracted mercury poisoning, either from inhaling the powder or from touching the mouth with hands that had been working in it. When this problem rose in the Lancashire Constabulary, experiments were conducted with a substitute which was afterward adopted, and proclaimed better than mercury powder; Men who were exposed as much as 250 hours a year were declared to be in danger of infection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So permanent is the fingerprint that it remains distinct and unchanged (except for a slight shrinking in old age) from birth till death and even after death. Not until bodily decomposition begins in the grave do the fingerprints vanish. This reminds that prints may also reflect the state of health of their owner. Science </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">News Letter</span><span class="font1"> of November 11,1950, reported that certain illnesses leave their mark in the form of white lines that cross the paths of the ridges at acute angles. These are usually evident on the middle, ring and little fingers of the left hand. These lines were even found to make appearance after death. In fact, it was this discovery that prompted investigation of the sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The American Federal Bureau of Investigation exchanges fingerprints with governments around the world. This effective weblike system of methodically tracking criminals even to the ends of the earth has done much to cut short the careers of gangsters and hoodlums. The shadowy form of Sherlock Holmes is joined today by airplanes, radio and a host of scientific laboratory additions used in this century to thwart crime. But fingerprinting remains a stable part of crime detection. In a word, it is “elementary, Watson”.</span></p>

His 25-year-old daughter, Princess Elizabeth, who was in Africa when her father’s d^ath occurred, became Britain’s’’new Queen Elizabeth. Eight y-four-year-old Queen Mary now becomes Dowager Queen Mother Mary, the widowed Queen Elizabeth assumes the title Queen Mother, and as heir apparent to the British throne young Prince Charlie becomes Prince of Wales. The king actually has little power in the government, except as a figurehead symbolizing the empire’s unity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Islam Protests</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">&lt;$&gt; It is a dangerous oversimplification to think that there are only two sides (communistic and anticommunistic) to today's world problems. Large portions of the world are in ferment, not because they are communistic, but because they have legitimate national aspirations and because distressing poverty has made them rise up in protest. The Communists make the most of this, but the original blame must fall back on the West. People cannot be blamed for objecting when a few outsiders control their country and its wealth. In Tunisia, for example, 300,000 Europeans control 3,300,000 native Tunisians. The Europeans, comprising only 9 per cent of the population, control half to two-thirds of the agriculture, 90 per cent of the industry, virtually all .of the commerce. Violence broke out in January. Nearly 50 persons were killed within 10 days. The Tunisian disorders only intensified nationalist demands in neighboring Algeria and French Morocco. Nationalist groups are impatient. They want self-rule now. This is the case throughout the entire Moslem world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">—And in Egypt</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">&lt;♦&gt; In Egypt increasing tension and terrorism have resulted from the diplomatic deadlock since last October over control of the Suez canal. “Liberation battalions” have been sniping, ambushing and throwing grenades from windows. The lid blew off (1/25) with the fiercest battle between Britons and Egyptians since the British first occupied that land in 1882. When Egyptian police, whom the British accused of helping the terrorists, refused to surrender their arms, 1,500 British troops with tanks, armored cars and Bren guns fought 800 to 1,000 auxiliary police. Forty-three Egyptians and 3 Britons were killed. Then violence erupted In Cairo (1/26). Mobs</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">The Long Talk</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">&lt;$&gt; Twenty months have passed since the Korean war began June 25, 1950. This is longer than the U. S. fought in World War I. Armistice negotiations, which began eight months ago, brought a lull in the fighting, but did not stop it. During the negotiations the Reds built up their forces and are now far stronger than at the start of the talks. Some officials believe they could prevent the present U. N. troops in Korea from mounting a big offensive. Each day’s news recounts the apparently unending excess verbiage that flows forth from the Panmunjom circus tents, while soldiers continue to fight and die. The truce talk deadlock was over U. N. refusal to permit the Communists to build military airstrips during an armistice, and over Communist refusal to exchange prisoners on a voluntary basis. The long talks continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Facts—Only Favorable Ones</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A 400-page U. N. study of the treatment of refugees in 17 countries prompted howls of protest. The Rockefeller Foundation had given $100,000 to finance it. An international team of experts did the work. Then </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font16"> magazine (2/4) reported: &quot;Some of the victims spoke up. Syria resented the report’s stating the fact that beggars abound in Syria;</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">The Cost of Modem War</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the United States the filing on the national debt was $45 billion prior to 1940. With World War II it rose to $300 billion. In June, 1946, the ceiling was reduced to $275 billion, where it now remains. The actual debt in January of $259.4 billion, which is definitely on the way up, amounts to $1,665 for every man, woman and child in the country. As one example of modem war cost, a vastly improved bomb-sight was unveiled before the Senate Military Appropriations subcommittee (2/5). In comparison with the Norden bomb-sight of World War II which cost $8,000 and weighed 50 pounds, the new K-l system costs $250,000 and weighs a ton. Also shown was a new “skysweeper” antlaircraf t gun. The World War H model cost $10,000. This new radar-controlled gun costs $275,000. Commenting on the expense of this and other new military items, Subcommittee Chairman O’Mahoney said that for a nation that believes in individual liberty the high cost is making war &quot;practically Impossible”. But the money is being spent, and the war is definitely feared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">The Presidential Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">&lt;$&gt; The U. S. presidential campaign is warming up. It has been 19 years since the voters changed presidents. The only change since 1933 was the result of a vice-president taking office. By January 20, 1953, Truman will have been president 7 years, 9 months, 8 days. Only nine presidents have served longer, and many think Truman would like to find a substitute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">New Hampshire’s primary on March 11 will get the ball rolling. Although it has little direct </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">effect, as it only</span><span class="font16"> indicates the voters’ preference for a nominee, indirectly the preference shown by this small State (43rd in area, 44th in population) may have a far-reaching effect on undecided voters elsewhere. New Hampshire votes Republican, but also has a Democratic primary. The only Democratic entrants are Estes Kefauver, of crime investigation fame, and President Truman, who still might later'withdraw. Kefauver challenged corruption under Truman and says he is a candidate &quot;to the finish”. TTu-San retorted pointedly that efauver is a good senator and he likes to see good senators in the Senate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Canada Flexes Her Muscles</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">&lt;$&gt; Tremendous progress is evident in the world’s third largest country (next in size only to the Soviet Union and China). Since 1939 Canada has quadrupled her national production. Today she has a world influence never before </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">achieved </span><span class="font16">by a country of only 14 million inhabitants. Her living standard has advanced 50 per cent. The average income for a family of four is $4,000, $622 above the corresponding U. S. average. Minerals, gas and oil are produced in abundance. Three out of five of the world’s newspaper pages are Canadian newsprint, as is this page. The proposed St. Lawrence Seaway</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">will further aid shipment of Canadian products from the Great Lakes area. Although it has been advocated by U.S, presidents since Coolidge, Congress (presumably* influenced by railroads and East Coast </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">shippers) has never given</span><span class="font16"> consent to U.

<p><span class="font16">*$&gt; From Mexico comes the report that as a result of a serious drought the first of an estimated 10,000 families have been forced northward to escape &quot;Imminent starvation”. For centuries they lived in a region extending across the states of Coahuila and Durango, about 250 miles west of Monterrey, where lack of rainfall and accompanying erosion have now made the land unsuitable for cultivation, Nearly half of the area's 180,000 hectares (444,780 acres) of farming land must be abandoned. An emergency program of public works and well-drilling has been ordered by President Aleman to tide over those who can stay until the September rainy season. The district depends on irrigation from wells and a dam on the Aguanaval river, but the water level of the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">reservoirs has dropped</span><span class="font16"> fd Jess' than one-tenth of capacity and the land has dried to dust. The displaced families are being moved to a section of Coahuila, about 200 miles south of the Texas border, where underground water supplies are believed sufficient.</span></p>

Since a cataract is a clouding of the normally transparent lens of the eye* ball, in modem times doctors have cut into the eye, removed the cataract-clouded lens, then tried to make up for this loss with glasses. Now a British eye surgeon reports he has slipped a carefully ground plastic lens Into the eye during 25 operations. Twenty-two have been successful. One patient has worn the lens for two years. Seven have normal vision or better. Five more can read at 20 feet what normal eyes can read at 30. The others<sup>1</sup> vision is poorer. It is hoped that the method will prove successful over a longer period of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Take Care!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">&amp; The' National Safety Council’s report (1/31) that in 1951 U. S. accidents killed 93,000 persons, injured 9 million and cost billion should warn all. The automobile comes first—it killed 37,500; home accidents, 27,000; mishaps at woik, 16,000. Accidental deaths increased 4,000 over 1950. Heeding the warning these figures shout may prevent you from contributing to an even greater accident increase In 1352.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">&lt;$&gt; Traffic deaths jumped 38 per cent during the first month of Britain’s new pedestrian traffic arrangement. New, bold, white “zebra stripes” on the pavement showed where pedestrians had the right of way, but instead of providing safe crossing points, more died on the roads than at any time since wartime blackouts. Poor visibility, inability to stop quickly, overconfidence on the part of pedestrians, all contributed to the toll.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Not Since Eden</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">$ A look at today’s world shows fear of war, corruption and vast unrest among poverty-stricken masses. All lands fear the future. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">’Time</span><span class="font16"> magazine, November 5, reported: “The hand of fate has been on the U. S. with special gravity since World War I; it has disturbed the lives of America's youth since &lt;&nbsp;the ’30’s, through depression and * war. The fear of depression has receded; the fear of war remains.” Despite prog' ress in many fields, no form of human accomplishment has established desirable conditions of peace, health and tranquillity, because, particularly since 1914, Satan the Devil has brought increasing violence to the earth. (Revelation 12:12) This, however, 4s because he knows his time is short and that soon the full blessings of God’s kingdom will restore a divine rule such as this globe has not known since Eden.</span></p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>“JUBILEE TRUMPET” WITNESSING PERIOD—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:25:9-3:25:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Leviticus 25:9, 10</strong></a></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The time is here for sounding liberty among all of earth’s inhabitants, to all races and nations. As conditions worsen and grow more unbearable, why should not people want to be free from such? The great Liberator has decreed that evil will not always prevail. No, his Word of promise offers freedom even now. This good news of liberation must be sounded out as though by trumpet blasts. This is being done by God’s faithful servants world-wide through the distribution of the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine. The “Jubilee Trumpet” Witnessing Period during April affords opportunity for many to take part in this fourth and last month of the <em>Watchtower </em>campaign. The <em>Watchtower </em>magazine is offered at $1 for a year’s subscription. New subscribers receive three Scriptural booklets free. To those already subscribers for <em>The Watchtower, </em>the <em>Awake! </em>magazine may be offered on the same basis. Single copies may be left with those who do not subscribe. Regular house-to-house distribution of the magazine will aid many. So make April a magazine month.</p>

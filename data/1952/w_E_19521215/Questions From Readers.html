<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Is vaccination a violation of God’s law forbidding the taking of blood into the system?—G. C., North Carolina.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The matter of vaccination is one for the individual that has to face it to decide for himself. Each individual has to take the consequences for whatever position and action he takes toward a case of compulsory vaccination, doing so according to his own conscience and his appreciation of what is for good health and the interests of advancing God’s work. And our Society cannot afford to be drawn into the affair legally or take the responsibility for the way the case turns out.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">After consideration of the matter, it does not appear to us to be in violation of the everlasting covenant made with Noah, as set down in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:4-1:9:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 9:4</a>, nor contrary to God’s related commandment at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:10-3:17:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>. Most certainly it cannot reasonably or Scripturally be argued and proved that, by being vaccinated, the inoculated person is either eating or drinking blood and consuming it as food or receiving a blood transfusion. Vaccination does not bear any relationship to or any likeness to the intermarriage of angelic “sons of God” with the daughters of men, as described in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:1-1:6:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 6:1-4</a>. Neither can it be put in the same class as described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:18:23-3:18:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Leviticus 18:23, 24</a>, which forbids the mingling of humans with animals. It has nothing to do with sex relations.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Hence all objection to vaccination on Scriptural grounds seems to be lacking. The only proper objection that some persons could raise to it would be on the matter of the health risks involved or of keeping their blood stream clean from diseased matter coming from a foreign source, whether from an animal sore or from a human sore. Medical science, in fact, claims that vaccination actually results in building up the vitality of the blood to resist the disease against which the person is inoculated. But, of course, that is a question for each individual concerned to decide for himself and as he sees it to be Jehovah’s will for him.</p>

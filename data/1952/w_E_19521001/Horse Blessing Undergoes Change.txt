Horse Blessing Undergoes Change
● Although there is no mention in the Bible of Paul’s ever having his tent-making tools “blessed” so he could outshine competing tentmakers, or of Jesus’ sprinkling Peter’s fishing boat with “holy water”, certain Roman Catholic officials make a regular custom of “blessing” farm animals and inanimate tools. The London Catholic Herald last November 16 explained that “the traditional Blessing of the Horses outside the Church of St. Leonard near Boerwang, Bavaria, has undergone a change” due to the shortage of horses. This opportunity was not taken to free the people from this church-fostered superstition and unnecessary ceremony, but now the Catholic Herald shows the priest walks between rows of tractors and “the blessing is still given—a blessing similar to that given at rallies of cars seen in a number of towns and cities in various parts of Europe”.

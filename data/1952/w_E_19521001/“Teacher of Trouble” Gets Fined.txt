“Teacher of Trouble” Gets Fined
“He that practices vile things hates the light and does not come to the light, in order that his works may not be reproved.” (John 3:20, NW) Those words of Jesus addressed to a religious leader of his day are as applicable to the religious leaders of today as they were to the religious leaders in Jesus’ day. This the following experience had by a Kingdom publisher in Rhodesia, South Africa, clearly shows:
“I must tell you of the trouble that befell me one day as I was making known the good news of the Kingdom on the streets. I was getting along with the work very well when suddenly a Roman Catholic priest came up and asked, ‘What are you doing?’ I replied that I was doing the witness work in praise of the kingdom of God. He then said, ‘You witnesses are deceivers.’ He became violent and began hitting me and taking my books from me and tearing them up. A crowd gathered and soon a white policeman came, asking, ‘What’s going on here?’ Some of the people in the crowd told him that a Watchtower man was there. The policeman then asked the priest, ‘What has this man done?’ The priest told him that he saw me preaching. The policeman then asked me if I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and when I told him I was he asked for my identification. I showed him my certificate which showed I was a minister and a teacher as well.
“Then the policeman turned to the Roman Catholic priest and said, ‘Aren’t you a teacher as well?’ When he had said that he was, the policeman asked him, ‘Then why are you hitting your fellow teacher? What made you tear his books? Are you a teacher of trouble?’ The matter was taken to court and the priest was ordered to pay £2-2-6 (about $6.00 U. S. currency) for the books he had destroyed.”

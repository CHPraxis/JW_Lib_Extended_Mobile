<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Although there is no mention in the Bible of Paul’s ever having his tent-making tools “blessed” so he could outshine competing tentmakers, or of Jesus’ sprinkling Peter’s fishing boat with “holy water”, certain Roman Catholic officials make a regular custom of “blessing” farm animals and inanimate tools. The London <em>Catholic Herald </em>last November 16 explained that “the traditional Blessing of the Horses outside the Church of St. Leonard near Boerwang, Bavaria, has undergone a change” due to the shortage of horses. This opportunity was not taken to free the people from this church-fostered superstition and unnecessary ceremony, but now the <em>Catholic Herald </em>shows the priest walks between rows of tractors and “the blessing is still given—a blessing similar to that given at rallies of cars seen in a number of towns and cities in various parts of Europe”.</p>

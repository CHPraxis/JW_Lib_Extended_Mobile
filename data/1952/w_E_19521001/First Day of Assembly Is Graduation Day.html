<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Mammoth Yankee Stadium in New York city will again serve as the site of graduation exercises for the Watchtower Society’s School of Gilead. In 1950 it seated more than seventy thousand persons from scores of nations while they were spectators of the graduation of Gilead’s fifteenth class. That was on July 30, opening day of the international assembly of 1950. Now history seems headed for a repetition, for on July 19, opening day of the proposed 1953 international assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses, Yankee Stadium will again accommodate many thousands from many nations as they witness the graduation of Gilead’s twenty-first class. This class will, like the assembly, be international, its students being drawn from many nations. These graduating students from many lands will have interesting experiences from their native shores to relate, giving international flavor to this opening day’s program. In fact, both the class that precedes and the class that follows the twenty-first will also be international, and representatives from both these groups will add to the day’s flavorful international scope by offering some of their more outstanding experiences in gospel-preaching under conditions far different from those of their brothers in other parts of the earth. But with all of the variety of preaching conditions and problems and persecutions, and with all the different racial and national extractions of the ones doing the preaching, there is a oneness of ministerial method and godly devotion that will be thrillingly portrayed on opening day. Do not miss it. In fact, miss none of this international assembly. Be there from start to finish, from July 19 to 26, 1953. Plan now to be there then.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Millions today are in a poverty-stricken condition. The inability of men to improve the lot of the oppressed masses and to lift their burdens makes relief seem unattainable. However, most disturbing is not the lack of material riches, but the spiritual poverty everywhere in evidence. Here the wise words of the Master Prophet come to mind: “Happy are those who are conscious of their spiritual need.” He knew of Jehovah’s promise to raise up the poor out of the dust and to lift up the needy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:7-19:113:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 113:7, 8</a>, <em>AS</em>) Literally millions of such poor people are to be found throughout the earth today. They need to be fed with wholesome spiritual food from God’s Word to put them into a healthy state of heart and mind and to strengthen them for right works. <em>Watchtower </em>readers may aid others during the month of March by taking the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine to people in their locality, and so publish uplift and comfort for those who hunger and thirst for righteousness. Present the <em>Watchtower </em>offer of a year’s subscription and three booklets for $1. Then, if not associated with a company of Jehovah’s witnesses, send a report of your “publishing” work to the Brooklyn office.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Millions of sincere persons practice religion. These maintain that religion is beneficial and aids them to live and work for a better and happier life. Others assert that because of the vast number of religions on earth today, and the variety of viewpoints on the subject, many persons are confused and perplexed as to just what good religion has accomplished and thus are unable to determine whether it is worth having or not. Also, religion’s part in world affairs and its contribution to present world conditions cause many to question religion’s value today. Here, however, is an opportunity to find a satisfactory answer to a vital question. The 352-page book <em>What Has Religion Done for Mankind? </em>brings to the reader’s attention an enlightening treatise on the world’s leading religions. With the aid of this absorbing book you will be able to determine for yourself what religion has done and to decide which religion is good and true.

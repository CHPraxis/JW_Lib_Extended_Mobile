“Out of the Mouth of Babes”
● The press caught on to the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses being held in mid-November, 1951, and the city itself, Victoria, British Columbia, seemed to catch the spirit of the thing. Publishers on the street were approached with: “Where is this convention to be held?” “What is its purpose?” “Do you have a copy of the program?” “I’ll be there!” A naval officer approached two of the witnesses, identified by means of their lapel badges, and said to them: “What’s this all about? Why, I stopped two of your little girls about eight or nine years of age; they were wearing your placards. And I asked them questions which clergymen were unable to answer for me, and I got answers, logical answers, from the little girls! What in hell have you guys got over there, anyway?” The brothers replied that about the best way for him to find out would be for him to come over and see and listen for himself. The officer replied: “That’s just what I’m going to do, as soon as I change my clothes!” He not only came but he turned in his name as being interested and asked that a call be made anytime before six p.m. A picture in one of the papers of a young brother giving a ministry school student talk caused many to comment: “A nine-year-old giving a Bible talk!” His poise and his ability to speak intelligently and extemporaneously helped open the eyes of many that saw and heard him.

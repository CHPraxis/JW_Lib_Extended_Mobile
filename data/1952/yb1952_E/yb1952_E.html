<p><span class="font12">1952 Yearbook </span><span class="font10">of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">J</span><span class="font8">EHOVAH, the great Sovereign Ruler of the universe, has shown undeserved kindness to the least of humanity, men and women just like us. Paul was a recipient of this undeserved kindness. He appreciated it so much, he just had to express it in words as well as in works. The gratitude to Jehovah that was Paul’s he wanted all other persons to feel too. That is why he wrote so fervently to Timothy, saying: “I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who delegated power to me, because he considered me trustworthy by assigning me to a ministry, although formerly I was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man. Nevertheless, I was shown mercy, because I was ignorant and acted with a lack of faith. But the undeserved kindness of our Lord abounded exceedingly along with faith and love that is in connection with Christ Jesus. Trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance is the saying that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. Of these I am foremost. Nevertheless, the reason why I was shown mercy was that by means of me as the foremost case Christ Jesus might demonstrate all his longsuffering for a sample</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">of those who are going to rest their faith on him for everlasting life.”—1 Tim. 1:12-16, A<sup>7</sup>W.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was so fine of Paul to speak frankly to this young man Timothy, who also wanted to gain life and who could gain it too, because of the undeserved kindness of Jehovah. Acknowledging his insolent disposition in times past, Paul tells Timothy of the undeserved kindness God showed toward him even though he was a blasphemer. He appreciated this love. The abounding joy in Paul’s expression to Timothy was over the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ had considered him trustworthy and had delegated him to be a minister. What an assignment! What a privilege! Paul certainly appreciated his ministry, and in the book of Acts the account of his life of service shows that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When, on another occasion, Paul wrote to the Ephesians he also had this same thought—the ministry—in mind. He told the congregation at Ephesus that God had extended to him a kindness that was undeserved. Certainly neither Paul nor the Ephesians nor any other of the human family deserved kindness from God. But still Paul was shown such love and was given the opportunity to declare good news to the nations concerning God’s love and to make known the majesty, the power and the wonderfulness of the Creator and his Son. Paul stated it this way, when he wrote to the Ephesians: “To me, a man less than the least of all holy ones, this undeserved kindness was given, that I should declare to the nations the good news about the unfathomable riches of the Christ and should make men see how the sacred secret is administered which has from past eternity been concealed in God, who created all things.”—Eph. 3: 8, 9, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah did something for Paul. He was now a free man in line for everlasting life. He came away from the bondage of that old system of things in which he had lived, and now for the first time he had freeness of speech that comes to God’s people through knowledge of Jehovah. What Paul learned about God’s revealed purposes through Christ Jesus gave him confidence to do his work, through his faith. This faith was never shaken. He proved this by doing good works now in the role of a persecuted man, not the persecutor he had once been. His trials, tribulations and buffetings were many; still he was faithful unto death. He was a man of integrity. He knew God’s will and he was 'resting his faith in Christ for everlasting life’. Paul must have been an inspiration and a good example for others to follow, because he himself was following in the footsteps of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But what about other Christians? Were they faithfully following Christ? Did God’s undeserved kindness have the same effect on them as it did on Paul? Yes, it did. Consider the early Christians: The Jews had failed as a nation to keep their covenant with Jehovah God. They were once chosen to be God’s name-people, but now when Jehovah had revealed the sacred secret, his Son Christ Jesus as the Messiah, they would not accept him. So the call went forth to the Gentile nations in order to take out from them a people for God’s name. The sacred secret that had been concealed for generations, that is, how Jehovah God would bless all the families of the earth, was now revealed in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">According to it Jehovah had now shown mercy and undeserved kindness toward the Gentiles as well as the Jews. Both kinds of “nations”, or all kinds of men, could now accept the Messiah and get in line for everlasting life. Truly, Jehovah God knew from the foundation of the world how he was going to work out his purposes for the blessing of all the families of the earth and the vindication of his name, even though he had not revealed this to the fullest extent in times past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For centuries Jehovah God had no dealings with the Gentiles, but now the way was open for them to become Christians, God’s chosen servants, Jehovah’s witnesses. In writing to the Romans about their being shown so much mercy and so much kindness not deserved (for they had done nothing to honor Jehovah), Paul exclaimed : “Oh the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge! How unsearchable his judgments are and past tracing out his ways are! For ‘who has come to know Jehovah’s mind, or who has become his counselor?”’ (Rom. 11: 33, 34, A’F) It is incomprehensible, but still Jehovah’s undeserved kindness was extended to the Gentiles; and those who dedicated themselves to the Most High and came into the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">congregation</span><span class="font8"> or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">visible organization</span><span class="font8"> became spectacles before men and angels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was about nineteen hundred years ago that this visible organization, the congregation of God’s people, was brought into existence. The recipients of this undeserved kindness were taken into a new covenant with God, not the old law covenant. The old one mediated by Moses had been abolished with the impaling of Christ Jesus. This new covenant was the law of God written in the hearts of the covenanters, not on tablets of stone. These New Covenant persons were to be “a people for his name”. These were the ones like Christ Jesus, namely, Paul and all the early faithful followers of Christ, the pro-claimers of the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A new system of things, a new organization, was starting, and it was of vital importance. The selection of the bride of Christ had begun and it was to be made up of 144,000 faithful followers of the Lord Jesus. At that time this selection of the bride and the forming of this visible organization wherein each individual must be faithful unto death was a very serious matter; and so the members appreciated to the full that they must work together in unity, because in God’s undeserved kindness he had brought them together for a special purpose. Eventually the eyes of the world would be upon them and certainly the angels in heaven were watching the outworkings of God’s marvelous arrangements. Here were the announcers of Jehovah’s kingdom, which is the only hope of the world. Could there be anything any more vital or important?</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>“FREENESS OF SPEECH”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah had purposed that men should “see how the sacred secret is administered”, and hence that which had been concealed in God was now being revealed, and “this was to the end that now to the governments and the authorities in the heavenly places there might be made known through the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">congregation</span><span class="font8"> the greatly diversified wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which he formed in connection with the Christ, Jesus our Lord, by means of whom we have this freeness of speech and an approach with confidence through our faith in him. Wherefore I ask you not to give up on account of these tribulations of mine in your behalf, for these mean glory for you”. (Eph. 3:10-13, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font8">Yes, “the eternal purpose which he [Jehovah] formed in connection with the Christ” was now being accomplished. Things were moving ahead to the vindication of Jehovah’s name and word. The congregation of God was now his visible organization making known the good news about Christ and heralding the glad tidings of the kingdom of the heavens. A true foundation was laid with Christ Jesus, the faithful and true witness, and, come what may, whether tribulations to any individual member of the congregation or the dispersing of the companies of Jehovah’s witnesses, all would still “rest their faith on him for everlasting life” and speak with the wonderful freeness of speech Christ Jesus had given them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You see, during his ministry Jesus introduced a freeness of thought and speech that had vanished from the earth by his time. It was he who said: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (John 17: 3, AW) The world’s religions had a powerful hold on the people. Millions of persons of all nations, tribes, peoples and tongues were in a definite rut. The truths Jehovah had set forth centuries before Jesus’ time were till then hidden. The Israelites were just as bad off as all the other nations, for they had forsaken Jehovah’s teachings for the traditions of men. When Christ Jesus came he demonstrated by his words and actions a freeness of speech that cheered the hearts of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">His sayings were not based on any old false religious tradition. What he taught he did not learn in the schools of his day. He learned it by studying the Hebrew Scriptures, by communicating with God in prayer and by dedicating himself to doing his Father's will. It was this anointed One, the Master, who said: “The truth will set you free.” (John 8: 32, AW) Certainly Jesus was free from this old world. He was no part of it even though he was in it. He was a man free to say the things that were true and righteous and an honor to Jehovah’s name. He was free to do the things that would bring praise to his heavenly Father. He restored pure worship of the Most High God. He condemned hypocrites and false religions with their idol worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul recognized these priceless and fearless qualities in Christ Jesus, and it was through Christ Jesus that he himself received his freeness of speech. To speak the truth concerning Jehovah and his Son and God’s kingdom was certainly speaking freely, for all nations and their rulers were and still are against Jehovah God’s kingdom and its rule by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All the persons in the congregation of God must have this same freeness of thought and expression and must no longer be tied down to the oppressive thinking of the world. They must not be caged up or hemmed in; they must come forth free from this world’s prison houses. Jehovah made provision for this freedom through his Son Christ Jesus. It was Christ who said in the synagogue in Jerusalem one sabbath day: “Jehovah’s spirit is upon me, because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor, he sent me forth to preach a release to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send the crushed ones away with a release, to preach Jehovah’s acceptable year.” (Luke 4:18, 19, W) He was quoting from Isaiah, chapter 61, and from that moment on he went forward doing that great work of releasing the captives, or sending the crushed ones away with a release. He pointed to Jehovah’s acceptable year of freedom now from this old world. The time had now come for people to be free from the bondage of this dying old world, and Christ Jesus was showing them the way to that freedom. The congregation of God knew this!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus had not preached this freedom message too many years before the scribes, the Pharisees and the rulers of that day had had enough of his free speech which he was talking throughout Palestine. It became the determination of these worldly mighty ones to do away with him. The record is clear as to how, time and time again, these scribes and Pharisees tried to trap Jesus and bring about some sort of false trial and a cause to silence him. Eventually they succeeded in having him impaled upon the torture stake until dead. Now he could talk no more. What relief for them I They were confident that freedom of speech had been stifled. No longer would people be trying to free themselves from the influence of the scribes and Pharisees and be listening to this man. They thought they could hold their people in their prison houses. But how wrong they were! Consider Jesus’ prayer and note his request to his heavenly Father for those he was leaving behind:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I have made your name manifest to the men you gave me out of the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have observed your word. They have now come to know that all the things you gave me are from you; because the sayings that you gave me I have given to them, and they have received them and have certainly come to know that I came out as your representative, and they have believed that you sent me forth. Also I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world and I am coming to you. Holy Father, watch over them out of respect for your own name which you have given me, in order that they may be one just as we are. I have given your word to them, but the world has hated them, because they are no part of the world just as I am no part of the world.” (John 17:6-8,11,14, A<sup>7</sup>TF) Jesus’ disciples had the truth and they must speak it. They did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was shortly after the resurrection of Christ Jesus that he organized his followers so as to accomplish the great work to be done. When talking with his disciples he had told them that they would remember the things he had spoken to them and that he would send them a helper, God’s spirit, to remember these important things. “I have many things yet to say to you, but you are not able to bear them at present. However, when that one arrives, the spirit of the truth, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak of his own impulse, but what things he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things coming. That one will glorify me, because he will receive from what is mine and will declare it to you.”—John 16:12-14, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The spirit was poured out upon them at Pentecost, just as Jesus said. “And while he was meeting with them he gave them the orders: 'Do not withdraw from Jerusalem, but keep waiting for what the Father has promised, about which you heard from me; because John, indeed, baptized with water, but you will be baptized in holy spirit not many days after this.’ ” (Acts 1: 4, 5, AW) Their minds were then filled with the truths that Jesus had taught them and they moved forward fearlessly preaching the kingdom of the heavens is at hand. (John 14: 25, 26) All the persecutions, trials and difficulties they endured; their being jeered by mobs of incensed people and even imprisoned never halted them. Freedom of speech they had gained through Christ Jesus, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, and it was theirs to keep. No, they were not going to be prisoners again, for Christ Jesus had released them. The prophet Isaiah had declared: “Say to the prisoners, Go forth.” (Isa. 49: 9) Jesus did just that to the prisoners. His disciples were free men now and they went forth making proper use of their freedom by preaching the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They traveled to the lands near Palestine, Peter to the east as far as Babylon and Paul west probably as far as Spain. They practiced God-given freeness of speech. They said to those in prison, 'Go forth! Listen to this good news! Have confidence and faith through Christ Jesus in Jehovah God the Creator of the universe. Trust in his precious promises and seek the way to eternal life.’ The gathering together of those who loved truth and righteousness began and God’s visible organization was made manifest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul, of course, was one of the outstanding missionaries and evangelists of his day. He said to those whom he met and taught the truth that they should walk worthily of the things where-unto they were called. They should no longer live in a proud, austere manner, as the peoples of the world lived. Rather, they should be humble and show lowliness of mind. They should be mild and long-suffering, “putting up with one another in love.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Accomplishing this loving attitude means the making of a strong organization of brothers, and then great work can be done in the interest of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>TAKEN CAPTIVE BY CHRIST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Paul was explaining the proper attitude of mind Christians must have. No longer were they under the oppressive rule of Satan’s world as subjects of that old system of things, but Christ had purchased them with his blood. They were his possession. Paul says: “What! Do you not know that the body of you people is the temple of the holy spirit within you which you have from God? Also, you do not belong to yourselves, for you were bought with a price. By all means, glorify God in the body of you people.” (1 Cor. 6:19,20, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> Paul was certainly happy to be such a bought one, a prisoner in the Lord, one led captive by Christ. He told the Ephesians he was a “prisoner in the Lord” and said: “Now to each one of us undeserved kindness was given according to how the Christ measured out the free gift. Wherefore he says: ‘When he ascended on high he led captive a multitude; he gave gifts in men.’” (Eph. 4:7, 8, NW) In order to free those followers of his who had been held in bondage Jesus had to capture them and take them to himself into his organization. So the thousands who heard the truths that Jesus had expressed were led to him and were made to think as he thought. They thus had the mind of Christ. They were freed from this old dying world. To all these free people “he gave gifts in men”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These “gifts in men” were apostles, prophets and evangelists, men who went about from congregation to congregation serving them. They were able to speak in tongues, to interpret and to heal. They were given the gifts of the spirit, which were in effect in Paul’s day. (1 Corinthians 12, NW) These men helped the young congregation, the visible organization of the Lord, to get strong and bind themselves in unity so as to be used in his praise and worship. Paul, who was one of those “gifts in men”, appreciated that he had been freed from the old system of things, and he was grateful for this undeserved kindness on the part of God. Whether as a prisoner in chains at Rome or as one taken captive by the Lord Jesus Christ, he was glad to be made a prisoner of the Lord, as he stated in Ephesians 4:1-3 (NW): “I, therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, entreat you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called, with complete lowliness of mind and mildness, with longsuffering, putting up with one another in love, earnestly endeavoring to observe the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace.” Paul the prisoner wanted the visible organization of the Lord to be at unity, at oneness with one another. There was work to do in the new visible organization under Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The congregation of God was to be made up, not of individuals who were striving for prominent positions, but of servants. (Jas. 2:1-4, NW) Jesus was the example for the congregation and he said that he who was greatest among his brothers was to be their slave. Jesus showed his lowliness of mind by washing the feet of the disciples on the night of the last passover and at the introduction of the memorial of his death. (John 13, NIL) Here he was showing how they must humble themselves and be slaves to their brothers. These apostles were the principal ones who were called to be “gifts in men”, evangelists, shepherds and teachers, and they were not to lord it over the flock, but they were to be shepherds and care for the visible organization. (1 Pet. 5:2-4, NW) These special representatives were to help all the individuals in the congregation to see their responsibility to be ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Having been called to the Lord’s organization and given the freeness of speech, then every individual in the visible organization should walk worthily of the calling with which he was called. All, shepherds and flock alike, had the same responsibility. Faithfulness in service as ministers was required.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>ONENESS AS A BODY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">So then, the congregation must see alike and have the same positive views in mind. All must realize that the purpose for gathering together these servants of the Most High was to preach this good news of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness, to magnify Jehovah’s name, to announce the Son Christ Jesus and to make public expression concerning the sacred secrets that God has revealed through his Word. All those within the Lord’s visible organization must work together to this one end. They could not work against one another, for the members that compose the body certainly do not work against other members. That is why Paul went on to say at Ephesians 4:4-6, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW:</span><span class="font8"> “One body there is, and one spirit, even as you were called in the one hope to which you were called; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all persons, who is over all and through all and in all.” Jehovah was dealing with all the body members through His Word and His visible organization, and, what is more, he is doing the same in this our day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Look at the situation as it existed back there in Paul’s day: Jews were coming into the truth, some of whom had been taught under the Pharisees, others under the Sadducees. Paul himself was formerly a Pharisee. There were Egyptians, people from Asia Minor, Greece, Babylon and other far-flung parts of the world—all of them mixed together in the one congregation of the Lord. At one time all had different ways of life, different religions and teachings, but now they were to live together under one God with one Bible, the Word of God, as their guide. They were to make up his visible organization, having freeness of speech and a determination to do the Lord’s will. If this organization was to be successful, then they must work together just as the members of the human body work together: the head, the arms, the organs—all must function to the best interests of the whole body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul was impressing upon the minds of the Ephesians that there is just one body and that governing this one body is one spirit, God’s spirit. They were all called in the one hope, the hope of being joint heirs with Christ Jesus in the heavenly kingdom and of living eternally. All had the same faith based on God’s infallible Word, the same baptism and the same Father in heaven. Therefore there should be no difference in viewpoint as far as the members of the body were concerned, but they should all be striving to accomplish the great work of carrying on the clean worship of the Most High God, sharing in the vindication of His name and Word and aiding all people of good will to get the knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes. It was done in Paul’s day; it is being done in our day, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then do Paul’s wise words that Jehovah would have an active, working visible organization find fulfillment today? Where is there an organization today like the congregation about which Paul was talking? Could there possibly be a group of people today who have one Father, the Father of all the persons in the congregation, a Father who is over all, through all and in all, a Father who is earing for his children and keeping them together in the pure way of worship? What a privilege and pleasure it is to answer Yes, yes, there is such an organization. In the apostles’ day you could find such a visible organization in the early congregation of Christ. In this year of 1952 you will find it in a group of Christian people known as Jehovah’s witnesses. They make up Jehovah’s visible organization. What is more, you can be in that organization if you think like Paul and have faith like his.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Note how Jehovah’s witnesses today are like the early congregations of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses: Jehovah’s witnesses are firm believers in God’s Word. They study it; they preach it, and they live it. They are “putting up with one another in love”, even though their customs and habits of life and the tongues they speak in their daily conversation are different in all parts of the world. They are fulfilling the command to preach the Kingdom in all the world for a witness. (Matt. 24:14, NIT) Thus in all parts of the earth they demonstrate the unity of God’s visible organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>ORGANIZING FOR THE MINISTRY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah is the greatest organizer and he taught his Son Christ Jesus how to organize. When on earth Christ selected disciples and taught them how to gather more workers who loved truth and righteousness. At that time it meant a “little flock”; now it means the gathering of a “great crowd” of “other sheep”. So as to assemble the “little flock” Jesus arranged for organizing the congregation and developed that into a strong working unit, with competent servants. Hence the apostle Paul quotes Psalm 68:18 and says: “He gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as missionaries, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the training of the holy ones for ministerial work, for the building up of the body of the Christ, until we all attain to the oneness in the faith and in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown man, to the measure of growth that belongs to the fullness of the Christ; in order that we should no longer be babes, tossed about as by waves and carried hither and thither by every wind of teaching by means of the trickery of men, by means of craftiness in contriving error.”—Eph. 4:11-14, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah God was very much interested in the proper organization and care of the early congregation. The Son Christ Jesus meted out the gifts of the spirit to his followers so that some could act as apostles, others as prophets and missionaries and still others as able teachers. But what was the purpose of all this in the body of Christ ? This: “The training of the holy ones for ministerial work, for the building up of the body of the Christ, until we all attain to the oneness in the faith.” Today this visible organization is also being used to aid the “great crowd” of “other sheep”. These are not of the ^Tittle flock” but they must be brought to maturity in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God. These are not the ones to be joint heirs with him in the heavenly kingdom, but they will gain life under it in the new world of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Everyone who ever comes to the Lord’s organization, having studied the Lord’s Word, must see it only one way. God never purposed that there would be hundreds of different denominations throughout the world, each having a different faith, a different doctrine, etc. There could be only “one faith, one baptism; one God and Father’’. Jehovah is desirous that everyone who seeks salvation come to an accurate knowledge of these truths. (Rom. 10:11-13, W) He wants them to become full-grown, mature men. The only way a person can become full-grown is to gain knowledge, and this comes through education. The false religions are not disseminating this accurate knowledge from God’s Word. On the other hand, Jehovah’s witnesses want all kinds of men to be well acquainted with their Bibles and have this one faith. If they have this faith they will manifest themselves as Christ’s “other sheep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The education that was being brought to the “little flock” members in the days of the apostles was for the training of the holy ones for ministerial work. The whole apostolic organization was an organization of ministers. It was not a laity class, with one or two clergymen over each congregation. All this training and instruction then being given the “little flock” was to make every member of that flock a fully competent ordained minister. There were not to be any spiritual babes in the organization for long. New ones would be coming in all the time, that is true, but they would not remain babes in the Word, “tossed about as by waves and carried hither and thither by every wind of teaching by means of the trickery of men.” There was not to be a division of ideas, with part of a congregation believing one thing and the other part another. By study all were to become mature, full-grown men. There must be unity in God's visible organization. As it was then with the “little flock”, so it must be now with the “other sheep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There was to be no stunting of growth, no relaxing. All were to watch for the trickery of men. There was no arrangement to branch off into a little Methodist group, or Baptist group, or some other religious organization and be content with one man’s teaching. Jehovah’s Word points out that one person may plant, another person may water, but it is Jehovah God who gives the increase. They all belong to God, not someone else.—1 Cor. 3: 6-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Being recipients of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness now and belonging to Jehovah, the “other sheep” should work hard to become full-grown and to stay in God’s visible organization. To do this everyone must have the same mind. Study the truth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul went on to say, in his argument to the congregation of God: “But speaking the truth, let us by love grow up in all things into him who is the head, Christ.” (Eph. 4:15, AW) Yes, the vital thing was the speaking of the truth. The only place the apostles, evangelists and the missionaries of that day got the truth was from God’s Word. It is the same now. Jehovah’s witnesses today regularly receive visits from mature brothers, special representatives of the Watch Tower Society, and all of these are required to speak and live the truth as set forth in God’s Word. Not only these mature brothers, but the whole congregation of God, his visible organization, must look at things from God’s Word, seeing harmoniously and having God’s mind on matters along with his spirit. By closely associating one with another and by showing love for Jehovah and our brothers, “let us by love grow up.” If we did not have love in God’s visible organization there certainly would be a standing still and a retarding of growth. When there is discord and strife there is no advancement. When there is peace, love and joy, things grow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The growing human body is a wonderful example of harmonious movement, function and co-ordination. A body can do things, can get work done; and while it is made up of many members, still there is no opposition on the part of any member of the body in accomplishing the desired purpose. This is why Paul went on to argue concerning the “body of the Christ”, that “from him all the body, by being harmoniously joined together and being made to cooperate through every joint which gives what is needed, according to the functioning of each respective member in due measure, makes for the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love”. —Eph. 4:16, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When every tissue, every organ, every joint, every muscle of the human body responds to the instruction of the mind, what unity of action there is! This is a picture of how to achieve the oneness of God’s visible organization under the Head Christ Jesus. Things can be done by a person who is not awkward or clumsy and who has a well-formed and balanced body, one under full control. That is exactly the way it is with Jehovah’s witnesses today throughout the world. They are under control and receive instruction from the greatest instructor, Jehovah, through Jesus Christ. They study God’s Word and have his spirit. They get things done. Co-operation is received from every part of the organization, every department, every company, every branch, every missionary home. They all function unitedly as respective members of the whole organization, the body; and this makes for the growth of the organization in love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When we review the work of Jehovah’s witnesses during the year 1951, it is again seen how they are working at unity. No doubt about it, Jehovah’s spirit is upon them in the work. They have not done the work in their own strength. They have “one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father”, and all the Lord’s people are associated in one visible organization built up in love; first, love for Jehovah, the Giver of every good and perfect gift, and, secondly, love for one’s neighbor. This is the answer to the unusual growth of the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>LIBERATION FOR THE MINISTRY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses today are interested in one thing no one else is interested in, and that is the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness. Not only are they interested in doing this themselves, but they have interest in training others for ministerial work. They know this means the salvation of others; as it is written: “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.” (1 Tim. 4:16, AW) The witnesses of Jehovah are going to the ends of the earth, saying to the prisoners of modern Babylon, “Go forth!” Hundreds of thousands of all kinds of persons who are desirous of preaching the good news of the Kingdom are 'going forth’ from this Babylonish world. All they need is the necessary help and instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One thing is certain: men of good will certainly have not received proper instruction from this old world’s Babylonish religions. Millions of people go to churches every Sunday and listen to their pastors, but after a ten- or fifteen-minute sermon and the religious ceremonies for the day the people leave with no good news to preach to the world. They have heard a little about some popular book which was reviewed, or they have listened to something on politics. Maybe the pastor did discuss some abstract thought from the Bible or use a Scripture text and then wander off into some easy-listening philosophy. But where is “the one hope” ? Where “the one faith” ? Where the accurate knowledge of the Son of God? Where the growth to the full-grown man? Where is there interest in God’s kingdom? Where is the one visible organization built on love ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If the so-called “Christian” churches were being taught the Word of God and the truths presented in the Bible, then all the members of the congregations would be trained to be ministers. Did we not find in our study (page </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">22,^2) </span><span class="font8">that the reason teachers were given was “with </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">view to the training of the holy ones for ministerial work”? Yes. Hence, to engage in pure, undefiled worship means you must be a preacher, a minister, a servant of the Most High, Jehovah. Christendom has failed in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In contrast with the indifferent way taken by false religion, Jehovah’s witnesses diligently work to make everyone who shows interest in the truth a competent minister of God’s kingdom. They try to bring all immature ones to a mature knowledge of God’s Word. Jehovah’s witnesses </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font8"> into the homes of the people when invited and study with them. These ministers of Jehovah will spend all the time the people of good will desire so as to help them to know what God’s Word has in store for them. After these interested persons study the Bible and the publications that are used as study aids, it is not long before they start talking to their neighbors. It is not much longer until they come to the Kingdom Halls of Jehovah’s witnesses, to which all lovers of righteousness are invited, there to study deeper things pertaining to God’s Word. A little more time and they are ready to go from door to door preaching the good news of the Kingdom. Next, they dedicate themselves to God in imitation of Jesus, who said: T come, as in the volume of the book it is written of me, to do your will.’ (Ps. 40:7, 8; Heb. 10: 5-9) They believe that God’s Word contains instruction for them to follow, sets forth his purposes, and clearly indicates to them their responsibility to God now to be ministers to “declare to the nations the good news”.—Eph. 3:8, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society does send out missionaries, teachers and special representatives who are trained in aiding others to gain a better knowledge of the Lord’s Word. Everyone needs building up in the most holy faith. Still, all of Jehovah’s witnesses are ministers, because that is why God has been and is gathering together his “other sheep”, to train them for ministerial work. In this organization of ministers we see a new world society working at unity. Jehovah’s witnesses make up Jehovah’s visible organization today. Seek them out. Study with them. Hundreds of thousands are already doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the past year many have heard the call, ‘Come forth from the prison houses of Babylon!’ They have left Catholic churches, Protestant churches, Jewish synagogues and heathen temples. Since their coming forth they have studied and prepared themselves for the intensive preaching of Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide. During the year the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses has had a monthly average of 384,694 ministers who were engaging in the preaching work every month, comforting people from door to door, making back-calls and conducting home Bible studies with the interested. These zealous publishers have accomplished a tremendous amount of work during the service year of 1951.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>GENERAL SURVEY OF WORK DONE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">These 384,694 publishers were not alone in their work. They were taking along and training some “babes”. Some who had been prisoners in devilish organizations heard the good news of God’s kingdom and began to pull away from the old world and its way of thinking, and they associated themselves with these publishers for the new world. They too went out and preached, 57,686 of them, for the first time. Combined, that means 442,380 ministers—a new all-time peak for Jehovah’s witnesses! The Society is interested in the welfare of every one of these 442,380 persons and it wants to see them continue as ordained ministers. This is the way Paul felt. He wanted to help the members of the early church to become qualified, fully grown, mature ordained ministers. Paul knew why he was called; he said: “I should declare to the nations the good news.” He said we should imitate him as he imitated Christ. If it was his responsibility to declare the good news, then it is the responsibility of everyone who comes to this knowledge to declare the good news. That is why Jesus said he gives “gifts in men”, namely, “with a view to the training of the holy ones for ministerial work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many of these 442,380 persons who are preaching need to be brought to maturity. They are “babes” not a year old and they cannot remain babes the rest of their lives, in danger of being tossed about by waves and carried hither and thither by every wind of teaching. They have to be well trained. They need constant attention and help. Bible studies must continue in their homes. They must come to service meetings, participate in the theocratic ministry school and attend the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> studies that Jehovah’s witnesses conduct in their Kingdom Halls. They will go out in the field with seasoned publishers. Circuit servants will visit their companies and take them out in the preaching work and give them advanced training. Questions on the Bible which may be bothering them will be answered. They must study diligently the publications of the Society along with their Bibles. They cannot afford to remain babes; they must become full-grown and appreciate the visible organization God has set up and be an active part of this body that functions all to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name. Their keeping busy in the preaching activity and keeping up with their studies “makes for the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This training work will not let up either, because Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to “say to the prisoners, Go forth”. (Isa. 49:9) Why should lovers of righteousness stay in the old world and go down with it at Armageddon and die for an eternity, when they have the opportunity of pulling away from this system of things and of enjoying life in a new world of righteousness?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A most wonderful work is going on. People are hearing this good news and heeding it. They see the unity of God’s visible organization and they flee to it for safety. Of course, it means a big change in their lives, but it is all for their benefit. It is interesting to observe that during the 1951 service year 17,732,323 books, booklets and Bibles were distributed by Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide. It took a lot of time to distribute these publications along with the 20,046,485 copies of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> magazines that were placed with the people. This was certainly planting seed. These witnesses of Jehovah devoted 62,854,483 hours to talking the Kingdom and doing this planting and watering. But just why did they do this? For the simple reason that Christ Jesus, the Pattern they are following, preached the good news continually, saying that the kingdom of the heavens is at hand. He also gave a command to the effect that this good news of the Kingdom shall be preached now in all the world for a witness. Jehovah’s witnesses are glad for this command and are zealous in doing their ministerial work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In order to help everyone they could, they made 20,438,000 back-calls on persons interested in God’s message. Just think of that! Going back to the homes of the people over 20 million times during the year, trying to help them gain a better knowledge of the Bible! And the record shows that every month throughout the year there were 260,187 Bible studies held in different individuals’ homes throughout this whole world. These studies were conducted at least once every month, but usually every week. Jehovah’s witnesses want to help these people of good will all they can. That means work. But it is joyful work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This organization of Jehovah’s witnesses is not one that is standing still; it is growing rapidly. In fact, in 1951 we see an increase of 17 per cent over the preceding year in the number of persons taking up this good news and proclaiming it. As you look at the chart on pages 246-251 you will be able to see the comparative work of the 121 countries that are listed. For such expansion of the work world-wide it was Jesus who said: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations.”—Matt. 28:19, 2VJF.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many people are seeing that Jehovah’s witnesses are a blessed and happy organization in the earth even though persecuted, and that they have the favor of God. Many who see this are forsaking this old world and its organizations and are coming to Jehovah’s organization. One fact alone that proves this is that during 1951 there were 63,178 individuals who symbolized their dedication to do Jehovah’s will, by water immersion. These want to be at unity with God’s visible organization and share in the blessed promises of the new world. During the year many ministers entered the pioneer work and now 17,955 are spending full time in this branch of ministerial activity. Another 1,004 work at branch homes doing office work, caring for the buildings, and others of this number did the printing of 4,955,201 books, 13,604,283 booklets, 30,256,927 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and 21,422,620 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font8">magazines for subscribers and for distributors, and 278,820,411 handbills, tracts, placards and office forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All of the brothers in the branch homes and the headquarters office in Brooklyn, New York, enjoy serving their brothers world-wide. They are grateful for the undeserved kindness of Jehovah toward them and all of Jehovah’s witnesses the world over. And with their brothers around the world they will continue to “say to the prisoners, Go forth”, so that all liberty lovers may enjoy the blessedness of the unity of God’s visible organization. Our blessed privilege it is to help all such liberated ones to get organized with us for the ministry.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>THE NEW WORLD SOCIETY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses are not only looking and praying for a new world organization but they are working for that new world now. They fully realize that the wicked conditions that exist in the earth at the present time must be destroyed; but Jehovah’s servants do not want to be destroyed with them. They appreciate what the apostle Peter said: “Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of persons ought you to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion, awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah.” (2 Peter 3:11,12, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses appreciate that the “day of Jehovah” has come and his kingdom has been born; that the Sovereign Ruler of the universe has placed his King Christ Jesus upon the throne to rule, and that this took place in 1914. With the Kingdom here and the “new heavens” of the new world already in operation, is it any wonder that Jehovah’s witnesses are working hard for the new world? Certainly not, for there is plenty of work to be done. Clearly, we can see from the Scriptures that the ingathering of those people who are seeking after truth and righteousness must be accomplished. The Bible terms such ones “other sheep”. And, indeed, these sheeplike ones are being gathered together, as this year’s report so eloquently testifies. Yes, being gathered they are, but not just in hundreds, or thousands, or even tens of thousands, but in hundreds of thousands. Surely the new world society has begun!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses and people of good will toward God are desirous of living in peace and righteousness in the new world. But, more than that, they know that according to God’s Word they must begin living in peace now. Among themselves they are dwelling in peace and are uniting in carrying the peaceable message of Christ Jesus to all nations, kindreds and tongues. That message which has such a peaceful effect on all lovers of righteousness is that “the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near”. From all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues men of good will are streaming into the new world society anxious to learn how to live in the new world. All work together in unity under the direction of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, which acts as a governing body for them. This organization, a Pennsylvania corporation, sets forth plans and suggestions for Jehovah’s witnesses relative to ways and means of promoting the educational work in which all are engaged. The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society sends missionaries out into all parts of the world and keeps in touch with its many branch organizations which direct activities in the various lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The home office of the Society is located in Brooklyn, New York, at what is known as the Bethel home. In this home there are more than four hundred workers, all ordained ministers serving the interests of their brothers throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The organization that has been built up under the blessing of Jehovah God is a simple organization; it is not complicated in its structure or operation. The president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, with other able ministers residing in the Bethel home, plans the work that should be done in harmony with the Lord’s Word. Such plans are put into operation, and instructions regarding them sent to the branch offices around the globe. This information, whether in the form of a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine article, books, booklets or letters, is translated into the various languages and sent forth to all the company organizations and special representatives of the Society, such as pioneers, full-time ministers. The companies transmit the information on to the publishers of the Kingdom, and the good news of God’s glorious work spreads into every corner of the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Additionally, the Society at Brooklyn, New York, sends forth missionaries into new fields where there are no branch offices or organized activity. There it establishes missionary homes, and the specially trained missionaries carry on the same kind of work as do the company publishers and pioneers in other lands, namely, going from house to house, making return calls on interested persons, conducting home Bible studies, and organizing companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus the organization functions and good results are forthcoming. As the years roll on, the persons interested in the true Word of God associate themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses and become part of this peaceful, life-loving new world society. As stated, not only do they pray and look forward to life in a paradise earth, but they </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">work</span><span class="font7"> for it. They spend their time and energy and funds in the interests of God’s kingdom; they devote themselves wholeheartedly to that work now. They believe it with all their heart and they preach it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide constitute a society of ministers. There is no clergy class or laity class; all of them are one society of people happy in the glorious treasure of service they have received from the Most High God. These Kingdom workers use many corporations throughout the world to earry on their work, as in the state of Pennsylvania, in the United States, they use the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. This corporation deals primarily with the foreign branch activity and the missionary service. In America the Lord’s people have another corporation, known as the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Incorporated, of New York state. This Society operates the Bethel home and the large printing plant located in Brooklyn, New York. Also, it directs the general activity of the witnesses of Jehovah throughout the United States. It also operates radio station WBBR and directs the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, where missionaries are specially trained for foreign service. Having been trained under the supervision of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, the missionaries are then sent forth to lands throughout the world by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, a Pennsylvania corporation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In many other countries of the earth there are corporations formed, such as the International Bible Students Association of Great Britain and Canada. There are other corporations in Cuba, Brazil, France, Switzerland, Sweden and other lands. All these corporations are used by Jehovah’s witnesses to carry on their ministerial activity. Persons associated with these corporations have one thing in mind, and that is the making known of Jehovah God’s kingdom in all the world. This educational work with the Bible must go on until the accomplished end of this old, wicked system of things. Those in this new world society are seeing to it that this good news is preached to all nations.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>ORDINATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">All of Jehovah’s witnesses receive their ordination from Jehovah God. Each one makes a careful study of the Lord’s Word and after studying what God has set forth in his Bible he sees that the only course of action that will bring life is that of doing the Lord’s will. Individually each one dedicates himself to the doing of the Lord’s will. And, as it is stated in Isaiah 61:1, such ones appreciate that “the spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me”. This text goes on to say that it is Jehovah God who anoints such dedicated ones to preach the good tidings to the meek and sends them forth to bind up the brokenhearted and proclaim liberty to the captives and open the prisons to them that are bound to this old evil world. Jehovah’s people have been freed, and now they want to free others by bringing to them the good news of the Kingdom. Having dedicated themselves to serve Jehovah God, the Most High consecrates them to carry on in his service. This they do with joyful hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So we can see throughout all of the new world society that Jehovah’s witnesses are really ministers. All must be preachers. It is not just a matter of going to a Sunday school or church once a week. With Jehovah’s witnesses it is a matter of continuous study and then application of the knowledge gained by carrying this information to others and being preachers themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of these ministers are able to devote all their time to the preaching of the good news. Others have certain obligations, such as providing proper care for their families and rearing their children in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah, and these Scriptural responsibilities prevent them from giving full time to the preaching work. But in every instance these witnesses of the Most High God are seeking first the Kingdom and its righteousness. As it was in the days of the apostles when certain older brothers were sent to admonish and build up in the most holy faith the congregations of Christ’s followers, so today the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses does the same thing. The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society selects certain individuals who are qualified to take the lead in spreading this good news, and these ordained ministers are appointed to special service. Some are branch servants, some are in special assignments of duty in branch offices, Bethel homes and missionary fields, and others serve as circuit and district servants, traveling about assisting in more efficiently carrying on the work done by the congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It would be impossible to list all of those assigned to such special services, but we do list here some who have positions of greater responsibility and who hold special appointments from the Society.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>WATCHTOWER BIBLE SCHOOL OF GILEAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Divine education, or the understanding of Jehovah's revealed Word, is the greatest education anyone could possibly obtain. While all of Jehovah’s witnesses spend many hours every week in a study of their Bibles and the Society’s Bible textbooks, there is always the desire on the part of every minister of God to be able to spend a greater amount of time in study. But in these busy days we know that it is not all study: important also is the repeating of the information gained by that study, that is, telling others what we have learned. This impresses it upon our minds and at the same time benefits other people. The minister of God must always keep alert and search daily in the storehouse of riches for things new and old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In view of the necessity of spending as much time as possible preaching to the people, some wonder why we have the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead and the five-month course of study for training missionaries. We must keep in mind that when missionaries are sent forth they go off into fields isolated from all fellow workers. Sometimes four or five missionaries go into a land where none of Jehovah’s witnesses have ever been and where the good news of the Kingdom is not being preached, a land where the Bible is an unknown volume to the people. It is of inestimable value to strengthen the faith of these missionaries in the Word of God and equip them as well as possible before they begin serving in such far-off lands and begin pioneering new frontiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Therefore the Society sets aside about a five-and-a-half-month study period for the special training of missionaries. Full-time ordained ministers are invited to the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead and are given a thorough education on the Bible from cover to cover, studying its history, its doctrines and refutation of arguments raised by those who want to disprove the Bible and its authenticity. The training given to missionaries at Gilead has proved very beneficial in this regard and it has strengthened the ministers and has made them more qualified for their missionary work. Not only does the school devote practically all its hours to a study of the Bible text, but it also teaches the students something about the language they might use in a foreign land, as well as information on geography, travel and the practical things that go with daily life. From the school’s yearly report the following is taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This school opened on February 1, 1943, and since that time 1,743 individuals have finished the prescribed course and have graduated. There have been 1,812 persons enrolled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Obviously not all have been able to finish the course, due to poor health or other reasons. In eight and a half years we have put through 17 classes. Of those who finished school 601 were single men, 550 were single women, and 51)2 were married persons. Another interesting point about those finishing school is this: 678 of the graduates were men and women from 45 countries outside the United States, and 1,065 were Americans. This shows that a very large number of those taking up the missionary work come from other lands to America where they are trained and educated for this special field activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The 16th and 17th classes finished school during the 1951 service year of the Society. The 16th term began on September 8, 1950. There were 127 students registered and the entire student body was composed of non-Americans and non-Canadians. The students came from 26 countries. This was a very unusual group of students; they were energetic and hard-working despite the fact that some were not too well versed in the English language. This was a difficulty some had to overcome at first, but it was not long before they were following the courses of study just as rapidly as the other students. Two students left school because of ill health, feeling they would be unable to take up their duties in a foreign land. They returned to their former ministerial service as pioneers. The student body that graduated was made up of 125 ordained ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Graduation exercises were held on Sunday, February 11, 1951, and 121 diplomas were awarded to those who met the grades required for the obtaining of a diploma. However, all of the graduates qualified as missionaries and were assigned to 38 countries throughout the world. The graduation took place in midwinter, and Gilead’s auditorium was packed out, with 1,294 persons attending the exercises. The graduation talk given by the president of the Society was on divine healing. This caused considerable discussion among those in attendance because many new points of truth were brought forth, and they were greatly appreciated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The 17th class began their Gilead school career on February 20, 1951. One hundred and twenty-two students were registered. This group came from ten countries, including the United States and Canada. This class was quite different from the preceding one because there were not so many Europeans and representatives from other parts of the world in the class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere love Gilead because they see in the students a great determination to follow the I.ord’s Word and to obey the command given by Christ: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations.&quot; (Matthew 28:19, Ml') While all of Jehovah’s witnesses can do the preaching work, not all can go to the ends of the earth in the service; so it makes their hearts rejoice to see these who are going to other lands and they wish them well in their travel and in their service. This spirit was truly manifested on Sunday, July 22, 1951, the graduation day for the 17th class. There were 8,432 gathered together for this, the largest summer graduation ever held at the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. The graduation exercises were held in front of the building called “Shiloah” (the library and study room). The great throng of people sat on chairs arranged on the campus in front of the building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The local press and radio stations in Ithaca, Syracuse and Auburn gave considerable publicity to this graduation. Just stop and think for a moment what happened here: 119 students were graduating at the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. Certainly this little group did not have 8,432 relatives to come and see them and wish them well! No, the people who attended that graduation were persons of the new world society, persons who had dedicated themselves to do Jehovah’s will the same as the group of students being graduated. Yes, they too were ordained ministers, but up to this time they had not the opportunity of going through Gilead and of being sent off to some foreign field. But their hearts were with the students and their spirit was the same. Their love for God was equal. They, like the graduates, were seeking first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness. Following the graduation this mass of people dispersed and returned to their home companies and their pioneer assignments, there to do the same kind of work as that to be done by the missionaries—preaching the good news of God’s kingdom in all the world for a w’itness. It is this unity and love manifested among the I-ord's people that has brought such great prosperity to the work of Jehovah's witnesses. It is the love of God that surpasses all understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It goes without saying that the graduates of the 17th class, whose names are listed below, were very happy to have so many visitors and friends of theirs by their side on this, their graduation day.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, under the direction of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., has received the Lord’s rich blessing. Any pioneer who has the opportunity of going to Gilead and then on into foreign missionary service should certainly seek that blessed privilege. Of course, going to Gilead is just a forward step in increasing one’s privileges of service, for when one goes to Gilead he does not have just the education in mind but the missionary service which follows in any part of the world where he might be sent by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The outstanding textbook used in the school during the past year was the excellent new translation of the Greek Scriptures, entitled “The New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures”. The students certainly appreciated a careful study of this textbook. They also used in their studies the new book released by the Society in August, 1950, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For young men and women who have full-time service as their goal, Gilead is a blessed thing. They have the opportunity to study God’s Word uninterruptedly for five and a half months. This is an unusual privilege. Then after having studied it at school, putting to use this wonderful knowledge is an even greater privilege and responsibility. We rejoice with all the missionaries who have gone forth to their assignments and who are now gathering together the “other sheep” under the direction of the Good Shepherd, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>BRANCHES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">One of the great barriers that separates men today is language. There are many languages spoken in the different parts of the earth. In one place we find a group of people speaking one tongue and not too many miles distant another group of people speaking a different tongue. They isolate themselves from one another by a boundary, and this line may not be crossed without permission by both groups controlling the territory. In one territory the only way you can be understood by the people in general is to speak their language. You move into an adjoining territory and you must know another language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In order to carry on the preaching of the gospel in all these different lands it has been advisable to set up branch offices in these different countries. In these branch offices of the Society the language spoken by the people of the country is used. However, in most instances the branch servant knows the English language as well as his native tongue, and the general communications of the Society go forward in English from country to country. If it were not for the division of languages there would not be the need for branches in the numbers that there are today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As far as all the people of the world who have entered the new world society are concerned, they have a language all their own. It is the new world language; it is the Word of God. When people think alike and act alike and do the same things for the same reasons, they understand one another. This certainly is true of Jehovah’s witnesses. They speak a pure language among themselves because this pure language was given to them by the Most High God through his 66 letters he has written to them. Now they can see eye to eye and understand Jehovah’s purposes. So no matter where they are in the earth, no matter what their native language, they have the same hope, the same faith and the same message to preach to the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same spirit is shown among Jehovah’s witnesses today as was shown by Peter and John when they traveled about and performed the ministry of good news. It is recorded in Acts 4 that men of the world “perceived that they were men unlettered and ordinary”, but they also “began to recognize about them that they used to be with Jesus”. (Vs. 13, AW) The things they said and the acts they performed demonstrated this. Today the peoples of the world can recognize that Jehovah’s witnesses are walking with Jesus, too, by the work they do and the message they preach. They realize, too, that the witnesses of the Most High have his spirit because of the unity in the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The language barrier does not interfere with the oneness of mind in this new world society, nor do the boundaries made by nations interfere with the onward movement of the great educational work that God’s servants are performing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You do not see Jehovah’s witnesses settling down in some massive, Gothically-beautiful cathedral or church building, but you see them assembling two or three times a week in a modern “Kingdom Hall”, as they call it. Here they gather unpretentiously to study the Word of God. This is the place where the companies of Jehovah’s witnesses meet in the various towns and villages throughout the countries of the world. These groups keep in touch with their respective branch offices, and, in turn, the branch offices keep in close communication with the president’s office of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society located in Brooklyn, New York. The pioneers in the various countries also report to the branch offices as do the missionaries, if they are assigned to lands where branches operate. It is through this method of reporting and keeping in touch with all of God’s ministers everywhere that we are able to compile the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font7"> report, which is of great interest to all ministers of God. This report shows the advance of Kingdom work and proves to Jehovah’s witnesses that what they are trying to do in fulfillment of God’s Word has his blessing, and good results are seen. It is as Jesus said, as reported at John 10:16,27, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">NW:</span><span class="font7"> “And I have other sheep, whieh are not of this fold; those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd. My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So, regardless of languages the peoples speak, they are following Christ Jesus, the Right Shepherd, and he is bringing them into the new world society, and they become Jehovah’s witnesses. They are determined to praise the name of the Most High God and join in clean, undefiled worship of the Sovereign One of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The branch organizations help to gather these people together and to care for their needs. As one reads the pages of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font7"> he will see that, regardless of boundaries, tongues and customs, Jehovah’s witnesses think alike. They act alike in all parts of the world; they are interested in just one thing: the true worship of Jehovah and the opportunity of helping other people carry on this true worship and to enjoy everlasting life in a blessed new world under the reigning King Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The service year of the Society ends on the last day of August each year. Then the branch servants send in their annual reports to the president’s office. These are checked by the president and certain portions are reprinted in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font7"> for the benefit of all of Jehovah’s witnesses. At the present there are 70 branches in the world, but under these branches there are many other territories, totaling 120 (including the branches), where Jehovah’s witnesses are residing and preaching the good news. All of these lands are mentioned in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font7"> and a brief report is given on each one. In these reports you will observe the interest Jehovah’s witnesses have in other people in trying to help them understand God’s Word. There is no selfish motive on their part in assisting men of good will in a study of God’s Word; their only desire and motive is to magnify Jehovah’s name and show the people the way to life. This they do by educating the people in the Word of the Most High, the Bible.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The administrative offices of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society are located at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 2, New York. It is from this place that the work is directed throughout all the world. All the branch offices make reports to the president’s office each month. The administrative office of the Society plans the work that shall be done throughout the world, and during the year regular visits are made by the president of the Society to various branches and missionary homes to see what can be done to advance Kingdom interests. From information gathered arrangements are made for expansion in various countries and for putting into operation those things that it is believed will be of greatest benefit to the “other sheep” in the various lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It has been found that it is good to do the majority of the Society’s printing at one central place, and the place chosen has been Brooklyn. The demand for literature in all parts of the world has constantly increased. It has been deemed advisable to publish the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine and other publications of the Society in various languages, and it is best to have this done at Brooklyn. That is the reason why such a large printing plant was set up at 117 Adams street. This plant measures approximately 100 feet wide and 200 feet long and has nine stories. All types of presses have been installed to take care of the work necessary. The president’s office is always arranging for new translations of literature, and when these are received the office sends them to the factory for production, putting them through the linotype department, the plate-making department, pressroom and bindery. Then the shipping department sends these various translations to all parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From time to time it seems advisable to publish </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> in new languages or in a better form. So the president’s office directs that these publications be printed at Brooklyn rather than be mimeographed in the various countries. Recently the president of the Society was in the Philippine Islands, where he arranged for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> in Ilocano, Tagalog and Cebu-Visayan to be printed at the Brooklyn factory. This meant discontinuing mimeographing it in the Philippine Islands and added more work to the plant in Brooklyn. It seemed best, too, to transfer the printing of publications in some of the African tongues, such as Ibo, Twi and Yoruba, from Nigeria to the Brooklyn plant. Here we have the machinery and the presses and it is possible to get the paper. What goes through the factory at Adams street is directed from the administrative office. As the work increases and the need for more machinery is seen, the necessary things will be purchased and installed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those brothers working in the factory have a unique privilege of service in that they are servants for their fellow workers throughout the world. While they are not in the foreign land themselves, producing literature for the people of that land, they are in the Lord’s organization turning out publications that will help peoples of all languages to gain an appreciation of the Kingdom and the wonderful blessings God has in store for them. It is a privilege indeed to be able to send publications to 120 different nations or islands of the sea for the purpose of aiding people of good will to take their stand and ‘say to the prisoners, “Go forth!”’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this same building where the printing is done for the Society are the offices that take care of the work in the United States. These are considered the branch offices for America. The brothers working there look after the needs of the companies and pioneers. They handle correspondence and orders and keep the accounts that are necessary. In this same building we have a very large circulation department where hundreds of thousands of addresses are handled every year in order to take care of the subscribers for the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines, not only in the English language but in many foreign tongues. The printing of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines is one of the biggest jobs that the Society’s factory has to handle, but it is certainly gratifying to see the increase in the number of magazines year by year. In 1949 we were printing 29,700,000 copies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> In 1950 it climbed to 34,500,000 copies. And now, in 1951, it was our privilege to produce 39,700,000 copies of these two fine publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine, which brings to the Lord’s people food at the proper time and helps them to understand the purposes of Jehovah and carry on their work throughout the world, continues to take the lead in circulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The production report which is furnished by the factory servant gives one a very good idea of what the factory can now produce. But, of course, it has not reached its capacity; there is still room for more machinery and greater production. Our great problem in these difficult times is the obtaining of sufficient quantities of paper to meet the production demands. However, through diligent effort we have been able to get the necessary supplies for the past service year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">At the close of the year there were 393 members of the Bethel family sharing in this glorious production. Some are working in the administrative offices, some are writing, others run machinery producing the literature, and still others work at taking care of our needs in the Bethel home, such as in the dining room and kitchen and in taking care of our private rooms. In addition to that, all have the privilege of engaging in field service activity as publishers of the Kingdom. Excerpts from all the branch servants’ reports to the president follow.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>THE MINISTRY UNDER</span></h2>
<p><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THE AMERICAN BRANCH OFFICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God's servants were ‘increase conscious’ throughout the entire 1951 service year, as the invitation to “praise Jah” resounded through the land and liberty was proclaimed to those in bondage. The spiritually sick were aided by the ‘leaves for the curing of the nations’ and the ‘life-saving waters of truth’ to become a part of the increase. And Theocracy’s increase will continue, as the Word of God assures us, until its blessings fill the entire inhabited earth. To have a share In this increase was the joyful experience of the ministers of Jehovah In the United States. Jehovah blessed their faithful planting and watering of the Word of truth by Increasing their average number of publishers 20 per cent. How that stirs within all of us heartfelt thanks to Jehovah our God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But where do these new witnesses of Jehovah come from? Actually, they are people in all walks of life who meekly and sincerely permit God’s Word, the Bible, to direct their paths. The following examples serve to illustrate this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One new witness is a woman in Nebraska who wrote this letter to the Watchtower Society: “I have been a reader of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer</span><span class="font6"> for many years. Now I want to go in the field work and I need instructions. Will you please send by return mail, if possible, instructions and forms I need? I am the mother of 17 children and I have hopes that they too will come into the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here is an excellent example of the ‘freeing of a captive’: A sister in Indiana engaged in the house-to-house work found interest during the three-bound-book campaign. The good-will person was so delighted over the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font6"> book that she read It through within three days. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">return call provided the necessary contact for a Bible study. During the course of time she expressed her desire to be baptized, but was denied that privilege by her husband. He was so bitterly opposed to the witnesses that he insisted on returning all the literature personally to the sister conducting the study, and refused the sister the right to see his wife again. Shortly thereafter, however, he was drafted into the army, and his wife resumed her study and was immersed at one of the circuit assemblies. Through her enthusiasm over the Kingdom work she was able to plant the seed of life with her fleshly sister, and she too is planning to be immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Circuit and district assemblies have played a great part in laying the groundwork for upbuilding the faith and stimulating the zeal of the thousands who have joined in the thunderous song of ‘praising Jah’. Favorable response by many newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations doubtlessly stirred up many good-will persons to attend the assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The responsibility of carrying through and developing the increase into strong, valiant warriors of righteousness falls upon the shoulders of the local congregations or companies. Theocracy’s increase spreads its contagious enthusiasm into each and every company, leaving the fruits of its labor behind to be cared for by the mature publishers and to be spiritually nourished. A total of 1,039 companies attained the 34 per cent peak increase established as the goal at the outset of the year. Unquestionably the pleasures of service, together with those of Christian association in the company, played their part in the expansion of praise to “Jah”. What a thrill to be associating with God’s organization and with brothers and sisters of like precious faith! Nor would we overlook the 1,256 young witnesses who emphasized the fact that they were in accord with more service of praise for expansion by enrolling and serving as vacation pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Will Jehovah’s people sit back and recline in ease, now that they have witnessed so many captives being set free? Definitely not I Each one of us must continue doing his best in harmony with his dedication to do the will of God, not grudgingly, nor under compulsion, but cheerfully, generously, as an expression of thanks to God. We must pursue this Kingdom work for a further manifestation of increase. So long as men of good will are bound with the chains of darkness we must continue to herald the cry with ever-increasing volume: “Prisoners, go forthI”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a pleasure to report, too, that the doors of service in the United States have been kept wide open without too much resistance or too many encroachments during the year. However, the legal desk of the Society had to fight many cases in connection with keeping the door to free worship open. One of the outstanding victories already reported and published was the Havre de Grace (Md.) park case. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazines have kept Jehovah’s witnesses posted on the legal battles as they have been fought, so there is no need to consider them in detail here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society’s legal counsel has been ready and diligent to provide all ministers of the Society with legal advice relative to the procedure and rights guaranteed all ministers of religion by the draft law in force in the United States. To be specially noted is the recent letter to the Society’s counsel from General Hershey, the Director of Selective Service, in which he stated that unless a man is a pioneer and exempted as a minister of religion under the Universal Military Training and Service Act he will have great difficulty, if not impossibility, in freely continuing in the service of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER COUNTRIES REPORTING TO THE UNITED STATES BRANCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are a number of places where Jehovah’s witnesses are located that are not large enough to have branch offices. It seems best to keep these countries under the direction of the United States branch. The brothers in these countries report directly to the United States branch office. There are 17 of such locations and the report shows there are 522 publishers scattered throughout 28 companies in these lands. In a number of these places a total of 26 missionaries are doing excellent work. During the year 47 persons have taken their stand for pure worship and have been baptized. There are real prospects for increase in these countries because 1,292 persons attended the Memorial services in the spring of the year. The year’s reports on each of these locations follow, giving the reader some idea of what real missionary work is like.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>ALASKA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The high light of the Alaskan report for this year is the visit of Brothers Knorr and Henschel and the resultant assembly in Anchorage held May 11 to 13 inclusive. The brothers in Alaska were in good spirits at convention time, and never before had Anchorage received such a witness, for the publishers were out with placards and handbills every day, letting the people know of the assembly. Many signs were taped to the taxicabs and others placed In store windows. Even the newspapers did their part in telling of the arrival of the Society’s representatives and of the assembly in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The attendance figures rose from 59 to 70 and then to 162 for the public talk Sunday afternoon. It is believed that 100 of this final figure were persons of good will and not as yet associated with any of the established companies. The prospects for continued increase in the future are encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rugged terrain of Alaska and the scattered population make it difficult to organize companies and work the territory, but the faithful witnesses fight temperatures of 50 degrees (Fahrenheit) below zero and steady rains that last for weeks at a time, in order to advance clean worship in this vast territory.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font6">Arrangements have been made for a Gilead graduate to do regular circuit servant work throughout the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Regular assemblies will henceforth be arranged and served by a district servant flying there by plane from the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Much of the work is seasonal and summer brings in thousands of workmen from “outside”, as the Alaskans say when they speak of the States. Because the people work such long hours in the summer, it is difficult to carry on the witness work during that season; and in the wintertime many of them leave the area, which in turn is reflected in the company reports. Of course, while there is a subsequent loss on the Alaskan report, actually there is no loss in the Kingdom service, as the brothers keep on preaching wherever they go; and thus Alaska has contributed publishers to companies in the States, and when the over all viewpoint is taken we find good progress in Alaska. The witness is being given and by the Lord’s undeserved kindness will continue to increase, all to his glory and the salvation of men.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>AZORES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The two missionaries that came to the nine islands in the Azores group in November, 1950, were a great help to the brothers there. The work leaped ahead, with three times as many publishers reporting field service during the year as before. The fine increase came in spite of the many hardships and hindrances against the work. To really appreciate their problems you have to be right in the heart of a Catholic-dominated country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Almost every day is a saint’s day in some village, to be celebrated as a holiday with masses for the faithful, and bullfights for the people as well. In the processions, If they do not carry an image around with them, they carry a silver crown which is said to represent the ‘holy spirit’. In either case, a man is always in front of the parade setting off rockets to keep everyone awake to what Is going on. Everything that happens in the islands is given a religious significance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Watchtower Society’s vice-president, F. W. Franz, met with the brothers at Angra, Terceira, in July. The two Gilead graduates arrived there a month ahead of Brother Franz to advertise his coming and arrange for meetings with the publishers and persons of good will. The night before he came a group of persons Interested In the Adventist religion expressed a desire to meet the Society’s vicepresident, and the following Monday night eighteen gave keen attention to what he had to say. They also had questions to ask and showed appreciation of the Scriptural answers given. The meeting lasted hours, and the Gilead graduates returned the following week to discuss with them the subject of the sabbath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sunday afternoon Brother Franz also met the group of publishers and other persons of good will and they gave good attention to his talk on the Model Prayer. It is clear that many want to learn more of the Kingdom and the purposes of Jehovah at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although the predominant religion among the 484,278 persons of the Azores is Roman Catholic, spiritism also has quite a hold in many parts, with a number of Catholics practicing both. There are also one or two groups of SeventhDay Adventists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The publishers here do not spend many hours a month preaching the good news because of their secular work, but it is believed that conditions will get better, and that there will be a greater number of publishers in the Azores group.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>BERMUDA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Since the deportation of the missionaries from Bermuda, the Watchtower Society has endeavored to open the way for entry of other Gilead graduates into the country. It was to see if this could be accomplished that the president of the Society made a trip to Bermuda. Details of the visit of Brother Knorr are given in the April 1, 1951, issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font6"> It appeared encouraging that the way might be opened again for someone to go there to represent the Society, look after the congregation of the Lord’s people and visit other interested persons in the principal settlements of the Bermuda islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year, however, two attempts were made to obtain resident permission for a family of three graduates of Gilead. These attempts were made both from the Society’s headquarters in Brooklyn and from the offices of the branch in London, England, but to no avail. Both requests were refused. The government officials are still opposed to the preaching of God’s kingdom by Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite this, work in the Bermuda islands shows a fine increase for the service year. The only pioneer there is the wife of an American serving in the armed forces and stationed in Bermuda. This sister is zealously pushing the battle to the fore, as her report reveals. She has averaged 16 home Bible studies each month during the year with telling effect. The publishers have increased from 3 to 8, and 21 attended the Memorial. The work goes forward even though opposition exists. There is every indication that the praise to Jah will continue to increase in the islands of Bermuda.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>ETHIOPIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">This is the first time the Society has had a report on Ethiopia, that ancient land the Bible mentions. The Society opened a missionary home in Addis Ababa when three mis-slonarles arrived there just one year ago. They pitched right into the work with a goal that they had established for themselves: “Each one find one.” They hoped by the end of the service year to have a total of six reporting from that country. However, they far exceeded their hopes and dreams, for at the end of the year a total of 16 publishers were reporting their works of praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first few months of work were very discouraging, as very few persons were found who were really interested. Then one day the turning point came. The missionary home servant reports: “I was walking along the road one day when I met a young Ethiopian man and stopped to speak to him. Upon learning that I was a missionary he asked, ‘Please, sir, tell me about Jesus Christ.’ He was invited to our home the following day, and within ten minutes of his arrival a study in the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font6"> was in</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">progress. He returned the next day and brought another</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">young man with him, and another study was held. These</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">two turned out to be the first two Ethiopian publishers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">and both are now zealous, active witnesses. One of them conducts weekly meetings and studies of over 20 average attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The oldest and strongest mission in Ethiopia, the Sudan Interior Mission, has been perhaps our strongest opposer, but its actions have certainly resulted in a witness. The mission has a school in Addis Ababa where they train missionaries during the week and then send them out on Saturday and Sunday afternoons to preach for the Sudan Mission. Rather than going out to preach, many of the students come to the missionary home to learn the truth. One of them was expelled from the mission because of his stand for the truth and was so happy that he reported over 40 hours in his first month of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It is a strange and wonderful experience to have a constant flow of people coming to the missionary home every day and requesting that someone study the Bible with them. One of the missionaries must always be at the home to care for these people, as a day hasn’t passed for over two months without a group of people calling at the home for a study. Some of these people have walked for as much as two hours, studied from two to three hours, and then walked two more hours to return home. Some have come several times per week and wanted to study. Some days only three or four come, whereas other days as many as 20 persons of good will come in to study the Bible. Never are the people satisfied to study just one hour; most of them want to study two or three hours.” The home servant concludes his report, saying, “We could go on and on telling experiences that we have enjoyed here as each new day brings with it a new experience. To us, Ethiopia, the land of Bible mention, is the most wonderful assignment on the earth. May our assignment continue here after Armageddon.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>FRENCH EQUATORIAL AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Imagine, if you can, being in a vast territory with only 37 publishers of the Kingdom message scattered throughout the entire land. Perhaps you had never seen any other active witnesses except those few in your own home town. The only thing you knew of the truth and the procedure for witnessing was what you had read of the publications and of the few letters that the Society had been able to get to you. Understanding and application of right principles come hard that way. Such is the obstacle that the brothers in French-controlled Africa are facing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The publications of the Society are banned. The publishers have a small amount of literature, and this is used for study. The preaching of the good news by word of mouth is given free rein by the officials, and, as a result, much good is accomplished through the medium of the public meeting work. Only six pieces of literature were reportedly placed with the public, as this is all they had to spare; but, on the other hand, 468 public meetings were held during the last service year, shouting forth praise to Jehovah. The Memorial attendance was encouraging, as 206 met to celebrate that occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One person subscribed for the magazines and received only a few issues before the prohibition against the publications of the Society took effect, but through these was able to start to study the Bible, and now there are five persons studying the life-giving message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The French government has repeatedly refused to allow representatives of the Society to establish residence there to aid and educate the witnesses and to correct any wrong reports that may be circulating regarding them. It indeed seems strange that a Christian government would refuse entry of missionaries to further Bible educational work in this bedarkened land. Yet the praise to God is increasing in these lands and it is hoped that the government will change its mind and allow our missionaries to enter French Equatorial Africa.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>FRENCH WEST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The problems and hindrances against the witness work in French West Africa are similar to those of French Equatorial Africa. The Parisian government till now refuses to authorize the entry of missionaries into this land. It allows the local authorities to decide who shall or shall not carry on their missionary work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is but one proclaimer of the good news in this vast territory, but he is holding high the message of the Kingdom to the local populace. It is our hope that in the Lord’s due time and way help can be given this lone brother and that the proclamation of the good news may expand here as all over the earth to the eternal glory of our heavenly Father.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>GAMBIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It is sad to relate that many, after coming to an understanding of the truth, have chosen the broad way of willful ignorance, some even speaking evil of the organization that once enlightened them to many Bible truths. The fear of man and the empty traditions of the people continue to be mountainous obstacles among the Africans in Gambia. Neighborhood gossip is another potent weapon used by the Devil to crush out any appearance of free, untraditional thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is how they reason: The worst thing that could happen to the Gambian would be for him to die and not have his corpse taken inside the ‘church’ as part of the burial service. This and other religious traditions have been used by the clergy to hold the people in bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some persons who have come to an understanding of the truth and yet continue to attend the customary services of false religion have expressed themselves in the following manner: “We don’t go to church to hear the preacher, we only go to worship GodI” The argument that the African sets forth is this: “These clergymen are here to instruct and lead us in worship. If a man wishes to present a case before the court he consults a lawyer and does not rely upon his own limited knowledge of law. If a man is sick he shouldn’t depend upon his own limited knowledge of medicine, but should consult a doctor. We, in turn, not being versed in theology, must rely upon a theologian. If the theologian teaches lies instead of the truth he is responsible before God and not the unlearned sheep. So we continue to worship God in the church in spite of the clergyman's false doctrine.” This choice bit of logic is the Gambian’s way of shifting responsibility. Yet no Gambian would return a second time to a doctor if he knew the man to be a fake and a distributor of false medicine. Or if one did return knowing the doctor to be a liar and a fake, would not the foolish patient be responsible? Especially so if he knew of another medical office in town that was known to teach and practice the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the month of February a weekly </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font6">study was organized with a peak of 13 persons attending. But with the passing weeks this attendance gradually dropped until recently there have been only two or three persons who have been coming to the study with any degree of regularity. But the missionaries are still trying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The two public talks given during the year had an attendance of 32 and 27. It appears the people will attend an occasional Bible talk but will not have Bible studies in their home, as this brings with It responsibility and opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As far as the Moslem community which represents over 75 per cent of Bathurst's population is concerned, there are only two men who have continued to study the literature. Neither of these, however, will come to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font6">study. The Moslems are held in a bond of fear to the teachings of Islam’s prophet Mohammed. But, by the Lord’s undeserved kindness, the workers will push ahead, even in Gambia.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>GUADELOUPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">This service year saw the young children take advantage of their vacations and become vacation pioneers. Five such children and one adult took such a course amid persecution and opposition by the local religious element.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The report comes to us: “They published in the streets, in the open places and in the country; yes, they witnessed even to the priests. One of the priests who saw me with them said to me: ‘Madame I have here a chapel which you can visit.’ I said in answer: ‘Sir, God does not live in houses made by men; He is a spirit, and those who worship him have to worship him with spirit and truth.’ He became very angry and looked furiously at us. The little pioneers hung their magazine bags over their backs, so that he could see what they were advertising, as a shame to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Some of the adults said that the children were demons, and other children attacked them with stones and called them ‘Jehovahs’. They boldly went forward and told them that Jehovah is the true God and they are his witnesses. When some questioned them they were always ready to answer In such a remarkable way that the people said: ‘Really these children have received good instructions, because they are able to stop our mouths with their intelligent answers.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A good number of publications were placed, and it is hoped that w<sup>T</sup>ith the help of Jehovah a prosperous back-call work and many studies in the homes will result. There is much interest in Guadeloupe, for nearly four times as many persons as there are publishers attended the Memorial services this year; 291 came to the celebration. This shows that there is a tremendous increase possible for this little country. For over two years the Society has been unable to send in Gilead graduates to aid the local congregation, but even without this aid there are now 78 Jehovah’s witnesses preaching the good news.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF THE JORDAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There are troubles in all parts of the world, and the Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan has had its full share of troubles during the past year. The peoples of this land, like all lands, need the kingdom of God to bring them peace and prosperity. The witnesses of Jehovah have a difficult time preaching the good news of the Kingdom here because of the principal religion of the people. They are Moslems and they practice the religion of Islam. However, there have been 19 regular publishers preaching the message of the Kingdom and as many as 25 have gone out in the field service in one month. Literature is being placed and some studies are being conducted and 43 persons attended the Memorial service this past year. So there is hope that some will be saved from the Islamic religion and will take up the true, clean worship of the Most High God and gain life in the new world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Over a period of many years thousands upon thousands of publications of the Society have been distributed throughout this little island. Very little was accomplished in gathering the “other sheep” because it was impossible to interest the people in home Bible studies. However, during the past year this work has been done with success by some Gilead graduates who have taken up the missionary work in Iceland. Now there are ten persons who are doing good work in the Icelandic field and chiefly in the city of Reykjavik and vicinity. So as to aid the work in Iceland the Society sent the branch servant of Canada and a special representative from Brooklyn to that land at the close of the service year. Some good public meetings were held and a good witness was given in the city. The newspapers publicized the event, while much opposition was demonstrated on the part of the religionists. However, the papers were good enough to publish both sides of the discussion. The group at this assembly, though small, caused a number of persons to take notice of the work done by Jehovah’s witnesses, and the publishers who remained in the country will no doubt find some interested people and w<sup>T</sup>ill be able to help them In a further study of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people of Iceland are very superstitious and steeped in false religion. It will require much work to break down and cut through the false teachings and present the truth. Had the inhabitants of Iceland read the many publications left with them much good would have been accomplished by this time. However, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to preach and teach until the cities be wasted and without inhabitants, as foretold in Bible prophecy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>ISRAEL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The people of Israel have their freedom and their country. That is, they are free of Arab rule or British rule and they have their own form of government. Israel is a nation now, acknowledged as one of the United Nations of the world. It is a homeland for the Jews. But just why are the Jews returning to Palestine? Is it to return to the land spoken of in the Bible prophecies, there to worship their God Jehovah? No, the reason is primarily a political one based on selfishness. The true worship of Jehovah is not to be found as the motivating force of the new nation of Israel. To our knowledge there are only a few of Jehovah’s witnesses who are praising the true God of Israel. Eleven in number have set about to preach the good news of God’s kingdom and talk about the Messiah, in an endeavor to turn the minds of the people to Jehovah and his new world society and away from the affairs of this dying old world. Times are hard in Israel. Living expenses are almost impossible. There are long, impatient queues of people waiting to get on buses, waiting to purchase food, waiting to get ice, etc. No one is in a hurry, say the missionaries, to wait on all these people. If one does not get served today, he can come back again tomorrow. In spiritual things that is the attitude of the people, too; they can wait until “tomorrow” to hear about God’s Word. Jehovah’s witnesses can’t; they are preaching it “today”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the land of Palestine was a “land of promise” to ancient Israel, the multitudes of the modern Israeli government are not returning to a land “flowing with milk and honey” or prosperity, nor are they going to one that has the special protection and blessing of Jehovah. They are simply adding another government to the long list of nations that make up this dying old system of things, and, like the others, a government plagued with human Ills and discontent. In spite of the Jewish people’s endeavor to forge a new Israeli society, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue in their work of showing the Jewish people the desirability of becoming members of the new world society and knowing and serving Jehovah. There is a great work to be done in Israel, and it will be interesting to see how many of the Jewish people will accept the truth from God’s Word the Bible.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>KOREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In this war-torn land of Korea the Kingdom message is still being preached. The Society had some missionaries in Seoul, but these brothers were evacuated by the United States Army at the time of the invasion by the communists from the north. The missionaries were taken to Japan, where they are now carrying on the preaching work. However, the native Koreans had to remain. They remained with a realization that in spite of the trialsome condition within their land they had to tell other people about the good things they had learned. As the war dragged on these faithful servants of God kept moving about the country preaching the good news. Some of them are now in Pusan, Taegu, Kunsan and Chon An, as well as other places. Here they continue to do the all-important work of a minister, namely, calling on the people and giving them the sorely needed comfort of God’s Word. Communication is carried on with these brothers through one of the missionary brothers now located in Japan. A record of what they have been doing during the past year has been compiled, and, while it is not complete, it shows us that these brothers in Korea are faithfully pressing on in the assigned work. Their trials are great; it is extremely difficult to obtain the necessities of life. But with all this, in their communications with the Society the primary concern of the beloved Korean brothers is not personal relief from the ravages of war, but a continued supply of spiritual food and literature with which to work. They realize more than ever that man ‘cannot live by bread alone’. The Society is trying to have some of the missionaries in Japan return to Korea even now, before the war has ended; and if applications are approved by the authorities, some will go back, there to help organize the work again. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> of October 15, 1951, gave considerable Information concerning the work in Korea as reported to the president of the Society by the brothers in Japan. It is felt that if the missionaries can return and the war in Korea ends, a great increase will be seen; for certainly the people there are hungering and thirsting after righteousness. The zeal of our brothers in Korea should stimulate all of Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere to faithful service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>LIBERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptural admonition to bring up our children in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah surely was not given in vain, as this experience from Liberia indicates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1948 a young Jamaican immigrated to Liberia. Seeing the Kingdom Hall sign he came in one day and announced that he was glad to find some of the witnesses, as his father had been a “member of our church” for over forty years. As a child he had accompanied his father to company meetings and conventions in Jamaica. After the announcement of the coming convention in London this young man decided to attend, remembering the ones attended with his father. The company was indeed glad that he could go and asked him to write to them. You can imagine their joy upon receiving a letter from him stating that now he was their brother, having been immersed at the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The witness work expands in strange and miraculous ways. For example, on one occasion, while walking along a country road, two missionaries met an elderly man walking along leaning on his cane and gave him a witness. He showed keen interest and obtained the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font6"> He invited them to his home and seated them on the piazza. Then, excusing himself, he left them and went from house to house witnessing to what he had heard on his way home. Many of his neighbors returned with him and an interesting study was conducted. Arrangements were made for the study to be held each week. For a time 22 were In attendance, with much interest being shown. The elderly man, who Is the justice of the peace, gave permission to give a series of public meetings at his home, which was well attended. About eight months later, due to pressure from the false religious clergy, the attendance dropped down to seven. A schoolteacher who conducts several Bible studies also conducts the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study with the other six every Sunday. All of these see the Kingdom quite well and are preaching it. Truly the Lord is dividing the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Liberia, 62 in number, join their brothers world-wide In giving praise to Jah as they look forward to another year of Kingdom privileges and blessings.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>MARTINIQUE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">This report highlights the religious political opposition to the work and its effect on the witness work in Martinique. The four missionaries, Gilead graduates, arrived there in August of 1949 and immediately set out to fulfill their commission, engaging in the regular door-to-door witness work and thereby learning the language. In time the increase came and a Kingdom Hall was obtained in town at a very suitable location. The proclamation of the pure language by these zealous missionaries and the response of the newly found Kingdom publishers brought forth the wrath of the priests, which eventually resulted in the deportation of the missionaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the missionaries were not French, they were considered as undesirable by the French government, and hence their visas for continued residence in Martinique were not renewed. An earnest effort to get permission to stay was immediately launched on every quarter, but to no avail. Martinique is considered as a department or as a county of France rather than as a colony. The final orders for refusing their renewal of the visas came from the home office of the Suretd Nationale in Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lawyers were consulted, a petition signed by 59 persons of the local congregation was submitted and personal appearances were made by the missionaries and othei' representatives of the Society both in Martinique to the local authorities and to the Surete Nationale in Paris. When every remedy had been exhausted and there seemed nothing else to do, they left the country. The missionaries are now at another assignment actively advancing the Kingdom interests in other lands.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>PORTUGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Looking back over<sup>-</sup> the past year it is evident that although progress has not been as rapid as in former years yet there have been a general consolidating of previous gains and a strengthening of the organization in Portugal. There were two outstanding events of the year—the arrival of two new missionaries and the visit of Brother Franz, vicepresident of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In January the brothers started looking for a missionary home, and on March 9 two graduates of the 16th class of Gilead arrived to take up residence in a fine little house that was located in a pleasant district. They soon began finding interest, some being rather unusual persons, such as a well-known actor, an author and a Dutch lady who speaks several languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On July 3, 1951, Brother Franz arrived by plane from the Azores and was met by an eager group of brothers. A very full program had been arranged for his week’s visit, including three meetings in Lisbon, three in Almada across the river, and a small one-day assembly at a place down the river for an immersion service. All meetings were well attended and the brothers thrilled to Brother Franz’ explanation of Bible questions and marveled at his ability to explain himself so clearly in Portuguese. During the day the time was fully occupied with various features of Kingdom activity and special visits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The outstanding day of Brother Franz’ visit was undoubtedly the Sunday when some 90 brothers and persons of good will took a river ferry to a beach right near the mouth of the Tagus estuary. There, in a shady spot under the trees, Brother Franz gave a talk on immersion and later 11 were baptized in the sea. After a picnic lunch under the trees, there was a full program of talks in the afternoon. It was a happy, never-to-be-forgotten occasion for those who attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since there are only about five little groups of publishers and newly interested persons, there is still a great work to be done in Portugal. As yet, very little has been done outside of the capital. The small but growing band of publishers is looking forward to the time when there will be better facilities for expansion, but in the meantime they are forging ahead, appreciating the privilege of participating in . declaring Jehovah’s name and purpose in a land so bedark-ened by false religion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>SIERRA LEONE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Although some of the brothers in Sierra Leone have “been in the truth” for 20 years they are still relatively babes In knowledge and understanding. Two graduates of Gilead were sent there to aid the brothers and carry on missionary work. The company at Freetown has been divided internally for some time, making it difficult for the brothers to get together and concentrate on the advertising of the Kingdom in fulfillment of their dedication to God. The missionaries are not popular in Sierra Leone, just as the early Christians were not popular in their day; but with hard work, strong leadership and the Lord’s spirit the work will advance to the honor and glory of Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">More hours have been put in this year by fewer publishers, the magazine placements have increased and back-calis and Bible studies have steadily improved. Especially encouraging is the step-up in the public meeting activity, for it is here that many “strangers” or “sheep” are fed and encouraged by the spiritual feast that is spread.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>SPAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Catholic Church has been in power in Spain for a long time. For untold generations the Spanish people have been taught that by confessing to a priest their sins will be forgiven them. It is no wonder, then, that standards of honesty and morals among them are not very high. And having experienced for centuries the totalitarian methods of the church, it is not surprising that they have submitted so long to the totalitarian rule of Franco and his fascist setup. The majority of the common people are tired of the present situation. The strikes in Barcelona during the spring were evidence of that fact. Barcelona, incidentally, is one of the places where Franco’s regime is least popular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The police, ever on the alert, watch the publishers very closely, resulting in the following experience: Two of the servants of the Barcelona units found apparent interest in a certain house and arranged for a Bible study. When they made the return call they found two members of the secret police waiting for them. They were arrested. Their homes were searched, literature was seized and they were put in prison. Later the literature was carefully examined and they were questioned. However, little was said until the police found an article in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">/Despertad! (Awake!)</span><span class="font6"> about Franco and conditions in Spain. That roused the anger of the police and the two brothers had to stand the fire of abuse and threats. However, after filing a complete police record of them and warning them of the consequences if they continued in their work of preaching the good news, the authorities let the brothers go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hardships and opposition do not stop the work. For example, one young special pioneer tours the villages on his bicycle, in his part-time secular work, and at the same time without attracting undue attention distributes literature and conducts studies. It takes real courage for a lad of 17 to be out doing this on his own in a country like Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The most outstanding event of the year was undoubtedly the visit of the vice-president of the Society, Brother Frauz, in July. Publishers elsewhere in the world who enjoy the regular visits of the circuit servant and the various assemblies should try to imagine the feelings of the little companies in Spain when they heard that after three years without personal contact they were to have a visit from the Society’s vice-president. First he visited Barbastro, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font6">small town of Aragon, well up near the Pyrenees. Aragon is the name of the medieval kingdom, and former ancient kingdom and province of northeastern Spain, now the provinces of Huesca, Zaragoza and Teruel. During his brief visit Brother Franz helped the publishers on back-calls, conducted meetings and also conducted an immersion service by the riverside several miles out of town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From Barbastro, Brother Franz swung through western and southwestern Spain covering 900 miles in five days, visiting Valencia, Alicante and Granada. The visits were of necessity very short, but the little groups of publishers appreciated very much the personal ministry of Brother Franz. He spent hours with them, answering their Bible questions and giving help in many other ways. Longer visits were also made to the brothers at Madrid and Barcelona.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brothers in Spain are still in need of much help to better organize the work. But whether Franco stands or falls, whether Spain is governed by fascists, democrats or communists, our brothers in Spain are determined to sound the Jubilee trumpet and proclaim liberty to the many Spanish people of good will still captive in this old world’s political and religious prisons.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>ISLANDS VISITED BY THE “SIBIA”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">As the three Gilead graduates on the Society’s schooner “Sibia” look back over the past year they rejoice greatly and thank Jehovah our God for the many blessings received at his hand. Collectively they averaged 50 Bible studies per month and started 10 new publishers in the service, with many more ready to start soon. To do this the “Sibia” has sailed 2,107 miles, visited 16 islands and has entered the different ports 77 times. Besides this, they managed to work over 5,000 hours in the field service, putting on 77 public meetings and talks at such meetings to approximately 6,000 persons of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the Theocracy’s Increase Assembly in Yankee Stadium, New York city, in August, 1950, they resumed their service work among the lesser islands of the Caribbean, making their first stop at Carriacou.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A grand welcome was given by the natives to the crew of the “Sibia”. It was not long before the good people here were just clamoring for Bible studies; so that missionaries soon had more than could properly be handled. Although poor materially, the people brought gifts of eggs, corn, fruit and other island produce to show their appreciation for the work of the sailing missionaries. At the public meetings it was thought a poor turnout if less than 100 came. Since these humble folk love to sing, the appealing sound of their voices singing the new Kingdom songs rang out stirringly into the clear tropical night air as an offering of praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Four months later found the crew of the “Sibia” departing northward to the Virgin Islands. The three-month visit at these islands brought the joy of seeing the fruits of previous labors as four new publishers joined in preaching the good news “publicly and from house to house”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">April again saw them sailing, this time to the islands of St. Martin and Anguilla. This latter island had eight months previously suffered from a hurricane; so the people felt very deeply their need for the Kingdom which will erase all pain and sorrow. Here there are many people who love the Bible and who are getting disgusted with the dry, poisonous food that is dished up by the false religions. This is evidenced by the fact that at one study in the home of a schoolteacher there were 8 the first night, 16 the second and 70 the third. They were crowding into every room and around the windows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Toward the end of June the missionaries sailed to the Grenadines once more and this time stopped at Bequia first. They were well rewarded for their efforts, for soon they were again inundated with studies, some of these with Adventists, which religion has lost at least one member, and will soon lose more as others take their stand for God and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At one small village an open-air Bible study was started with 50 in attendance at the initial study. When the missionaries left the island for a while a young man eagerly agreed to continue the group study and this he has faithfully done. There are great prospects here for expansion, as the Anglican religion which predominates on the island is starving the people spiritually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Upon returning to Carriacou they found one young publisher diligently conducting Bible studies and the people in general very glad to have them back. An empty house was used for group studies with attendances up to 70. Imagine what it was like: at least 30 persons seated on the floor of a room about 14 feet by 12 feet and all the others crowding in the other rooms and around the doorways, each one trying to find the answers and blurting them out as soon as he found them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On this island the false shepherds are howling as they see their pastures spoiled. On one occasion an Anglican priest had only about 10 in his large church building and as a result flew into a rage, saying: “If it had been a meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses you would all have been keen to go.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The three missionaries now face the future with glorious prospects ahead of them, hoping to start many new companies and revisit the islands. Praise and thanksgiving go out daily to Jehovah as they continue to serve the interests of the theocratic kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">When the service year started, the outlook in this country was not at all encouraging. Jehovah’s witnesses were the only religious organization not recognized by the government. The members of all the other religions pointed an accusing finger at this fact and said it was God showing his disapproval of Jehovah’s witnesses. If this were true, then we should expect to see the organization crumble and disintegrate. As Gamaliel wisely put it: “If this scheme and this work is from men, it will be overthrown; but if it is from God, you will not be able to overthrow them.” (Acts 5: 38, 39, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font7"> Of course, it was the Devil’s intention that the proclamation of the Kingdom would cease. But instead, we find the same thing happened in Argentina that happened in all other parts of the world. Jehovah God was a wall of fire round about his people. His people remained in his organization and there continued to do his will. The branch servant has this encouraging news to report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the Kingdom Halls were closed, the Lord’s spirit acted on the hearts and minds of his people and they opened their homes for Bible study. The programs that were carried on in the Kingdom Halls, such as the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font6">study, service meeting, theocratic ministry school and book studies, were all transferred to these homes, and here we had thrilling and enthusiastic round-table discussions. These little groups would sit in a circle and talk to one another and plan what to do in the way of serving the interests of the Kingdom. It was through these small meetings that the year’s expansion started. Each little group was a company in itself. The brothers not only wanted to be listeners at these meetings, but they expressed themselves and, more than that, they applied what they learned in the door-to-door work. All were there to help one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the beginning of the year most of the door-to-door work was done with the Bible alone. The brothers did not know how far the government would go with legal measures to stop their preaching. However, as some took the lead, others followed, and it was not long until all had wonderful experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of these remarkable experiences is about a woman who was very prejudiced against Jehovah’s witnesses and who said to the publisher who called at her door: “Any religion is good except those blasphemous Jehovah’s witnesses.” The publisher, using tact and knowing that his purpose was to aid this individual in learning about God’s Word, did not make himself known through the publications of the Society; he just used his Bible and kept on talking, leading the conversation onto doctrinal points. Interest was aroused; calls were made at another time; a study in the Bible began. For five or six weeks nothing else was used but the Bible. The woman and her family agreed with what the Bible stated, but were still of the opinion that the work being done by Jehovah’s witnesses was wrong. In due time she had a great surprise, for she learned that the study conductor, whom she said was “sent by God”, was a minister of Jehovah’s witnesses. Of course, she was of the right heart and mind and she preferred to believe the Bible rather than the story she heard about Jehovah’s witnesses. So the meetings continued, and now this woman is calling on all of her friends as one of God’s ministers. Her entire family is studying regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We find it difficult to print anything in this land, but this does not hinder the work, because information, such as that contained in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font6"> does reach the publishers. The latest books that the Society has printed in the Spanish language also get into the homes of those who want to seek truth and righteousness. Jehovah’s witnesses are sincere in trying to help the “other’ sheep”, and the Lord opens up the way to get things done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many are symbolizing their dedication to God by water baptism and are engaging in the Bible study work which all of the publishers are now carrying on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some isolated publishers and those associated with companies heretofore thought that our time was up, but they have since learned that Jehovah God knows how to direct his people and his work, even in totalitarian-ruled countries. They have come to the definite conclusion that Jehovah God is the greatest Teacher of them all and that through Christ Jesus he is directing his work in the earth and that he still has work for us to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Under these trying times it appears that each individual publisher appreciates his privileges and responsibilities more than ever before. They certainly know the value of home Bible study work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Argentina the publishers reached eleven consecutive peaks of publishers during the year I At the beginning of the year, when talk was made concerning a 34 per cent increase, the brothers viewed the goal as being very large. But now that the year has come to a close and the ingathering of his “sheep” has been accomplished for the 1951 service year, we find an increase of 50 per eent over last year’s peak I The average number of publishers engaging in the field service every month has been 1,672, which is a 29 per cent increase over last year’s average. We now have 2,117 proclaimers of the Kingdom. Of course, the work is banned by the government, but they have not stopped Jehovah's witnesses from talking. As long as they can talk, they are going to help people learn the truth and show them the difference between false religion and true religion. Certainly we in Argentina can say with all of Jehovah’s witnesses: “Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.” The everincreasing “great crowd” is coming; the “sound of many waters” is getting louder.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">When you are one of Jehovah’s witnesses, the days, weeks, months and years go by quickly. They are filled with profitable preaching and unusual experiences. Your life is filled with joyous events and plenty of the right kind of work to do. Like the witnesses in all other parts of the world, God’s servants in Australia lead a full life. They are very busy bearing the fruit of the Kingdom. The Australians have good cause for rejoicing because of the wonderful increases in the number of persons associating with them during the year. By far it has been their best year in field service. In his report the branch servant lets us know how the Australians feel about all this expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All over Australia Jehovah’s witnesses were getting keyed up. Enthusiasm was mounting. We were on the brink of great events! The latter part of March came and then— Brother Knorr’s visit! Memorial celebration! National convention I All of this packed into ten solid days of unprecedented theocratic happenings revitalized the Lord's people in this land and launched them out on a more positive course of new world living and increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the Society’s president and his companion, Brother Henschel, in our midst, we thoroughly enjoyed the four-day Sydney convention. Outstanding was the Memorial celebration. Sobering and timely were the talks by Brothers Knorr and Henschel. The imprint left upon our minds has been a lasting and stimulating one. Previous views on Scriptural points were corrected, others were sharpened up, all gained a better perspective of the theocratic organization and the principles governing it, and the value of God’s Word was made unmistakably clear to us. The provision was rich, refreshing, and according to our needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the branch office the visit was invaluable. Applying the practical counsel given us has resulted in a conserving of time and in greater efficiency so that more is accomplished with a reduced force. Arrangements were also made to spread out into new fields in the Pacific, and headway Is being made in that direction. We are truly grateful to Jehovah for all such considerate attention and help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Undeniable evidence of expansion is also found in the fact that 771 persons were immersed during the year. This is more than the number baptized during the previous three years combined. New ones, whether old or young, are quick to act upon their privileges now. Bearing this out is the following experience: “A pioneer called at a house previously missed. At the door a 65-year-old man explained that he was deaf. Undismayed, the publisher showed him a copy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">'Let God Be True’,</span><span class="font6"> wrote down the contribution on a notebook and succeeded in making the placement. When a back-call was made later it was found the man had read the book three times and now wanted another book. So </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Truth Shall Make You tree’</span><span class="font6"> was left, and after reading that through twice he asked to be immersed. His next forward step was a request to come to meetings. Though some thought it might be useless for him to attend meetings, he settled that by saying he knew the Lord would bless him because of assembling with His people. Now he has been out in the service for two months.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the false religious clergy lay hold of material things for selfish gain, Jehovah’s witnesses seize opportunities to unselfishly feed the hungry sheep, as can be seen from the following experience: ‘‘In calling on a lady who had been associated we learned she was staying with folks who were strict Methodists. . . . We discovered the hostess to be an elderly person and a foundation member of the local Methodist church having an engraved stone bearing her name on the front wall of the ‘church’. However, they were not happy as they had no minister. This is because the congregation was not large or affluent enough to provide the salary demanded, including a car and house. We suggested that they might like a Bible study in the home. This was readily agreed upon. The study has now progressed to the point where we have ten regular students, including the church organist, Sunday school superintendent and other neighbors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not only our preaching but also our actions identify us as a people cultured in the ways of a new world society. People are watching Jehovah’s witnesses as never before. They are seeking information about us. As the work continues its forward movement and growth it is inevitable that the eyes of all will be focused on this strange work that captures the attention of the whole world. In this closing drama of the ages God’s people are a spectacle indeed as they stand out above all the rest by reason of their blameless ministry and clean worship, their unshakable confidence and hope, their upright dealings, and their love of God, their brothers and all men of good will. How could it be otherwise? No wonder then that Jehovah has so richly blessed the activity of his people and continues to use them mightily in making known his great name. We here in Australia delight to serve with our brothers everywhere in this grand and successful work right down to the accomplished end.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>FIJI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">An increase of over 100 per cent in publishers! How did this come about in the Fiji Islands? There were a few faithful publishers there who were desirous of finding the “other sheep” and they worked hard. This is what the report shows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From time to time Gilead graduates going to other countries stopped by and assisted in the work by putting on public talks. Later in the year, in March, Brothers Knorr and Henschel visited the Fiji Islands. The publishers reached a new peak that month, coming up to 30, with a Memorial attendance of 55. The convention held during the visit of the president certainly proved to be a stimulus to all the publishers. This was evidenced in April when they moved ahead to another peak in publishers, and before the year was over they had gone up to 117 per cent increase. This marked increase has caused quite a stir in false religious circles, and the various church organizations are making great outbursts concerning their “back to church” movement, but they are not meeting with too much success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brothers in Fiji are now putting forth a greater effort In the magazine work. Two years ago only one lone publisher would take a regular part in this service, but now a number of publishers have joined him. It is also a pleasure to report that a number of the local Fijians are now considering the pioneer work and have filed applications. There is still much work to be done and it is the desire of the Society to send more Gilead graduates to take up the missionary field there and work with the local publishers. All in Fiji are very grateful for the blessings Jehovah has poured upon them and they praise Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">While Austria is one nation, still there are four great military powers that occupy different portions of it. This arrangement does not make for unity. The Austrians have their own central government and conditions in the country are much better now than they were several years ago. Nevertheless, the real problems of the day are not solved. Under these conditions Jehovah’s witnesses are pressing forward and they are having very good success in comforting those that mourn. They ‘say to the prisoners, “Go forth!”’ Many hear this good news and are taking their stand alongside Jehovah’s witnesses in these last days and are proclaiming the Kingdom message. Despite the fact that Austria is 94 per cent Roman Catholic as far as membership is concerned, the people give a hearing ear. The branch servant sets out some interesting things relative to their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brothers who live in small villages have to spend a lot of time walking to their territory, as there are no buses or trains. But they are very happy to do this in order to serve the “other sheep”, and the Lord gives the increase. In a small place in the Tyrolian Alps two pioneers started working some time ago, and in February, 1951, three new publishers went into the field service with the pioneers for the first time. By the end of the year there were 13 publishers. This not only happens in the isolated sections, but even in the city of Vienna great increases are made. At the beginning of the year a new unit was started witli 39 publishers in one of the districts of the capital city. The other unit is reporting 78 publishers. Several other units in Vienna moved ahead with very rapid increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses throughout all of Austria, whether they be in the territory under the military control of the Western powers or in the communistic section, are putting forth a real effort to preach the gospel and they meet up with plenty of difficulties. One pioneer writes: “Sometimes the interference becomes so great it is hard to hold on.” But by diligent study they are able to see the importance of continuing. Another pioneer writes: “Now a year of pioneer service is past, a year of joys that satisfy. There have been plenty of difficulties, but these are surpassed by the joys that remain. Without this kind of service life would be empty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Right now there are nine missionaries in the country, all graduates of Gilead, and they have done splendid work. There is plenty of untouched territory that has not been witnessed to for many, many years. More pioneers are needed, as well as company publishers, in order to work this territory and bring the truth to these hungry hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In some of the isolated places the Catholic clergy make a big fuss because public meetings are put on from time to time. A small company decided to visit an isolated village and the publishers advertised a public talk. At the first talk only four persons came and afterward the brothers learned that the priest had announced that no one should go to hear this lecture. However, the little group of publishers did not give up and move on to new territory. Rather, they advertised another talk in this same town and, again, the clergy worked hard against Jehovah’s witnesses. Since it was impossible to obtain a hall for the lecture, it was necessary to hold the second public talk in the open near a castle tower. This time 80 of the Catholic inhabitants attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the present the truth has a free course throughout all of Austria and we rejoice that an all-time peak was reached —2,702 publishers. Jehovah’s witnesses in this land are looking forward to another year of prosperity during which they can sing greater praise to the Most High.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>BAHAMAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">So that there might be an increase in the theocratic work in the Bahamas a branch was established in the city of Nassau on New Providence island. More careful attention will be given to the Bahama Islands now that a branch office is organized. The increase on the islands is noteworthy. A year ago there were 74 publishers and now they have jumped to 110 on an average, with a peak number of 122. The organization of the branch proved profitable and the brothers who live on the islands are happy that they have a greater responsibility now of looking after that territory. The newly appointed branch servant sends in an interesting report. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Following the first visit of the president of the Society and Brother Henschel and the subsequent public meetings held in the city of Nassau, the brothers were delighted with the news that the Bahama Islands would now become a separate branch and that regular visits would be made to the other islands to increase the witness. Since that visit many young persons of good will have become associated with the Society and are now showing real zeal and are anxious to be used in Jehovah's service. The local brothers are taking over the responsibility of servants in the company and all the missionaries need to do is assist them in their work and help them from time to time. This makes for better organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A call for vacation pioneers was heeded and all together 13 responded. The assistant company servant set the example by pioneering on the Island of Andros, where he found much interest. It is believed that a new company will be established here soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the missionaries had an interesting experience. A person of good will on the island had charge of a Mother’s Day celebration and the missionary was invited to give a ten-minute talk. About fifteen persons were on the program, including various clergymen, lawyers and other prominent people. The missionary prepared a talk “New Jerusalem Above, Which Is the Mother of Us All”. A good witness was given to hundreds of persons present, including people difficult to contact in our field work. The amusing thing in this opportunity of giving a public witness was that after the Roman Catholic priest had said Mary was the greatest mother, then the missionary was called on to speak, and he showed that Jehovah’s wonderful organization was the greatest mother of us all. This afforded another opportunity to discuss the matter further with interested persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The branch is planning to hold more public lectures both indoors and outdoors during the coming service year, using many of the theocratically trained ministers now available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some from the Bahamas were able to get to the Wembley Stadium assembly in London, England, and they brought back to the Bahama Islands a good report on clean worship. The work will move ahead under the blessing of Jehovah in the Bahama Islands.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The prospects for freeing more prisoners in Belgium is good. It has a population of about nine million and right now there are a little more than 3,000 publishers reporting eaeh month. However, there are approximately 1,900 towns and villages that are not assigned to companies or pioneers. We can see from this that there is still much work to be done in virgin territory. Catholicism has long been deeply rooted in Belgium, and Belgium is known as the land of churches and cathedrals. But the many churches are not filled. Nevertheless, the people, especially the women, are under the influence of the clergy. This is probably one of the reasons why there are usually more men at the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses than there are women. The men do not pay too much attention to the church affairs. The Belgian people are kindheart-ed and it is pleasant to work among them. The publishers of the Kingdom have some very pleasant experiences, and the branch servant relates some of these in his annual report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy of false religion view with envy and hatred the advance of true worship, and vainly they fight to keep the sheep in their folds. But Jehovah’s witnesses are not at all disturbed at the raving of the false shepherds. How the clergy are becoming alarmed at the progress of pure worship is shown by the following extracts taken from an article entitled “Jehovah’s Witnesses in Luxembourg” (province of Luxembourg in Belgium), published in the December 2, 1950, issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“L’Avenir du Luxembourg”,</span><span class="font6"> we read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“You will say, ‘America and Canada are so far away!' Well, don’t deceive yourselves, Jehovah’s Witnesses have followers in Belgium, and their propagandists, and their faithful, and their meetings, and their halls! . . . ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses,’ you will say, ‘one does not hear about them in Belgium, and above all in our Luxembourg so deeply Catholic, . . . undeceive yourselves. This so-called religious movement of American origin launched a few years ago a regular offensive against our Ardennes villages. . . . We do not know what is going on in all the corners of Luxembourg but we notice that in several villages in the vicinity ot Neufchateau and Bertrix, Jehovah’s Witnesses have taken root.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the small villages where Catholicism reigns supreme the publishers do not have it so easy, but by fearlessly taking the initiative they are triumphing over false religion and putting to flight the opposers, with the result that the persons of good will take courage and flee to Jehovah’s theocratic organization. This is shown by the following experiences had by a Flemish pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While in the witness work in a small village the pioneer was ordered to leave by the dean of the Catholic church. The publisher, of course, refused and continued his work. He returned the following day and was met by the village priest, who likewise commanded him to leave, and he again refused. At this the priest began to go with him to the doors. Then the brother changed his method of presenting the message. When he was greeted at the door, he said, “I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses and the priest has something to say about Jehovah’s witnesses.” The priest then had to talk. He said that the publisher was a Protestant and that he sold Bibles which the people were forbidden to read, etc. The pioneer then refuted what the priest had said. In this way the two worked together for about three hours. Finally the priest would no longer go to the doors, but he stood in the middle of the street, from where he spoke to the people. That day the pioneer placed five books and thirteen booklets. The next day the priest came again to follow the publisher, but this time the brother called the police and the priest disappeared. All of this led to giving a witness to the officials of the town and placing 18 books and 35 booklets in this village of about 1,500 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two Gilead missionaries were sent to the little town of Spa, of some 9,000 inhabitants, slumbering in the Ardennes mountains under the potent spell of the Catholic Church. We have no record of when the town had been worked before, so it was really virgin territory. However, it wasn’t long before the inhabitants of Spa, and especially the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">cures, </span><span class="font6">were wide awake! Now the priests had to work hard. Just about every Sunday they warned the people not to have anything to do with these “American Protestants”. During January the two missionaries placed 69 books and 28 subscriptions, which literally set the town on fire. But it was the article in the April 1, 1951, French </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> about the dogma of the assumption of Mary that really made them wild. Even one of the back-calls called on a nun and proved the matter satisfactorily with a Bible. The nun almost fell over backward when she read that Jesus is called Mary’s “first-born son”. This person of good will noticed that after 35 years in the church the nun couldn’t find the texts as fast as she could after only a few months of studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. Asked if the priest wouldn’t try to make it hard on her, the nun replied, “No, I’ve got too much on him !”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the circuit servant visited Spa a public meeting was organized and 46 persons attended, to the consternation of the clergy. These two missionaries are certainly having an exciting time, but they are enjoying it to the full. The people have great fear of the Catholic Church because if they took their stand it would be difficult for them to make a living; but in spite of this after nine months there are four publishers reporting in this little town and we feel confident that in a few more months others will also take their stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The most joyful occasions of the year were the assemblies held in Europe during August. A group of about 40 attended the international assembly at London, while about GOO attended at Paris and the same number at Rotterdam. During the interval of time between the Paris and Rotterdam assemblies we had our one-day assembly here in Brussels, with an attendance of 1,600 at the public meeting. This was very good considering that it was held in the middle of the week. These joyful and instructive assemblies were just what we needed to start us off right for another service year of prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ban on the transportation of the Society’s publications by railway and the postal system continues, but we have been able to get all the publications to the publishers by truck and boat. One Gilead graduate who was working in Ghent as a pioneer was deported back to the Netherlands because “his presence was considered dangerous to the security of the country”. But he is now busy in the Netherlands, and a Belgian special pioneer whom they can’t deport has taken charge of the work in Ghent, so the expansion of true worship will not slow up in Ghent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our receiving </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Atcake!</span><span class="font6"> twice a month in both languages of Belgium, as announced by Brother Knorr at Paris and Rotterdam, will also be an added impetus to the advance of true worship in this country. We also hope to get some of the new publications in both Hollandish and French before too long. We have many things to be thankful for, and we look forward joyfully to the year ahead of us. We here in the branch office start the new service year more optimistically than ever before, with the determination to work harder for an increase this year. We thank Jehovah for all his undeserved kindness and for the marvelous privilege we have of being in his theocratic organization at this time. Our hearts are overflowing with joy and we cannot keep from singing his praises more and more. We send our love and greetings to you, Brother Knorr, and to all our fellow workers throughout the world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>LUXEMBOURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, that little spot of land that touches Belgium, France and Germany, has Jehovah’s witnesses in it, too. Almost all of the Luxembourg people profess to be Catholics, but the publishers going from door to door find that very few of them believe in God. It is very difficult to interest a person in a study of the Bible. If one asks why the people go to church, the reply will be, “Because everyone else does.” The general principle followed is that you should not be different from anyone else. Even so, there has been an excellent increase in the number of publishers in this beautiful little land, and they have reached a peak of 113. Some of their experiences are very interesting, and the branch office in Brussels gives us the following report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It really requires much perseverance and patience both in the work from door to door as well as in the back-call and Bible-study work; but endurance will produce results if the right mind is there, and so the truth will conquer the lies of false religion and make the people free. The following experience shows this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“A couple had a Bible study in their home for quite a time; the husband did not care much for the church but his wife was an ardent Catholic and went to church at every occasion. She also attended the Bible study, but only because her husband wanted it. She did not show any interest. but was longing for each study hour to pass by quickly. Her husband, however, told her to take note of the scriptures which the priest used in his sermons and also to remember what he said about them. In this way she soon found out that the priest used scriptures that could not be found in the Bible; and, moreover, her husband was always able to refute the priest's sermons by pointing out to her what the Bible itself said about the matter. So she finally got her eyes opened to the truth and both she and her husband are now publishers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another missionary reports: “Up until this year there had been no regular street work with the magazines, but beginning in January this feature of the work was started. Selling anything from house to house or on the streets is forbidden in Luxembourg, but we were determined to start street work even if we had to give the magazines away. This we did. The first few weeks the pioneers and the few publishers who were on the corners aroused much interest, or perhaps we should describe it as curiosity. The false religion of Catholicism has long tried to make the people think that our work was forbidden, but, lo and behold, here we were standing on the street! They couldn’t believe their eyes. When a publisher started to talk to someone several others would gather around and listen in. Of course, the police were there as well as plain-clothes men to see that we didn’t accept a franc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“To counteract this work the priests said that we did the work because we were being paid 1,000 francs an hour (about $20.00) and that we were just an American sect that came here to get back all the Marshall Plan money that we could. The Evangelical Church also joined in on the verbal attack. They complimented us on our zeal but said, ‘What a pity that it is wasted In telling lies.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The visit of Brothers Knorr and Henschel brought great joy to the brothers here, as it was the first time the Society’s president had visited this small country. A one-day assembly was organized, and there was an attendance of 205 at the public meeting, the greatest yet for a theocratic publie meeting in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Working in the field since the assembly we find that Jehovah’s witnesses are everywhere spoken about. Some speak for us and some are against. Several good-will persons who attended the public talk were really enthused as Brother Knorr explained ‘what religion has done for mankind’ and ‘what mankind has done with religion!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yes, another forward step has been made in the direction of clean worship, and, by Jehovah’s grace, many more Luxembourgers will yet abandon false religion, and join the throngs of those praising JAH!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>BOLIVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses in this country have enjoyed six new peaks of publishers during the year. It is interesting to read of their experiences and to know that in the high altitudes of the Andes the good news of the Kingdom is going forward. A number of European persons are leaving their war-torn native lands and are moving to South America and quite a few have settled in Bolivia. Some seed was sown by brothers in Europe and it is being watered now in the Andes. The branch servant tells of an experience in this regard, as well as other happenings in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">Gilead graduate reports her experience with one of these sheep coming from foreign shores. “There are many German people living here not understanding English or Spanish; so the problem was, could we help them? One day I placed a book with a German lady who understands Spanish and I immediately arranged a study. It was not long before she connected our work with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bibelforscher </span><span class="font6">(Bible students, as Jehovah’s witnesses are called in Germany). After a few weeks we were talking of the variety of languages in Bolivia, and I related our problem. She asked, ‘Couldn’t I go with you to the ones that speak German and French?’ You know my answer. Her first study with an Austrian lady was simply marvelous.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There has been some opposition to our work in Bolivia, such as the circulating of handbills against us; and both Catholics and Protestants have been preaching against us in their churches. In one instance, as has happened elsewhere, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Evangelistas’</span><span class="font6"> preaching against us has boomer-anged against them. A study was started with a young couple strong in the evangelistic faith. After studying some of the primary doctrines of the truth of the Bible, they went to church and asked the clergymen after their “services” why they taught immortality of the human soul when the Bible did not teach it. They were immediately asked if they were studying with Jehovah’s witnesses and were told they had better stop because the witnesses were “antichrists”. However, the young couple, who had recently completed a chapter study on Jesus Christ, had too many proofs contrariwise and were soon asked to leave, being told, “We are too busy to talk now.” But these two young people are not too busy to talk, and they are now actively ‘preaching the good news’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Early in the year an energetic Arabic brother of Oruro took up pioneer service while still attending to his dry goods store with the help of his hired hand. He started off with a bang during the October and November Spanish </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font6">campaign and wound up with around 210 subscriptions in all. He has since then moved to La Paz, where he continues zealously In the pioneer service. He has lately organized more studies than he can take care of and has been turning over a number of them to publishers who do not have studies, thus helping them to get started in the Bible study work. We know there is much more work to be done here to feed the Lord’s “other sheep”, and we look forward with joy to the opportunities and privileges to thus make known God’s purposes to the people who love righteousness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This country is tremendous in size, but the little group of Jehovah’s witnesses is making a dent and that dent is being seen. During the past year the newspapers have had much to say about Jehovah’s witnesses and the clergy seem to be worried because so many people are associating themselves with God’s organization. The clergy would especially like to prove to the government that we are a political society and that we have designs against the interests of the people. Recently a government official made investigation, but could not find anything alarming. Jehovah’s witnesses are very active; they carry on Bible studies and they do a lot of preaching and inform the people about the new world. But this is not political; it is not harmful; it is not injurious. This is a difficult pill for the clergy to swallow. It certainly makes us happy to see a 45 per cent increase in the work in Brazil and that now they have reached a new peak of 4,867 publishers. A great crowd is singing praises to Jehovah in Brazil. Some excerpts from the branch servant’s report set forth a few of the experiences of our brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many Brazilians of all ages and walks of life are learning the truth. Take for instance the young boy of ten who read the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font6"> and begged his parents until they consented to also read it and begin the study in their home. He is now a good publisher and, thanks to his persistent efforts, his parents are in the truth too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is the case of the materialist, an evolutionist who barged Into his Catholic brother-in-law’s home during the Bible study conducted by an elderly publisher, disrupting the study procedure, scoffing and cursing the name of Jehovah until the elderly publisher rose to leave. At this point the man of the house reprimanded the godless one, who in turn took it and settled down to listen quietly. This move stirred his wife to also listen to the study. Three months passed and the evolutionist sold his evolution books; the wife relieved her walls and house of Catholic images and pictures and all became Kingdom publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Also an interesting occurrence took place in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro where voodooism is practiced. There the poor superstitious people erect altars upon which they sacrifice chickens and small animals, in front of which are placed burning candles. A pioneer brother lives there in his modest home with his wife and children. As there is no electric current they burn candles for light. The children often gather the old, half-used candles from these altars for use at home, to the great awe of the sacrificers who cannot understand why no harm from the devils comes to the children and family who use them. They view the family with respect and think that the gods like them. This has given many an opening to the pioneer brother to witness to them and prove to many of them the uselessness of their superstitions and powerless gods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Especially in the interior of the country has the radio been used extensively this year, and most of the time free from charge. Sometimes when the stations cannot take the public discourse direct on the air at the time of delivery a wire recorder is used, and it is broadcast later on. This has happened several times during circuit assemblies with the result that many thousands have heard the public talks over the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In some cases the radio stations have even been used by the circuit servant to prepare the way for the week-long visit to the company in that particular city. As one of them from the interior of Sao Paulo state writes, “On arriving in town I went direct to the local radio station and with the help of some of the local publishers gained permission to speak for 15 minutes on the air to explain my visit to the city, the concerted field service work that Jehovah’s witnesses would undertake during the week of my visit, and to invite all the residents to open their homes to a discussion of the Bible with us when we call.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Naturally all this activity throughout the interior has awakened the groggy clergy, both Protestant and Catholic, and many pointed attacks have been made against us through the newspapers, by their religious magazines and by labeling our literature as “heresy” through a campaign of leaflet distribution. But the 13 assemblies held throughout the year have given an especially wonderful witness against them, from the Amazon Basin across the great plains to the border of Argentina. There is still much more work that can be done in Brazil and we are looking ahead to the new service year, confident that Jehovah will advance true worship here and elsewhere.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This colony of Great Britain is as large as England and Scotland combined, but it has a population of only 400,000 inhabitants. These people live in the flat coastlands and along the numerous rivers. Jehovah’s witnesses have a very interesting time visiting the villages, sugar estates and rice farms and witnessing to the East Indians, the Negroes, Chinese, Portuguese and all other kinds of men. British Guiana has a lot of virgin territory. It is a difficult territory to work, but the people living in that country know how to get around and how to talk to the people. These publishers have had some very interesting experiences and an excellent increase in the organization there. The branch servant gives us some good material to think about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two sisters, special pioneers from our local ranks, were assigned to Bartica, a place on the edge of the interior. It has a population of about 4,000, and just one lone brother resided there. Imagine their surprise when inside of two months there were 20 persons regularly attending meetings, with 50 at the Memorial. The brother had never given a public talk before, but, his being faced with necessity, the situation turned out to be the beginning of his publicspeaking career. It was something new to this village when a public-address system began to be used for open-air preaching; and now there is always </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> crowd of from two to three hundred who will listen throughout the lecture. Theii<sup>1</sup> only complaint, whatever the subject, is that we do not hold public meetings often enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another special pioneer finds himself the sole publisher in a population of 30,000, a large proportion being Hindus. Being an East Indian himself, he has been able to make some good progress, for now there are others associating with him in the service. Two missionaries have been assigned to the center of the bauxite industry, with about 10,000 population within reach. Now they have a strong little company of nine publishers operating, and recently a fine witness was given when many of the public turned out to witness the affirmation of some of these new ministers at the open-air immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The stereotype method of witnessing certainly has no place in this territory, for in a single locality one may come across the ardent Catholic, an argumentative Mohammedan, a Hindu who will listen at any time, and a variety of others. The majority will listen attentively and, provided they can read and have the money, many will readily take literature. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazines are especially popular, and often a single publisher while traveling a few hours by train or boat will place 40 or 50 copies. Since </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> has adopted its new style with so much variety in it many more persons really read it and comment upon the practical subjects discussed. One incident is reported of some church members’ taking along </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> on “Marriage” to their clergyman In defense of a divorced person who, on Scriptural grounds, wanted to be remarried. They won their argument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In aiming for our 34 per cent goal we made three successive peaks, finally going beyond all our expectations in making a 45 per cent increase. This required the persistent vigilance of all the servants in assisting their brothers, along with the co-operation of missionaries, pioneers and other publishers, so that together all can rejoice in having had a share in the year’s campaign. All are thankful to Jehovah for the many blessings received and look forward with confidence to a new year of blessings.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>BRITISH HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Last year there were four of Jehovah’s witnesses from British Honduras who came to the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in New York. They returned with great zeal and enthusiasm and desired to see the increase, and they sounded that message throughout British Honduras during the year. The things that occurred in Yankee Stadium were accepted quickly by all of the publishers. They were delighted with the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font7"> and were anxious to carry on greater Bible-study work. They have carried on that work, because we see a 28 per cent increase in the number of publishers singing the praises of the Most High. The branch servant tells us the following about the work in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The false religions of this world have done nothing to enlighten the eyes of understanding of the people in this country. They do not show them what is right or wrong. They set a bad example for the people, as far as morality is concerned. The lovers of truth and righteousness see that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> stands squarely for the principles set forth in the Bible, and many are now associating with Jehovah’s witnesses so as to carry on clean, undefiled worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We were very glad to receive two new missionaries, this time colored brothers from the 16th class of Gilead. These colored ministers were accepted gladly by the people of good will, and they have done excellent work along with all the publishers here. In July and August, the two months of the 1951 service year that these two missionaries worked in the colony, new peaks were reached in publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no organized opposition to the work in British Honduras, but it can certainly be seen that the religionists of the country are very much opposed to the work that God’s servants are doing. Religion is a subject in which many people in the land are interested, and often discussions start on the street corners, and large groups form and listen to what each of the parties has to say. These discussions are common In Belize, the capital city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the missionaries reports that just before going to the New York assembly last year he made a back-call on a man who works in a dockyard. While speaking to this gentleman, another young man appeared, to ask some questions. These were discussed, but no follow-up was made with the second person because the publisher was leaving the country shortly. The witness thought that the questions were asked for the purpose of carrying on an argument. However, when this missionary returned to his assignment again he was surprised to find the young man attending the Kingdom Hall meetings. Now he engages in field service and is a very active publisher for the Kingdom. It is difficult to say where the good news will take root. Some falls on good soil, and some falls among the thorns. If it is on good soil, the truth will find an increase, and the increase is on in British Honduras.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>BRITISH ISLES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There is a tremendous field for service in the British Isles. More than 50 million people live in this territory, and the field can use many more workers. Jesus said to the disciples: “Look! I say to you: Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting.” (John 4:35, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font7"> A wonderful opportunity presents itself to all the energetic publishers in this land to go ahead in this harvesting work. A good witness has been given during the past twelve months, and it was brought to a close with the “Clean Worship” Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses at Wembley Stadium. The branch servant sends in a good report, and some of the high lights are printed here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The outstanding event in the British Isles during 1951 was the international convention at Wembley Stadium. When we first learned that there would be a convention in London, in August, there was much rejoicing. As the months rolled by enthusiasm mounted, and preparation was made for this great gathering of Christians from many lands. The convention is now a matter of history, but it has certainly proved to be a milestone in the forward march of the theocratic interests in this land. Representatives from forty countries were in attendance, and a mighty witness to the name of Jehovah has been given. From one end of the country to the other the public press carried reports of what was happening at Wembley during the days of August 1 to 5, and, generally speaking, these reports were fair; so much so, that the Catholic press said: &quot;Jehovah’s witnesses got a pretty good Press for their recent international rally at Wembley. One of the two dailies which took no notice of the recent (Catholic) celebrations at Aylesford spread itself lavishly over this sect. To a reader asking the reason for such selectivity I can only reply that (1) I don’t know and (2) it doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great shout at Wembley has reverberated around the country ever since, and no wonder, for the lecture given by the Society’s president on “Will Religion Meet the World Crisis?” seems to have stung the clergy and made them sit up and take notice. As if by way of confirmation of all that was stated there, one of the leading newspapers has been conducting a survey of “Religion in England”, and this is what they find: “The English are no longer a nation of practicing Christians, only six out of a hundred are fervent church-goers attending more than one church service a week. With the Church of England the position is frankly appalling, just one in ten is a regular churchgoer; four times that number never enter a church at all for religious worship.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After stating that “a mere quarter pass the simple test of genuine loyalty to their faith—regular attendance at a place of worship”, it further says: “If these institutions were properly used to imbue the children with the teachings of Christianity, the gloomy picture of religion in England might be transformed within twenty years.” It is interesting to note that among the professing Christians this survey classifies Jehovah’s witnesses with some others as “much the most devout”. This, then, is the picture presented of religion in England. There can be no doubt that it is a true picture, for many of the church buildings are becoming empty and converted to commercial purposes. The deterioration is open for all to see, but the supporters of organized religion are unable to do anything about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The instrument the Lord gave us at the convention, the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font6"> will surely prove a great blessing in helping to locate the “other sheep” and aiding them to join with Jehovah's witnesses in calling upon all to “Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king”. For this gift and the other releases of the four tracts and the new booklet, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Will Religion Meet the World Crisis?</span><span class="font6"> we are deeply grateful to Jehovah. We hope to make good use of these instruments Jehovah has provided to show honest people what false religion has done for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The witness work has had free course with little interference. The people are tolerant, and without doubt the rank and file of the people have respect for Jehovah’s witnesses and their bold, uncompromising stand for their Christian principles. This finds its expression with many of the younger brothers who are called up for military service Recently one brother appearing in court was asked by the chairman how long he had been engaged in this work. On being Informed that he had been engaged in it since he was eight years of age, the chairman responded: “If anyone of eight years of age came to my door and asked if he could give me religious instruction, I would tell him he was an impudent young whelp and tell him to get out of this.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The above was reported in the daily press, and a week later a letter appeared: “As a Catholic and therefore a member of an allegedly intolerant faith, I note with Interest the remark of the chairman in dismissing an appeal on conscientious objection by a Jehovah’s witness. ... I seem to remember a Child being found in the temple addressing the wise men of Jerusalem. Again we are warned that the road to salvation lies in the direction of the simplicity of Christ’s little ones.” As a matter of fact, the young witnesses are doing a splendid work and they are quite capable of presenting the message of the Kingdom effectively, but some of these wiseacres are not open to learn from those whom the Lord is using.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year some fifty young brothers spent time in prison, varying from one month to twelve months, for refusing military service or for refusing to be directed away from their pioneer ministry. While the law provides for exemption for “regular ministers” the courts have not acknowledged them to be ministers, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary. The publicity connected with these cases has stirred many to express their sympathy with our brothers as they have sought to stick to their privilege of serving as ministers of the Most High God. No matter what those administering the law may say, the fact remains that Jehovah has called into his service those who are ministers and no man can deny or take away from them their privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As we have reached the close of another year we are deeply grateful to Jehovah, our Father in the heavens, for the blessings the year has brought to us. The international convention: the presence with us of the president, Brother Knorr; then, too. the privilege of fellowship with our brothers from other lands, and, above all, the increasing light of truth bringing with it privileges of service which are a great treasure.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>EIRE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The people of Eire are humble and hospitable. They are truly likable people in so many ways. Life is slow-moving, and the countryside is beautiful with its intensely green fields and lazily flowing rivers. It would be a pleasant place were it not for the bitter feud that false religion has created in the minds of the Irish. Anyone who knows anything about Ireland knows that bitterness exists between Catholic and Protestant, and this is very hard for them to live down. Real opposition is shown against Jehovah’s witnesses. Territory is hard to work, and those working it must have real zeal and the joy of the Lord. The brothers there know that there are “other sheep” in Eire, and it is their privilege and opportunity now to help them. The branch servant reports the following about Eire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a growing band of Kingdom publishers who are doing what they can to tell the people of Eire about the Kingdom as their only hope, and these are made up of over thirty pioneers and about seventy company publishers. It requires much tact to effectively present the Kingdom message in Eire. Mobs quickly gather if a number of publishers are together In the street. It is not practicable to work the territory as elsewhere. From experience it is found that the best results can be obtained by quietly visiting the homes and talking about the blessings of the Kingdom which Jesus taught his followers to pray for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When people begin to gather it is wise to move to another street and continue there. The priests describe the literature as “scurrilous writings of bad-minded Americans”. A public appeal was made to the government some while back for the expulsion of Jehovah’s witnesses from Eire. This is what the Catholic hierarchy in Eire would like, for they know that Jehovah's witnesses are the only people that they have cause to fear. But the Eire “Constitution” guarantees freedom to practice religion by others as well as Catholics, so the Kingdom message continues to go out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is good to see that the home Bible studies have increased, for we can be sure that the quiet, effective instruction received in the home will bear fruit in due course. With a population of less than 3,000,000 and with the chief occupation agricultural, the work is carried on mainly in the two largest cities, Dublin and Cork.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was a great joy to the pioneers and company publishers in Eire when they knew that Brother Knorr would visit them prior to his going to the convention in London. There was some difficulty in securing suitable halls for the occasion, but places were finally located in both Cork and Dublin. The people of good will were gathered together, and enthusiastic meetings were held, with much rejoicing on the part of the faithful workers in these cities. These visits, we know, will do much to quicken the interest as well as strengthen the Kingdom publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We hope to see more publishers in Eire and a more extensive witness given in the immediate future. There can be no doubt that the fiord’s “sheep” are there to be contacted and, with the Lord’s help, these will be reached and made strong enough to stand for the truth and to make it their own.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>MALTA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There has been one brother who has taken a share in the work in Malta month by month during the year. Although the report from Malta is only small, we are glad to know that at least one voice is lifted in praise to Jehovah in this island in the Mediterranean sea. Malta is dominated by Roman Catholicism, and the authorities there do not like the Kingdom message, for they have tried to stop the work altogether. However, they cannot stop a person from talking, and while a ban may be put on the organized work of Jehovah’s witnesses, it does not stop the message from being proclaimed. One sister from England shared in the work in Malta for a short time but is no longer on the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the close of the service year, the brother has come to England too; so, for the time being, no more reports will be received from Malta. We hope that the day will not be far distant when this Catholic-controlled island will hear more about the Kingdom, for we know no power on earth can stay the onward march of the Kingdom message as it reaches out to the islands of the sea.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>BRITISH WEST INDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Like every other branch, during the past year the prime objective in the British West Indies has been the gathering of the “other sheep”. The eyes of all the Kingdom publishers were set on the 34 per cent increase. Through hard work and conscientious effort they gained this and more, having a peak of publishers that meant an increase of 41 per cent over last year’s peak. Now there are 2,403 publishers working in the thirteen islands under the direction of the British West Indies branch office in Trinidad. They have had many interesting experiences during the year, which show how the people are turning toward clean worship. Excerpts from the branch servant’s report are very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Opposition in previous years has been rather light and inconsequential. This past year has seen a marked change. It is not localized but extends to all the islands under the branch. Putting the finger on the cause of this general stiffening of religious intolerance and persecution is an article that appeared in the Catholic press of Trinidad entitled “Ban on Watchtower literature”. The ban of recent years was recalled to the minds of many, but an examination of the article revealed the local archbishop in Port of Spain prohibiting Catholic people from “buying, distributing, keeping, lending or reading the periodicals known as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> as well as the pamphlets and other literature issued by the same publishers”. Such foolish announcement only added impetus to the work and created more interest, as many honest-hearted Catholics are wanting to know why they are not allowed to read our publications, and are asking questions. Typical of the many disgusted replies was the one by a Catholic man, “He doesn’t have to tell me what or what not to read. I will continue to read the Watchtower publications, as I have found nothing wrong with them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, some misguided zealots have allowed their religious fervor to run away with their reason, and they have interfered with the rights of others. Magazines have been jerked out of the hands of publishers engaged in street work, torn up in their faces and thrown in the gutter. To put an end to this, the Catholic wife of an estate manager was charged with assault and destruction of property. The court upheld our right to do this work, and the magistrate, himself a Catholic, in passing sentence severely reprimanded her, stating, “This is supposed to be a democratic country yet.” He fined her $15.00 and costs and included the cost of the magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To attend an assembly on another island is costly and creates a financial strain for nearly all the publishers here. Consequently, few from other islands receive the benefits of assembling together in our larger conventions. However, this year, for the first time, we have seen many making great sacrifices in order to attend the assemblies and receive the blessings of feasting at the Lord’s table. One group of 14, many of whom had never traveled off their island before, hired a schooner and attended their first big assembly. To help provide enough to pay for the trip, such things as bananas, mangos and coconuts were shipped with them and sold upon arrival at their destination. Now being “assembly-conscious” they are looking forward to future assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Barbados, the religious group most hostile to the truth is that known as the “Pilgrim Holiness”, noted for its ‘hot gospel’ and hell-fire screeching. As a result of the district assembly one of their leaders has now accepted the truth. For the past year many questions existed in his mind concerning the fundamental truths of the Scriptures. He was Invited to come to the assembly, and he attended all sessions. Being colored, what impressed him most were the love and consideration among Jehovah’s witnesses, and how there was no discrimination among them. This was not so, he said, among “holiness” people, for when their white missionaries came from America they always held themselves aloof from the colored folks. Now’ this good-will man finally asked the brother who brought him how </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font6"> too could help to achieve the 34 per cent increase, as he w'anted to serve the true God, Jehovah. And on Sunday morning, before attending the sessions, he wrote out his resignation and sent it to the “elder” of the “holiness church” where he had been a “pillar”, the Sunday school superintendent, for many years. Many have followed with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another, an Anglican clergyman on a small island In the Grenadines, thought to enlarge his idolatrous activities by bringing a portable image of the virgin Mary into the church and setting it in a nice alcove. The congregation had other ideas, and so one dark night they threw it out on the road. The next day the Image was back in the church and the congregation was called together and advised by the priest that this was an image of the virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus, and it was going to remain in the church. The image remained, but quite a number of the people left, never to return. As a result, about 40 persons became interested in the truth. Jehovah’s promise, “And from all your idols, will I cleanse you” (Ezek. 36: 25), is to be realized in due time, and that is exactly w'hat he is doing for thousands of persons of good will today.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark111"></a>BULGARIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There are a few of Jehovah’s witnesses in this land, but there is no freedom for the Lord’s work. Whai preaching is done cannot be accomplished openly because the government forbids the talking or distributing of the message of the Kingdom. However, some fearless publishers have done good work by word of mouth, not with the literature. They have none. It is known that 50 persons are able to do a little, but they must be very careful to whom they talk about the glorious blessings that Jehovah God will bring to those who love righteousness. The Society does all it possibly can to keep them informed on present truths. These dear brothers have a real interest in our prayers, and we hope that they can continue faithfully, even under the adverse conditions that exist.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>BURMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">While large-scale resistance to the government forces seems to have been broken in Burma, still there are dozens of bands of rebels hiding in the hills. They come into the towns, sack them, blow up bridges and trains, burn villages and ambush those traveling by cars, trucks, buses and by foot, and in general terrorize everybody. Under these conditions it is obviously dangerous to travel. This has a great effect upon the service work, too. This can be seen during the past year by the dwindling number of publishers. With the advances of the communists in Korea and China, a number of the Burmese brothers became uneasy and thought it well to go to a safer place. All of these conditions were not encouraging to the branch servant. Let us see what his report reveals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The inevitable result of these combined factors was a sharp slump in Kingdom activity, with publishers dropping to a low of 65 in December. Certainly when we considered the Society’s request to aim for a 34 per cent increase over last year’s peak of 87, which would mean getting a total of 117 publishers for Burma, it looked impossible. Then came news that electrified the brothers. Brothers Knorr and Henschel were coming to visit us in April!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Everyone now began to work with more enthusiasm and we climbed out of the slump. As April drew near, a delay in securing entry visas for our visiting brothers made us anxious, and this was increased when about a week before the visit the Rangoon water supply was suddenly cut off by insurgents. For a week we had barely enough water to drink, let alone to wash with, and the open sewers began to smell to high heaven. Then just a day or two before the arrival of the brothers the water supply was restored. What a relief!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Once more Brother Knorr ran into the water festival, which again had the effect of hindering our activities. Just the same, 256 persons came to listen to him at the City Hall and gave good attention. Thereafter Brother Knorr was permitted to broadcast a comforting Bible message over the Rangoon radio for fifteen minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This assembly was indeed a joyful occasion for God’s people in Burma. Coming as it is did at a time when the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Far Eastern situation was so critical, we thoroughly appreciated Brother Henschel’s counsel and Brother Knorr’s fighting admonition to us, “Encourage the brothers to stay in Burma and keep on preaching no matter what happensI”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By way of immediate assistance to help speed the good news, the president approved the appointing of several special pioneers. The unselfish and diligent work of these brothers has since then played a large part in the continued forward march of the Kingdom interests here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thereafter the forward march began to quicken, and, to the great delight of the publishers, a series of new peaks was attained. In May we made 95. In June we climbed over the 100 mark for the first time in the history of Burma, to make it 108 for that month. July broke all records when we swept past the much-desired 117-pubiisher mark (34 per cent increase) to reach the splendid new total of 123 prais-ers of Jehovah in Burma—a 40 per cent increase! The brothers were overjoyed to think that Burma would be listed among the countries passing the 34 per cent goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One class of people here who have given an attentive ear to the Kingdom message are the Chin soldiers, who hail from the Chin hills of northern Burma. However, many of them speak neither English nor Burmese (only Chin dialect), although a number of their officers do speak some English. A meeker class of people it would be hard to find. Several months ago the circuit servant and some other brothers in a little northern town were making back-calls in a Chin barracks and met their pastor. He immediately offered to take the brothers to several of his friends who were interested in the Bible, and to do the interpreting. The offer was gladly accepted, and the brothers listened in surprise as the pastor interpreted questions and answers on such subjects as “Where are the dead?” “What is hell?” etc. In fact, the pastor enjoyed it so much that he offered to take the brothers to a Chin outpost four miles away up in the hills. When the post was reached 20 soldiers gathered for a discussion, bringing such Bibles as were available. The discussion lasted for over an hour, with the soldiers asking many intelligent questions and listening eagerly to the answers. Here it was necessary for the circuit servant to speak through two interpreters, one brother translated from English into Hindustani while the pastor (who spoke no English) translated from Hindustani into Chin. Ail had an enjoyable time! When it was over, the soldiers not only expressed their thanks for the Bible assistance given but provided the weary brothers with tea and then gave them a ride in a truck back to their lodging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Have you ever read the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> magazine?” asked a publisher on a Rangoon street corner. On receiving an affirmative reply to his inquiry, he was able to place a magazine and obtain the address of the interested person, who was a Tamilian (South Indian). Following up this placement he found both the man and his wife and also their grown-up son and daughter all interested in hearing about the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the war the son was given a copy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;</span><span class="font6"> as a parting gift by a friend. He was so impressed by it that on arrival at his destination he inquired at all the bookshops for other like publications, but without success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, when visited by the publisher in Rangoon, the opportunity arose to Increase his knowledge, and immediately a Bible study was started with the father and son in the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font6"> This group was soon joined by another boy, a friend of the son. This boy is a Goanese and a Catholic. Soon the Kingdom truths penetrated, and within a short time all were publishing, and now two conduct their own Bible studies. They give talks at the theocratic ministry school and attend the other company meetings regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The father, who previously was quite a pillar of one of the local “churches”, was asked by the clergyman why he no longer attended church, to which he replied that he was too busy going out and preaching himself. The clergyman then asked him to speak at the church. He readily agreed and gave a talk on “Who Are Jehovah’s Witnesses?” which cleared up the doubts of many concerning the witnesses. This talk was given in Tamil, a language hardly ever used before in witnessing in Burma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not to be forgotten either is the excellent work which one lone pioneer, Brother Dewar, is doing in northern Burma, in the Mandalay-Maymyo district, which has been and still is the scene of much bitter fighting. A promising company is growing up here, but more pioneers are urgently needed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses in Canada have had marvelous success in gathering together the “other sheep”, and they will continue to 'say to the prisoners, “Go forth!” ’ We feel sure that there are many more who will be coming forth and associating themselves with the Lord’s organization. The branch office in Canada continually invites pioneers in well-worked territories to go to those sections that do not receive the Kingdom witness so often. The response to this call has been splendid, and the results most gratifying. The Canadian field has also supplied many students for Gilead school. These have graduated and have been sent to foreign lands. The spirit in Canada is good and the branch servant reports some interesting things that happened in the 1951 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fired with godly zeal for Theocracy’s increase we departed from New York, the greatest of all modern Christian assemblies, determined to press forward during 1951 proclaiming the Kingdom everywhere and to make it the best service year on record. Now as the year’s activity is reviewed it is inspiring to see how Jehovah has blessed our efforts. For the first time the 20,000 mark in publishers has been surpassed, and 28,279 attended the Memorial celebration in March.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Without doubt the outstanding reason for increase has been the rich nourishment provided by Jehovah through the pages of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font6"> From the time of release of the new-style magazine at New York there has been increased interest in this vital journal, and numerous expressions are heard about it. Its convenient size, the rich variety of subjects covered, the interest-gripping headings and illustrations, and the satisfying answers to the readers’ questions are among the high lights frequently extolled. This accounts for the enthusiastic presentation of the magazine during the 13th annual </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> campaign, when 21,296 subscriptions were obtained and hundreds of thousands of single copies were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another campaign which stirred up considerable interest in Jehovah’s witnesses, to the dismay of our enemies, was the nation-wide distribution of the March 8 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> reporting the Supreme Court decision on the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Boucher</span><span class="font6"> sedition case. In addition to distributing over 300,000 copies in English, we printed and distributed throughout the province of Quebec an eight-page French edition, to the number of 150,000. For a long time the Quebec Catholics have accused Jehovah’s witnesses of being communists, so we also distributed in the French language over 100,000 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font6">carrying the Resolution against communism adopted at the New York convention, which has refuted the priest-inspired iies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A vigorous fight to advance true religion in the face of entrenched opposition has been carried on in Quebec. A new peak of 1,091 company publishers was reached in March. In addition there are 215 full-time publishers, including 80 missionaries, 12 specials and 213 general pioneers working there. The major part of the increase has been among the French-speaking people, and in order to intensify this the French school in Montreal Is continually aiding pioneers to equip themselves for more effective work. Even the rural areas of Quebec are being penetrated with the glad tidings, and, by reason of patience, endurance and love for one’s neighbor, fruitage is being harvested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The opposition in this Catholic province continues to be marked by threats, boycotts, mobbings and every other tactic so well known to the Hierarchy. However, the enemy activities have been checked considerably by some outstanding victories in the courts. The well-known </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Boucher </span><span class="font6">seditious libel case, based on the distribution of the leaflet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Quebec’s Burning Hate,</span><span class="font6"> in 1946, was finally brought to a completely successful conclusion that was a shattering blow to the enemy. The Supreme Court of Canada had given the appeal the unheard-of concession of a rehearing. This time nine judges sat instead of five as previously, and by a majority of five to four ordered an acquittal, much to the discomfiture of the Roman Hierarchy, which for twenty years has been accusing the Lord’s people of sedition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite this decision Attorney General Duplessis insists on proceeding with the hundred other libel charges based on exactly the same document. Two of these have already been before the courts, and he has lost both. During the service year there have been 50 arrests and three convictions (all of which have been appealed). Montreal police have continued to illegally interfere with our house-to-house ministry, so a number of damage actions for false arrest have been launched. The perseverance of the faithful publishers in Quebec is accomplishing its purpose, and in. spite of the enemy threats and wicked actions these faithful ministers are there to stay until all of the Lord’s “other sheep” have been located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Attendance at and enthusiasm for circuit and district assemblies continually increase. Although the largest public meeting was held at Toronto’s Maple Leaf Gardens, the most outstanding assembly was the one in Montreal, Quebec, where the Verdun Auditorium was engaged for all sessions, including the public address by the Society's president. Here the Hierarchy’s henchmen suffered a severe setback, as all their efforts to prevent the assembly were thrust back by new world fighters. This running battle took us into the courts of Montreal with injunction proceedings, and it was not until the assembly had actually started and the brothers who had proceeded calmly with all preparatory work were assembled for the address of welcome that victory came. The president’s timely speech “Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land” was heard by an attentive audience of 3,500.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah's witnesses are known throughout Canada as the real light-bearers and true servants of the people. The victories during the past year with the attendant publicity have put us in a most favorable position and many are indeed saying, “You are the ministers of the Most High.” Our prayer is that 1952 will produce a still greater fruitage to Jehovah’s praise in Canada.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>CHILE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s servants in Chile had a most blessed year. They enjoyed a 66 per cent increase in the average number of publishers and reached a new all-time peak of 765. Even with this great increase the brothers there find the same problem exists as exists in other countries: a lot of planting is done but the seed falls on poor soil. This, however, is not a discouragement. They know that seed will fall on good soil, too, and that these must be gathered and cared for within the Lord’s organization. The things the Lord’s organization provides for the feeding of these “other sheep” are also essential, and the branch servant makes mention of this in his report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The enthusiasm of the Memorial grew with the arrival of the new aid, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot;</span><span class="font6"> in Spanish, with its schedule for study of the Bible itself. Truly a wonderful help to equip the publishers, new and old, for the ministry I The new book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life” </span><span class="font6">was also received at a very opportune time, stimulating more action. It filled a great need, being a new instrument for public distribution setting out God’s requirements for those seeking the way to new world living. No, a lower standard was not to be accepted so that more could be counted as publishers, rather, in clear terms, the new book showed that all who desire life must convert from their former ways and come up to new world standards. These require that more time be put to profitable use and, as always, the Lord’s organization was right there with another provision for increasing praise. The new public talks were received, translated and printed in Spanish. Such was a great help, as well as the many articles in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaga</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">;Despertad!</span><span class="font6"> which filled the need of up-to-date information for the brothers in preparing their talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As in all parts of this old world, so in Chile, the seed of the Kingdom truth falls on all kinds of soil. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">h-tower</span><span class="font6"> article on the “parable of the sower” expressed the feelings of many servants and publishers here when it said, “The rocky-soil class who at first raise hopes in us turn out painfully disappointing to us.” The economic problems and the anxious cares of this life carry away many v Iio could be just as fruitful as others. So after spending much time helping new interest advance to the point of becoming publishers, to then find them returning to the “pleasures of this life” is certainly disappointing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A unit in Santiago experienced that. During the first nine months of the 1951 service year dozens of new publishers were taking up the proclamation of the “pure language”, but still new peaks in publishers were not reached. Yes, cares of this system of things were making it hard for many to put up a hard fight for the faith. However, the mature ones pressed on and, like “the good soil”, produced fruit. In just the last three months of the service year, the unit increased 34 per cent! Other units and companies had their problems too, but all made a good finish and nearly all passed their quota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And now a glance at the possibilities for the new service year gives hopes of passing the 1,000-publisher mark. Certainly every publisher is now more fully equipped. Spiritual food and preaching equipment are being received from the I,ord's organization in greater abundance than ever before. Jehovah’s King, Christ Jesus, is gathering the “other sheep” now, and by His undeserved kindness the people praising Jah will continue to increase in Chile.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">People throughout the world are informed concerning China’s international relations and they know, too, about the revolution and something of its social system. It is really difficult to get something new started, that is, new to China. But the Scriptures point out that the good news of the Kingdom must be preached in all the world for a witness, and to that end Jehovah’s witnesses are trying to preach it in China. While many false religious missionaries are fleeing that country, the Society’s Gilead-trained missionaries still remain and we hope they can stay there to help the “other sheep”. We have an interesting report from the branch servant. He tells us what is going on in Shanghai and also in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At present there are three missionaries in Shanghai and during the past four years these have done a good work in reaching many persons with the truth. Many hundreds of persons have enjoyed studies with the missionaries, and approximately 90 of these have progressed sufficiently to start out in the field service. However, conditions have forced many of these to move away from China, and others have yielded to fear before becoming mature and have fallen away; so our peak in Shanghai is only 25 publishers. So to build up a strong and large congregation is not easy, but progress is being made. The past year has certainly been our best year to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We were very thrilled to hear of your visit to Hong Kong and of the very successful assembly there. It would have been w’onderful if you could have traveled on to Shanghai to meet all the brothers here, but this was impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While we often feel like a train shunted onto a siding, yet we have kept in constant touch with our mother organization. Jehovah has been gracious and has seen to it that we have been supplied with all the up-to-date spiritual food. Especially do we appreciate the regular supply of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font6"> As we do not have </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> In Chinese we have presented the substance of the articles in the form of translated talks for the benefit of the Chinese brothers. We have done the same with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life&quot;, </span><span class="font6">many in attendance taking notes and sharing in the reviews held the following week. We were granted an Import license to import a number of these books, also the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font6"> The new translation is greatly treasured by all understanding English and is now our textbook in the ministry school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our largest meeting of the year was the Memorial, with 97 in attendance. It was a thrill to see so many respond to the invitations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Missionaries of the various religions have been packing their bags and leaving by the hundreds. As they pack up they know they have no good fruits to leave behind in the way of true Christians, although they have had a wonderful opportunity to disciple the multitudes of the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many people have come in contact with Christianity through attending schools run by missionaries. Very often they eventually leave school very confused on the subject, while some are quite opposed. We have been able to study with some of these confused ones and found them to have a real love for the Bible. One sister Invited three of her former school friends to her home, and a Bible study was started. It was soon evident that they were lovers of God’s Word, and they progressed rapidly. One of these women then came in for much pressure from Catholic friends. They tried every way to break her from the study. Instead she became more convinced of the truth, and finally they left her alone. Soon she became a publisher with real zeal. This aroused her husband’s anger and she came in for much unpleasantness and persecution, but she remains firm. She and the other two women have been immersed and are regular publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Throughout the year we have been keeping up house-to-house work with good support by the local brothers. A total of 15 new ones shared with us in this work during the year. The work has become increasingly difficult because of the tightening political control and the fear that this genders. It was not unexpected when toward the close of the year the foreign missionaries were ordered by the police to cease their house-to-house activity. So we face the new year with increased obstacles in our way. But we are confident that the truth will continue to be preached in one way or another and that the gospel will be preached to Jehovah’s satisfaction here before the accomplished end comes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>HONG KONG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">With conditions in the Far East as fragile as an eggshell the democratic outpost of Hong Kong has gotten through another year little changed. But to those who joy in theocratic advancement the picture is different, for this year has seen the work stabilized and strengthened. The Society now maintains a new missionary home in busy Kowloon, where missionaries stay in airy quarters, with room enough for the Kingdom Hall, which is in use every day for private studies as well as company and public meetings. The chart shows the year started with its quota of seven publishers and rose to a peak of 24 in August, plus one vacation pioneer. Memorial night saw 91 persons squeeze into space prepared for 60. Last Memorial there were 22 present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The high light of the year was the visit of Brothers Knorr and Henschel. This was the first Hong Kong assembly, and it meant something entirely new to our Chinese brothers who worked with a will, so that we all got a great surprise and thrill to see over 700 fill the Star Theatre, which was given free for the public talk. Yes, the visit put us on the map, for it brought a peak of 21 publishers, most of whom have worked steadily ever since and contributed to our peak of 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the dark days of the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong a young man seeking the truth lighted on some second-hand books published by the Society. He struggled to understand them because he discerned that here was something different that rang true. Years later when the war was over he came across </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font6"> also on a second-hand stall, apparently a copy distributed by a visiting American artisan engaged in rehabilitation. Next he got in touch with the Society, so when we landed we had a study practically arranged. Recently we had another request from the Society to call upon an interested person, and lo, it turns out to be the original owner of the books that found their way to the second-hand stall! The books had been looted when the Japanese took over. Both persons are now publishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the five missionaries the year has been occupied mostly with studies and latterly aiding new ones into the field, so that there are now 30 to swell the glad sound, and we are happy to hear the Society contemplates sending further Gilead graduates in order that the island of Hong Kong itself will get the witness. Now as we contemplate a new service year we greatly rejoice, especially with the added incentive of working under a new branch now established in Hong Kong.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>COLOMBIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The theme of the convention at Yankee Stadium in 1950 became the theme of the publishers in Colombia. It was Theocracy’s increase. Every effort was made to help someone else get out into the field service, and the publishers were particularly interested in Magazine Day, too. They arranged to go from door to door and from store to store. In the report from the branch servant we note that they distributed 24,127 magazines this past year, to compare with the previous year’s 8,175 copies. All of this has a real effect on the minds of the people. If there are obstacles in distributing the magazines on the streets, there is always the door-to-door method, where greater numbers are placed. It has been a real struggle to keep the work moving in Colombia, but this year finds the Lord’s people associating together in the number of 269, their peak. The branch servant tells us these things about Colombia:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In considering the advance of the work in this country It is noted that nearly three-fourths of the publishers are located in three cities along the Caribbean sea. Four special pioneers were sent into two of them, and companies were established. Barranquilla, the largest of the three cities, is the center of coastal operations for Jehovah's witnesses. Writes the company servant: “For two months we have had another </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya</span><span class="font6"> study in an area far from the Kingdom Hall. Attendance averaged 45. With 168 publishers and 16 pioneers in the company the circuit servant thought it advisable to divide the company into two units.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A local pioneer offered his large home in the center of the new area for a Kingdom Hail, rent free. Attending the first meeting were 52 persons, including two Franciscan priests listening attentively at the front door. The following Tuesday evening, during the company book study, the hall was stoned, and seven roof tiles were broken. Thursday, another stone baptism, but with several brothers on hand the assault was less vigorous. Since then the brothers have met together, without opposition, and the new unit goes fearlessly and confidently ahead, assured of Jehovah's blessings. The home is being painted, servants are organized and all are convinced that the new company will grow rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The seeds of truth lit on good soil when sown in one large Catholic family about three years ago. One by one they dropped traditions, saints and mysteries to accept the truth. Several months ago one of the boys, only 12 years of age, became a pioneer. He is now doing well and conducts several studies. At the last baptism the great-grandmother was Immersed. So now the records show 12 members of this family in the truth, representing four generations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Government importation restrictions held up entry of new literature for many months, but finally, in February, we secured the first of three consecutive import licenses. Hence, with the entry of over 20,000 books and 22,000 booklets, we have on hand at the year’s end the largest supply of literature since the branch was established over five years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Bogota, the capital, the police have bothered the publishers from time to time, although no serious difficulties have arisen. Several times publishers have had all their literature confiscated, and on one occasion the literature was turned over to the priest. Another time the publishers were taken to the church so the police could consult with the priest before going to the police station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have every reason to believe that the new service year will be full of joyful experiences and theocratic increase. Our territory is large but the small group of Kingdom publishers is expanding despite obstacles, and these publishers feel like talking, and with their talking the increase will come, by Jehovah’s grace.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>COSTA RICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The preaching of the good news in Costa Rica has been firmly established during the past eight years. Men in authority know that these servants of God are peace-loving and law-abiding. They know, too, that they are energetic and that they believe their message and that they want to help the people. The branch servant gives us a very interesting report on what happened in connection with their first public parkmeeting. Excerpts from the experience are published here, and they show you how far Catholic action in Central American countries goes to stop the people from hearing the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pioneer company servant at San Ramdn, in Alajuela province, obtained a permit from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">jefe politico</span><span class="font6"> to use the park in front of the big Catholic church there. One of the Gilead graduates from San Josd was assigned to make the trip and give the talk on Sunday, April 22. His report is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Arrangements had already been made with the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">jefe politico</span><span class="font6"> for the use of the park for a public talk at 11: 00 a.m. We arrived and immediately began to put in order the sound equipment, with the aid of several persons of good will. By this time there were many people strolling around the park, while others were seated on the benches awaiting the hour to arrive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Soon the local servant announced the lecture, and I began to talk. How good it was to see the people drink in the message, as it was their first experience as well as ours in using a public park in the Spanish-speaking section of Costa Rica! About ten minutes after I began talking the priest came over from the church, gathering children to him as lie came. He walked around the bandstand to a spot directly in front of me and then gave the children instructions, saying: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘Hagan bulla’</span><span class="font6"> (make noise). The faithful little flock followed its master, and the noise began. With this the priest disappeared. However, not being satisfied with his progress, he found it necessary to return in a few minutes to give his flock further instructions. In his excitement he even mistook one of the pioneers for one of his group and commanded him to make noise also. By this time some of the fanatics of the church were busy throwing rocks at the loud-speakers and breaking the wires that carried the current. Each time the wires were broken I would step to the edge of the stand and, beckoning the listeners a little closer, would continue to talk. When the wires were fixed, then I would step back to the microphone and the talk would go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“What were the police doing all this time? The two policemen and a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">guardia civil,</span><span class="font6"> who happened to be visiting there for the day, were the only force available. They did all that was humanly possible, but their efforts were puny in a crowd of approximately 300. For instance, when the brothers were trying to fix the broken wires one of the leaders of the mob grabbed the company servant by the throat to choke him. Immediately the guard detached his gun, and when the man started to attack him, he threatened to kill him on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“About this time the priest had someone go over and ring the church bell. This seemed to set the people wild and the whole mob made a rush at me, shouting ‘Kill him’; however, through the protecting hand of Jehovah, none of us were harmed. Since the wires were torn down and a little damage was done to the speaking equipment It was decided to discontinue the talk there; so it was announced that it would be carried on in the home of one of the publishers. By this time the priest appeared in the bandstand encouraging his faithful to attack. Quickly the equipment was dismantled and carried to safety. As my wife and I walked through the raving mob the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">guardia civil</span><span class="font6"> was ever at our side giving a helping hand when needed. Many were the expressions of the people of the town: ‘The priest is at fault’; ‘how fanatic’; ‘we are ashamed of these people’; ‘they are country people he is using to do this.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“A small group having assembled at the publisher’s house, I continued the lecture while the leaders of the mob, minus the priest, walked up and down the other side of the street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“On returning to the center of the town to take the bus home, I met the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">jefe politico</span><span class="font6"> and his secretary. They expressed their deep feeling over the incident and asked us to come back in two weeks to give them another talk. He assured us there would be no further trouble even if he had to call the entire </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">guardia civil</span><span class="font6"> from San JosA He said he had a list of the ones responsible for the trouble and would start proceedings against them the following day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So our first attempt in the use of the parks set things on fire; the papers were full of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two of us went to see the minister of government, and put to him our side of the issue. He received us very kindly, said he had read some of the literature and expressed his belief that it was good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Three weeks later we returned, this time the branch servant and a special bus load of San Jose publishers. We arrived about eleven, but the priest had called a special meeting so as to have the church busy at that hour. So we held a conference with the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">jefe politico,</span><span class="font6"> a fine young man from a Catholic family in San Ramon. He suggested that we wait until one o’clock to hold our meeting, at which time nothing would be going on in the church. So we did. In the meantime the publishers got a bite to eat and then scattered throughout the town to invite the people to hear another public talk. Just before the talk was to begin a catechism class was ushered into the bandstand by their teacher, a young woman. One of the San Jose brothers appealed to her in a kind manner, and they left. This time, too, the police were ready, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">jefe politico</span><span class="font6"> had called In all of his men to see that order w’as preserved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The branch servant appealed to the people to listen carefully to the message of peace, hope and good cheer that he had for them. The talk went over, and only once did someone try to interfere; the police had him quiet before he got started. Once or twice the current went oft due to an electrical storm. A little rain fell, some came to the bandstand for shelter, but most of the people remained under the trees until it was over or sought shelter on the opposite sidewalk under the overhanging roofs of the stores. Almost a hundred booklets were distributed free, and it was estimated that more than 150 persons heard the talk. Meanwhile, behind the speaker's back, the priest and the head of a Catholic action group from San Jose were madly pacing in and around the church. The laymen even made an entire circle of the park, but evidently they decided to try nothing. Perhaps they knew the strength of the police better than we did. We returned home grateful to Jehovah for this victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In our conversation with the jefe </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">politico,</span><span class="font6"> he told us that this fight was with him and the priest and that they had been enemies for several years. Just what motivated him to hand in his resignation, we do not know, but the minister of government and police did not accept it. An investigation was made and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">La Hora</span><span class="font6"> on Monday afternoon, June 4, stated that the “Civil and Church Authorities Have Closed the San Ramdn Incident”. Under this heading it quoted the minister of government as stating: “In view of the good results obtained the resignation of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">jefe politico </span><span class="font6">will not be accepted, as this ministry has the impression that the authority complied with the law.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The enemy has taken note of the growth of the work and is bent on closing it down. However, we trust in Jehovah to guide and direct us at all times. We will continue to preach in season as long as we can, and, when that can no longer be done, we are determined to continue to “Praise Jah” with out-of-season preaching. There are many people of good will here that still need to hear, so we join our brothers world-wide in proclaiming louder and louder, “Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.”—Rev. 19:6, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span class="font6"> IF.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>CUBA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">‘‘And I heard what was as a voice of a great crowd.” (Rev. 19: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">6, NW)</span><span class="font7"> This is certainly true in the land of Cuba, where thousands upon thousands are singing Jehovah’s praises. In this little country more than one million hours of preaching were put in by faithful servants of God. It wasn’t too many years ago that there were not many publishers in Cuba, but those who were there talked and worked with the Lord’s organization, received Jehovah’s blessing, and great things have happened to Jehovah’s praise and clean worship. The branch servant sets out a few high points of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brothers here are not afraid to talk the truth. They talk it on the buses, in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">cafes,</span><span class="font6"> in the hospitals or anywhere they might be. One brand-new publisher of less than two months in the Kingdom service had to go to the hospital because of illness, but she didn’t forget to talk about the Kingdom. She talked to all the patients she could reach with her voice, and placed quite a number of magazines with the hospital staff and the patients. One patient seemed especially interested, and when they got out of the hospital she called on this person. A study was arranged for, and in a short time three of the family were in the service as publishers. The mother of the family is also studying and will soon be a publisher. “Incidental” publishing is certainly very effective. The Cubans love to talk, and directing this energy in the right direction is one of the reasons for the increase in Cuba.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pioneers are having many wonderful experiences in finding and aiding the Lord’s “other sheep”. One pioneer related the following experience. “While working in my isolated territory I made arrangements with one of my book studies to visit some of his relatives that lived a long way off. It took us almost a whole day of horseback riding and walking through mountainous paths to reach the town where his relatives lived. I witnessed to his relatives and to a number of people in the town, and placed quite a bit of literature with them. Much interest was manifested, and I made arrangements to visit them again in about two weeks’ time. I took another pioneer along with me on the return visit. This time we had many difficulties on the trip, because we made the entire trip on foot. We got caught in a bad storm, and we lost our way. We finally reached our destination late that night. The relatives of my study were glad to see us and offered us food and dry clothing. The next day the local religious group held their regular meeting in their hall. The local minister, being a kind and sincere person, gave us the opportunity to speak to the congregation at this meeting. Arrangements were made for my companion to give an hour public talk. Great interest was shown by all who heard the talk, and arrangements were made to revisit these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“On our next visit a number of studies were started, and within a few weeks’ time all of the members, with the exception of the minister, had abandoned the religious group. Nevertheless, this minister was also one of the Lord’s ‘lost sheep’. He obtained a copy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True'</span><span class="font6"> and began to reason with us. Since he was a sincere person, it was not long before he began to see the truth, and he began to preach it to others. He has now been appointed by the Society to be company book study conductor of the local group. Shortly thereafter we made arrangements for a baptism, and 19 were baptized. And now here in this town, where a year ago there wasn’t a single publisher, there are 35 publishers reporting active service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In December Brother Knorr visited us for a week. Three conventions were arranged for in different parts of the country during his visit. The publishers greatly appreciated this arrangement, as it enabled practically all of them to attend an assembly. The counsel and Instruction given by Brother Knorr at the assemblies were a great aid to the increase in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During his visit, Brother Knorr made arrangements to bring a group of pioneers to Havana from all parts of the country, to teach them English to prepare them to attend Gilead school. Some of these are now at school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All of the publishers here are very grateful for the share that they have had during the past year in being part of the “great crowd” shouting forth Jehovah’s praises worldwide.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>CYPRUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The small group of publishers in Cyprus had their hearts filled with gratitude to the reigning King, and thc.y rejoice that so many of the “other sheep” have been gathered together on that island. They now have 337 ministers of good news. This has not been accomplished by waiting for them to come, but by their going out and helping the men of good will take a stand for the truth. The opposition has been very heavy against Jehovah’s witnesses, and the branch servant gives us a picture of things in this regard in his report for the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As is to be expected, more praise on the part of Jehovah’s servants must bring forth more opposition from His opposers. This has been particularly seen during the past year. Both the Greek Orthodox and various Protestant bodies have shown their bitter hatred against the Lord’s servants. Their hatred for truth was expressed in mob violence, assaults and beatings, but instead of ridding the island of the “ravening wolves”, as they like to call us, more truthseekers have had their eyes opened as to whether the so-called Christians are really what they claim to be. One notable instance is as follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our district assembly was held in the capital during the month of October. The greatest effort to date was put forth in the advertising of the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Saturday afternoon young men attached to the Greek Orthodox Church were out in the streets with leaflets, telling the people to keep away from the Jewish organization known as “Jehovah’s witnesses” and operating under the “prince of darkness”. “Don’t go near them, don’t let them enter your home, close your doors to them, don’t take their books and pamphlets, and inform others about them,” the leaflet read. The signature at the bottom of the leaflet revealed where the sword had been felt most, namely, “The Holy Archbishopric.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About ten minutes after the public talk began there were shouts from the back of the cinema, “Lies I Lies! Antichrist !” etc. The noise increased as the voices of 50 or more men shouted their slogans and threw papers into the air. They refused to be quiet, and lost all control of themselves. Pandemonium reigned for the next fifteen minutes, and repeated calls for police assistance remained unanswered until a visit was made to the police headquarters, and a lorry load of police was dispatched. In the meantime chairs had been broken and blows exchanged until the men calling themselves “Orthodox Christians” were thrown out of the cinema. By this time hundreds of people hearing the commotion gathered to the cinema, which caused a greater witness to be given, and while the police formed a cordon outside the cinema, the talk was resumed and concluded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The religionists thought they were going to silence the message, but failed. Incidents such as these show them up in their true colors and to be the “sons of those who murdered the prophets”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The so-called Protestant organizations have also hurled their darts at the Lord’s witnesses. During the year quite a number of Protestant sects have established themselves in the island. These sects are out in the streets preaching on Saturday evenings, but before beginning their talks they Inform their listeners that they have no connection with Jehovah’s witnesses. One such speaker was approached and asked why he didn’t say that his sect had no connection with the other religious bodies, to which he replied, “We hate Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work has expanded well during the year to many villages of the island. We were very happy when you gave us permission to enroll three special pioneers, and these were assigned to the rural areas. Groups of interested persons have been brought together, and several persons are already sharing in the witness work. There are three such groups in the rural parts of the island, and we hope that these will soon be organized into companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Orthodox Church continually warns her “flock” against “straying” away from her grip, but some of her closest “children” are hearing the voice of truth and are forsaking her ensnaring table.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It has been three years since the police occupied the branch office in Czechoslovakia and confiscated the property and arrested the brothers. A ban has been on the work of Jehovah’s witnesses all this time. The brothers, however, know of the injunction: ‘Pay back to God what belongs to God.’ They have a responsibility, and they are carrying it out regardless of the ban issued by human powers. Despite all the restrictions, lack of literature and personal danger, Jehovah’s witnesses in Czechoslovakia go forward helping the “other sheep”. The experiences related by one in Czechoslovakia show us how this is really accomplished. Truly we can say, Jehovah knows those who belong to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A sister went to spend her vacation in an outlying district with her brother’s family, where the message had not been preached for about 13 years. At the first opportunity she gave a witness and offered a booklet, but was repelled with the words: “Oh, spare me please, for you speak just like our neighbor; he has also offered us a booklet like that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sister went to visit this neighbor and found him, his wife and fifteen-year-old boy to be “sheep”. Many years before, the man had bought a Bible and a booklet from a witness passing through the neighborhood. Later, during the war, under the pressure of existing conditions, he remembered this caller and his explanations, and the family began to read the booklet and the Bible. The message it contained arrested their attention so much that they began to recommend the booklet and Bible to others to read. During her vacation the sister then devoted her attention to these “sheep”, and after her departure they remained in contact by correspondence, seeing that her own home lay about 106 miles distant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another sister was undergoing treatment in a hospital; she witnessed among the patients and distributed some booklets. One patient, after having read the booklet, wanted to know more. She showed great interest, and while still in the hospital began to witness herself. On leaving she gave the sister her address and wanted to be visited as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As soon as this sister had completed her hospital treatment she undertook the journey in spite of bad railway connections to this outlying village to visit the interested person. Her visit evoked much joy; the husband of this lady, a doctor by profession, did not want to hear about the truth, however. When the sister undertook her second visit she asked a brother to accompany her. The doctor listened with attention to the conversation this time, and then admitted that Biblical prophecy was actually being fulfilled in our day. Now he too wished to be visited again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two weeks later this doctor pleasantly surprised the brother by bringing to the study four other interested persons, whom he had told the little that he himself now knew. Today the lady is a full-fledged publisher and the doctor witnesses occasionally to people with whom he comes in contact in his practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One case is worthy of mention where an interested family solved the problem of searching for the truth with comparative ease, to their own joy and to the great joy of the witnesses that they were able to find.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At one time this family came into possession of the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font6"> It took years for this book to fulfill its purpose. But the time did come when they began to read it, and soon they had the feeling that they needed still further spiritual food. They realized that it would not be easy to find God’s servants in the prevailing circumstances, but did not doubt that they would be successful. They began to search and learned that in a village not too far away some people were living who called themselves “Jehovah’s witnesses”, but they could not ascertain the name and address. One of the female members of the family resolved to go one day by train to the village named.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the way from the railway station to the village she overtook a group of workers who were eagerly debating some question on their way home from work. One of them was saying: “We have a man working with us who is always explaining something out of the Bible to us. He doesn’t swear and doesn’t get mad whatever you say to him.” On reaching the village she asked a person passing: “Where does the man live?” She was told that he lived at the other end of the village, and in the same way she found which house he lived in. But still she did not dare to ask if Jehovah’s witnesses lived in this house, but what to do? Then it came to her mind that she had read about “Jona-dabs” in the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font6"> How would it be if she were to ask whether Jonadabs lived here? If they were Jehovah’s witnesses then they would understand all right and all would be in order. Good! She stepped up to the house and asked if Jonadabs were living there. The woman at the door gazed at her in astonishment, and then exclaimed: “Yes, they live here.” Joyfully this good-will person poured out the story of their search for them, and the no-less-delighted sister began a long discussion with her on the vital life-bringing truths. Their joy was contagious and spread to the other members of the interested family who had personally experienced the truth of the words: “Keep on seeking, and you will find.” They were hungry for the Word of God, and are now being satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From day to day we experience Jehovah’s undeserved kindness. He blesses our efforts to use well every opportunity in the proclamation of the Kingdom message and strengthens us with His spiritual food at all times. Although the avenues of service are restricted we rejoice, nevertheless, in the results attained.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The call is going forth to the prisoners to forsake their old religious dwelling places and come out into the Lord’s clean place of worship. The people in Denmark are doing this in numbers too great to please the clergy. In all of Denmark the clergy are putting forth a real effort to hold on to their members, and they are trying to hinder them from listening to what Jehovah’s witnesses have to say. This hasn’t helped them very much, because Jehovah’s witnesses have the answer for the people. They give them God’s Word rather than the theories and doctrines of men. There are many public meetings going on throughout all the land against Jehovah’s witnesses; these are being organized by the clergy. The branch servant gives us some interesting reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We started the service year by having a district assembly in Copenhagen, and it turned out to be the greatest assembly so far. This aroused the wrath of our foes, who had for some time carried on a slanderous campaign about our teachings and work in general. A newspaper called “Chris-tain Daily News”, which does not live up to the name, hates truth. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font6"> wrote a defamatory article about our assembly and accused Jehovah’s witnesses of misleading the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It should be mentioned that not all clergymen are against Jehovah’s witnesses. Here are some excerpts from an article written by a Danish pastor. “With the exception of the endeavours of peace on the part of some small Christian movements we do not see strivings for unity among the Christians. . . . Jehovah’s witnesses are conscientious objectors. So are the Quakers, and a few other Christians and nonChristians take a similar stand; but the big churches of the world are absolutely silent during the present intensified preparations for war. That may mean that there is disproportion between belief and action. If it is true that a tree is known by its fruits (and I believe it is), then there is something seriously wrong with the knowledge of God on the part of the Christian nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The high light of the service year was, of course, the London convention. Many brothers had been preparing for a long time to attend. A special train was arranged for from Copenhagen to London, with 367 brothers. Banners were put ou the train with the text “Jehovah’s witnesses—London convention”. Through Denmark we had the text in Danish. Going through Germany we put the German text on, and in Belgium we had the text in French.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">More than 400 Danish brothers (approximately 7 per cent of the publishers) attended the great feast. All means of transportation were used—train, car, motorcycles, bicycles and one pioneer hitchhiked to London. All of us were refreshed by the wonderful truths brought out. Most of the Danish brothers had only very little knowledge of the English language, but they got the main points from those who knew the language. The summaries given at the Danish assemblies proved to be very helpful, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the close of the service year we had the great pleasure of being visited by the president of the Society, Brother Knorr, his secretary, Brother Henschel, and Brother K. M. Jensen. The instructions and wise counsel given by these dear servants of the Most High certainly brought joy to our hearts. At the convention the attendance reached a peak at the public meeting, where 6,912 heard “Will Religion Meet the World Crisis?” Brother Knorr showed very clearly that the service record of organized religion is extremely poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The large K. B. Hall was packed during all the sessions. No wonder Brother Knorr told us to try to find another hall for coming conventions. “You have to widen your tent,” he said. The visit of our American brothers, as well as the convention itself, is going to accomplish a lot for the advancement of Kingdom interests in Denmark. Not only wilt the number of publishers grow, by the Lord’s grace, but we hope to grow individually, stripping off the old personality and putting on a new and better one. This we will do by continually reading “the letters of our Father”, as Brother Knorr so nicely put it in his stirring heart-to-heart talk to the Danish brothers at the close of the convention.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark135"></a>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The second world war got rid of some totalitarian rulers and then the world powers got together and formulated the United Nations organization. The Dominican Republic is one of those nations that shout freedom and liberty for all. But the political rulers and the religious leaders are against anyone’s studying the Bible. This little dictator-nation is in the Western Hemisphere. It is illegal for a group of people to come together and talk about God’s Word. Walking on the streets with the Watchtower publications in your possession is an offense against the state. Just to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">talk</span><span class="font7"> to a person is prohibited, if you happen to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Just because some persons attended a wedding where the majority of the people were Jehovah’s witnesses, they were arrested and imprisoned. The faith of those who want to serve God is being tested and tried from every angle. Despite this the message is being preached, and the authorities know it. A report has come out of the Dominican Republic about some of the things that have happened. The readers of this </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font7"> will be interested to know about them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The small group of witnesses grows stronger. They are standing closer together these days. Those who have grown cold because of fear have turned away. Right now 15 brothers are in prison, some because they have conscientious objection to war. One individual had served his prison teiiu and was called up for military service again and questioned at great length. He had the opportunity to explain to the officials his beliefs. A letter written to the attorney general set forth certain legal points in their favor, and now, because of writing the letter, some of these brothers are being tried on three counts: (1) refusing military service, (2) slandering a public official, and (3) preaching in violation of the ban on the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Five other brothers living in the country and a group of neighbors gathered together for the wedding of their children. Because the majority in attendance were Jehovah’s witnesses, the authorities declared the wedding assembly illegal and picked up five of the brothers. No charge was filed. The judge refused to hear the case for lack of evidence. It was taken to another court and here a prejudiced judge heard “evidence”. The prosecuting attorney, however, said that there was not enough information for a trial. But the judge carried the case over until the next week. Up until this time the brothers had spent 35 days in jail, and the only reason was that they had attended a wedding and they happened to be Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course, it is difficult to gather reports from all the publishers in the island, but we know by communicating with them from time to time and seeing them that they are talking to their neighbors and their friends. The people admire the zeal of the brothers who take their stand definitely against this totalitarian rule. There is a great crowd that is for Jehovah’s witnesses, but fear keeps them from investigating openly. Jehovah’s witnesses are spotted and followed by secret police. If Jehovah’s witnesses call on any home, whether just to visit a friend and make a neighborly call or to tell the person about the Kingdom, the person called upon is later questioned by the police and threatened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Dominican Republic is a police state. Everyone lives in fear, whether they are Jehovah’s witnesses or not. Even though the government brings all this pressure to bear against the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom, there are still a good number who are listening to the truth, believing it and being baptized, and they keep on talking. The brothers are provided with the spiritual food. Those who were formerly in the full-time service are “making tents”, but they are setting forth a good example and showing sincerity. The government admits that Jehovah’s witnesses are a good people, but the top rulers and the religious clergy are against us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We know what the future holds, however—a new world for those who love righteousness. And with God’s undeserved kindness we will continue on with clean worship glorifying the name of the Most High God, Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>ECUADOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It is always a delight to see an organization grow in a country and to learn of its experiences and to watch the missionaries, pioneers and company publishers press on shoulder to shoulder with one thing in mind—the Kingdom interests. This makes one’s heart glad. In the country of Ecuador we hear the brothers saying to the prisoners, “Go forth!” Some interesting new experiences are reported by the branch servant, and they show us that it pays to be aggressive and try new things once in a while. Here is what he has to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Ecuador our organization is still growing up from a babe into a mature man, and at the end of each year we can look back and count the steps. The feature that added so much to our advance this year was the inauguration of circuit assemblies, our first assembly being held in the capital city, Quito. We rented the same hall as was used for Brother Knorr’s visit in 1948, when 12 persons attended. This year saw 189 in attendance for the first session of the assembly, and we almost had to stretch the walls to make room for the 295 who came to hear the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Throughout the year, in addition to the formation of a new unit at Quito, two completely new companies were entered on the list and pioneer groups began work on two more cities, thus forming a complete chain of activity all along one of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">cordilleras</span><span class="font6"> of the Andes which crosses Ecuador. The new company at Tulciin, on the Colombian border, is the only one we have so far that is made up exclusively of native brothers. The company servant there has a shoemaker’s shop in the town, and the literature is continually on display in the window. The local street sweeper would casually stop from time to time and read the open pages of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer.</span><span class="font6"> In fact, he made such a habit of this that he was threatened with the loss of his job. Noting the interest, the brother in the shop would co-operate by turning the page, and some time later the person of good will would come back and take over where he left </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">off. </span><span class="font6">Soon the verbal witness fanned the spark into a flame, and a bright flame it turned out to be. The result was a new and very active publisher, who is still the local street sweeper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Quito surprised us with our first taste of mob action toward the end of the year. The truth is that liberalism was never so liberal as it is here. One is free to love and free to hate, and justice is not very exacting unless the issue is pushed. Here is the story : Some missionaries and young publishers left to complete a section of territory that they had been working for five successive weeks. This morning was different, for they found' many doors labeled with signs saying, “All members of this family are Catholics. Jesus ... is our God and our King. We glory to have as our mother the Most Holy Virgin, Mother of God. We love and obey the Pope, the Vicar of Christ. . . . We prohibit entrance to his house to Protestants and other heretics. We do not want them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was no serious objection till the local priest appeared and began to form a mob, at the head of which he placed two nuns, and then disappeared. Aware of the situation, the brothers could see that nothing would be gained by continuing, so they gathered together and started toward the bus stop. As they boarded the bus the mob developed a great surge of courage and showered them with mud and stones, much to the disgust of the other passengers. Many favorable articles appeared in the newspapers and soon all Quito knew about it. The matter was submitted to the chief of police and a written protest made. In way of defense, a number of Catholic committees also submitted a letter to the police department, supposedly setting out what really took place. It was obviously a masterpiece of fantasy, and its own inconsistency belied its regard for truth. The letter claimed that the incident was negligible, Involving only a few children, yet concluded with the words, “We do not permit, nor will w<sup>T</sup>e permit the ‘witnesses’ to perturb and infiltrate our homes. . . . they will not be able to return here, because we are ready, even if w<sup>T</sup>e have to fight to the death.” The chief of police and the minister of government have taken action against those who signed this document, warning them that should there be a repetition of this disgraceful and unconstitutional conduct, they will be the responsible ones. The priest who claimed he “wasn’t there” when it all happened has graciously promised the police to use his own personal influence to prevent a repeat performance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A sister writes an Interesting experience which centers around the house she lives in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“This is a large house with many families living </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">it, and it Is the custom of the women to gather in the patio on a sunny afternoon to mend, knit or weave the straw hats which make Cuenca famous. I decided to spend an afternoon with them and armed myself with a good supply of socks, booklets and a Bible. These people have a great deal of kindly curiosity and almost immediately </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font6">gan to inquire about our work. At first most of them were fearful, as they thought I was surely an </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Emnflelista</span><span class="font6"> intent on deceiving them, but when they had carefully examined my Catholic Bible and read a few texts therefrom, they were less nervous. We talked for more than two hours that afternoon, and on leaving the landlady said, ‘I hope you can convert every single person in this house, and I wish you would start with me and my family.’ Since then I have joined the other women once each w’eek, and almost every week at least one new person is contacted in this manner. As a result, five studies have been started right here in the house, with a prospect of two or three more shortly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Much work has been done this year in the governmental offices. Upward of 80 books have been placed right into the hands of high-ranking officials, foreign power consuls and educational heads. One of these contacts led to permission's being granted to witness to the officers and men of the Ecuadorian navy. One of the navy’s largest ships was lying here in the port of Guayaquil, and three of the missionaries took a launch to visit it. They were welcomed aboard and immediately introduced to the commanding officer. The purpose of the visit had hardly been explained wdien all of the officers were called off duty and assembled in the captain's</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">quarters to hear the message. In the course of the explanation the six latest of the Society’s books In Spanish were circulated. The captain said he wished to have a complete series for the ship’s library and others wished copies for their own private reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Next the commander gave orders to assemble the men, and all work aboard the ship was called to a halt. When everything was ready the missionaries were conducted below deck and were surprised to find themselves before an audience of 90. The commander himself explained the visit and the nature of our work just as ably as he had heard it from the mouths of the missionaries half an hour earlier. Once again the books circulated for examination, resulting in a total placement of 33 books, most of the men preferring </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This has been a wonderful year, but there Is still a tremendous amount of work to be done. We are greatly encouraged by our increase in publishers of 103 per cent, and begin this new year determined to forge ahead building up our young organization, taking full advantage of the unparalleled freedom we enjoy here.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>EGYPT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Society has a branch office in Cairo and from here the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is directed. The branch looks after three territories: Egypt, Sudan and Lybia. The ministers of God find it hard going because there are not too many persons who have an ear to hear. They are so definitely set in their own religion they will not reason or accept the plain, clear statements as set forth in God’s Word. However, there are a few of the “other sheep” who are opening their hearts and minds to the hearing of the Word of God, and these are taking their stand and working for the blessings of the new world of righteousness. Excerpts taken from the report sent in by the branch in Cairo appear here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although a witness has been given in this Moslem country for about twenty years, yet not one Moslem has ever been able to firmly take his stand for the Theocracy. On the other hand, the Egyptian Christians, the Coptics, as they are called, are very fanatic and too much attached to their human religious teachings and traditions. They do not even want to reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In spite of the opposition and many difficulties we have, however, Jehovah God showered us with many blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year started with a district assembly held in Cairo, where a cafeteria was set up for the first time at an assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in Egypt. It was the best-organized assembly till then, and the brothers enjoyed it very much. The talks given were condensations of the ones given at the international assembly held in Yankee Stadium last year. Then the circuit assemblies, successfully held, gave good courage, help and admonition to the brothers. Also the Lord gave us an increase in the ranks of the special pioneers, now five in number. These special publishers did a good work in spreading the Kingdom news, some of them conducting up to 19 home Bible studies every month. This shows that there are many people longing for the knowledge of the truth, as evidenced also by the attendance of 411 persons at the Memorial celebration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Indeed the field is great and the workers few. It was therefore a great joy to see publishers taking up the fulltime service, thus increasing the general pioneer ranks from 8 to 11. We were very pleased when a member of the Bethel family from Cairo (who attended the 15th class in Gilead graduated at Yankee Stadium during the international convention held there) came back to Egypt. As he knows the languages of the country, he has been appointed as circuit servant. Thus the number of Gilead graduates has increased now to two. It is indeed encouraging to see the publishers increasing, for there are persons who want to desert false religion and take their stand for God’s kingdom and who, of course, need assistance and help. Here is a good experience regarding this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This year a new field also has been opened, which brought great joy to our hearts, that of Upper Egypt. It was done by a pioneer who left Cairo and went to Upper Egypt for secular work. This pioneer worked hard and, as he knows Arabic, was the right one for the work there. Soon the results came. Subscriptions were obtained, magazines placed and home Bible studies started. Many good-will persons were found and the interest arose to such a point that two families were contending as to which one would have the brother for a home Bible study, due to the limited time of the brother. They were considering it a big honor to have him in their home. The matter was settled by having one home Bible study at the house of the biggest family. A desire was expressed by them to get organized for more effective training and publishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our activities were climaxed by a district assembly held in Alexandria from August 30 to September 2, thus bringing this service year to a successful end. We were thrilled when, after four years, we were able to secure a theater and hold the assembly there. That was the Moassat Theatre, where Brother Knorr gave his lecture “The Joy of All the People” in 1947. Four different public talks were given, in Italian, in Arabic, In French and In Greek, with a total attendance of 407.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark140"></a>SUDAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Sudan is an African country south of Egypt having a population of 12 million people, of which about 500,000 are Europeans. As it is far removed from the ocean and less than 1,500 feet above the sea, it is extremely hot. Nevertheless, the dryness of the air renders the climate healthy. Due to the heat, the people have to wear light, loose clothes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A brother from Egypt was transferred to Khartoum because he was needed in his secular employment at the branch office of the firm there. So the firm prepared everything for him, applications, guarantees, transportation, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The doors of Sudan were opened; Jehovah’s witnesses were in and excellent results were obtained, subscriptions were taken, a lot of people began to be interested, and Bible studies were started. Several of these Interested ones spread the good news to many other cities and villages. But how did all this come about? In this way. Being merchants, these persons had to come from their cities to Khartoum to buy things and, of course, had to go to the firm where the brother works. The brother was following a principle with those going to him for trade. First of all he would give them the message of God's kingdom, offer them subscriptions for the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazines, and then he would do business with them. So in a few weeks' time the message was widely spread, by the undeserved kindness of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A short time after the brother began his preaching activities in the Sudan, another fighter entered the country. A brother was transferred from Libya to Sudan due to his secular job and so he joined the first one, thus doubling the forces of Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A company of Jehovah’s witnesses was organized and established in Khartoum with the initial brother as company servant. The publishing work was extended and more publishers were added. Moslems here in Sudan took their side with Jehovah and his kingdom, conducting home Bible studies and encouraging others to join in the true worship. Later on, the family of the company servant, namely, his wife and daughter, both publishers of the Theocracy, went to Khartoum. Then the company servant rented a nice home with a big garden, and now all the company studies are held in that open-air garden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Really, Sudan is having its part in the Kingdom witness. The good news Is being preached, publishers are increasing from month to month, going from peak to peak, till the climax of 16 publishers was reached at the end of the service year in August. What a blessed service year in Jehovah’s ministry: last year one publisher, this year 16 publishers!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark142"></a>LIBYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Libya was the name given in olden times to FJorth Africa with the exception of Egypt. Today it constitutes the territory of North Africa lying between Tunisia and Egypt, having a population of approximately 985,000 persons living in the three parts of Libya, namely, Tripolltanla, Cyrenaica and Fezzan. Tripoli is the capital city and is in that part of Libya called Tripolitania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Libya started two years ago when a brother left Egypt and went to Tripoli for a secular job. At that time there was not a single publisher, but today there is a company of Jehovah’s witnesses in the capital city of Tripoli. The preaching activities of the brothers have reached various places in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, and many are the interesting experiences they are having in that country where most of the Europeans are under the control of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Magazine work from shop to shop was the first feature of the work in which the brothers engaged in Tripoli. Magazines and literature were placed, then these placements were followed up and home Bible studies were held. A short time after, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> studies and service meetings were held for the building up and training of the new ones who joined in rendering sacred service to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our brothers in Libya were not affected by the opposition of the Catholic Church. They did not retreat in front of all the warnings of the priests telling the people not to accept them into their homes. On the contrary, they went ahead fearlessly and zealously proclaiming the good news to the people of Libya, and Jehovah God blessed their perseverance in the good works with Increase. A Kingdom Hall has been secured where all company meetings are now held and the number of publishers on an average is now six, to compare with three last year; the peak number increased from five to ten publishers reporting in July.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark143"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>EL SALVADOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">According to the latest reports there are over two million persons living in El Salvador. That means there is a lot of witnessing to be done. The little group of Jehovah’s witnesses in that country have taken on the work and have had a most joyful time during the year finding the “other sheep” and aiding them. They fully appreciate that there is a lot of virgin territory in this land and now that they are established in some of the larger cities, they are beginning to expand into these isolated places, and they are finding remarkable interest. The branch servant tells us some very interesting experiences about how they plan for the increase through the circuit assemblies, a new Kingdom Hall and getting out into the small towns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The problems for increase were tackled early In the year. The first move was a circuit assembly in San Miguel the first week in November. This assembly seemed to do the trick. The new, small company doubled in size, and then doubled again before the end of the year. Thirteen were baptized in a rain-muddied river called the Rio Grande. We shared the river upstream with a large gold mine, and downstream leaden-eyed alligators lay hidden in the marshy river shallows. It was a strange setting. As the two Gilead graduates waded out into deep water to start the immersion, strange four-eyed fish left the scene silently, and large flocks of wild parrots flew screaming overhead, as reckless in their flight as the course of the foolish people of this mad old world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the San Miguel assembly now history, we devoted our attention to other necessary work, namely, that of finding a Kingdom Hall for the San Salvador company. At last a large upstairs hall was rented. This was one that we had looked at previously and ignored because it was divided Into several small rooms. However, the landlady gave us the whole top floor for only $60 with the right to take out a wall, making a hall barely large enough for our needs. Well, that only started off Increase after increase for the company, which hasn’t stopped even as of the writing of this report. From the first, the hall overflowed for every public talk, so more walls had to come out, and to date we have removed three walls, and each time the hall has filled right up to its new capacity as if by miracle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You can imagine how this filled us with joy, but you cannot know of the consternation it has caused the professional religionists of El Salvador. They have gone to great trouble to alert the people to the “dangers” of these “Children of Jehovah”, as they choose to call us, but nothing to any avail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The beautiful Teatro Nacional in Santa Ana was rented for a Sunday talk, and 1,300 persons packed it out to hear “Surviving This World’s End”. Many new ones from surrounding towns attended and returned home Jehovah’s witnesses. These new ones have grown much stronger in the faith since then; in fact, the two cities of Chalchuapa and Atiquizaya are good prospects for companies soon. The missionaries have been following up this interest by working out of Santa Ana one day each week, and they now have the brothers in Chalchuapa to the point of being organized into a company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Atiquizaya a talk was arranged in the home of a man of good will. There were no publishers present. All gathered just on the strength of oral invitations and motivated by what knowledge they had received through a few home Bible studies. The modest home, however, was filled, as 22 persons sat around and listened to the Bible talk. There was not enough light to see all the faces clearly, but not a sound was made as the circuit servant spoke in the darkened room, showing how men of mild temper might now associate with the new world society. At the end of the talk an invitation was given to ask questions. A tall sober-faced young man rose from the shadows after a moment of silence and said that he didn’t have a question, but he wanted to express himself concerning the things he had just heard. He said that he was confident that he spoke for his neighbors in saying that the things explained to them that night were better than anything they had ever heard before, and they wanted to accept the Invitation to form a study group in their town in order to learn to preach too. The missionaries in their happiness fell over themselves to grant that wish!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It wasn’t long until the priest in town got excited about the meetings, and he put on a lot of un-Christian behavior in church on Sunday morning denouncing those “Children of Jehovah”. He even went so far as to name the man who had loaned his home for the Bible talk. The missionaries held their breath for fear this man would be scared out, but not he! He only laughed it off, and for his being so well respected in his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">pueblo,</span><span class="font6"> the people took his side of the question, becoming more soured on the priest than before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of our three new companies for the year came about in a very Interesting way, showing clearly that the Lord knows his own, About 1946 one of our publishers in the capital moved away and settled in a town that is really an “eagle’s nest”. High up there in his mountain town he went to sleep as far as service was concerned; but, by chance, the most zealous of the new publishers baptized at the San Miguel assembly found him while going from door to door in this out-of-the-way place. He was surprised but pleased to find this drowsy witness. He was invited in by brother so-and-so, who, sleepy-eyed and half ashamed, admitted that he was a witness but was doing nothing about it. If you knew this active brother, you could understand how he wouldn’t let a chance go by to help this fellow ; so he said, “If you were only saying one word a day, that would be something, but you are not doing anything; you’re dead.” That may not have been the most tactful thing he could have said, but it did the work, and our sleepy publisher woke up, or as he himself said later in a letter to the branch, “I was resurrected.” He was too. Now he is publishing regularly away up there on top of El Salvador, and he is having many good experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a real blessing to be a missionary and to help open up new frontiers of service in new fields. And as we see the virgin territories disappearing from this globe, replaced by study groups, companies and circuits, we rejoice, knowing that for certain it can only be because ‘this good news of the kingdom is being preached in all the inhabited earth'.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Many have been the joys and experiences of Jehovah’s witnesses in Finland. The spirit of the New York convention held at Yankee Stadium was transferred to Finland early in the year, and they had three wonderful conventions. Despite the fact that the winters are long and cold and the snow lasts for months, the work continues to progress in Finland. The brothers do not have automobiles as they do in America, but they get around. At the close of the year we find one publisher for every 787 persons in all of Finland. The brothers appreciate, however, that there is still more to do. The “other sheep” are scattered among the forests and the cold, icy regions of Finland. The branch servant gives us an interesting report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To serve the needs of our brothers three different conventions were arranged in various parts of Finland. The first one was in the Swedish language and held In Turku for the benefit of about 220 Swedish brothers in Finland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brothers were very glad to receive a new question booklet for the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘The Kingdom Is at Hand”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brothers in northern Finland were served with a convention In Oulu. Here a total of 480 brothers gathered to hear in the Finnish language the same talks given in New York. A surprise release came with the new-style </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> cover being Introduced. This convention had all of the atmosphere of a warm, progressive assembly, and 780 were present at the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The last and largest convention was held in Helsinki in Messuhalll, the finest and largest hall in all of Finland. This assembly lasted four days and had all the thrills and feeling of any large convention. Many were the spiritual good things received from the table of the Lord, for the whole program of the New York convention was considered in the Finnish language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On Friday, the opening day, came a surprise when one of our most enthusiastic speakers gave a talk Brother Knorr delivered at Yankee Stadium and presented the resolution against communism. This was unanimously accepted by all of the almost 3,000 witnesses present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On Saturday evening the branch servant released the news of Brother Knorr’s approving the publication of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> in the Finnish language from January 1, 1952, onward. A thunder of applause arose from the audience. It continued until many were in tears of Joy. At last we have the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazine! As only a sample copy of the cover was available, it was shown and subscriptions were being accepted. Several people were busy the remaining convention time taking in the subscriptions. This was the best news that they have had since Brother Knorr’s last visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Memorial time was released the new booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Earthf</span><span class="font6"> In the Finnish language. Our first printing of 50,000 went out completely in six weeks. This was the first new booklet we had received in the Finnish language in two years. The brothers were very enthusiastic to take it into the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Travel conditions are not always good In Finland and many times time is lost waiting for a change in trains. One circuit servant put this time to good use by arranging a public meeting on his way to the circuit assembly. One young woman listened attentively to his talk. After the close of the talk she explained that six months before she had received literature and had been studying it herself. Now she was convinced It was the truth. Later this circuit servant saw the same lady at the circuit assembly, and she was baptized on Sunday morning. This shows how one plants, another waters, but God gives the increase. This sister Is now planning for pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In one community as the circuit servant was working from house to house he heard people say, ‘You had better not </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">go to</span><span class="font6"> that old man on the hill as he knows more than all the rest about the Bible and he will talk you down.’ Curiosity aroused, the circuit servant wondered what kind of a man he would meet. Upon arrival at the old man's house he was invited in and there followed discussions about the Kingdom’s establishment, seven times of the Gentiles, etc. Everything the old man said was the truth, and he agreed with all the circuit servant said. This man was almost in the truth. The circuit servant said, “Let me see your Bible.” Then the old man confessed, “Well, you know, young man, I don’t have a Bible, it somehow got lost during the war and I never have had a chance to get another.” “But I have a book just about like the Bible,” he said, bringing out a copy of the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”. </span><span class="font6">He had it marked, and had gained the truth from that. He rejoiced to get a Bible and the new book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In one company the publishers had to travel from six to eight miles to attend company meetings. The circuit servant suggested forming a new company. At the time of the division the company had 21 publishers reporting. Within three months this new company had 17 publishers and the original company 15 publishers. This new company now has more than one home Bible study per publisher. The centralizing of witness work in one local area brought out more good will and publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Large distances have always presented a problem in the northern and eastern part of Finland, where large distances must be met in order to attend meetings, make back-calls or conduct home Bible studies. One pioneer working in the eastern part of Finland reports that his nearest Bible study is 12 miles away. He has to travel sometimes 22 miles to conduct some of his home Bible studies. His report shows that he conducts regularly 10 studies a month. In summer he uses a bicycle and in winter he travels on skis. Despite these great distances he stiil arranges his time to put 130 hours in preaching every month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The branch oflice has suggested that wherever possible more company book studies be started and used as meeting places and service centers. This has helped overcome the problem of distance, since the publishers do not have to travel so far. Even in the city it brings good results. In Helsinki, for example, 12 company book studies were arranged in one company. This brought about much better organization, and using these as service centers and helping new and weak publishers through the company book studies, we have found a growth from 120 to 180 in just eight months. This is a 50 per cent increase. All the Helsinki units have been following this method and have all shown from 34 to 50 per cent increase.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The spirit of expansion was certainly felt in France and in the Saar this past year. Twenty of the brothers in France were able to attend the New York convention in Yankee Stadium, and a special effort was put forth to organize district assemblies which would permit the French brothers to at least get the strong echo of that great Christian gathering. These assemblies had a wonderful effect upon the brothers, and they delighted to press on in preaching the good news and helping the “other sheep”. The effects certainly were felt, because the average publishers increased 34 per cent, and today there are 7,136 Jehovah’s witnesses proclaiming the Kingdom and saying to the prisoners, “Go forth!” The branch servant presents some interesting things to consider.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">company servant tells of a back-call that was made in a town where there were no Jehovah's witnesses, and how this back-call grew into a study with ten persons attending. Within two months, four were publishing, and by the time of the next circuit assembly six of the original ten were immersed. At the close of the service year there were 12 publishers in that little town, and as many as 30 persons were attending the public meetings held there. Home Bible study work is certainly an effective means of obeying Jesus’ injunction, “Feed my sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Millions of French people are under the influence of two extremes, Catholicism on the one hand and Communism on the other. But it can be reported that both these brands of false religion are failing to satisfy the many sincere persons who have turned to them for help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following experience is typical of the way many Catholics react when they hear the truth. Making a back-call on a lady who had taken the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True’’, </span><span class="font6">the publisher was met by the husband, who bellowed, “People like you ought to be hanged and your books tied around your necks and burned!” Why? “Because you attack the pope, the church, Its teachings and the blessed virgin.” Calming him, the publisher set before him the new world hope, and a back-call was arranged. His blinded eyes once opened, what wasn’t he going to do to the church for having deceived him so long! But he was shown that vengeance belongs to Jehovah; however, he could share in opening other people’s eyes. And that’s just what he and his wife are now doing, being among the most zealous publishers in the company. Experiences such as that account for the fact that the Greater Paris company has grown in the past year from 650 to 1,085 publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As to Communism, it also is failing to hold those who are sincerely looking for the truth. A Catholic lady who was being visited by Jehovah’s witnesses always arranged for the publisher to come at a time when her husband was not there. The reason? He was an ardent Communist! However, one day the unforeseen happened: hubby was home when the witness called! A factual, logical explanation of our hope was given him, and the following week it was noted that he made a point of being there when the witness called. It appears that world conditions and religious hypocrisy had turned him Communist, but he could see that something more than communism was needed to put things right. He quickly embraced the truth, and now ex-Catholic wife, ex-Communist husband and the two children are all publishers for Jehovah’s new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It would be impossible to close this report without making mention of what was clearly the greatest event of the year, indeed, the greatest event of all time for Jehovah’s witnesses in France, namely, the 1951 Paris convention. What a thrill, and how broadening to be able to meet with the brothers from some 28 lands! And what a great blessing it was to have Brothers Knorr, Franz, Henschel and many other brothers from Brooklyn present, and serving on the program! This assembly certainly put </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Les Tdmoins de Jehovah</span><span class="font6"> on the map, as far as the French press and the government authorities are concerned. And, without a doubt, it marks a turning point in the status of the work here in France. With well over 10,000 persons attending a convention in the nation’s capital, and with more than 7,000 active witnesses throughout the land, and still other thousands associating with the organization, it can be said that France is beginning to receive a witness somewhere nearly comparable to that given in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Obviously, there is a tremendous work yet to be done, but a sound start has been made, and with God's help, the new service year will see a further improvement in internal organization, and in outward expansion of clean worship. To help in this, new instruments have been provided: the magazine bag in French, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”, “Equipped for Every Good Work”,</span><span class="font6"> as well as new booklets, and in 1952 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> will be published twice a month in French. For all these good things, and the manifest blessing poured out, we thank our kind God Jehovah, and look to him to bless the days ahead.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark149"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>THE SAAR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The first event of importance during the 1951 service year was the district assembly held in October at SaarbrUcken. The program was based on that of New York, and it turned out to be the greatest assembly yet held in that country. The attendance on Friday of 481 rose on Sunday at the public meeting to 910—a record number. A very joyful moment of the assembly was the release of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”</span><span class="font6"> in German.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In spite of the opposition put up by the Catholic clergy, the little army of faithful witnesses in the Saar advances in its preaching work, and the truth is proving to be a powerful force in the hearts of persons of good will, enabling them to come out from Satan’s prison houses and swell the ranks of clean worshipers. One company arranged to hire a bus so as to work a little town that was known to be strongly Catholic. For four weeks the brothers thoroughly worked that town, and four public meetings here held. In spite of clergy influence and opposition, subscriptions were taken and home Bible studies started. A study group was formed with 16 good-will persons regularly attending. One gentleman was particularly impressed because the message was brought to him by a young publisher 13 years of age. He could not understand how a young girl like that had the courage to preach the good news in such difficult circumstances, and he was amazed at the clear explanation she gave of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The two circuit assemblies held during the year at Volklingen and Saint Ingbert were a practical help to the brothers in accomplishing the different features of Kingdom service. It is the work from house to house, with back-calls and Bible studies, that gives the best results. A young couple received the witness, and the same evening the husband attended a public meeting and was very interested. After several back-calls, a study was started in the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;.</span><span class="font6"> Not only did the young couple attend, but many of their relatives, old and young, ten of them. At the next circuit assembly six were baptized, taking an active part in field service. The mother, aged 70, and who was brought up very religiously in the Catholic Church, is particularly zealous, and everyone she meets receives a good witness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark151"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark152"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">A blessed year of work in Germany was brought to a climax with the “Clean Worship” Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in Frankfort-on-the-Main. One hundred and twenty German publishers were privileged to attend the London convention, and they got a foretaste of what was going to happen in Frankfurt. Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide know that Germany has gone through very hard times for a long period of years, and this is particularly true of Jehovah’s witnesses. And they continue to endure hardships to this day. But they are faithful and determined to magnify Jehovah’s name and preach this good news of the Kingdom. Opposition has been brought to bear against them in the distribution of magazines in many of the cities, but these matters have been taken to court with good success. The witnesses in Eastern Germany stand firm despite concentration camps, imprisonment and being hounded by the communistic police. They know that there is still a work to be done, and they are saying to the prisoners, “Go forth!” And they are going forth, praising the name of the Most High. The branch servant’s report on what has gone on there during the past year is most interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In approximately four weeks of preparation an entire tent city was raised in the woods surrounding the beautifully located stadium at Frankfurt Neiderrad. Four of the biggest tent firms of Germany assisted in the construction. More than 30,000 persons as well as the entire cafeteria and other important departments of the assembly were accommodated therein. On August the 23rd, the night before the convention, 28 special trains brought more than 25,000 convent! oners to the small station located near the grounds. Thousands more came by bus, car and other means of transportation so that shortly after the opening of the convention on Friday morning an attendance of 34,547 was counted. This number increased to 38,226 on Saturday and reached a peak of 47,432 on Sunday afternoon at the public lecture. Representatives of no less than 24 nations were present, so it was quite an international assembly, more colorful and larger than probably ever before experienced in Germany or even in Europe. There were 2,373 brothers immersed, giving new proof of the continuous increase of Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The release of the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot; </span><span class="font6">in German by Brother Knorr loosed great joy and applause. Everybody had been longing for it, and it will surely be an effective aid in Kingdom service. It is the second book produced by the factory at the German branch since the end of World War II. Songs sung from overflowing hearts expressed the tremendous joy of all those attending. Music was supplied by a large, brilliant 150-piece orchestra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The press, periodicals and radio gave favorable and even well-wishing reports and announcements that supported the good work of the witnesses throughout the land. They commented on the immersion and showed special interest in the locomotive, standing on an unused track directly next to the big kitchen tent, that supplied steam to 48 steam kettles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order to have the joy reach its peak in our country Brothers Knorr and Henschel flew to Berlin to meet the Berlin brothers and some from the Eastern zone. The Wald-biihne (forest stage) had been rented. What a surprise, and how deeply the president and his companions were moved when it was established that, Tuesday afternoon, 13,563 participants had assembled in this lovely natural theater! The assembly had been arranged for only four hours previously. Although no further notice had been given, the news of Brother Knorr’s intention to visit Berlin had penetrated into the far corners of the Eastern zone before the convention in Frankfurt and got the brothers there moving. Who could have held them back? Who among the great crowd of God’s people can imagine what it means: ‘Brother Knorr behind the Iron Curtain’ and to listen to his talk there?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">More than 8,000 of the East zone attended and returned to their homes filled with joy and ready more than ever to engage in Kingdom work in spite of the foes and to proclaim early liberty to the captives. The people of the East zone listen to the message and like it. They appreciate the courage and boldness with which Jehovah’s witnesses resist communistic terror, and go rather into penitentiaries or labor camps than resist the divine command or lay aside the blessed Kingdom service. They are living the life extended to them by the undeserved kindness of the Lord. They win it by remaining fearless until Jehovah’s strong arm also beats this enemy into the dust to again aid his people in obtaining the freedom needed to serve him according to his command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the Eastern zone the number of those again taking up the work or newly joining after the ban has increased monthly. Starting with 5,500 publishers in September of 3950 the Eastern zone has reached a peak of 17,256 during the last service year. Although it is generally known that 708 Imprisoned by the Communists endure horrible tortures and tribulations, hundreds join this group of witnesses every month and take their stand for Jehovah and his Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now at the beginning of the new service year there are 36,997 publishers in Western Germany. If we add those of the East zone we have 54,253 publishers for the new world. That is 2,000 more than we had last year before the ban in Eastern Germany. Thus Jehovah has already, through the power of his spirit, transformed that which the enemy regarded as our defeat into a wonderful victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the past service year good progress was made In legally establishing and defending the work of publishing the “good news”. Decisions of government offices, acquittal court decisions, as well as other avowals and recognitions have served to effectively throw back the enemies’ attacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So with Increased gratitude and appreciation for the service given us by Jehovah, we go Into the new year feeling sure that nothing can keep us from having our share in the increase of his theocratic rule world-wide. Brother Knorr’s visit and the recommendations by him for Bethel and the factory will further promote and benefit the work throughout the entire land. Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany, together with their brothers in all countries of the world, will continue to render to Jehovah God the “clean and undefiled worship” due him.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark153"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark154"></a>GOLD COAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It has been a year of steady advancement in Kingdom service in the Gold Coast. Our brothers there are able to show a 45 per cent increase in publishers. Here, too, we see the “other sheep” streaming in very rapidly. It was a good thing that they were able to receive new publications during the year to help those now in the truth study and become more mature. There are some real problems that must be surmounted by Jehovah’s witnesses in the Gold Coast. It takes tact and love on the part of the publisher to try to make over the mind of those individuals steeped in idol worship. But it can be done and is being done in these days. The branch servant gives us a report on the Gold Coast and also the Ivory Coast, a country that comes under the branch’s jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The big event of the year for us was our national assembly held at Kumasi the last four days of December. At the time we had just under 2,500 publishers, and as the assemblies are usually well attended we expected an attendance of about that many. Much time and effort were spent in preparing for the cafeteria, for this had been a weakness at previous assemblies; but from the very beginning of the assembly the cafeteria was having difficulty in feeding all the people. The organization of it appeared to be good, and so we were unable to understand why they were having so much trouble preparing a sufficient amount of food. By the second day we began to understand why; instead of feeding 2,500 as we had originally planned they were feeding more than 3,500. The average attendance at the assembly for the four days was 3,663, and 6,050 attended the public talk. Outstanding too is the fact that 800 were immersed at the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The field service here presents many problems, but none too big for an alert publisher to overcome. Although a large percentage of the people profess to be Christian, many of them hold to their pagan rites and fetish worship. A fetish may be anything from a piece of pottery to a mound of dirt used as an object of worship, and which Is supposed to have supernatural powers. The people make these fetish gods and then live in constant fear of them. Several Interesting letters have come in during the year from publishers and pioneers telling of how they were able to help some people, and even fetish priests, to see that their gods are false and possess no power. Typical of the experiences is this one from a company publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In the month of June, 1951, Brother J. T. and I went witnessing at Peki village, about six miles from Asesewa. We came to a place where a fetish priest of Tigarl had been pounding fufu and a fine dish of soup for the Tigarl fetish. I told him the fetish has no hands and he cannot take the fufu. He said, ‘No, he can take it.’ I said, ‘Well and good; let us weigh the fufu.’ He agreed, and having weighed the fufu, it was three pounds in weight. We put the fufu to the fetish to eat, and after ten minutes we reweighed the fufu and got the same weight. Fifteen minutes after, a friend of the fetish priest entered in and took the fufu to eat. We waited, and after this friend had satisfied himself, we reweighed the fufu the second time and got one-half pound. We were all satisfied that the fetish could not take fufu, and the fetish priest was immersed on the 24th of June at Asesewa. Satan’s Inabilities are being proved.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is much work yet to be done here. We are just beginning to expand into the Northern Territories, which comprise nearly half of Gold Coast. Our need is for more Gilead missionaries, and we were more than pleased when we learned that four from the 17th class have been assigned to Gold Coast. Our prayers to Jehovah are that He will open the way for them to get here that they may further assist in expanding the Kingdom interest in this land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark155"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark156"></a>IVORY COAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Ivory Coast during the past service year has been carried on by a special pioneer and his wife, a pioneer. Their reports show that they have been working hard though there has been no increase in publishers for the year. Living conditions are very difficult there. Prices are high, and in Abidjan, where the brother and sister are located, it is next to impossible to find a place to stay. The brother had to get part-time work with a firm there in order to get rooms, and then the firm was able to provide them with only a single room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two Gilead missionaries, natives of Gold Coast, who were assigned to Ivory Coast arrived there just before the close of the service year. They will be a great encouragement to the brother and sister already there, and we look for a more rapid advancement of the work in Ivory Coast during the present service year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark157"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark158"></a>GREECE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The conditions surrounding our brothers in Greece are not favorable. However, these conditions do not prevent our brothers from rendering their service to Almighty God. The difficulties and obstacles faced by the Lord’s people in Greece seem almost unbearable, but they press on preaching the good news, and find a wonderful increase. Starting with the first month of the service year they steadily and progressively exceeded the quota set every month. They reached a new all-time peak of 4,163 publishers, a 26 per cent increase. Our brothers in Greece are happy even though they have tremendous trials. The branch servant in Greece gives us a good idea of what is going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Theocracy’s increase is made an actuality even in Greece. Without assemblies, without Kingdom Halls, without possibilities of singing songs, but solely with small meetings “at homes”, the Kingdom work is regularly going on. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> studies, service meetings and theocratic ministry schools are very regularly conducted by ail companies of the Lord’s people. So, with the assimilation of the rich spiritual food provided by the Lord through the “faithful and discreet slave”, and with the training acquired in the service meetings and the theocratic ministry schools, we are enabled to overcome the manifold difficulties encountered in our way. We very well know that we are not alone in this fine attempt. We are assisted by a powerful and holy theocratic organization, ready and willing to help us in every case of need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are moved by the fact that we are privileged to do a missionary work in this country, where about 1900 years ago the apostle Paul preached the gospel of Christ. We feel glad whenever people of good will heed the Kingdom message and, like the ancient Beroeans, express their desire to examine ‘whether these things are so’. We are many times arrested and charged with “proselytism”, because of merely presenting to the people our literature, which is lawfully issued and circulated. But we repel this erroneous and intolerant conception, because as true Christians we are not at all inclined to bring pressure of any kind to bear on any person, or to lead people to become members of any manmade organization. It seems, however, that as long as we are imitators of Paul, who was also an imitator of Christ, we must have experiences similar to those had by Paul in his missionary work in Greece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You will also be pleased to learn that gospel ministers kept in various prisons for cases of integrity are sending their Christian love to you and through you to all of their fellow ministers in all parts of the world. They wish you to know that, though being “prisoners”, they continue the “pure worship” as free people in Christ. They are regularly holding their meetings, and do not fail to turn in their reports of the work done “in season and out of season”. These prisoner brothers have substantially contributed to the general effort toward the 34 per cent increase. Some of them are sentenced to death, just because they did not want to render to Caesar those tilings that are God’s. Execution of their sentence has merely been suspended pending pronouncement by the Council of Reprieves on the brothers’ petitions for reprieve filed therewith. These zealous ministers, however, are governed by Paul’s words at Acts 20: 24 (2VW) : “Nevertheless, I do not make my soul of any account as dear to me, if only I may finish my course and the ministry which I received of the Lord Jesus, to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last June the Greek Orthodox Church organized spectacular festivals on the occasion of the 1900th anniversary, as announced, of the apostle Paul’s arrival in Greece. Here are some instances of “religious freedom” professed by the pious-looking perverters of missionary Paul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a village of Macedonia, intolerant agents of a local corps of security police arrested four witnesses of Jehovah, all being family men, find very cruelly mistreated them for not signing declarations to the effect that they deny Jehovah. Then they took them before the metropolitan of the area, who, upon hearing that they were Jehovah’s witnesses, began beating them with his own hands. A brother then dared say to him: “You, metropolitan, beat us 1 But I ask you, Has Christ slapped anyone, or did he suffer slappings?” Subsequently, the above intolerant agents took the brothers to the jail cells, where more cruel tortures continued. The wife of one of them went to the chief and protested about this cruel treatment of the brothers and of her husband in particular, who was ill. The chief’s reply was: “We shall make them useless; since they offer no service to us, we shall make them useless even for Jehovah!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again, in a village of Crete, the chief of the police station called in a brother in the presence of the priest, and demanded of him to deny Jehovah in writing. The brother protested and stated that as a Greek citizen he has the right to worship God according to his own convictions. This irritated the police officer who, while insulting Jehovah, snatched a Bible held by the brother, trampled it underfoot, and then tore it up in front of the priest’s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even in Athens itself, in July 1951, while the speeches of Pauline celebrators about love and freedom of worship were yet fresh, police agents invaded a house where about twenty witnesses of Jehovah were gathered together studying the Bible. They broke up the study, crying, “Hands up I” as if they were to arrest bandits. They took the brothers to the police station, took their fingerprints, as in the case of criminals, and next day they took them to the public prosecutor. The latter, finding no legal backing of the charge, set the brothers free. Of what value, however, is this discharge, when each time Jehovah’s witnesses meet together to study God’s Word, they risk being arrested and taken to jail as criminals? And if such things happen in the midst of Athens, one may guess what happens in the provinces, where the local agents are influenced by intolerant religious elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">¥et, out of all these difficulties and persecutions comes the increase. The experiences had in the service fields are rich and very blessed. The brothers are not discouraged from the warfare waged by the Devil on those keeping God’s commandments and having the witness of the King Christ Jesus. With the strength drawn from the rich spiritual food provided by the Lord’s organization we continue, along with all our fellow ministers in the various parts of the earth, the good fight of the faith once delivered to the saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some brothers were prisoners on a barren island for reasons of Integrity. The jailers isolated them in order to deprive them of any chance of speaking to other prisoners and converting them to Jehovah. They were, however, commandeering them for forced labor on the hills situated around there. Other prisoners were also sent up there. So the brothers were given an opportunity to speak of God’s kingdom. Quite a number of persons have come to know the truth in this way. Really, God’s Word cannot be bound. The brothers turned their tent into a Kingdom Hall and conducted therein all their meetings regularly. One day, the commandant sent up one of his trusties to watch the brothers and listen to the subjects discussed, In order to charge them accordingly. But when the man heard the brothers speaking of God, the Bible and God’s kingdom, he was so influenced that he stepped into the tent and openly attended the discussions and disclosed the secret commission assigned to him. He became a friend of the brothers and helped them during the hard times they had on that barren island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This year’s assemblies of London and Paris were attended by eight Greek brothers who conveyed to us, on their return, the many blessings enjoyed, and especially the Import of “clean worship”, which was much emphasized during those big gatherings of the Lord’s people. We are now prepared to enter the new service year with renewed strength for the increase and expansion of the “clean and undefiled worship” in our land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark160"></a>GUATEMALA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Like all of Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere the Guatemalans are interested in assembling together. The outstanding event during the year was the circuit assembly at Quetzaltenango, the second-largest city. Chartered buses were obtained and many of the brothers left the capital city to travel to the convention point. A great blessing was received by all. It gave them an opportunity to talk to the humble Indians and many others not too often met in the capital city. When the brothers engaged in the magazine work in this town the discussions eventually turned into little impromptu Bible lectures. A lot of interest was shown on the part of the local people in this assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. From the branch servant’s report the following is taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A joyful step In the expansion of true worship was the opening of a new missionary home in the country’s main port of Puerto Barrios. This is one of the biggest banana ports in the Caribbean, handling the bulk of exports from Guatemala. The town centers around a mile-long wharf, with houses built on stilts, having wire screens instead of windows. The inhabitants are mostly colored workers from Jamaica, who speak Spanish and English. The two missionaries assigned there, despite the sweltering heat and primitive conditions, report wonderful reception of the Kingdom message. Already two new publishers have joined them, while eighteen studies were started in the first six weeks. They were indeed overjoyed to hear that four new missionaries from the graduating class were assigned there to assist in the blessed ‘harvest work’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Recently a publisher was preaching along one of the new street-construction projects in the capital, without finding a single person of good will. To his surprise, as he was leaving some of the street construction gang walked up to him. They said they had overheard him witnessing and were interested in the Bible’s explanation of a new world, and could they please have some of the books and Bibles. Upon being shown these, they called over the rest of the workers, which, of course, aroused the interest of the construction foreman as to what it was ‘all about’. He too joined his workmen in wanting literature. This shows that, while sometimes we seemingly witness in vain, some ‘preaching crumbs’ may fall into the ears of humble ‘sheep’, so that they will call others to come and take hold of the coat of him who is presenting the ‘glad tidings’, to learn more about the blessings of ‘everlasting life’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the problems confronting missionaries here in preaching is that of the many Indian tribes that do not speak Spanish. Recently the Lord opened the way to reach these, when an isolated publisher asked that a public lecture be given at his home. Two missionaries arranged to meet him in the village of Momestenango, afterward climbing a footpath up the side of a mountain for an hour and a half to get to his home. On arriving they found two thatehed-roof houses, where about thirteen persons were waiting to hear the talk. An hour talk was given. Since all present were Mayan-Quiche Indians, it was necessary for the local brother, who could speak Spanish, to translate in the Quiche dialect. Soon the fruits of this first Kingdom lecture in their native dialect were manifest, when two months later three publishers reported instead of one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The importance of making back-calls was emphasized a few months back when a missionary placed a Bible help with a man who remarked that he had no time for studying. However, this did not deter her from faithfully calling back on the placement. This time she was met by his wife, who, although a devoted Catholic who attended all the religious parades and rituals, was attracted by the glorious Kingdom promises, and a study was arranged. After the study had continued for some time her son, who had noted her happiness in studying God’s Word, offered the witnesses free radio time on a new radio station being started. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">15-minute Bible study program, three times a week, in the evening, was arranged. This program soon proved popular, as the native Guatemalans were attracted first by the way these </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">norteamericanos</span><span class="font6"> spoke Spanish, and secondly by the Bible truths. Soon reports were received of even Catholic priests regularly listening to the only ‘good news’ of our times. The program is broadcast on short and long wave, so all who can listen may rejoice with His people. Thus from obediently taking care of this ‘placement’ the way was opened up for thousands to listen to the pure Bible truths.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>HAITI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Our brothers in Haiti have had an exciting year. It has been one of fighting for their lives as free ministers in this land. The work was going along very well, and then, for some unforeseen season, the government decided to ban the work of Jehovah’s witnesses and not allow them to proclaim the message of God’s kingdom. Of course, the Society, through its branch office, worked continually with the government officials to show them that there were no communistic connections whatsoever. This is usually the cry of the Catholic Hierarchy concerning Jehovah’s witnesses. It took some time to convince the officials that they were misinformed and that Jehovah’s witnesses had no communistic tendencies whatsoever. The story by the branch servant gives us an account of what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In reviewing the events of the 1951 service year, it certainly turned out to be by far Haiti’s most outstanding. First of all we were overjoyed to receive Brothers Knorr and Henschel, who featured their visit with a convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Month after month new publishers came out into the field, and, despite difficult living conditions in Haiti, the number of pioneers rose from two to seven, and two of these were made specials. On May 1, 1951, the department of cults requested the branch office to submit copies of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Atcake! </span><span class="font6">for investigation by the government. It was a serious matter, about the question of communism. But alas, this request proved to be but a modest way to present us with a letter dated April 19 banning all activities of Jehovah’s witnesses In Haiti, on the grounds that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> was continually diffusing communistic ideas. So that official written decision preceded the investigation of the literature requested, and we were not informed of the ban until May 9. The meetings at the Kingdom Halls were discontinued, and the work was carried on from the area studies, even though there seemed to be no real enforcement of the ban. Very few publishers were discouraged about this, and, as a matter of fact, a company was organized while the ban was in force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then another letter, dated July 11, came through the department of cults, removing restrictions and authorizing us to continue activities. At this point the army of Haiti accentuated its connection with banning the work by objecting to this letter and passing direct orders to the police to stop the work of Jehovah’s witnesses all over Haiti. A lieutenant of the police force came to the Kingdom Hall in Port-au-Prince and ordered us to stop all meetings. Out-of-town companies were forcibly closed down, and, in two cases, articles, including Kingdom Hall equipment, were confiscated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many representations were made before the various departments of the government, including the army. The American Embassy greatly aided the Society and cooperated in writing lengthy letters to the Haitian government. In all this it was stressed that we have been persecuted by the communists, and, with proof, it was shown that absolutely no connection exists between the Lord’s organization and communism. After all the interference it sounded humorous for a major to say that the army of Haiti was never guilty of persecuting religious organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But in the meantime another Issue was running current to the proscription. The Society directed that five more graduates of Gilead be sent to Haiti, which included the four missionaries that were forced off the Island of Martinique last January 18. Their application for residence permits was not accepted because of the ban; it appeared as if all five of them would never remain to do missionary work in Haiti.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But look! Then came August, the last month of the service year. We were told that the army had reversed its decision. They were calling off all police interference, and the letter lifting the ban was now accepted, and through the police all congregations would be informed that they could continue activities as before. Listen to the report of one company in the south: “We went to the police station and asked for our effects (that had been confiscated), and the captain handed them over saying, ‘Go, work for Jehovah until the end!’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We received the Society’s first publication in Haitian Creole during the year. Then, too, came the Paris convention release of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work&quot;</span><span class="font6"> in French. A local brother has also purchased sound equipment and placed it in the hands of the group here at the branch for public meeting activity. All these things have been a great help. Then, at last, the residence permits for the new missionaries were released by the immigration, the final one being obtained on the very last day of the service year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark163"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark164"></a>HAWAII</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This group of islands in the Pacific has many people living on them who are desirous of singing praises to the Most High. Those who have learned the truth are not satisfied to just keep it to themselves, but they have gone from island to island and city to city and house to house, preaching the good news. They were expansion-minded and anxious to reach the 34 per cent increase. This they did by April, and finally went up to an all-time peak of 478 publishers. Their average increase in publishers for the year was 44 per eent, which is excellent. The branch servant tells us about some of the outstanding events of the year, all of which helped them in their progressive march.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The high light of the year came with your visit and the long-awaited district assembly. Anxiety had run high from the first news of your coming, and excellent unity and cooperation were shown by the brothers in preparation for your visit and assembly. It was encouraging to learn that the majority from all outlying islands made an effort to come to the feast. Many here were thrilled with your fine account of the visit, which appeared in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font6">We are still reminded of your visit, and thank Jehovah for this wonderful provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Further proof of expansion was seen at Memorial time, a time of special blessedness in the service year. The Honolulu company had been expanding so that there was scarcely enough room for the attendance at the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> studies. It was decided that a nearby school auditorium should be engaged for this Important occasion and it was well that we did, for the attendance mounted to 306 in this company alone. An all-time high of 790 attended this celebration throughout the Islands; truly a manifestation of proof that Jehovah is gathering out his “other sheep”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From this Memorial experience it was seen that the Honolulu company must soon be divided into two units. A new list of servants was appointed and they began to train while another meeting place was searched for. In May a suitable place was found, and shortly after the first of June the Kaimuki unit began meeting separately from the Central unit. This was Indeed a great step forward and brought many to the realization that the work was really on the increase in Hawaii, with a total of eleven companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of greatest interest to all is to watch the progress of the home Bible-study work. A monthly average of 688 studies was maintained during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pioneer work is always a point of interest among Jehovah’s people, and it is no less so in Hawaii. It was found that a peak of 31 pioneers was reached, due to several signing up for the vacation pioneer work. Arrangements were made during your visit to send two special pioneers to the Kohala section of the Big Island. This too has had Jehovah’s blessing, for an average of seven publishers are now reporting regularly, and these pioneers have an average of 16 studies each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A fitting climax for this grand service year was the circuit assembly held in Hilo on the Big Island of Hawaii the last week end In July. Many looked forward to this assembly, as It would be their first visit to this Island. All but one of the Islands were represented, and a peak attendance of 222 was reached at the public lecture on Sunday. Many were the favorable comments on the improvements in the Saturday evening circuit activity meeting, at which there were 210 present.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark165"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark166"></a>HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Publishers in Honduras are very grateful for the many articles in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> on proper living and conduct of Jehovah’s witnesses. As is true in many Catholic-controlled countries of Central America, the people have not been taught the Scriptures on how to live together as man and wife. They think it is perfectly proper to live with anyone and have illegitimate children. The Catholic priests baptize them and do little to discourage this most common and ungodly custom in the land. It is reported that half the children of Honduras are born out of wedlock. This condition is cleared away when an individual comes into the truth. Such ones study the Society’s publications, and they learn that they are living in “common law” marriage and that they must get legally married. One company reported that it had assisted seven couples to get married, and now all of them are in the service. Keeping the organization clean is important, because the blessing of the Lord goes with the organization doing his will. The branch servant gives us some interesting reports on the activity in that country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Words cannot express our gratefulness to the Society and to Jehovah for the nine new missionaries assigned to Honduras and the three others transferred here from other countries during the past year. We now have a total of five missionary homes in the country, including the new ones in Puerto Cortes and Tela. There is now an English and a Spanish company In each of these two mentioned places. The missionary home servant in Tela sent in some interesting experiences. He writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Arriving in Tela in the latter part of October, the four missionaries worked hard to establish the home. . . . As quickly as the Kingdom Hall was ready a series of lectures in both languages, Spanish and English, was begun. As many as sixty attended these first few talks. . . . These continued to associate, and gradually the little company of Kingdom publishers began to grow In numbers and maturity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are In need of more general pioneers. There are large departments or provinces here in Honduras that have never received a witness as yet. From time to time letters come In from these remote places, asking that a representative be sent to explain our work. It is hoped that during the new year more company publishers will be able to take up pioneering. The four we now have are doing excellent work, as well as the two native special pioneers. Possibly some day some of these will meet Gilead requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reaching out into isolated territory two missionaries took a launch out to the Pacific island of Amapala, all to the displeasure of a couple of Catholic priests on the same vessel. Arriving at night they shortly retired, to begin witnessing early the next morning. Next morning at the first call a soldier accosted one of the missionaries, stating, “I called at the pension where you spent the night to direct you to the local </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">commandancia.</span><span class="font6"> They will check to see if you will be permitted to continue or not.” Who could have put the soldier on the witnesses’ trail so quickly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before the local commander, somewhat irritated, not with the witnesses but the ones who had reported them, he remarked, after taking a book, “I am the one who commands these islands; although I was born and brought up a Catholic I appreciate your coming here and you may continue your work, and I will see to it that you will not be molested again.” Yes, religious freedom prevails not only on that island but throughout all Honduras. After placing a carton of books, and when leaving, the same officer accosted the missionaries again, this time to bid them goodby and invite them to return, besides obtaining some literature for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two trips were made to the Bay Islands, and the whole town turned out to welcome the missionaries at Utila. At three public open-air meetings an average of over 200 attended. Other Gilead graduates spending their vacations to good advantage went into new fields, La Esperanza, San Marcos de Colon, UniOn, etc. Many were their exciting experiences, not only during vacation but in their local assignments as well, such as the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the suburbs of Tela is a poor settlement ignored by the clergy, until the missionaries started holding meetings at night under a house built up on stilts. They bought a small power plant for lights, and from 70 to 90 attend. Another reports that a circus came to a village nearby. The truth so appealed to one of the circus clowns and his wife that they left the circus and took another job where they could attend Kingdom Hall meetings and associate with the Lord’s people. And so it goes, an endless chain of thrilling experiences that fill our hearts with joy for the small part we have in helping a few of the ever-growing great crowd to find their place in the one organization of pure worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since Memorial time the average number of publishers kept on climbing. July saw an increase of thirty-nine, and August overshadowed that number by forty, thus erasing the country’s previous all-time peak of over two years ago. Words can hardly describe our joys and privileges of service had during the past year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark167"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark168"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The task of Jehovah’s witnesses is not an easy one in this land under Communist domination. They appreciate that “this is how love has been made perfect with us, that we may have freeness of speech in the day of judgment,. .. There is no fear in love, but perfect love throws fear outside, because fear exercises a restraint”. (1 John 4:17, 18, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font7"> Our brothers certainly have thrown fear outside in Hungary, and from what little information comes through from that country all of Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere can be strengthened. Our Hungarian brothers set a fine example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To our God, who has led and protected us through many difficulties, of which at the close of another service year we can report to you, be all praise and thanks. The past year has been a year of heavy warfare. It opened with a condition of cold war against the Society, which came to a climax on the evening of November 13, 1950. The branch office was occupied by the police and our brothers were carried off to unknown destinations; typewriters and equipment were taken away by car. We were reminded of the danger threatening in King Hezekiah’s time that the Assyrians might cut off the water supply of the city of Jerusalem, but how the water flowed into the city through another channel bored by King Hezekiah! That is the situation here. Our office is closed down but our brothers are receiving the most necessary food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Traveling and postal facilities are excellent in the country, but unfortunately not for the Lord’s people. It is not easy to serve Jehovah here, but we must fight under great difficulties. Physical aggression and imprisonments are frequent, and many are being dismissed from their places of employment because they persist in the pure and undefiled worship of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time of writing there are 200 younger brothers in prison serving sentences of from ten months to four years. The number increases from day to day; here and there one or another Is dismissed under threat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The publishers work with the Bible. The Bible shop in Budapest, which operates under the influence of the clergy and has a limited number of Bibles, has received the order not to sell to Jehovah’s witnesses because they prove from the Bible that Jehovah is the “higher power”. This false religious element continues to slander us. Since the loss of their material property their moral reputation has suffered too, but in order to get back into favor they do not cease their wooing. The government accepts these advances although they fully recognize their wily policy, and do not place any confidence in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At present 21 pioneers are working under great difficulties. All must produce evidence of secular work, and as they have no literature to distribute it is hard for them to support themselves. The companies in which they work assist them. The brothers are courageous and spiritually strong. There are here and there such persons as those of Penuel and Succoth, but they cannot create disharmony. We are often accused of being against the state. Formerly we were decried as Communists, as forerunners of Bolshevism; today as spies of an imperialist state. These attacks come sometimes from official places, but many people do not believe these modern lies. Among the highest officials there are some earnest-minded statesmen who shared our imprisonment under the Nazi regime, and they respect us on account of our steadfastness. They know personally some of our brothers, and our enemies cannot blacken the record Of these messengers of truth in their eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Amidst many difficulties, but under Jehovah’s protection and leading, we enter upon a new year. Strengthened by our experiences in the past we courageously and steadfastly face the difficulties that await us, in the conviction that truth and peace will triumph under the leadership of the King of kings and Lord of lords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We join with you in prayer and in the fight for the vindication and praise of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark169"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The whole world is in a state of nervous anxiety. Political and economic conditions plague all nations. In India they have another problem in addition to these, that is, their religion. There are the orthodox Hindus in India who would like to enforce their way of life on all people, but the present governmental powers maintain that there shall be free speech and free worship. This is good for Jehovah’s witnesses. It is difficult, however, to reach the people and convince them that the Bible is the Word of God and contains the true hope for mankind. But our brothers in India continue to try, and they are making progress. The branch servant reports on India, Ceylon and Iran. Read his report and get the feel of their problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The outstanding events of the year have been the coming of more Gilead missionaries. The two pioneers who went from India to Gilead returned and brought with them two others. The influx started in March and reached a climax in May, when seven sisters arrived, giving us a total of eleven additional helpers. These were sent to Madras, Bangalore, Calcutta and Greater Bombay. We now have 21 missionaries in full-time service in India, 17 of whom are working as pioneer missionaries in the field, one as circuit servant, and three are at the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order to find out how the work among the non-Christian communities was progressing a questionnaire was sent to all companies and pioneers, as was done last year. This reveals a total of 83 home Bible studies being conducted with Hindus, Parsees and Moslems at the close of the year. Thirty-three studies had been started but discontinued, and thirteen persons, who were not previously “Christian”, had started publishing the good news. Three were baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These reports reveal the same general conditions everywhere, but mention should be made of Calcutta, where by far the greatest amount of progress has been made among non-Christians. There are 38 home Bible studies being conducted in Calcutta among the Bengali Hindus, and the report says “this work is just beginning”. Other characteristic expressions are: “they have studies out of politeness,” “just for friendship,” “to improve their English,” “for comparative study but with the determination that they will never change their religion.” One report expresses a general truth revealing the attitude of most Hindus by saying “there is general antipathy to any revealed religion, and they cannot accept the idea of a ransom”. Now that the new book, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font6"> is available it should do a great deal toward helping honest Hindus, Parsees and Moslems to see the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The language problem still remains our biggest hurdle to overcome. Throughout the year we have had only the one booklet, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People,</span><span class="font6"> available in the principal vernaculars. The book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font6"> in Malayalam is now printed, and we are awaiting the shipment. The same book in Kanarese is also about ready, while translations are finished in Marathi and Urdu, and these are being prepared for the press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An outstanding event of interest was the opening up of organized activity in and around the town of Cochin in south India. This is in the Malayalam-speaking territory, and some of the brothers from Travaneore had aroused interest, and, of course, opposition from the religionists there. The sect of “Brethren” there tried to create trouble at a public meeting held by Jehovah’s witnesses. After a series of eight talks given by the Witnesses the “Brethren” engaged the same hall and advertised that meetings would be held to refute what the Witnesses had taught. They had three meetings, and it is reported that some of their audience complained to the speaker that he was not giving them any Scriptural proof for his arguments, and therefore they could not accept them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>CEYLON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There are three Gilead missionaries who have worked hard through the year, and one of them particularly is making good progress with the Singhalese language. They now have the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People</span><span class="font6"> and the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free&quot;</span><span class="font6"> in Singhalese. Their work among the Buddhists and Hindus has been difficult, and very few have accepted the invitation to study the Bible, or even show any desire to do so. They will take the literature, but it is difficult to get them to make a serious study of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the commencement of the year there were three general pioneers working. One had to give up pioneer w’ork because of domestic affairs, and in the month of April all three left the country to settle in Australia. Other publishers have also left the place, and these losses about equalize the gains made, so that the net result looks as if no progress has been made. But progress has been made, and there is no thought of slacking the hand on the part of the mature publishers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark173"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark174"></a>IRAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Iran suffered an unfortunate setback just at the time when we anticipated a forward surge of activity. All the world knows about the dispute between the Iranian and British governments over the oil question, and this has interfered with the progress of Kingdom preaching in Iran.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There has been the one lone publisher working in Abadan, the oil town, through most of the year. He had been a pio-iieer some time back, but had to give up the full-time work because of marriage duties. He had one home Bible study running all the time, but recently he went to the cooler and safer place of Isfahan. There is some interest in Iran. Reports are not received regularly now.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark175"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark176"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Darkness covers the people who are in this old system of things and serving it. However, Jesus said: “You are the light of the world.” It is certainly a joy for Jehovah’s witnesses to go about the earth letting their light shine. That is what they are doing in Italy. It has been a long, hard, uphill battle to help the people in this land, but Jehovah’s rich blessing is upon the servants of the Lord there. With the increase of the field work more legal problems arise, but these are handled as they come along. A greater witness is thus given throughout the country. And the greater the witness, more is the opposition that comes from the false religionists, and this is handled, too, as they go along. The branch servant gives us a pretty good idea of the power and control of the religionists. But despite this control there has been a 52 per cent increase over last year’s average of publishers, and now there are 1,742 singing praises to Jehovah. One experience sums up the obstacle that must be met in Italy by Jehovah’s witnesses; we will let the branch servant tell it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is evident that the common man Is sick and tired of the whole religious mess and Is blaming religion for his present sorrowful state. The Catholic religion in Italy is reaping exactly what she deserves after centuries of dogmas, tradition, Intolerance, bigotry, inquisitions, and harsh treatment of the people in general. So it Is not surprising to find so many Italians, even next door to the Vatican, who despise that organization and would like to see it go down. They have had their eyes opened to what false religion has done. But the masses are not acquainted with true religion nor de they know that it is God’s purpose as expressed In the Bible to destroy all the false Institutions of this world and set up a new system of things. This comforting good news is now being declared on the Italian peninsula and on the islands of Sicily and Sardinia by Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following experience, which was sent in recently, well illustrates how false religion reacts to the message of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Plans were made to hold our semiannual circuit assembly in the city of C---- the last week end of June 1951.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Police permission was obtained both for the private meetings and the public assembly. Two years ago authorization for our public meeting had been refused on the pretext that the police were tied up with Communist strikes in the province, and hence none could be spared for duty at our meeting. This time, however, everything seemed to be going fine until after our public advertising got under way Saturday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“At noon two policemen came over to the hall to advise us that our </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">private</span><span class="font6"> meetings there were being forbidden. Immediately we called on the local office of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">commissario </span><span class="font6">to find out what this was all about. As we entered the police station, a young priest was leaving the place with a big smile on his face. Evidently he was quite joyful, and we soon learned that the police had given him reason to feel contented. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">commissario</span><span class="font6"> himself made it very plain to us that our police permit was being canceled for reasons over which he had no control. The authorities gave as the ‘reason’, the unsafe condition of the hall, but no one was expected to believe that. After a somewhat heated discussion of the matter, we were advised to go to the capital of the province and talk to the provincial ‘boss’, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">questore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“A few hours later we were walking into the provincial police headquarters, and to our surprise we found there the same Catholic priest we had met in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">commissario’s</span><span class="font6"> office, this time accompanied by an older and more importantlooking priest. We found out later that the latter was the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">vicario</span><span class="font6"> of the city where we were holding our assembly. The priests were waiting to talk with the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">questore,</span><span class="font6"> but when his assistant, the chief of police, came in they asked to be shown into his office instead. A few minutes later the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">questore </span><span class="font6">arrived, giving us the opportunity to talk to this head man of the province while the two priests were in the adjacent office with the chief of police. However, the stage had already been set, the black-robed religionists behind the scene had already gone into action, and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">questore,</span><span class="font6"> their political puppet, was ready to carry out their orders. He clearly showed that his mind had already been made up for him before hearing what we had to say and, instead of offering good reasons to explain why our meetings had been forbidden, he started out by threatening us with arrest for having rented a hall that was, in his opinion, unfit for meetings. His tactics were to frighten us and make it seem as if we were the ones that had done wrong and hence deserving reproof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Then he telephoned the police chief in the next room, and, undoubtedly so that the two priests in there with him would be convinced of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">questore’s</span><span class="font6"> devotion to their cause, he gave orders to forbid our private meetings, and, as a punishment, even our public meeting was to be prohibited. How the priests must have gloated when they saw that their scheme was working! They must have felt like the religious scribes who put pressure on Pilate and made him give in and consent to Jesus’ death. Though outwardly they thought they had gained their objective, their Jesuitical machinations were to result in their own defeat in the eyes of their political dupes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We were determined not to give in to this arbitrary, fascistlike action of the police without a battle, and for more than one hour we stayed in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">questore’s</span><span class="font6"> office and debated the legal aspect of our ease. The chief of police, evidently after having gotten rid of his religious advisers, came in to join the dispute. We tried to show both these politicians that they were not acting fairly or democratically in giving in to religious dictators who would not tolerate a difference of opinion, and if religion could not stand criticism then there was something wrong with it. They agreed to this, but justified themselves by asserting that Italy could never be democratic, because of the old totalitarian elements that have ruled for centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“As we left, we pointed out that they were refusing the privilege of giving a glass of ‘cold water’ to Christ’s ‘brothers’ and asked them who they really thought were the real followers of Christ, the priests who were putting pressure on them or we. Without hesitation they frankly declared: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘You</span><span class="font6"> are the disciples of Christ.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We went back and made arrangements to hold the assembly in two private homes, and by means of loud-speaking equipment we had the same program in both places at the same time. The intolerance of the clergy aroused the indignation of many honest persons, even though the priests tried to cover up by announcing in church the next morning that no one should attend the public meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses that day (when they knew all the time that it had been forbidden and therefore would not be held!). They did not want the people to know that it had been they who had stabbed freedom in the back, not because they were ashamed but because they are afraid of the truth and its effects on error. But here again the priests were defeated, because Jehovah’s witnesses do not keep their mouths shut but continue to expose the hypocrisy and the erroneous teachings of the false religionists, resulting in more persons of good will getting their eyes opened.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ffe thank the Society, Jehovah’s visible channel on this earth, for all that has been done for the Kingdom work in Italy. To be sure, it does cost something to carry on the work, but Jehovah’s blessings have been manifest and greater blessings are ahead. We appreciate what our brothers in Brooklyn, and especially our dear Brother Knorr, are doing for the work in all the earth. The new booklets that were prepared in Italian during the year, the Gilead training that was given to our full-time servants, and the rich spiritual food that is reaching us regularly make us all the more determined to press on in “good works”. This is the best way we can show our love for Jehovah and his organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark177"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The good news of the Kingdom is going forward in this land despite the difficulties that faced our brothers this year. There was a terrific hurricane that hit the island and this is reported by the branch servant. It is interesting to note the love of their brothers in other parts of the world who sent them relief. The United States brothers sent over 21,000 pounds of clothing immediately after the hurricane so as to equip our brothers with the things needful for life. The love between the Lord’s people is great and they help one another in the preaching work. The branch servant tells us the things that have happened during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We had been looking forward to the coming of Brother Knorr ever since his first visit in 1946, and we were thrilled to get notice of his visit for a whole week, from December 15 to 22, 1950. Early preparations for three assemblies were made, one in the capital and largest city, Kingston, which would be three days, and two others, one day each in two other principal cities. These proved very instructive and gave a great witness to Jehovah’s honor. A total of 5,459 heard Brother Knorr’s talk, “Can You Live Fovever in Happiness on Earth?” and 158 were immersed at these three assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All too soon Brothers Knorr and Henschel left, but with instruction left behind for plenty of work ahead. Kingston, having only three units, with about 800 publishers, needed to be divided again. Brother Knorr left suggestions as to how two more units should be formed as well as outlining a way the two more Kingdom Halls could be built. Immediately property hunting began and a site was purchased for the South unit, and now the building of a hall 32 by 60 feet is well under way while the brothers meet at a rented school. The North unit meets at the Women’s Clubhouse until their property is obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Shortly after the president and his secretary left, two of the Gilead missionaries who are working in Jamaica were assigned to work in the Cayman Islands (under the Jamaican branch) for two months. There are three islands in the group having a population of about 7,000 in all. Every home, practically, was visited and almost 2,000 Bibles and Bible study helps were left with the people. The two brothers did their best to lay a good foundation for the people there to get the knowledge that leads to life. Nearly every one of the schoolteachers there took literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Arrangements were made for the public talk, “Why the Bible Has Endured,” to be given in the Town Hall in one town, but due to the local parson’s telling those in charge of lights generally used by those using the hall not to let Jehovah’s witnesses use the lights, the gas lights were not obtained. So the people in the neighborhood gladly brought their lamps and lanterns and the talk was successfully given to over 100 persons. The parson even went to the lady who was boarding the two missionaries and asked her, “Do you know who it is you are keeping here? Do you know what you are doing?” The good lady answered emphatically, “Why, Mr. ----! Me? Fifty-five years old and don’t know</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">what I’m doing?” And she bid him go. It was not possible for the brothers to remain in those islands, but we hope soon someone will be able to care for and feed the many mild-tempered ones of good will there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here is an experience by a publisher at one of the assemblies : “While doing advertising work on the street on Saturday I heard a lady who said, ‘They know better than to come to my yard. I’ll run any Jehovah’s witness away today—those liars.’ I had some literature with me and I tactfully approached her. I knocked on the gate, greeted her pleasantly. She gave me a queer look and a rough answer. I introduced myself as a dear friend loving her as myself. At last she gave me a nice drink of water, a seat, and said, ‘Tell me about this Kingdom.’ I could see she wanted life. With tears she explained how her parson had read her out of church because her dues were not paid up, and she is left alone. I pointed her to the Kingdom where Jehovah will be her Shepherd if she will do what is required. She took </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’.</span><span class="font6"> She is now enjoying her weekly Bible studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A devastating hurricane struck the island the night of August 17, and when welcome daylight appeared, what a shorn and battered scene struck our gaze! The official report was 154 dead and 25,000 homeless, with property damage estimated at 16 million pounds! None of the three Kingdom Halls in Kingston were damaged, but many of the brothers in cities and country parts lost everything, as their houses were smashed to bits by the powerful twisting wind. What a blasphemy for some of the “parsons&quot; and therefore many people to charge the Almighty God with sending it as a chastisement for sin!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If only the people had the knowledge of Jehovah and his Son, which means life! No more charging Him with absurd and inconsistent actions, but it would make them line up with His now-established kingdom of peace, plenty and blessings for man, including no storms, which will soon put an end to this wicked, woeful rule of Satan the Devil!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark179"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark180"></a>JAPAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There are 80 million persons to whom Jehovah’s witnesses can preach the message of the Kingdom in this land. Shall we ever have a full opportunity ? That is the question. In any event, we are trying. Jehovah’s witnesses in Japan are pressing on diligently, reaching out into the various sections of the country and making known the Kingdom, the only hope of the world. The Society has 47 missionaries in the country now. These are doing excellent work in the large centers where they can reach millions as they have the time. Their problem is very well described by the branch servant, and excerpts from his report follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The report for the service year 1951 is submitted with unbounded gratitude to Jehovah for the ever-increasing privileges of service in Japan because of the forward progress of the past year, made possible by such happenings as (1) the visit of the Society’s president and a director, causing an extended witness through assemblies, public lectures in the four principal cities, and other meetings which inspired and stimulated the missionaries, pioneers and company publishers; (2) the beginning of publication of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> in Japanese May 1, 1951, bringing the so much needed spiritual food and instruction from Jehovah’s Word; (3) the coming of 24 additional missionaries during the year, and the opening of added missionary homes at Osaka, Nagoya and Yokohama; and (5) the starting of circuit servant work in Japan. The result has been a goodly increase for the Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We would like to give a detailed report of the fine assembly in Tokyo on the occasion of Brothers Knorr and Henschel’s visit, but, being limited in space, all we can say is that the instructive talks given and the association of the brothers with our visitors has been of great benefit to the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The missionaries have made much progress with the language during the past year. We start each day with the Japanese-language study of the day’s text, and then an hour’s group study of the Japanese language. The service meetings, including demonstrations, are presented entirely in Japanese, and in these the missionaries take a leading part. Also, we have presented some of the hour public talks entirely in Japanese. This is hard work, but it is a great aid to gaining fluency in the language. Also the audience say they can understand it better this way than through an interpreter, as the latter often misses the exact sense. The Japanese people are amazed that our mastery of the language has increased over that of other foreigners who have been in the country ten or twenty years. We thank Jehovah for this power of speaking in the most foreign of foreign tongues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But language is not our only problem. The Oriental outlook and temperament are something we have not yet come to fully appreciate. It requires the essense of patience and tact to overcome the ingrained superstitions. Just now we are at the height of the ancestor-worship festival. Every family loads a small boat with food, drink and other gifts for the spirits of the ancestors, and launches it forth on the sea one bright moonlit night. Our new publishers have learned to avoid such idolatry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then there are such things as the veneration of the emperor, etc., that still persist. In fact, creature worship is one of the cardinal shortcomings of the Japanese. Many studies have failed because the new interest wanted to make a god of the missionary. They wanted to sit forever at the feet of the missionary as “teacher” and never become apt to teach themselves. But the Lord through his organization provides means for overcoming these problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Group witnessing has been one such instrument. Through group witnessing, the new publishers get the opportunity of working with mature Japanese publishers, and they find that they can witness just as well as the missionaries. They begin to sense their companionship in a powerful organization, and that the numbers of the Japanese publishers are increasing over those of the missionaries. One midweek witnessing group has increased from three or four to sixteen company publishers. Thirty or more publishers support the Sunday group witnessing. It does one’s heart good to see a zealous Japanese sister, with baby strapped on her back and leading a toddler by the hand, defying the broiling sun to do her part in the group work. One Japanese company publisher, a Buddhist eighteen months ago, reported eleven studies last mouth. Thus we are no longer simply a missionary organization, but a company organization!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Plans were made by the president for the circuit servant to visit, in particular, during the first six months, the five missionary homes, as up to now the bulk of witnessing has been done by the missionaries. Consequently, with two exceptions the missionary homes are the center of company activity in Japan. The Japanese people are education-minded and many have a real desire to learn the truth. On May 1 eleven missionaries began to witness in Yokohama, which is the principal port of Japan, having one million people but not one Kingdom publisher. Six weeks later the circuit servant visited the home, and arrangements were made for him to give a public talk in Japanese. Handbills were distributed and, of course, all the interested ones invited. Everyone was thrilled when 117 attended and listened attentively to a subject of great interest to the Japanese, “The True God.” An audience of 117 after only six weeks of preaching! Ten weeks later the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study began with 96 attending!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Until the end of World War II, the custom in Japan of family members’ being in complete submission to the family head was very rigidly enforced. Since the war, in the towns and particularly among the people who come in contact with the foreign population, this is not so noticeable, but in the rural districts it is very strong. While visiting a small company the circuit servant was taken by the company servant to visit some interested persons out in the country. Due to its being rice-planting time, little could l&gt;e done until nine o’clock at night, when a public talk was given in a farmhouse. From the neighboring farms about 32 came and listened and at the close asked questions. In the rural areas the native religions of Buddhism and Shinto have a strong grip on the people, and it is not easy for them to accept the truth. Furthermore, if the head of the house is not disposed to listen, that virtually ends all chance of any member of the family hearing, as the family head’s word is law. However, in this case the husband was of good will, and a good witness was given. After the meeting all prepared to retire for the night, and after the women set the cotton mattresses down on the floor, the twenty-three members of the family and the two visitors went to bed in the one room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is indeed heart-warming to watch the new sheep coming along, taking up the witness work, becoming full-fledged publishers, pioneers, study conductors, assistants in the companies, translators of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer</span><span class="font6"> and others of the publications, and interpreting for the missionaries when necessary. Truly the seed of truth is beginning to bear fruit in Japan.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark181"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>TAIWAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This island, formerly called Formosa, is now a military state. This is the part of China that is in the United Nations, but its rulers are not for freedom of worship or freedom of speech. They stand for the old dictatorial government of China which was run off the mainland by the communist uprising. The reports that have come through from Taiwan are incomplete. Our brothers are having a hard time, but about 244 are still pressing on preaching the gospel of the Kingdom and comforting those that mourn. Some information that has come through from these brothers is as follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Conditions make it diflicult for us to report to you and much of our mail is intercepted and a lot of mail is undelivered. During August two of the pioneers were arrested for serving an unregistered religion, meaning the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. They were released after three weeks on the condition that they return in three weeks, giving the names of all of Jehovah’s witnesses on Taiwan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The local government is opposed to the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom. They are against the reign of Christ in peace and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brothers in Taiwan understand the Japanese language because this land was under Japanese rule for years. Copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer</span><span class="font6"> in Japanese are being sent in and when we receive them the good news is spread to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One newly interested person was attacked by a mob because he stopped worshiping the idols he formerly served. The mobsters damaged his farm and stole his animals, but he is going ahead in Jehovah’s service despite this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The letters received from our brothers In Taiwan are happy-sounding. They show faith and devotion and have full confidence in Jehovah God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark183"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark184"></a>LEBANON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">When one travels through Lebanon he is captivated by the sight of the hundreds of villages dotting the mountainsides. It is beautiful country. About two-thirds of the country’s populace live in these villages, and one wonders how the message of the Kingdom will ever reach them. The report shows that hundreds of the villages have been witnessed to during the year, but a great deal more work has to be done. When one thinks back to the days of Jesus and the apostles he remembers that they covered this territory by foot. Of Jesus it is written: “And he went round about to the villages in a circuit, teaching.” And then again: “They went declaring the good news to many villages.” (Mark 6: 6; Acts 8: 25, AW) If it is possible, such isolated places should be called on in all countries. Seed can be planted. Eventually it will be watered and Jehovah God will see to it that the prisoners come forth. The branch servant’s report is very interesting and he gives us a picture of the work in Lebanon and Syria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A pioneer brother from the U. S. came here for a year and brought a new automobile with him and almost daily took groups of publishers with him to work villages that had never before been given a witness. Much seed was sown by the vast amount of literature that was placed. As many as 40 books would be placed in a village having a hundred homes. To witness to these humble villagers is a real treat, because the people are very hospitable and almost always the publisher gets invited in. When you call at their door they will not say, ‘Well, what do you want?’ but their opening words in Arabic will be, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“AMan tea sahlan,&quot;</span><span class="font6"> which means “You’re welcome, come on in”. The custom of the Lebanese is to be polite to visitors. Even though they may not be interested, yet they will hear what you have to say. Before you leave they will usually offer you some sort of refreshment, coffee, candy, or fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There appeared an article in a publication in the Greek language which went to all the Greek-speaking families of Beirut. This article was by one of the ‘chief priests' of the Greek Orthodox Church in Lebanon. The article branded Jehovah’s witnesses as Jews and Communists. He was approached on the subject by two of our brothers. When told that he had no proof for anything that was written in it and that it was mostly false accusations, his retort was, “Well, you people are stealing my sheep!” He was reminded by the brother that they were not his sheep, but were the Lord's sheep and that the Lord was gathering them into the true fold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Being a land with many priests, occasionally, in going from door to door, the publishers will meet them in the homes of the people. An incident of this happened when two of the witnesses were invited into a house where four persons were present, and a discussion arose as to whether Mary the mother of Jesus had any other children after him. Scriptures from the Arabic Protestant version of the Bible were read to them showing that she did, but they would not accept these, claiming the Catholic Bible read differently. At that very moment a priest walked in and one of the men jumped up, kissed him on both cheeks and said, “Thank heavens you have come; you’re just the one we are looking for.” No time was lost in putting the question to the priest, Do the Catholic and Protestant versions of the Bible read the same? His answer, “No, certainly not!” It so happened that the man of the house had a Catholic Arabic Jesuit translation of the four gospels. The publishers had the priest read the same texts shown them before out of the Protestant version while the man of the house followed along in the Catholic version, and to their amazement they were found to be the same. The priest, without uttering another word, shortly thereafter slipped out of the house. More and more the people are beginning to see the fallacy of the clergy and their ignorance of the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the month of June we reached and exceeded our 34 per cent increase. Public meetings were instrumental in attaining this goal and this feature of the work increased 100 per cent. During the service year we were glad to welcome four more Gilead missionaries into our midst and they were assigned to work with the Beirut company. The company in Beirut started off the year with 52 publishers and ended up with a peak of 121. Persons of good will are quick in expressing their desire to join in field service, and some go out without anyone’s having had a home Bible study with them and after having attended only two or three company meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again we come to the close of another joyous service year. Realizing that there is yet much work to be done, we are resolved that the ‘stones will not have to cry out’, but we will continue to preach until the accomplished end comes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark185"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>SYRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In a village away back high up in the mountains of Syria there was a company organized four years ago. From time to time visits were made by brothers sent out from the branch, and at one public lecture as many as 500 persons were in attendance. For a small village having about 800 residents this means that almost two-thirds turned out to hear the talk. In the village there were three sectarian churches, but due to poor attendance the Protestant church closed down. The other two have hardly anyone going to them. The Protestant preacher was never very friendly to the witnesses, but once in a while the brothers would call on him. It was not long before he was listening, asking questions, and reading the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the circuit servant served that company he and other brothers visited the preacher and that week he attended all the meetings. On Sunday he accompanied the circuit servant from door to door and it was his desire to do much of the speaking. When inviting the people to the public talk, they would ask him, “Where is it going to be, at the church?” He would answer, &quot;No, at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses!” Some persons began criticizing him for now associating with the witnesses, asking him, “After you have been a preacher for thirty years how can you now join up with these young upstarts? What can these children teach you?” He answered, “Even the least of them has taught and showed me things in the Bible I never knew.” But his critics replied, “You will lose all your prestige as a respectable preacher in the community.” In answer he said, “Regardless, I thank God that I have been enlightened and come to a knowledge of the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For two lectures in the village he has acted as chairman and this has been a stirring witness to all in that area. Some have predicted that all the village might now become Jehovah’s witnesses. The company at this village has shown amazing progress during the year by having 31 immersed. The company has 50 publishers, an increase of 100 per cent over that of last year and with an average of 80 persons regularly attending the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The governmental authorities in the section of Syria where this company is located heard and took note of this numerical growth. They sent a notice to the brothers stating that they would not be allowed to meet any more. This order was not complied with and the representative members of the company were brought to trial. The charge against them was that they were a pro-Jewish political party operating under a religious cloak. At the trial the brothers had a Moslem for their attorney, who gave good testimony before the court, making clear the work of Jehovah’s witnesses and denying the charge made against them and proving that it was without foundation and thus false. The judge, also a Moslem, in dismissing the case said, “I have found Jehovah’s witnesses to be the only real Christians.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Syria is under continual surveillance and the brothers are often accosted and investigated. Syria is almost a police state, possibly because of its internal political troubles, border clashes and disputes with Israel. When traveling in the country one is constantly confronted with road blocks, searched, and checked to see if his travel papers are in order. A special pioneer sister was sent to Damascus, the capital, and after working there for about three months, placing on the average 60 books monthly, she was stopped and questioned by the police. She was permitted to go free, but for a few weeks afterward she was constantly shadowed and watched by plain-clothes men. Finally she was stopped again, this time taken to the police station and thoroughly questioned, then she was told to immediately leave Damascus and take a bus to Lebanon. She was not even allowed time to go gather up her belongings but the police took her down to the bus, put her on It, and waited until the bus left to be sure she left with it. The police and other responsible authorities there were given a thorough witness concerning the true nature of our work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the beginning of the year the branch servant and three other brothers took a 750-mile trip throughout all of Syria, going north almost to the Turkish border. Isolated interested persons were visited and in a few cities and towns the talks were delivered in private homes. A good survey of the Syrian field was made which revealed the enormous amount of work that yet needs to be done in order to find and feed the ‘‘other sheep”. Nearing the conclusion of their trip, while in a certain village the group was arrested, questioned and detained twenty-four hours. During this time a lengthy written report for the government was drawn up about them and the organization, and this after the authorities had carefully examined the publications. After all its interference and investigation, the Syrian government should now know, if it did not know before, about the work and organization of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark187"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark188"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It seems the policy of the Catholic Church is to keep the people in ignorance. That is the way they can eon-trol them. They have tried to do that for years in Mexico and other Central and South American countries. However, the government of Mexico has tried to remove the illiteracy of the people by instituting a vast educational program. Jehovah’s witnesses have taken up this work, too, with good success. God’s servants are not only trying to teach them to read and write, however, but they are showing them the way to life eternal in the new world, and many of the Mexican people are gladly receiving the truth. They are coming forth from the prison houses and they are singing the new song. The 10,335 publishers (the new peak in Mexico) are not liked by the clergy, and some of the points presented in the year’s report by the branch servant show this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is only in some small towns and isolated parts of the republic that the witnesses still meet a great deal of opposition, which will disappear little by little as the people become more enlightened due to the continued activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in their great educational work. This is well illustrated by the recent experience of a sister, who relates the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Leaving the city I went temporarily to a small town where I began to engage in the witness work, much to the chagrin of the local priest. Within a short time he used other men to threaten me if I didn’t stop talking to the people about the Kingdom, which I would not agree to do. In order to stop me a group of men went before the local commanding army officer, charging me with having weapons concealed in my house and promoting an insurrection. The officer, alarmed, sent a contingent of about 50 soldiers to surround my house. After searching me and the house and not finding a single piece of evidence to support the charge, the contingent took me with them to headquarters where they reported that the charge was false. When the commanding officer questioned those who had made the accusation, they did not want to tell where they had received the information; but further questioning revealed that the priest had told them to do that. Then the commanding officer, being an honorable man, charged the men never to molest me again; and after<sup>1</sup> hearing a good witness concerning the Kingdom, lie ordered the priest to leave town, never to return.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the greatest events of the year was the organizing of the district and circuit assemblies. Because of the large and scattered territory and the many other obstacles that the publishers in Mexico have to face, assemblies have never been held here as in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At one of the assemblies an Indian brother, dressed in his native costume, related an interesting experience. In his broken Spanish he explained how he had learned the truth and how Jehovah, our God, is now fulfilling his promise of gathering a people from all nations, tribes, peoples and tongues. He told how he had stood alone against his whole tribe when they tried to run him out of their village because he had become a witness. Now, after hard work, they can’t run him out, because there are about thirty others who meet with him regularly to study the Society’s publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Close to 7,000 have attended the 18 assemblies held up to date. More than half of the assemblies were held in towns where very little was known about Jehovah’s witnesses and, because of this, trouble was expected. However, to our surprise not a bit of trouble has been reported.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark189"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark190"></a>NETHERLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Waters of truth flow freely in the Netherlands, but not without a little opposition. The clergy of false religion have manifested themselves in that country as in any other. However, that does not discourage Jehovah’s witnesses, nor is it retarding them in saying to the prisoners, “Go forth!” There are 6,919 publishers singing a song of praise to Jehovah. The branch servant gives us some interesting points about the happenings in the land, which all will enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mention must be made of some of the features of service in the field which is the chief thing in our worship of Jehovah. A 20 per cent increase in the average number of publishers as well as 965 immersed during the service year is an indication that much work has been done in the field. In the last month of the service year a new peak of pioneers was reached, with 323 in the ranks. Pioneering is rather difficult in the Netherlands, as it is rather difficult to sustain oneself with part-time work because sueh is searee. Literature placements are not very high, especially in the deeply orthodox parts of the country. In the south of the Netherlands exists a law which gives the burgomaster the authority to decide who may and who may not obtain accommodations in a city and remain there while carrying out his vocation. So pioneer publishers, if they wish to do their missionary work in that part of the country, may do so if they can manage without a place to sleep and cook and eat I In exceptional cases, though, they manage to make some arrangements and there are a few pioneers in that section of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This year another feature has been added to the field in the Netherlands. Bethel brothers were assigned to various companies to deliver service and public talks, and the brothers in the companies appreciated this provision of the Lord’s organization very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Netherlands in general has excellent concepts of freedom of worship and the press, and Jehovah’s witnesses take good advantage of these, but this fact does not preclude the necessity of having to defend these rights in the courts of the land. Charges made against Jehovah’s witnesses are always of a petty nature, involving, as a rule, the distribution of handbills on the streets of the cities or walking through the streets with placards. This comes about as a result of the system of legislation they have in the country. The local burgomaster (mayor) has the authority to pass certain civil laws that deal with life in the municipality over which he has jurisdiction. It is usually the case that the zealous activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in a community causes “pain” to the religious “shepherds”, who, in turn, apply the thumbscrews to some chicken-hearted burgomaster, who, in turn, either contorts or concocts an ordinance which means for our brothers time-wasting, irritating inconveniences. It then becomes necessary to go to higher authorities and have this smudge erased and the little dictator spanked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the city of Eindhoven in Catholic Noord-Brabant it was a lawless deed to pass out handbills on the city’s streets until the supreme court ordered the injunction against Jehovah’s witnesses scrapped. We rejoice and thank Jehovah that we here in the Netherlands are indeed in a more favorable position than many of our brothers world-wide who may not be as successful in defending their God-given rights in this manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A case involving placard work held the attention of the brothers for over a year. It goes back to a circuit assembly held early in 1950. It was the city of Arnhem. That assembly caused no small stir in the city; Jehovah’s witnesses were put out of their hall and several were arrested while doing placard work. In the latter part of May 1951, Jehovah’s witnesses presented their case before the supreme court. Counsel challenged the application of this ordinance to Jehovah’s witnesses since it was contrary to Article 7 of the Constitution. Article 7 reads: “Nobody needs previous permission to publicize thoughts or opinions, except that wherefore one is liable according to the law.” Counsel pleaded for dismissal of the charges. The supreme court agreed, and rebuked the local officials for going a bit too far in their application of the law to the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The high point of expectation for the service year was the proposed visit of the president, along with other close coworkers, which visit was scheduled for August 17-22, during which time the national convention would be held. It was also known that the brothers from the Flemish section of Belgium would attend. Timely arrangements were made for the renting of the hall, a new building, and for setting up our own cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the spring of the year arrangements were made to launch the rooming work, a new work for the Netherlands. Bombed-out Rotterdam did not offer very promising prospects, so arrangements were made to house several thousands in tents put up for that purpose. A meeting was organized in Rotterdam in June to inaugurate this new work and it was taken up with the greatest enthusiasm. Any doubts of possibility to fill all the requests soon vanished as the work got under way. Many rooms were obtained, many for a very low rate and very many free. This work opened up the opportunity to live with these hospitable people and share with them our knowledge and understanding about the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A sister related her experience of how she called at a home and succeeded in getting room for two persons and was invited in to see the room as well as fill in the form. Her report concludes: “The people were very friendly and everything looked very neat. While I was filling in the form various persons came in for a visit. The lady of the house told them why I had come. These visitors were sisters as well as married daughters of the lady. Each one encouraged the other to take these people into their homes as guests for the convention days and all without exception said, ‘Yes.’ At this one place I got accommodations for 19 persons!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The convention itself is an event to be remembered. The brothers from the Netherlands enjoyed the fellowship of their brothers from Belgium, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, England, Canada and the United States. The talks delivered by Brother Knorr and the others from the United States and Canada were most upbuilding. It was truly a “Clean Worship” assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brother Knorr made it known that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life&quot;</span><span class="font6"> was now being set and very soon would be available to the brothers in the Netherlands. That was not all. The brothers in the Netherlands had missed something else for years now, something that could be of great help In making their minds over as well as the minds of persons of good will. With the beginning of the new year </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font6">would appear once again In Hollandish. A thunderous applause pealed through the assembly hall resounding their joy and surprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And so ended a pleasant year of joyful service which swelled loud with the message: “Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark191"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark192"></a>NETHERLANDS WEST INDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In these little islands in the Caribbean Jehovah’s witnesses are having a joyful time preaching to the people concerning the Kingdom. These brothers, too, have the parable of Christ in mind where he said that some of the seed falls along the roadside and the birds come and eat it up. The branch servant says that the trouble in his territory is that the birds there are especially ravenous. These birds are not content with just eating the seed that falls by the wayside, but they remind one of crows that go about and pull up the corn after it has sprouted. But this has not been a discouragement to the witnesses; they keep on trying and the Lord has blessed them with a marvelous increase during the year. The branch report is very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The service year got off to a good start because of having four more Gilead graduates join us here, bringing the total up to eight in the two missionary homes. Then the number of general pioneers has grown from one at the beginning of the year to five at the present. Also the number of companies has increased from two to four. This general increase is partly due to the circuit servant activity which was recently inaugurated. When the circuit servant came along the weak and irregular publishers showed up at the Kingdom Hall to hear what he might have in the way of new experiences and advice. Then, once they came to the hall, they were given an opportunity to go in the service and enjoy some experiences of their own. It is hoped that the stimulus aroused will last until the next visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The largest increase took place on the island of Aruba, where another company was organized. It is worthy of mention that among many of the publishers accounting for this increase there are children who are doing commendable work, especially in the street magazine witnessing. One of their youngest publishers took part in a demonstration showing the right and wrong way to carry on the work. The Sunday after that she went out and placed her first two bound books. This little girl is coming along fine and when the daily text is read before going out in the service she has her comment written out and is ready when the brother in charge asks for comments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Also, in Aruba two other children are becoming regular attendants and publishers even though their parents have never been to a meeting as far as is known. This seems to be because of the influence of the other children that take an active part in the witness work. The Gilead missionaries have found it profitable to take young publishers with them to home Bible studies, as their answers to the point oftentimes amaze the new people of good will and cause them to answer up when they were too shy to do so before. Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Jehovah has furnished praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The leading daily paper here has an editorial feature called “Short and Powerful” in which complaints of various natures are registered about conditions around town. One day this editorial stated that someone in town wanted a Bible and couldn’t find one to buy in Willemstad. The article went on to say that of all the items they had been called on to advertise for sale, no one had ever advertised Bibles. A businessman of good will read this piece and, knowing that we have a stock of Bibles at the Kingdom Hall, volunteered to pay for a nice ad stating that Bibles In Spanish, English and Dutch could be obtained at the Kingdom Hall. The officials of the newspaper were pleased and put in a big ad with the picture of a Bible, charging only half price for the ad, as It was for religious purposes. That was months ago and we are still realizing effects from it. Only yesterday a man stopped me on the street to know if we still had Dutch Bibles. Some people called up (the businessman put in his phone number). Many came to the Kingdom Hall and others asked about Bibles when they met us. Since the ad was placed, many Dutch Bibles have been placed, with more in Spanish and English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Recently a priest called at a home where a publisher is conducting a home Bible study. The priest took the lady’s Bible and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font6"> book and left with them in spite of her protests. She told the priest that that was a good book and she was learning about Christ and his kingdom from it. The priest told her he would teach her about Christ, so the lady said, “Teach me, then.” The priest said, “Well, when Christ grew up he learned the carpenter's trade and the first thing he made was his own cross,” etc. The lady wasn’t impressed with such teaching, so she bought another book and continued her study with the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the biggest and most pleasant surprises of the year is the way the work has increased among the natives here in Curacao. For the first six months of the year we were averaging about 50 in attendance at the English meetings on Sunday night, while we were averaging about thirty at the Papiamento meetings on Monday night, but all of a sudden the attendance at the Papiamento meeting jumped up to 75 a night. We really didn’t expect to see the attendance at the Papiamento meeting pass that of the English meeting so soon, but it has been ahead for some time now. The native brothers are so enthusiastic it gives one a good feeling to be in their midst. Their zeal is catching. At the last immersion service we held the majority of the candidates were natives, which is the first time that such has been the case.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark193"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark194"></a>NEWFOUNDLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">To a large extent the inhabitants of Newfoundland live in tiny quaint villages that spot the coastline. Sometimes they are separated by miles and miles of mountains, forests, lakes and bogland. It is difficult to get from place to place. Roads are few and travel by land from settlement to settlement is impossible. The rough Atlantic ocean provides the only means of surface travel and sometimes this body of water is so stormy that a person may be stranded in one of these small settlements for a whole month. In that time he keeps on preaching. But into every nook and corner of the world the good message goes forth and Jehovah’s witnesses say to the prisoners, “Praise Jah, you people.” The branch servant gives some high lights on what has happened in Newfoundland during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During this service year we received letters from goodwill persons living in isolated villages. We knew if these could be visited and strengthened that reaching our goal would be possible. But how to reach all these persons was the problem. The circuit servant answered this for us by purchasing a small airplane. He flies into a settlement, taxis up to the shore and, standing on the nose of the pontoon, delivers a Bible talk to the inhabitants. Every man, woman and child in the village Is on the beach by the time the airplane stops. In one village 270 persons attended a talk the circuit servant gave, and the lone publisher there has since reported that she has an organized Bible study group there and the people keep on asking her: “When is that flying preacher coming back?” The company publishers have done their part in contacting these isolated persons too, by writing letters and sending literature to them. As a result six new companies were organized during the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tlie missionary boat “Hope” has been inactive this summer due to engine failure. Two missionaries and a general pioneer used it as their headquarters and continued their visits in the district as usual. This was done in a small 12-foot boat driven by a small outboard motor. The opposers, who in times past referred to the missionaries as parasites, sailing around in such a fine comfortable boat as the “Hope”, had their tongues stilled as they saw this tiny boat, a week’s supply of provisions, tent, bedding and three men aboard punch its way through the waves. Many times the boat was hid from view due to the high waves surrounding it. Their determination and zeal were noticed by some good people there and one company was organized, with prospects of organizing four more this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In one of these settlements in Labrador almost the total population grouped together at the doorstep of one of the residents. Yes, they had seen the circuit servant and the clergyman together and expected an interesting discussion, so they came to hear it. The clergyman had planned to have a christening service that evening and was calling on the homes of the people lining up a group of infants for the service. This afforded an excellent opportunity to show up true and false religion, so the circuit servant asked him to show the people from the Bible that infants should be baptized or christened. It was found out that he didn’t as much as have a Bible with him; so the circuit servant offered him one, which was refused. When the clergyman was asked how old Jesus was when he was baptized lie said: “Nobody knows that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After being shamed he attempted to make a hasty departure, but every avenue was blocked by his parishioners and he was told by one to remain where he was. He objected because the christening service was to commence shortly. To this the reply came: “We’ll get more out of this than out of the christening service.” One young lady told him that her children were not going to be christened until he could show her in the Bible that it should be done. He went into another house after the discussion ended and exclaimed : “Boy, am I vexed today!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We were thankful for the nine new missionaries who were sent here during the service year. Jehovah’s witnesses in Newfoundland want you to know that we are 100 per cent for the Theocracy and will support in this service year any arrangements for its expansion, and that we truly love our brothers world-wide, praying that the reigning King will richly bless them with continued increases in their respective lands.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark195"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark196"></a>NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">No matter where you go, you meet people and to these you can talk the message of the Kingdom. You do not have to go far; you can preach right around your own home, do the work in little villages or even talk to the minister when he calls at your home. Jehovah’s witnesses in New Zealand are talking, and because of their earnest efforts we find that they have had a 22 per cent increase during the year and have now reached a new peak of 1,638. Their increase in peak number of publishers over their previous peak was 35 per cent. The work in New Zealand is moving along very steadily and the brothers are having many very interesting experiences. The branch servant reports some of these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The high point of the year was the visit of Brothers Knorr and Henschel and their attendance at the central convention in Wellington. In these remote lands we feel the need of sueh visits and only wish they could be more frequent. Besides giving us a lift spiritually, we are pleased to become more acquainted with our brothers from headquarters. We all benefit from their example of devotion to the Theocracy, and we feel how real Is the close unity existing in the organization world-wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Wellington convention was made especially delightful by the sound instruction and counsel from Brothers Knorr and Henschel. Our pleasure in the points made is enhanced as we fix them more firmly in mind, now that we may study them in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font6"> Certainly many persons of good will were started In the way of righteousness as a result of the Wellington convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A pioneer tells of a Bible study whose Catholic neighbor was much disturbed because the teachings of the convent school were frightening her small daughter. Information that such fear-provoking things were not found in the Bible caused her to think; so, two days later, she told her neighbor that she would like to know what is in the Bible, but did not own a copy. A Bible and the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font6">were loaned her, along with an invitation to attend the Bible study, which she gladly accepted. Thrilled with what she found in the Bible she must have a study in her own home, and this was soon arranged. Result: A child changes from convent to public school; a visit from the priest to find out why, and his quick retreat after being convinced of the futility of his pleas. Another captive has found sanctuary in the theocratic organization! Now both she and her husband are progressing well and publishing the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A sister relates: “Returning home from a Bible study I found a priest waiting at my door. Noting my Bible he soon learned I had been studying it. Then taking </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God }le True’</span><span class="font6"> from my hand he asked: ‘Isn’t this Jehovah’s witnesses?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘But aren’t you a Catholic?’ ‘I was.’ I expected an outburst of anger, but after turning over the pages of the book he asked, ‘Why are you studying?’ I replied, ‘The Bible is the only place where I can find the truth.’ Priest: ‘The Bible is not for everyone to interpret. The mother church has preserved it as was her right.’ I said, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘God</span><span class="font6"> has preserved the Bible for everyone to search and understand. As for the claim that the Catholic Church has preserved it, why did she oppose and persecute the men who translated it from the dead Latin into the living tongue of the common people?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The priest then switched to the love of God. He believed that God’s love for us far excels parental love, but when shown that, unlike the hell-fire god, parents do not torture their children, he offered the lame excuse, ‘That is the mystery of sin.’ ‘But,’ I said, ‘we are exhorted to study the Bible. Why study if it is full of mysteries? Jehovah’s witnesses study it diligently, comparing originals and the best translations and get at the truth.’ Priest: ‘They have nothing else to do. I have my parish, sick-calls and sermons to prepare.’ Then he quoted the rich man and Lazarus and was soon shown the absurdity of a literal interpretation of the parable. In turn were discussed the Kingdom and the signs that it is here, baptism of children, the soul and the responsibility of parents to study so they can teach their children the Bible. The priest said he noted I had been studying the Bible, said he had enjoyed the talk, shook hands and left. I was greatly encouraged and overjoyed to think that I could successfully stand up to a parish priest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Probably for the first time a combined Catholic service and Jehovah’s witness meeting was held when a circuit servant was invited to speak in a Maori meetinghouse. A Maori announced time to start and that the circuit servant would give the sermon. Not knowing their procedure, the circuit servant inquired of the leader, whereupon that worthy dropped on one knee and began chanting a prayer in Maori, the others joining in now and then and making the sign of the cross. Phew! What had we struck? But it lasted only five minutes, after which the circuit servant was motioned to proceed. With Bible in hand he talked for an hour on the importance of pure worship and how Satan has introduced so much false worship, with ritual, ceremony and vain repetition. He was followed with rapt attention. Questions were invited at the conclusion. But first the leader chants the repetitious prayer with noticeably diminished enthusiasm. Then for an hour many Catholic doctrines were examined in the light of Scripture. After an interval for refreshments the discussion continued until midnight, in all, nearly four hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We look forward to the year 1052 with expectation of wider expansion and increasing blessings in the Kingdom service. Our aim is to improve our back-calls, home Bible studies and public meetings, as some of the means to keep up the expansion. With the many new ones continually joining the ranks of the publishers we hope to keep moving forward with youthful zeal and enthusiasm right on to the completion of the work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark197"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>NICARAGUA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">While there has been a decrease in the average number of publishers in Nicaragua, still Jehovah’s witnesses are proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom to those who have an ear to hear. They know that they must be “shining as illuminators in the world, keeping a tight grip on the word of life”. The Society has been trying for some time to get missionaries into this country, but certain restrictions w<sup>r</sup>ere advanced to refuse such entry. Recently, however, the government approved the entry of a few more. We hope to send more in there to help stimulate the work. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences had by the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Do what they will the clergy cannot keep their flock from hearing, and hearing builds faith. The light of the “sword of the spirit” is cutting holes in the darkness caused by false religion’s teachings, and no amount of propaganda or pressure brought to bear on individuals from their employers or from the pulpit can keep them from seeing it. One man, who had left his small home town several years ago, found the truth and was determined to return and tell it to his family and friends. He worked hard and convinced a few that what he was telling them was the truth, even though the priest railed at him daily. He arranged for a public meeting and invited other brothers to help him, and for two days, amid derision from the priest and jeers from most of the people, they worked from door to door. It tested the new ones severely, but the meeting went on as scheduled. The priest’s campaign of fear failed, and the people knew it. Eighty-five of them attended the meeting, and today there is a company organized there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many house owners have been brought into close contact with the truth during the circuit assemblies, especially those who rent their buildings to the brothers for the assembly meetings. The Catholic Church has threatened with excommunication anyone who rents a building to us, because they know for what purpose we will use it. Recently the circuit servant visited a Catholic woman to arrange the rental of her house for an assembly. She expressed some fear that it would mean trouble for her if she rented it, but at last made a decision to do it. As soon as assembly advertising started she was deluged with threats from her neighbors, and the priest had plenty to say each day at the church, reviling her publicly for her action. But, to the surprise of all, including the priest, she stood her ground, and to stop people from bothering her told one of them that she intended to sell the house to Jehovah’s witnesses, and that then they would have meetings there continually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The public meeting was very well attended and real interest was manifested in the subject announced. After the meeting, in his closing announcements, the chairman mentioned that we appreciated the use of the house and thanked the owner publicly. The next day when the company servant called on her, she said, “Can you imagine it I Last night Jehovah’s witnesses were asking God’s blessing for me in my house, and yesterday in the pulpit at San Antonio the priest was cursing me because I rented the house to you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So the light is “shining more and more” as we approach the perfect day. Newly interested persons never fail to appear at the ever-increasing public lectures. In one small isolated town the circuit servant and one other brother arrived late in the afternoon with only two hours to advertise a lecture scheduled for the evening in a private home. Two persons were present to hear the introduction of the talk, but soon the room had become too small to hold newcomers and the speaker moved to the patio. That too proved to be too small and the people spilled over into the street. At the conclusion, 125 were there. I-aght will continue to shine in Nicaragua through Jehovah’s ministers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark199"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark200"></a>NIGERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Society has a branch office in Lagos and from this point the work is taken care of in Nigeria, Cameroun, Dahomey, Fernando Po and Togo. There are a number of obstacles in this territory that hinder the rapid preaching of the truth, but despite these obstacles excellent gains have been made in gathering the “other sheep”. Seed has been planted, watered well and Jehovah has given the increase. Today we find many of the prisoners going forth preaching the good news of the Kingdom. The readers of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font7"> will be interested in the problems that must be met by Jehovah’s witnesses in Africa. They love life and want to enjoy it to the full in the new world. The branch servant gives us the following report on the different countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The circuit arrangement, which is now well organized, has been a powerful factor in training the publishers in theocratic organization and in enthusing them for the work ahead, and the circuit assemblies have been high points for all the publishers. The Gilead district servants have had some wonderful experiences and their reports are very interesting. At times these brothers travel by airplane, ear, truck, canoe, bicycle, and, ofttimes like Jesus, on foot. Their assignments take them off the beaten track into villages deep in the dense rain forests, known here as the bush, where time has stood still for hundreds of years and where, often, pagan juju worship holds sway with its secret societies which exercise almost unlimited power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To one of these villages came the district servant for an assembly. He says: “Our arrival at Umutu was one not easily forgotten. As soon as we got out of the truck word went round the town that the European had arrived. Many had heard that one was coming but dismissed the story as an impossible rumor. What made it more impossible to them was the report that I had come by airplane. As we walked to my place of lodging scores of people joined us. Soon half the village was following and eventually almost all the Inhabitants had gathered to see the white man and his place of accommodation—a humble African home. Friday evening many of the village people were on hand and stayed throughout the whole session, so that out of an attendance of 250 over 100 were strangers. They enjoyed the service meeting as much as the brothers and were amazed to see how well the brothers get along together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“There was much discussion as to whether I would visit their homes. On Saturday morning about 50 men, women, and children followed me around to record with their eyes the unbelievable sight of a white man preaching the gospel in their homes through an interpreter. Could they have spoken English they surely would have said, ‘Now we’ve seen everything!’ On Sunday, in spite of rain, 21 were immersed and 794 gave rapt attention to the public talk. Two weeks later I heard that six of the villagers had burned or ‘drowned’ their jujus and are now Kingdom publishers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Illiteracy, which is a great hindrance in some parts, is being fought by free reading classes in English and vernacular tongues. Many are learning to read and are taking a fuller part in all features of the service. Public meetings are very popular. At one meeting the only advertising done was by the advertising servant who lived up to his name by going round the streets at five o’clock In the morning with a trumpet. It was evidently effective, as over 1,000 attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Six district assemblies were held, with the splendid total attendance of 17,000. At the Onitsha assembly there were 8,000, which is the highest we have ever had in Nigeria. It was here that the Yankee Stadium English releases were made available amid scenes of tremendous enthusiasm. About the same time we received </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font6"> in Yoruba and Ibo, and they have done much toward increasing our home Bible studies, still one of our weakest features.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the Rivers province of the Niger delta an inter-tribal war has been raging for several years and the only safe means of travel was by government motor launch with a machine gun mounted in the bow. During a recent lull in the fighting a pioneer made a trip through the labyrinth of creeks and streams and found much interest. The almost complete isolation of the area can be judged from the question put by one man who wanted to know if the ban on our work (lifted five years ago) was still in force. From this it is clear that much work remains to be done in the many truly isolated areas of this land before the “sheep” are all found, and much of the work will undoubtedly rest on the shoulders of these faithful pioneers. May Jehovah send more of these ‘‘workers into his harvest”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark202"></a>CAMEROUN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In spite of the opposition the brothers enjoy most of the privileges granted to their brothers in more fortunate lands. They can meet together for study and can engage in field service with care, and in some parts they even hold public meetings. In recent months the postal authorities have been seizing subscribers’ copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> but a few weeks ago the brothers started to receive them once more. It is not considered wise to arrange assemblies in Cameroun, but the brothers find little difficulty in crossing the border to attend circuit and district assemblies in their own tongue in British Cameroons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As yet, most of the preaching is done near the coast, but we get reports of people visiting the coastal towns, hearing the truth, and returning with it in their hearts to their towns in the interior. Many of them cannot read, but they know the truth when they hear it and they tell their friends what they have heard. There must be many hundreds witnessing as best they can whom we cannot as yet reach to organize into companies. One pioneer hearing of such interest traveled far and spent a month preaching. At the end of that time he gave a talk on baptism, after which 30 were baptized and organized for service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark203"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark204"></a>DAHOMEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in this French colony has made steady progress during the year. The brothers are able to work fairly freely in most parts and, apart from sporadic priest-inspired outbursts, the authorities do not seem inclined to take action against them. Since many of the population speak Yoruba, they come over into Nigeria to attend circuit assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few months ago a Catholic publication made a bitter attack upon Jehovah’s witnesses there but it has done the work no harm, rather to the contrary. The plain truth is that the Africans in Dahomey know that the Catholic religion is a racket and is largely responsible for the oppressive conditions there and they are just fed up with it. Two months ago the brothers tried to hold a public meeting and the priest went to the chief and demanded that he run them out of town. Imagine his surprise when the chief retorted, “When you came to this town we did not run you out, but we gave you land and helped to build your church. Why should you try to run Christians out of town?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No! If they have to go, you must go too.” Of course the priest did not go; and neither did the brothers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark205"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark206"></a>FERNANDO PO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Early in September the authorities on this little Spanish-ruled island in the Gulf of Guinea took swift action against the few brothers there. One night they were all arrested and their literature seized. After spending a month in jail all of them, being from Nigeria or Cameroun, were deported. From that time we have heard nothing. It is reported that the natives are regularly paraded and made to ‘hell’ Franco. We are watchful for an opportunity for reopening the work there, but must wait upon Jehovah to open the way.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark207"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark208"></a>TOGO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">This is another land almost completely dominated by the influence of the Catholic Church. A little work was done last year, but following the visit of a Gilead brother from the Society’s office in Lagos in March the preaching work has made good progress. A special pioneer was appointed and now there are two companies operating in Lome and Tsevie. A good quantity of literature was taken in and is having a wide distribution among the oppressed people, who are not permitted to read anything not approved by the Catholic Church. In such circumstances the seed of Kingdom preaching often falls on good soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is now an average of 28 publishers in the field and the home Bible studies are flourishing. In some places it has been possible to obtain permits to hold public meetings from liberal-minded police officials who know that our work is in the best interests of the people, and at one such meeting there were 1,200 people present. The Catholic priest had announced that to support this meeting would be counted as a sin. But, alas! He then became a “sinner” himself by attending the meeting, so it is not surprising that many of his flock followed him into “sin”. The truth is now getting started in several towns, and it is hoped that in due time more companies can be organized to care for the many “sheep” we know are there.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark209"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark210"></a>NORTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It is simply amazing to see the things that are happening in Northern Rhodesia. Everyone there seems to want to know the truth and is anxious to be a publisher. Can you imagine a country with 19,173 publishers as a peak having 59,216 attending Memorial? The people in Northern Rhodesia just want to be with Jehovah’s witnesses. Our big task there, as reported before, is the educational problem and that of teaching them the truth first. The people love to be with the Lord’s servants. However, in the countries round about, such as the Belgian Congo, Kenya, Tanganyika Territory and Uganda, the story is quite different. A call comes forth from these lands to send in more workers. Gradually the Word of the Lord is creeping and sometimes running all over the land of Africa. We are very glad to publish parts of the branch servant’s report submitted at the close of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">District assemblies held in October and November set the pace. Six assemblies were scheduled for the African companies and one for the Europeans. Plans were made to make these assemblies the biggest ever, and so they proved to be. The total attendance at all the assemblies, which in program duplicated the New York international assembly, was 28,001.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Came the Memorial celebration and we wondered what the attendance would be, in view of the district assembly figures. The final total of 59,216 amazed us all and convinced us of the work that is yet to be done to help and educate these many associates to come to a knowledge of the truth so that they too can join in the song of praise to Jehovah. The foremost problem is finding capable brothers in the African companies in the “bush” to care for the groups of interested persons and give them sound training in Christian principles and conduct and lead them away from old world practices into new world living. Nevertheless, as a result of these increases, many new companies have been enrolled and large companies split into units. One company with four units now reports more than 750 publishers each month. Another, 900 publishers in several units.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Several things have contributed to this increase. Where a real effort has been made to overcome illiteracy this has done much to build up the company. Over the past few years some companies have raised the percentage of literacy among the publishers from as low as 10 per cent to over 90 per cent, and this has been reflected in a healthy increase in company activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A number of pioneers have been enrolled during the year and they have had many experiences. Noticing the constant activity of one of the pioneers in one of the African townships a householder asked him over to inquire what he was doing. The pioneer briefly explained and arranged to call back later the same day to continue the discussion. When he returned he found ten people seated waiting for him, four of them being schoolteachers. As the discussion progressed others grouped around until in the end more than 60 were listening in. Several turned over their names to the pioneer so that he could call on them at their homes. The ten persons with whom the discussion was conducted all now attend the company meetings. Another pioneer witnessed to a Seventh-Day Adventist. When the subject of Christ’s second presence came up and the publisher said that Christ was now present the Adventist called the witness mad and laughingly ridiculed the publishers to the neighbors. The pioneer, unruffled, asked the householder if he would be prepared to sit down and listen to the Bible proof on the matter. A time was fixed for that same afternoon. Said the Adventist when the publisher came to keep the appointment, “I thought you would not come.” Now he no longer scoffs at the truth. For now after a home Bible study he is himself an active publisher and was immersed at one of this year’s circuit assemblies. No doubt he is himself now looked on as mad I</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among the Europeans the work goes on apace. Another company was enrolled at the year’s end, making three organized companies in addition to isolated groups. Much of the prejudice due to ignorance of our work which existed in the minds of the Euro]&gt;ean population has been broken down, and for our last circuit assembly the hall we used for Sunday was provided free of charge. The Gilead missionaries have enjoyed a rich blessing on their ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the end of the year the 19,000 mark was topped in publishers. We appreciate that there is a big work to be done in training and educating these many publishers and the thousands of meeting attenders in new world living. We seek Jehovah’s help as we go forward with this life-giving work, rejoicing in being associated with you and our fellow praisers throughout the world in the work of restoring the clean and true worship of the only true God, Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark211"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark212"></a>BELGIAN CONGO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Central Africa has an “iron curtain” also! So far as Jehovah’s witnesses are concerned it hangs around the borders of the Belgian Congo. The ban on the witness work in this predominantly Roman Catholic country continues without letup. Nevertheless, because this is the time when deeds of faith in Jehovah’s name are being accomplished as never before it is inevitable that news of these should penetrate tlie “curtain” and leak out, and this has been so in 1951.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Isolated reports filtering through from the country tell of deportation, imprisonments, beatings and other privations being suffered by the African publishers. In many parts it seems there has been an increase in the venom unleashed against the witnesses. Natives of the country are banished to work camps if caught witnessing or even possessing Watchtower literature. Even possessing the Bible is taken as a mark that the holder is one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and associates of the orthodox Protestant missions have sometimes been mistaken for Jehovah’s witnesses and had a difficult time proving their “innocence”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Most of this report was gathered from a few publishers who were able to get over the border to attend a circuit assembly in Northern Rhodesia. It is estimated that these brothers from the Congo represented groups totaling about 250 associates. However, they were able to give information only about their respective groups, as each group is not known to the other. The homes of these brothers are continually watched and often searched. In the words of one brother reporting this: “They [the Belgian Congo police] don’t sleep because of us, but move up and down looking for nothing but Jehovah’s witnesses. Now it is more serious than before.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In spite of these devilish attempts to destroy the true religion all reports from the Belgian Congo speak of increase in the number associating around the Word of life and seeking Jehovah’s people. An isolated report from 30 publishers for August reached this office witli 1 Thessalonians 5: 25, .VW, written as a footnote: “Brothers, continue in prayer for us.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark213"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark214"></a>KENYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Tlie call from Kenya ‘to come over and help us’ has been no less urgent than that to the apostle Paul from Macedonia. Two sisters who emigrated from England to Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, have courageously carried on the preaching work in 1951, seeking out people of good will from house to house and making back-calls and conducting home Bible studies. Yet another sister has immigrated to Nairobi with her family and she has already shown her desire to assist in seeking out the “other sheep” who may have been scattered to Kenya. A sister from Holland has taken up residence in the seaport town of Mombasa during the service year and has contacted this office with a view to sharing in the ministry. So, some help has gone to Kenya.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The real need, of course, is for full-time missionaries In these towns and cities, but since attempts made to get missionaries into Kenya were discouraged by the authorities in 1949, no other avenue has opened to full-time ministers in Kenya. However, arrangements are under way for a visiting Gilead graduate to spend some time with these isolated publishers and his visit will no doubt do much to encourage the sisters and help them to get organized for an even greater share in the preaching work during 1952.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So Kenya sends out the call! Perhaps even more immigrants will respond in the coming service year, and as a result of more preaching effort Kenya will enjoy fruits of the great ingathering to Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark215"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark216"></a>TANGANYIKA TERRITORY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">We are happy to be able to report an increase in Tanganyika for the first time since 1947—the encouraging increase of 84 per cent in the average number of publishers. An example of this increase was seen in one company which has increased during the year from 24 to over 60 publishers, with meeting attendances of 200 or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In an effort to further expand the Kingdom work, application was again made for the entry of Gilead graduates into the country, but to no avail. However, as the year closes, a Gilead brother is on his way to the capital, Dar es Salaam, to see what a personal interview may accomplish. Certainly it needs someone in the territory to supervise the Kingdom work and be on the spot to handle any problems that may arise. For instance, from one section of the territory comes a report of a district commissioner issuing a ban on the preaching activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in his area. This he stated at a meeting to which the chief and the company servant were summoned. When asked by the company servant what Jehovah’s witnesses had done wrong he could not point to any unlawful aet, admitting that if any had been committed he would have had them arrested. Apparently he just didn’t like Jehovah’s witnesses. In a letter to the branch office lie said, “I have not attempted to restrict in any way the rights of worship of your congregation, provided that they exercise them peacefully, in the manner practiced by other denominations.” Apparently what worries him is the public preaching activity of the witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year the circuit servant made the long journey into the interior of the country and contacted some scattered groups of interest, organizing a new company in one locality. During the long journey by rail he was able to witness to his fellow travelers, at times using one of them to act as an interpreter, as the dialects were unfamiliar to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">him. He reports encouraging increase in the companies and that the brothers, who in many cases are very primitive, are trying hard to conform to the theocratic way of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We look forward to continued increase in Tanganyika. We hope that it will be possible for the Gilead brother to get into the country and stay there so that the work can further increase and more of the other sheep in that land be reached and fed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark217"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark218"></a>UGANDA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The isolated group of Kingdom publishers in Uganda have been helped to appreciate that the “great crowd” of “other sheep” are coming from all “nations and tribes and peoples and tongues”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since a young man and his wife immigrated to Uganda a little over a year ago and began their ministry career in that country, they have enjoyed Jehovah’s rich blessing. They met a Greek family who responded to their preaching efforts and who have since supplied another regular publisher for Uganda. Then an Italian family accepted the good news of God’s kingdom, and there are good prospects for their contacting people of good will among some 200 Italian workmen who are working in the neighborhood on dam construction. Yet another thrilling experience in the witness work is probably best told In the brother’s own words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Previously we had met with stony looks and the usual reply, ‘I am not interested,’ or ‘I am quite satisfied with my church, thank you,’ and I must admit we were getting a bit downhearted. But on this Friday the Lord was surely guiding us. At a particular house we came across the language difficulty, as the lady was a Hollander. When invited inside we tried to converse, using our hands to make signs, and then we produced </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font6"> Oh, how wonderful it was to see the woman’s face light up at the sight of it! All of a sudden all barriers disappeared and somehow we could communicate with each other. We gathered from the woman that she had been studying the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font6"> with Jehovah’s witnesses in Rotterdam, Holland, and that she was now starved for food. We left with a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and then she directed us to her sister who also subscribed. We came home uplifted In heart and singing the praises of Jehovah. It was wonderful to behold how Jehovah knows those who belong to him and how he feeds his people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nevertheless, Uganda joins with Kenya in the call for more laborers in the harvest field.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark219"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark220"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers in Norway have had good success in arranging their circuit assemblies in different towns and cities throughout their territory. They have found that this has opened up new fields and has aroused the interest of many people. A grand witness has been given in this country during the past twelve months. The average increase has been 29 per cent. They reached a new peak of 2,066 publishers. But there is still a lot of work to be done in Norway as they say to the prisoners, “Go forth!” Some of the experiences given in the report by the branch servant are very interesting and show what can be done in other countries when isolated territories are worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those engaged in Jehovah's witness work have many experiences. Some can be a bit disheartening for a time, while others are of a joyful nature for the results they bring. One pioneer told the following: To his knock he received the sound of rattling kettles. The same reply was received to his second knock. So following the custom of this neighborhood he entered the door calling his “Hello”. But still only the rattle of kettles. The old man leaning over the stove was very hard of hearing, so the pioneer, calling as he approached, did not gain his attention until he reached his side and talked loudly into his ear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The old man, a former sailor, had heard of the truth shortly after the first world war but since then had not come in contact with it. He had liked what he had read and showed a real interest in the Kingdom message being now shouted into his ear. After the pioneer had shouted for about an hour his voice began to break and he had to give up for the time. Several pieces of literature were placed and promise was made to return later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few days later a lady approached a magazine publisher on the street, asking how she could get in contact with the young man who had called on her neighbor living below her in the same house. The pioneer was told of the desire of the lady to see him. When calling on her he was told that she had heard him talking to the old man. Ilis voice had carried through the floor to her listening on the second floor. She had liked what she had heard and wished to learn more about Jehovah’s kingdom. Though it may cost us an effort to give the witness we never know to what extent it is being received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another circuit servant wrote that he had just visited the isolated good-will persons in Skjerjehamn. He found four fully for the truth and that these had for some time been witnessing to their neighbors, but had never reported. How to report, obtain literature and how to go about in the service was explained to them. It seems that many of these isolated persons of good will need only a little encouragement and organizing to become regular publishers. Surely it is well worth the time and effort to help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Yesterday we had a public talk on Skrova, an island lying about an hour’s motorboat ride from mainland,” writes one of the circuit servants. He and four other publishers left for the island early in the morning to witness to its 500 inhabitants and invite them to the public talk. Handbills and literature were placed and placards were set up, inviting the people to come to the talk to be held at 8 p.m. Many promised to come but when eight o’clock came around it did not look very promising. So they waited twenty minutes before starting. There were then quite a number of persons in the hall, and more came after the talk had started. The attendance was 80 persons who listened with good interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have not had much interference in our service work this year. In Tdnsberg five of the brothers were arrested while engaging in the street work. They were charged with selling without a police permit. The case came before the city court where the judge gave us the victory. He based his decision on the victory the supreme court had given us in the street-witnessing case we had up last year. The police claimed the supreme court decision did not cover their police ordinance, as theirs stated that police permission must be had for selling newspapers on the streets. This the Oslo ordinance did not have in it. So the police appealed to the supreme court. However, the court would not grant a hearing. So again Jehovah has given us the victory. May we but honor Him faithfully for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One company arranged to have a public talk in a rural section of their territory. The talk was to be held on an outdoor picnic ground right out in the rurals. The publishers were scattered throughout the territory on foot and on bicycle, witnessing from farm to farm. Literature and handbills were placed. When the talk got under way, held by a brother from Bethel, there were 74 in attendance. It was interesting to see a farmer and his wife with their children come walking along the road headed for the picnic ground to hear the talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is also the joy of receiving new instruments to aiil us in our service work. This year we received the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom Hope, of All Mankind,</span><span class="font6"> the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font6"> and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazine in Norwegian. All of these are a blessing for giving a greater witness and a better witness to the honor of Jehovah’s name and the aid and comfort of those people of good will.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark221"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark222"></a>NYASALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">“Nothing stops these people,” say many in this country. The inhabitants of Nyasaland are amazed at what Jehovah’s witnesses do to push ahead with their work. They realize that God’s servants are happy and confident of success and they are not too worried about the difficult conditions under which they serve. They work hard and keep themselves in the right way of life instead of indulging in the practices of the people of this old system of things. Our brothers in Nyasaland are working to live in the new world, and people are able to see the difference between Jehovah’s witnesses and the others. The branch servant of Nyasaland gives us some high points on the year’s activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A small group of special pioneers began to work in May 1950 and did some fine work in new territory in various parts of the country. Two of the brothers, working in virgin territory, in a period of only two months formed two strong new companies consisting of over forty publishers, with many others learning of the truth and how to give it out to others. The two pioneers cannot properly care for the interest they contact; and there are still many villages as yet untouched but within working distance from where they are based. The big chief received them kindly when they came, and, once he understood more about their work, he gave them a partly built house in which to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another special pioneer has had similar experiences but under more difficult circumstances. He is situated in a part of the country where the mosquitoes come out in their hordes of an evening, making life most unpleasant. So, in order to hold home Bible studies with his interest, the pioneer builds a green-bush fire and sits in the acrid smoke that comes streaming out from it, and studies together with his friends. It is the only way of escaping the unwanted but persistent attentions of the pestiferous mosquito! And yet another special pioneer, serving in a waterless area where the women (who are the water carriers in this country) have to get up at 1 a.m. to fetch water from ten miles away, obtained liis water supplies by placing copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font6"> with certain individuals in return for two cents’ worth of water per copy, to be delivered daily for a period of fifteen days. He, too, has dozens of interested friends and has a new company to look after as well, with prospects of another’s being formed shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now let one of the general pioneers tell his story of expansion : “1 called on the chief to introduce myself and my work, left my name and address with him and obtained his permission to hold public meetings wdierever I wished within his area. My first public meeting was advertised and held with the co-operation of a half-dozen interested friends. Within three hours of house-to-house work a crowd of 150 were seated out under the trees ready to listen to the Bible discourse; and within a week five of the interested were quite decided in their minds that they wished to become regular publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We next called on the chief’s brother who holds the position of a village headman, and arranged for a public meeting to be held under the clump of mango trees at his door the next day. When we arrived there at the time agreed upon we found that he had already invited and gathered the people to the meeting place, about seventy in number. Following that meeting he has become so interested that every Tuesday he attends our book study, bringing with him each time twenty to thirty others. At the railway siding five others have become publishers and I have just received an invitation from a group of people living ten miles in the opposite direction to address them on Bible truths.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let me introduce you now to some of our brothers living the life of fishermen on one of the smaller lakes of the country: They earn their living by netting fish in their own home-made nets patiently made from the canvas of old automobile tires from which they make the cords for their nets. They cast their nets and get a good haul and bring it in to the wmiting crowd of purchasers. Before anyone does get any fish at all, the brothers first secure their nets, tell the waiting crowd to sit down and listen to a public talk! They do and then afterward the fish are sold to them; and as they are travelers from a radius of anywhere up to one hundred miles around, wherever they go they relate to others how they got their fish and of w’hat is said down at the lake shore by Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The lion story of the year comes from a pioneer in the north. He was cycling down the road on the way to a home Bible study, with his wife perched on the carrier behind him, when, lo, there was a lion ahead standing in the scrub bush at the side of the road watching their approach I When the brother caught sight of it he says that the only thing that he could think of doing to meet the situation was to ring the cycle bell I So down the road he went tinkling the bell and hoping that the beast would take the hint and obligingly melt away into the bush. It did! For when he next looked it was gone! He then thought that perhaps he was “seeing things”, but as his wife was able to assure him that the lion had really been there he gained confidence in his sanity and went on to a successful study !</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark223"></a>PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There are many problems to be overcome in Portuguese East Africa. Every effort is made by the government and particularly by the Catholic priests to keep Jehovah’s witnesses out of that land. However, the message does cross the border from time to time and a good witness is given. One Roman Catholic priest put it this way: “They gave me no peace in Nyasa-land and now they have followed me here to give me more trouble.” It is not that Jehovah’s witnesses are trying to give them trouble, they are just trying to give the people the truth. The truth has always given trouble to the Devil and to those representing false religion. The truth never disturbs those who have the true religion. A few excerpts are made from the branch servant’s report on Portuguese East Africa, which is under the Nyasaland branch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Well, interest continues to abound all along the border where Nyasaland Jehovah’s witnesses contact the good-will persons living in this territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The circuit servant, the two pioneers and the companyservant, who were seized lu the early part of November, 1948, never had any legal charge brought against them, nor any-hearing or opportunity to voice their protests at such arbitrary action. They are now away in Portuguese Angola working in one of the labor camps and bound over to remain there for a period of six years with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">perhaps</span><span class="font6"> the prospect of being returned home thereafter. They continued preaching the Word in their exile and have built up a company there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whatever the conditions may be, one thing is certain, no demon-controlled human power will ever stop the growth of the truth. Let the Roman Catholic priests cause their own followers to be beaten up (as they do) if they are found with the Society’s literature, yet they will not prevent the “other sheep” from answering the call to service! It is with interest that we watch the unfolding of this chapter of theocratic history in this part of the vineyard amidst a race of people not too ignorant nor too backward to accept and understand the precious life-giving truths of Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark224"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark225"></a>PAKISTAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Since Pakistan became a nation four years ago things have looked very dark for her. Political and social conditions have degenerated until the man in the street freely voices his dissatisfaction. For their new country they have sweat and fought and bled, but instead of getting the political ideals that were held before them they find corruption, filth, insecurity and fear. The people of this land need the truth as much as any other part of the world, and a very small band of Jehovah’s witnesses are trying to bring it to them. What will ultimately happen in these countries as far as the truth is concerned is impossible to predict. But we do have the words of the Lord that this gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world. Jehovah’s witnesses put forth a good effort and try to leach the hearts and minds of these people with the truth. The branch servant in Karachi gives us some interesting views of the people in Pakistan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The basic reason why conditions are different is the state religion, Islam. It affects the witness at every turn—house-to-house work, for instance. Because of the system of segregating women, called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">purdah</span><span class="font6"> (literally, “curtain”), only the men are contacted, and these only before work in the morning. Even then he is often absent, having gone to the “bazaar” for daily supplies. And in the evening he generally eats, dresses and goes out. So evening appointments are generally made for the Kingdom Hall rather than the home. Sometimes there will be three or four groups scattered over the hall, and one witness may have four or five hours of continuous appointments there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But most witnessing is done in the places of business. Here one is received warmly, seated and invited to drink tea. Business is suspended. It is expedient to drink the tea, even though it may be the twentieth cup, for to decline is to invite your contact to decline to show interest in your message. But there is a limit to what can be drunk, even in thirsty Pakistan! So while you sip, you talk, and business waits!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Moslems, who constitute almost all the population, are fanatical for their religion with a zeal born, generally, of ignorance. Partly because of blindness, partly from fear of the inevitable persecution that will follow from his fellow Moslems, none iias taken his stand for the truth so far. Even so, a number are now making a careful study of the Bible and are standing on the brink and contemplating the plunge, so to speak. These are genuine lovers of truth and righteousness, deeply moved by what they have learned and courageously continuing their studies in the face of much opposition. One of such, turned out of home, sleeps and has his studies in his workshop. One day one of these is going to make that plunge, and when he does so others will undoubtedly follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One witness had noticed a well-dressed person pass Inin on the street regularly each week for two years. One time he stopped and said to the witness: “I have observed you standing here for a long time and have never been able to pluck up courage to speak to you. I am really interested in your work and want you to come to my home and teach me the Bible.” An appointment was arranged, but before the witness could call the man had gone to some religious place and purchased a Bible and had begun to read it. Now a regular Bible study is held in the home of that government official.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another time a man called at the Kingdom Hall and approached one of the publishers with: “When I met you on the street the other day I argued against what you were saying, out of fear of any Moslems who might overhear, but I really believe that you people have the truth and I am eager to know more.” Another person approached a publisher on his corner and said: “For a long time I have been buying single copies of your magazine </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Atcake!</span><span class="font6"> I was wondering if there is any way I could subscribe for it and get it regularly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One gathers the impression that our little band of witnesses is being closely watched. Watched, not in suspicion, but from interest. They mark us as being different from what they thought was Christianity, Roman Catholicism. The Moslems’ belief in one Cod and their abhorrence of idol worship cause them to turn away from such. But when they find that we are as opposed to the trinity as they are and have no idols, no, not even a meteorite </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Haaba,</span><span class="font6"> they are induced to investigate further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, as though in answer to prayer, we have an advance copy of the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind? </span><span class="font6">with its chapter on Islam. To us it is an evidence that Jehovah is turning his attention to these pagan lands, to deliver those that sit in darkness and the shadow of death. When Jehovah begins to release prisoners, then no power can thwart him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PANAMA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Republic of Panama is that narrow strip of land that links the North and South American continents. Here, too, in this tropical climate there are many persons who are listening to the truth. During the past year splendid increases were made and a new all-time high of 664 publishers was reached. Some years back the witness work began in just the two principal cities, but now with more publishers it is possible to reach out into new territory, and good success is being realized. The branch servant gives us a report of what is going on.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark226"></a><span class="font6">Panama City today is packed with 123,000 people, while Colon, about 49 miles away and near the Atlantic entrance to the canal, has 44,000. For the past five years much of the witness work has been concentrated in these two cities and a few other coastal towns, resulting in the formation of both Spanish and English units in Panama City and Coldn. The Panama English unit has maintained an average of 99 publishers during the past service year and the Spanish unit 02, whereas the Colon English unit averaged 153 and the Spanish unit 33. Also encouraging is the fact that out of Panama's fifteen companies eight companies made increases of from 20 to 400 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With companies firmly established in these two large cities a great effort has been made in recent years to carry the good news of the Kingdom into the interior. The result of this effort has been the establishment of a congregation in David. With the hope of seeing more companies organized in the interior where three-fifths of Panama’s population live, three more missionary homes have been established. They are in Chitre, Aguadulce and Santiago, and three native specials are ■working in the interior town of La Chorrera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On Friday, Marell 23, Jehovah’s witnesses in Panama and the Canal Zone celebrated “the Lord’s evening meal” in the peace and quiet of their Kingdom Halls. Reports proved that 961 attended, giving an indication of greater expansion ahead. The following month showed how much the Panamanians appreciated “the Lord’s evening meal”, as they reached their 34 per cent increase and continued to maintain it during the month of May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The end of the service year was highlighted witli two district assemblies, one in Panama City and another in Colon. Both programs contained alternate Spanish and English talks. Stirring indeed were the presentations in harmony with the theme of clean worship. So effective were the talks, especially in Spanish, that one person of good will from the interior said, “When I get home I am going to straighten out my affairs, and get properly married so I can be counted as a publisher.” Others too, now realizing that the performance of marriage services does not entail a great banquet and clergy fees, are following a Scriptural course and soon find themselves respected married couples, living up to the name of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Having thus raised our voices contributing to the earthwide thundering sound of “Praise Jah” for 1951, and with the battle of Armageddon another year closer, we feel assured that there are many, many more who will yet call upon the name of Jehovah during the coming service year and be saved.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark227"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark228"></a>PARAGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This country is one of the two inland countries in South America. While this is one of the best-watered countries in the world, yet the true “water of life” is something the people need and are searching for. The missionaries and the publishers working with them are doing splendid work and from this we see some wonderful increases in the gathering together of the “other sheep”. Three assemblies played an important part in the work this year. And while there was opposition from the clergy at all three locations, still the assemblies were held and a wonderful witness was given. The branch report offers some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year three new companies were organized, making a total of 14, and we reached a peak of 43 per cent over the peak number of publishers for 1950. We were also able to have assemblies in the three principal cities of the country, Asuncion, Encarnacion, and Villarrica. These three assemblies resulted in a great witness and many good-will associates of the “Lazarus class” were comforted, but the “rich man class” was tormented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year two more Gilead missionaries were sent to Paraguay and they tell us of an experience they had a few days after they arrived. “We were returning from our territory late one afternoon about the time the sun was going down. We walked by the river port and noticed a large boat entering the port, and we walked on the dock to watch it. We had our book bags with us and in them some cans of corned beef that we had gotten for the missionary home. All was well until we started to leave. A Coast Guard officer called to us and asked us what we were doing. We could speak very little Spanish, so we were in a jam. To make matters worse we had that corned beef in our book bags. Thinking we were smugglers the officers took us to the Coast Guard station which was just across the street. In trying to explain where we got the eorned beef we pulled </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya, (Watchtower)</span><span class="font6"> out of our book bag. One of the officers immediately recognized the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya</span><span class="font6"> and said he knew one of our members. In a few minutes we had placed two books, two Bibles and six magazines. They put the corned beef back in our book bags and expressed approval of our work. So what started to be a dull evening turned out to be a joyous one in the service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of the many experiences we have had, I wish to report one of a Paraguayan brother. About six years ago, or about the time the Gilead missionaries came to Paraguay, a pioneer witnessed to two Paraguayans. One of the Paraguayans accepted the message as the truth and his friend liked the message also but soon thereafter moved to Argentina. The man that accepted the truth started to attend the meetings at the Kingdom Hall regularly, soon became a publisher, also enrolled in the theocratic ministry school, later becoming the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study conductor and one of our best public speakers. A few weeks ago his friend returned from Argentina, and it just happened that this brother was going to give a public talk the following Sunday. So he invited his friend to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It happened that it rained that Sunday and his friend did not come. Because of the rainy day, it was decided to give the same talk the next Sunday. This time his friend came and listened very attentively and when the talk was over lie went immediately to the speaker and told him the talk was very good. He said he had visited many churches and had listened to many religious talks but this was the first one he had ever heard that had sincerity. He asked for a subscription for the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">iDespertad! (Awake!)</span><span class="font6"> magazine, also took with him the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life” </span><span class="font6">in Spanish. After a few days he came to the brother and asked for a study so that he too might understand the Bible and the wonderful things he had heard in the talk. This and other experiences show that we are living in the time when people of good will are coming to us and asking to be taught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The 1951 service year has been a wonderful year of service and has brought many blessings from Jehovah. May the Lord continue to bless all of his servants in all parts of the earth wherever they may be.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark229"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark230"></a>PERU</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This is a very interesting country. Jehovah’s witnesses there are very happy this year because of so many “sheep” being gathered together. The average inciease for the year was 76 per cent, and they reached a new all-time peak of 296 publishers. The brothers have enjoyed many experiences in the preaching work and from the branch servant’s report we see that the people are looking for the truth that Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching. Not only do Jehovah’s witnesses have the opportunity of going to them and saying to the prisoners, “Go forth!” but some are so anxious to “go forth” that they come to the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lima company was split into two units, and now that all see the advantages they rejoice that the 1950 peak of 92 company publishers has been surpassed by a new combined peak of 172 in August. The other three companies connected with missionary groups have had </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> joyous share in the grand increase, this year reaping the benefits of being better established and the missionaries and local publishers being more fully experienced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And blessed personal experiences weren’t lacking either; often we were made to realize the harvest is ripe and the laborers yet few. Satisfaction and joy were derived from overcoming barriers by Jehovah’s spirit, whether they were illiteracy, prison walls retaining sheeplike Bible students, literal mountain ranges and jungles separating us from isolated publishers, official stubbornness, or just plain indifference on the part of some prospective sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As to indifference, one local missionary relates how after repeated brief calls on a shoemaker and his son during six months, just a magazine placement, she managed to start a study. The son had told her never to come back, calling us “Protestants”. She says, “I told him I would return with the Catholic Bible, as it protests against all false religions. I did, and discussed hell and the trinity. He exclaimed, ‘There is surely something to your work I I have never read from a Bible before. Why do the priests prohibit it?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Weeks later his father' arranged to study </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let Clod Be True,’</span><span class="font6"> with my sister and me, with the result that he was so thrilled that he subscribed for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> for his brother as well as for himself and sent over twenty magazines to relatives in other provinces. He now rejoices greatly to be a publisher, and gave his first student talk recently. His wife is eager to hear the truth now because of her husband's rescue from immorality.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One day an inquisitive Catholic boy in Arequipa saw one of the missionaries studying in a park. Seeing he was American, he thought he might have something interesting to study, and truly he did I The studies which followed were cut short after a couple of weeks when the young m;yi left the city in search of work. After a month had passed he came to Lima, where lie tried to locate us with the branch address. Meanwhile, however, we had moved and he lost a month or more hunting us high and low, finally meeting one of the missionaries in nearby Callao. Delighted, he attended one of the meetings, which lie had so much missed since leaving Arequipa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But he was going right away after work again, this time to the mountains in the interior. He agreed to try to attend the assembly in March and to write for information and literature as needed. The assembly site had to be moved just the day before the starting day due to official refusal of permission, but he was one of the 305 who found the changed location and enjoyed the program. He went in the field during the assembly and returned to the mining town to tell his friends all about it. Then they too wanted literature, so he wrote the branch, and since then his reports have been regular. He greatly enjoyed and benefited from the circuit servant’s visit to him in July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the Trujillo missionaries writes, “Three new sisters and I called on an </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hacienda,</span><span class="font6"> owner to see what our prospects would be for working the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hacienda.</span><span class="font6"> After I had made the presentation he said we were doing a noble work and he hoped we would visit all the families on his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hacienda. </span><span class="font6">He presented us with a book he had written regarding liis plan for teaching all the illiterates to read. I explained to him our educational work and how the ones that learn the message immediately begin teaching others. He turned to the sisters and asked each one how long I had been teaching her. One said a year, the others ten months. He then asked them if they had dedicated themselves to the same work of teaching. They told him yes, and that this was their tirst day in the service. He commended them highly and said that we have something very practical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“After thanking him we got ready to leave, presenting him with the new book as a gift. He said, ‘But you haven't told me how your work in financed.’ I explained, and he responded, ‘But you will permit me to make a small donation to your work?’ With that he handed me a five-hundred-sole bill ($33.33 U.S.), expressing the hope that it would help get the message to those too poor to contribute. Not all the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">haciendas</span><span class="font6"> are under his management, of course, but since he is considered a very important person we are in hopes that the other </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hacienda</span><span class="font6"> owners will follow his precedent and open the way to witness to their workers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So the great happy expansion is taking place here in Peru, just as it is all over the world now, and ours is a most blessed lot to have a little part in it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark231"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark232"></a>PHILIPPINE REPUBLIC</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Kingdom message is penetrating throughout the Philippine Republie. There is plenty of trouble in that land now—political strife, social unrest, etc.— but the opportunity to preach the good news still exists. In fact, it is unlimited for Jehovah’s witnesses. We do not mean by that that there is no trouble, but there are millions of people to talk to and there are thousands of witnesses to do the talking. Splendid increases have been made during the year. At the close of the service year there w’ere 14,609 who were willing volunteers calling on the prisoners to come forth. The branch servant relates a number of interesting experiences and shows what our brothers are up against in order to get the message preached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Cebu City the manager of a business concern was so impressed with the testimony given by an American graduate of Gilead School that he Invited him to come back and preach to all of his employees. On the return visit the missionary was delighted to find about thirty persons waiting to hear what he would have to say. After an introduction by the manager the publisher launched into a ninety-minute discussion on how to gain life-giving knowledge. Several revisits were necessary to answer all the questions prompted by this first presentation to the employees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Quite by accident two pioneer sisters going from house to house were swept in with more than one hundred persons during a mass raid by police in Manila who were seeking suspected </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Huks.</span><span class="font6"> Taken to an army camp, the sisters were at first rigidly confined, not even being allowed to speak to each other. When some of the army officers found out that these two were Jehovah's witnesses they were very-kind to them, even encouraging them to preach from the Bible to others in the same building until their clearances were signed and both were allowed to go free. Their time was well spent, they left a fine impression, and they were able to arrange for many revisits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Circuit assemblies provided plenty of excitement and fanned the enthusiasm of the publishers to a bright glow. In Libuianan, Camarines Sur, an acting mayor tried to cancel the public meeting permit granted to Jehovah’s witnesses by his absentee superior. Evidently he thought better of it when he discovered the law guarantees our right of peaceable assembly. The assembly hall was stoned and so were some persons going to and from the hall, but nothing stopped the program. Over one thousand attended the public meeting in spite of threats of mobbing. Only three hundred were brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">San Jose, Antique, witnessed similar lack of respect for worship of Almighty God. The provincial governor reluctantly signed a permit for the use of the public bandstand only ten minutes before the arrival of the district servant in town. He had been holding out for weeks in the face of repeated representations. A theater had been engaged for the assembly sessions. This was vigorously stoned and the owner subjected to pressure to break his contract with Jehovah's witnesses. He stood firm. Eight hundred came to the public meeting, strangers numbering five hundred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Burauen, Leyte, is stifled in a municipal strait jacket of administrative intolerance. Public property was denied to taxpayers for any part of our Christian circuit assembly. A theater was engaged for all sessions. The local parish priest put on an “amateur night” show right next door to attract people away from the assembly. In spite of that the theater was packed out and all sessions went on to a thrilling climax. Nine hundred attended. In Panabo, Davao, followers of a Filipino religion called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Iglesia ni Cristo</span><span class="font6"> set up a loud-speaker right in front of the circuit assembly hall of Jehovah’s witnesses. The police were summoned and the disturbers were made to move one hundred meters away. Then the sound amplifier of these religious intruders failed to operate. So their audience came over to hear the lecture of Jehovah’s witnesses. One thousand attended the public meeting undisturbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course, the high light of our service year came during your visit in April. We had a wonderful time during that national assembly and we want to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to Jehovah for your visit and for the sound counsel from the Scriptures you gave at that lime. Anyone reading your thrilling report in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> of September 15 and October 1, 1951, cannot fail to grasp some of the contentment we enjoy in spite of adversity in the Philippines. We are very happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The most sensational event with respect to our work came just at the close of the service year. Secretary of Justice Jose P. Bengzon, who was about to resign, took a parting shot at Jehovah’s witnesses. He issued an opinion to the effect that children of Jehovah’s witnesses could be compelled to salute the flag in the public schools on pain of expulsion. Thereby he reversed the opinion of his predecessor in office and disregarded the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the famous </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Barnette</span><span class="font6"> case. As a matter of fact Mr. Bengzon called the U. S. high court “vascil-lating” and said that court had “deprived its ruling of the necessary stability and force borne of fixed conviction”. He had a few other uncomplimentary things to say about that court’s logic, all of which erupted Into extensive publicity in the newspapers. The Manila </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle,</span><span class="font6"> In its Sunday magazine section, gave a very good three-page write-up of the stand of Jehovah’s witnesses. Appropriate pictures illustrated how the witnesses carry on their preaching activity. This publicity did much to acquaint the reading public with the work we are doing throughout the world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark233"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark234"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In this communist-dominated country the work of Jehovah’s witnesses has been slowed down momentarily. The totalitarian rulers of the land do not see fit to have freedom of speech or freedom of worship. They are fighting against the kingdom of God and all those who stand for the Kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses, however, have not stopped preaching, but they continue to say to the prisoners, “Go forth!” Certainly those in Poland are bound. It is known by the Society that intensive work goes on in the land of Poland. When the ban came there were about 18,000 publishers. But when the whip of totalitarian rule lashed against them in an endeavor to disorganize them, it made their numbers drop to 9,380. Of course, the scattering of Jehovah’s witnesses often makes them work harder in telling the people the good news, because it is the only answer to the world’s woes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The scattered ones did not remain idle, nor did they stay away from the Lord’s organization. They continued to meet one with another and preach the good news as they had opportunity. Today we know there arc 15,009 who have the good spirit of our Father and are praising Jehovah. They are strengthened by the Word of God and they believe it with all their heart, mind, soul and strength. They know that it is possible to lose their lives in the flesh now, but never will they lose the life God has given them. Satan the Devil may destroy the body, but it is Jehovah God who will give life in the new world. Jehovah’s witnesses fearlessly go ahead in Poland preaching the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The branch servant of Poland still remains in prison. He has been given a life sentence. There arc about a hundred others of Jehovah’s witnesses who are serving prison terms now. The only reason they are in prison is that they w-ere preaching the good news of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We know that some new interest is coming forward and they are being immersed and are taking then-stand for the Kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses in Poland believe that the Prince of Peace will continue to lead them to victory through these very difficult and dangerous days. God’s servants throughout the wide world admire their zeal and determination and trust in Jehovah. We stand shoulder to shoulder with them in the proclamation of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PUERTO RICO</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Five years ago there were just two towns where the message of the Kingdom was being preached. Now there are fifteen companies in Puerto Rico. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> is having a wide circulation too. Many new subscriptions were obtained during the year and due to the fact that the Spanish </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> are now published twice a month, just like the English, there is a much wider distribution. The publishers in Puerto Rico are happy with the increase and they are looking ahead to 1952 and the opportunity of singing more praise to the Most High God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has really been thrilling to see how the seed thrown forth by the great Sower has taken root and sprouted in unexpected places. Publishers are popping up all over the island, from the coastlands to high up in the mountains; little companies are beginning to blossom and established companies are branching out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Gilead missionary’s letter tells us of six publishers from the Mayaguez company starting out early one Sunday morning in response to a request for a public lecture by an isolated family of publishers about 15 miles up In the mountains. After a pleasant ride along the winding road lined with shrubbery and blossoming trees, they set out on foot along a narrow path leading over little hills and through valleys to the publishers’ home. They gave a friendly verbal invitation in all the humble homes along the way to come to the lecture, and, in most cases, got the answer, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Vamos, si Dios quiere”</span><span class="font6"> (“We’ll go, God willing”). But about lecture time dark clouds filled the sky and rain came pelting down, dampening the joy of the publishers and the isolated family. Not for long, though, because soon the invited neighbors started arriving, wet but curious, and the attendance grew to 28, some sitting on benches, others standing on the porch, as the saying goes, “all ears.” Now a group study has been started and, with Jehovah’s blessing, a company will later be formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A free booklet offer at the close of one of our radio programs brought a letter from another mountain town, Utuado. Calling at his first opportunity, the circuit servant was surprised to meet two publishers who related this interesting account: Leaving California, where they had learned something of the truth, they had set out for Puerto nico, the wife’s native land, their desire being to tell the people there of the Kingdom message. On arriving, they settled on a small farm near Utuado and soon began preaching the Word. The local Methodist Church extended a “warm” invitation to the wife (whose father had been a Methodist minister) to join their church, but turned “cold” when she visited them and witnessed about Bible doctrines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For a while the Pentecostal Church offered them their building for Bible discussions, but the preacher soon found their presentation of Bible truths made him extremely uncomfortable, and withdrew the offer. For several Sundays they invited a large number of neighbor children to their home for a Bible study, with good response, but then Satan’s “birds” got busy with false accusations and the parents stopped the children’s attendance. So, the two became quite discouraged and contemplated leaving. They were not in contact with the hundreds of publishers working throughout the island and were unknown to the branch—until that radio program evoked a letter from the wife. Now, with another visit from the circuit servant and some good instruction on carrying on the work, they have started witnessing from door to door and are probably experiencing the words of the psalmist (126:6,48): “He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for sowing, shall doubtless come again with joy, bringing his sheaves with him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Incidentally, we now have free programs amounting to two hours a week on five radio stations throughout the island, and many publishers on calling at homes find the radio programs have gotten there first, opening the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The company in Ponce, our third-largest city over on the south coast, has been a model of expansion. Starting the year with 80 publishers they reached a peak of 127 and last month reported 114 Bible studies. Rural witnessing, begun this year, brought interesting results. And here in the capital the company in Santurce started to bud early in the year and by its end had branched out four times!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Good evidence of future possibilities and an event that brought great joy, too, was the Memorial celebration. Memorial night came and passed and one by one the reports came in from the twelve places where it had been celebrated. When the reports were totaled we found not 600, nor 700, but a grand total of 834 in attendance! In the Santurce Kingdom Hall, although extra chairs had been rented for the occasion, there were as many people standing as there were sitting, 260 in all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So now we start into the new service year, and we count it a joy to be alive and working for the Lord in this his day. Religious opposition is beginning to manifest itself, as in Aguadilla where the presence of two lone missionaries caused the Presbyterian Church to distribute a pamphlet decrying the “invasion by Jehovah’s witnesses”; but we are confident that, though opposition increases, Jehovah’s work will continue its forward march. We Indeed have much to be thankful for and are determined to keep ourselves clean and theocratic that thus the flow of blessings may never stop.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark235"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark236"></a>VIRGIN ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There are three little islands, St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John, not too far away from Puerto Rico where 24,000 persons make their home. A good witness has been given to these folks during the past year. The brothers reached a peak of 99 publishers, with wonderful prospects of more “sheep” joining them in preaching the good news. The branch servant in Puerto Rico writes the following about the work in these islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was the most eventful year yet for our brothers there. When, on December 29, that big 4-motored Pan-American plane came gliding down onto the airfield at Charlotte Amalie and the brothers, lined up to greet it, realized that it was completely filled with some 50 fellow witnesses from Puerto Rico plus the Society’s president and his secretary, well, they really were thrilled. The district assembly that followed was certainly a milestone in theocratic progress for the Virgin Islands. Never had their capital city of Charlotte Amalie seen so many witnesses (over 100) at one time. They rejoiced again at Memorial time when 134 attended the celebration In Charlotte Amalie and Christiansted. More than double last year's attendance of 66!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In St. Thomas an interesting experience was had as the result of a Bible study begun with a patient in the Municipal hospital. This patient soon felt desirous of aiding others and began a Bible study in Spanish with an elderly man in the bed next to his. Soon four studies were in progress. A visiting Church of God preacher, seeing one of the newly interested patients studying, cried, “Man, you expect to get well and you drinking that poison?” But an English clergyman on seeing the patient studying with a fellow patient of good will asked permission to examine the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font6"> they were using and then requested that they get him a copy. Later he requested a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God, Be True” </span><span class="font6">book and expressed appreciation of the contents of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font6"> booklet they gave him, saying that he ‘admired the way Jehovah’s witnesses </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6"> went out and preached and gave aid to the people in Bible study’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses In the Virgin Islands are sure this coining year will prove still more interesting for them and bring them new joys and new blessings. They know that further increases are still to be made and they intend to lie found working for them, and this by God’s grace.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark237"></a>ROMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">An oppressive government has ruled over Romania for a long time. The communists have established the worst dictatorial regime Romania has had up to this time. Here is another country behind the “iron curtain” that is opposed to freedom of thought and speech. There is strong censorship of the mail. The letters pass through many hands at the post office and every word is weighed. Only that which is in favor of communism is allowed to go through. Anything that is for truth and God’s kingdom does not pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since July, 1950, many of the brothers in Romania have been in prison. A number have been put to work on the Danube Canal. This, of course, is forced labor. They do not get sufficient food or clothing. But it is understood that relatives are allowed to give them additional supplies so that they can keep alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What information has come through from Romania is good in this respect: Jehovah’s witnesses are still preaching the message of the Kingdom and they are very busy at it. They are putting up a good fight under hard persecution. They are not discouraged. All the brothers are being strictly watched and it is impossible to send through service reports. But we know “the work progresses in spite of all”. Our dear brothers in Romania were well fed before the communist regime gained great strength to oppress the people. Now the brothers there are holding close to God’s Word the Bible and the things that they have learned. We rejoice in their faithfulness. Jehovah’s witnesses have been well taught through the Lord’s organization. And, although fresh provisions of truth have been lacking recently, they know what they should do and, what is more, they are doing it. They are still praising Jehovah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SINGAPORE AND MALAYA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark238"></a><span class="font7">In Singapore and Malaya and the islands to the south of this peninsula there are millions upon millions of people who have not had the opportunity of hearing the truth. It is believed that if enough publishers get into this territory and can talk to the people in their own tongue, there will be a “great crowd” to praise Jehovah in thunderous tones. Some are doing this now, but not in any great numbers. The work in Singapore, Malaya, Borneo and the United States of Indonesia shows good increase. These countries are overrun with internal strife the same as most countries, but Jehovah’s witnesses keep on preaching and bringing comfort to those that mourn. The branch servant in Singapore, where a new office was opened during the year, sends in reports on the work in that part of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was with great joy and gladness that Jehovah’s witnesses in tills land heralded the announcement “Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land”. This was a special occasion for rejoicing, as we received the news that we were to have a visit from the president of the Society and his secretary. Since only four of the present 90 publishers were associated with the Lord’s organization on the occasion of Brother Knorr’s visit in 1947, it was to prove to be a special treat to all the new ones here. Singapore’s first assembly since 1940 was held on this occasion and all those attending enjoyed immensely the rich spiritual feast that was spread by Jehovah for his people. A clearer insight into the Lord’s organization, its magnitude and the manner of its functioning through the operation of his spirit was clearly impressed upon all. The information on divine healing was especially fitting, as here various religions are always in the limelight with their claim to numerous miracles among which faith healing is prominent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An interesting item on this point appeared in the local press. On the occasion of the visit to Singapore of a popular faith-healing “Christian” preacher an article in the press quoted testimonials from persons who claimed to have been healed from various afflictions on his previous visit. A few days later the same type of article appeared with testimonials from others, but this time from Buddhists, on the occasion of a visit from one of their miracle-working priests. This bears out the fact that performing of miracles is not that which identifies a true Christian today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The opening of a branch office in Singapore has facilitated handling of many details of service. Local problems peculiar to this country can be dealt with more easily. Especially appreciated will be the regular visits of the circuit and district servants as well as the semiannual circuit assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Through home Bible studies many are enabled to grasp the truth quickly and are equipped sufficiently to take the life-giving message to others, as the following experience from a pioneer shows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Twelve months ago I contacted a young Chinese whose family is Buddhist and placed a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font6"> with him, arranging at the same time to call again. On returning he had some questions and soon we began a study. He did not possess the Bible and knew very little about it. After a few studies his interest was aroused, especially after studying about the ‘end of the world’. At school he began talking to his classmates and in letters witnessed to friends, including a pen friend in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“After six months I invited him out in the service and he thoroughly enjoyed it. That which struck him most was the urgency of the work due to the nearness of Armageddon. When vacation came he asked me if I thought he would be wasting time if he spent two weeks with his friends in another town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Soon he convinced one of his Indian school friends that this was the truth and encouraged him to study </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’.</span><span class="font6"> After two studies this lad also wanted to come witnessing and now the two of them help each other in joyful service. They went to work on another schoolboy, and after a couple of studies in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Means Everlasting Life’ </span><span class="font6">and much encouragement he too is ready for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“For their last vacation two of them took up individual territories. Now they are conducting six home Bible studies between them and have taken two of their studies into the field service. Truly the ‘other sheep’ of the Lord are being gathered by Him and no matter w-hat one has been before, whether Christian or not, the pure language is causing all to unite in praising Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another high light of the service year was the arrival here of six Gilead graduates who were assigned to work in the Federation of Malaya. Four British brothers were sent to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Penang, which is an island located off the northwest coast of Malaya with a population of 189,000. This city had had no witnesses in it since 1940. Two New Zealand brothers were assigned to Kuala Lumpur, the capital of the Federation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Upon arrival here the two brothers for Kuala Lumpur received entry permits for one year, whereas the four missionaries for Penang were granted only a one-month stay while their case was reviewed by the director of immigration. On the day before their month expired they were ordered to leave the country. No explanation was given by the authorities. Subsequent appeals to the chief secretary, to the member for home affairs, and to the high commissioner were of no avail and the brothers concerned had to depart for Siam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the short while that the missionaries worked In that city they distributed much Bible literature and were able to start a number of home Bible studies with people who are keen to learn of God’s purposes. Public response to this free education was remarkable and many were shocked by the action of the government taken against these missionaries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark239"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark240"></a>UNITED STATES OF INDONESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The high light of the year was the visit from Brooklyn of Brother Knorr and Brother Henschel for the first time to Indonesia. That visit helped us toward better organization of the work in this country. Especially grateful were we for the arrangement Brother Knorr made to send a circuit servant from Singapore who worked with us for three months and helped build up our company more along theocratic lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our chief difficulty has been to locate a suitable Kingdom Hall. When we consider that the publishers have increased from last year’s 19 to this year’s peak of 65 we can appreciate that the place where we met in a private home before has become inadequate. However, negotiations are now being made for acquiring a missionary home and Kingdom Hall combined and we hope our efforts will bring success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the help of the circuit servant we were able to organize our company meetings better. We now have a regular </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study in Dutch Indonesian. Service meetings and the ministry school were also introduced and are greatly appreciated by the brothers. During the servant’s visit many of the irregular publishers were aided into the service and four, by water immersion, symbolized their dedication to do Jehovah’s will, which made a total of six baptized for the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are thankful to Jehovah that it has been possible for eight Gilead graduates to be sent here to take up missionary work. The brothers are assured of having many blessings and are already enjoying many interesting experiences in the service among this diversity of peoples. It matters not which form of false religion people have been practicing, if they are honest-hearted they will ‘listen to the voice of the right shepherd’. The following experience bears this out:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A sister placed a booklet with a young boy whose mother was a Catholic. On calling back she met the lady of the house herself. This person had never had any satisfaction in her church, although born a Catholic. After that a home Bible study was held with her regularly and now she uses in Kingdom service the money she usually gave to the church for masses to be said for her dead father and daughter. She realizes that she had been deceived all these years. Now she is a publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So now with these missionaries in our midst and six more being on the way, w<sup>T</sup>e look forward to a wonderful service year ahead of us.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark241"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark242"></a>BORNEO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Regular reports throughout the year were received from two publishers in Borneo. Though there are many hardships to put up with in this country the brothers have devoted good time to Kingdom service. No doubt many of those called on will respond to the message and take up the service in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There were six persons in attendance at the Memorial celebration. We pray for Jehovah’s blessings upon the efforts of our brothers there. The seed sown on “right soil” and cultivated by faithful back-calls and studies conducted will surely bring forth fruits to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark243"></a>SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The branch office now located in Cape Town, South Africa, looks after the general organization of the work in South Africa itself, Angola, Basutoland, Bechuanaland, Mauritius, St. Helena, South-West Africa, Swaziland. Reports are given on all of these territories and the reader will appreciate the problems that they face in this southern part of the great continent of Africa. During the past year the Society started building its new home in Germiston in Johannesburg, and it is hoped that before many months pass our offices will move from Cape Town to our new location. The work in South Africa warrants this expansion, putting up larger offices, accommodations for brothers and a printing plant to take care of the many dialects that are spoken in that part of the world. Cape Town is one branch that has never had a Bethel Home, that is, a place where all members of the family live together. They do have their own office and printing establishment, but the members of the family have never had the pleasure of living as a family. Now this matter is being corrected by putting up our own place. We are sure it will add greatly to the prosperity of the organization in South Africa. Jehovah’s witnesses have done splendidly during the past year and the report submitted by the branch servant is very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It Is always a thrill to find the Lord's “other sheep” and to have the privilege of feeding them the rich spiritual food that Jehovah through his theocratic organization distributes throughout the earth for the spiritual healing and uplift of the people who are of mild disposition and teachable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One lady with whom a missionary had conducted a study for about two months remarked: “You know, it is really wonderful I I have attended church regularly since I was a little girl and I have read my Bible quite a lot, but I have learned more about God's purposes in the few weeks that you have been coming around to help me study God’s Word with the aid of the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font6"> than I have learned in all these previous years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A brother on sick leave from his work for three months went to the country to recuperate. Having in mind that physical illness can often be helped by fresh air and exercise he began to walk from farm to farm to give out the Kingdom message. At the end of the second month there were 20 attending home Bible studies and he began a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font6">study for them. Before he returned home at the end of the third month 10 of those attending the studies had had some share in the work and arrangements were made for a brother in a nearby company to go over each week to act as group study conductor and care for the interest aroused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The youngsters, brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, have also contributed their share to the volume of praise that has gone up to Jehovah. One day a teacher at school said to the children, “Those who would like to go to heaven let them raise their hands.” The whole class raised their hands except one boy. Asked for his reason he told them about God’s kingdom and the paradise earth. When he had concluded the teacher asked the class who would like to live under God’s kingdom on earth. Without hesitation all the children raised their hands and the teacher added, “I am also raising my hand.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At a small town two pioneers were refused camping privileges on municipal ground. A person of good will offered his yard. Soon pressure was brought to bear on him and the pioneers were obliged to leave. A prominent businessman then agreed to let the pioneers use his property. Again pressure was applied and the offer was withdrawn. Unable to obtain accommodation in the town the pioneers have been forced to camp five miles outside and ride into town each day to carry forward their missionary activity. In spite of warnings from the pulpit and lack of co-operation from the town council, a successful open-air public meeting was held with 230 in attendance, and good interest has been aroused. Now a third party has offered accommodation to the pioneers and he is determined that no pressure, from either predikant or Council, will make him alter his decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The circuit work has expanded rapidly. Eighty-two new companies were organized during the year. In addition we found it necessary to subdivide a number of the circuits to make it easier for many of the brothers to attend the circuit assemblies. This has resulted in the total attendance at such assemblies being greatly increased. The number baptized at the circuit assemblies was 1,028 and this brought the total of those symbolizing their dedication by water immersion during the year to 2,015.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After a long wait of nearly three years we were eventually given transfer of the land purchased in 1948 and our building program immediately got under way. Satisfactory progress has been made during the past four months and according to the builders’ latest assessment the buildings should be completed next February. We are all very grateful to Jehovah and to you for this provision that is being made, for we know that it will lead to greater expansion of the Kingdom work in South Africa.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark244"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark245"></a>ANGOLA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Reports from this Portuguese colony in West Africa take a full month to reach the Cape Town office. The latest one at hand, the report for July, indicates that there were 19 publishers in action that month. During the greater part of the year the majority of these publishers have been working on the little Portuguese island of Sao Tome, which is situated right on the equator and which falls under the supervision of the authorities in Angola. The brothers there have been diligent with their back-calls and home Bible studies and this has brought the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Letters from Portuguese living in the capital city, Nova Lisboa, and at other centers in the colony have expressed appreciation for the magazines and other literature in the Portuguese language.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark246"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark247"></a>BASUTOLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">With no railroads and few good roads the work in Basutoland is carried forward under difficulty. For example, the circuit servant had to ride for two days on horseback to get to one group of interested people in the eastern part of the country. The journey, however, was worth while. The assistant chief, the postmaster and others in the district have the Society’s literature and appreciate it. The talk ‘•It Is High Time to Awake!” was well received, and now a little company has been organized, with good prospects for expansion. When the circuit servant again visited them six months later, a Roman Catholic priest attended the public meeting and at the conclusion testified that he had been charging his members at the rate of 2/6d per man, typer woman and 3d per child for many years and had been giving them nothing worth while in return. Now he had learned the truth and was determined that no longer would he “labor in vain”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the western part of the country steady progress has been made and several new companies have been organized. A pioneer working in Maseru, the capital, encountered some difficulty from the chief, who wished him to leave the country. However, the pioneer was born in Basutoland and when the matter came before the resident commissioner the latter justly made full inquiries. The resident commissioner, in the presence of the chief, informed the pioneer that he was free to carry forward his work without interference. A successful public meeting was held shortly thereafter with 205 in attendance. A company has now been organized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But although many of the chiefs are Catholics and opposed to the Kingdom message, there are some honest-hearted ones among them. A pioneer recently visited a chiefs kraal in the Leribe district. He was invited to eat with the chief, who at the time was entertaining two clergymen. Opportunity was given to explain the purpose of the visit, and as the pioneer made each point he handed the Bible to the chief so that the chief could see as well as hear the answer to his questions. The two clergymen became very annoyed and left, leaving the pioneer to continue the discussion with the chief. The chief was indeed pleased with all the information he received from the Bible and arrangements were made for a regular weekly study with him.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark248"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark249"></a>BECHUANALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">At one center where opposition was being encountered representations were made to the European district commissioner, requesting him to grant permission for a special pioneer to reside in the district to care for the spiritual interests of a small company. The reply was to the effect that permission for him to enter and stay in the Reserve must come from the chief and that would require our adherents to persuade the chief and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">kgotla</span><span class="font6"> that the presence of the pioneer was necessary for their wellbeing. The entire committee of three brothers, acting on this advice, approached the chief and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">kgotla</span><span class="font6"> for the necessary permission. The chief said: “I do not want any other church. The Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches are enough,” and then he ordered all three brothers to be thrashed with a stick. A month later they still bore the marks of the stick. A letter of protest was immediately lodged with the European officials at Mafeking, and the matter is now being investigated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At another center European representatives of the Society interviewed both the local district commissioner and the chiefs brother (the chief himself was absent on business). Both of these men agreed that the brothers should have the right to practice their religion in harmony with the dictates of their conscience if such religion was not injurious to a nation. The chief himself was sympathetic at first and raised no objection to our work. Later he yielded to religious pressure. He would not allow the brothers to defend themselves before any accusers nor would he state what the brothers had done wrong to warrant the change in his policy. Because they kept on preaching he ruled that some of the brothers forfeit land, cattle, sheep, goats, fields and corn. In this case the appeal to the native commissioner had some effect, and the sentence was not enforced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the face of such opposition and the cruelty of tribal chiefs the local brothers continue to let their light shine. They are learning to defeat persecution, and some of good will, noting the courage of the brothers, are also taking their stand on Jehovah’s side and learning to publish. The latest report at hand from the circuit servant indicates that prospects for expansion are brightest at the center where the persecution has been greatest.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark250"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark251"></a>MAURITIUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Two Mauritians, while in the army, came in touch with our work in Egypt. They commenced writing to the Cape Town office and received supplies of literature. Soon a number of fellow soldiers became interested. On returning to their homeland they did their best to let their light shine and some reports were sent to the Cape Town office during tlie year. It was obvious, however, that they needed help to organize more effectively. Just six weeks before the end of the Society’s year, two Gilead graduates commenced work. Now practical field instruction and regular studies are guiding these men. Enthusiastically they are rehearsing their share in the first service meeting scheduled for next week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is eighteen years since a witness was given in Mauritius by two pioneer publishers from South Africa. Their visit has not been forgotten by good-will persons, as the following experience with a teacher demonstrates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“When I introduced myself at a certain home, the householder asked, ‘How is Judge Rutherford getting on?’ I explained briefly the history of the Society from 1934 to 1941 and then from that date until now. Later he remarked, ‘I used to subscribe for your magazine </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age;</span><span class="font6"> do you still have it?’ He produced the July 4, 1934, issue containing the ‘Famine’ lecture. It was a real joy to briefly explain the history of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age, Consolation</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> Needless to say, he is subscribing for the last named. He brought ont an 18-year-old, well-worn and wellread copy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">La Harpe de Dieu.</span><span class="font6"> Now he is rejoicing in the opportunity to read the three latest bound books. A study has been started and he is already ‘confessing with the mouth’ the glorious truths he has learned.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Placements of literature have been much better than was the case eighteen years ago. This is largely the result of better social conditions, more education, a better distribution of wealth and increased freedom of speech and worship arising from political changes during the past five years. Formerly the right to vote in parliamentary elections was confined to the well-to-do people, and these were very largely ardent Catholics. Now nearly everyone except the completely illiterate has a vote and so the ruling power has swung much in the direction of the masses. Many of these</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">222 </span><span class="font6">are Indians not sympathetic to the mighty church. So Rome's retreat has led to an all-round improvement.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark252"></a>ST. HELENA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Kingdom message was first taken to St. Helena by two pioneers from Cape Town in 1933. Their stay was a short one, but in a week they distributed 800 books and booklets to the 4,000 islanders. Some of the seed fell on good ground. In spite of warnings and efforts by the “birds” to pluck it away several families accepted the truth and have kept in touch with the Cape Town office ever since, rendering regular reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the beginning of July a special pioneer was sent from the Union to help the brothers on the island to organize more effectively. He found 26 waiting to be immersed. By the end of July the number publishing had increased to 26. The holding of the baptismal service was not accomplished without some difficulty. First application was made for the use of the only swimming bath on the island. It was refused on the grounds that it could not be used for sacramental services. A sea bay was considered, but the water was too rough, and it would be difficult for some of the older publishers to get there. An effort was then made to buy a piece of ground to build a pond, but this too was of no avail. Application was made to the Baptist preacher for use of his church. This was refused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Finally one of the brothers living in the country offered a piece of ground on which to build a pond. After their day’s work was over the brothers for some days gathered stones and sand. Special ‘saddles’ were fastened to the backs of donkeys and two bags were fastened to this saddle, one on each side of the donkey. These bags carried the loads. After all the necessary material had been brought together, some brothers, helped by persons of good will, took a day off to help in building the pond. The pond is located in a valley, and 44 interested ones listened to the talk on “Baptism”. The occasion was a spectacle for men and angels. Many spectators, including one minister, stood around on the hillside overlooking the pond. It was a memorable day for St. Helena, for, as far as the brothers know, never before have as many as 26 been immersed at the same time by any religious organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of the 4,700 inhabitants now on the island, more than half are children. The Church of England has been the dominant religion and has succeeded in keeping the majority in bondage through fear. The people are told that unless they attend church at least twice a month there will be</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">no burial place for them and no one to bury them when they die. The same dire fate awaits any unchristened child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Properly organized service meetings and the theocratic ministry school are now in progress with 40 in association, and the brothers are appreciating the much-needed instruction and are endeavoring to apply this in their field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people are certainly being “stirred up”, and it is this kind of “stir-up” that is feared so much by false religion. As long as they can keep the people asleep they will be able to keep their pastures unspoiled. But now it is time for the captives to return home and for a great increase in the number of praisers of Jehovah. The brothers on St. Helena are determined to awaken tlie honest ones out of sleep and to encourage them in right works. They look to Jehovah for his guidance and protection.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark253"></a>SOUTH-WEST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Prior to 1918 South-West Africa was a German possession and the German influence and language are still strong. Today many Germans seeking a refuge from war-torn Europe are migrating to this former German colony and are welcomed by the administration. Contact has been made with several of these people who had either been witnesses or who had been associated with Jehovah’s witnesses in their homeland. They are glad to be in touch with the witnesses in South-West Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Early in the year two missionaries started calling upon the northernmost towns, equipped with a lorry, and placing much literature. Almost immediately two sheep manifested themselves in a mining town and were introduced to field service. One of them had been previously associated witli the truth in the Union and has since been reporting regularly. A town forty-five miles distant produced a German and his wife who too had had previous association with the truth but whom the tide of war had uprooted from their homeland. They had been doing some witnessing, but needed encouragement and instruction to carry on effectively. They were indeed glad to see the missionaries and enjoyed their companionship while the whole town was worked. They were left a supply of literature and are now contacted regularly. At a third town, 100 miles south, two brothers had moved in from the Union to seek work and were witnessing, but soon after the missionaries arrived a father and son were contacted who had been subscribers for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font6">previously. These two were immersed, and a company was formed, which is doing excellent service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our experiences in finding these isolated ones show there must be many more who are just waiting to be contacted</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">and instructed in the way of life and service to Jehovah. Finding such ones is a joy and reminds us of Peter’s words: “For you were like sheep, going astray, but now you have returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.”—1 Pet. 2: 25, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Actually the progress of the work is not so noticeable in the capital city, Windhoek, as in the rurals. This works well, however, for a more equitable distribution of the publishers, and hence results in a wider witness. It is hoped during the next service year to get regular reports from these isolated ones and thus enable us to consolidate the progress made.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark254"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark255"></a>SWAZILAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">During the year three new companies were organized and we had our first circuit assembly in that country. This was held at Mbabane, the capital. In addition to the brothers, many persons of good will attended the regular sessions of tile assembly and also the public meeting, and much interest was aroused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Swazis have not been encouraged by their religious leaders to read the Bible or to live in harmony with its doctrines. For example, they have not been informed that polygamy is not in keeping with clean worship, and it is still freely practiced. When the work first began in Swaziland some of the clergy seemed anxious to associate with Jehovah’s witnesses, but when they discovered that there was no money in it for them and that one of their chief sources of wealth, the traditional </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">lobola</span><span class="font6"> custom, was disapproved, they cooled off. However, a number of their honest-hearted supporters have not followed them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the publishers go from house to house answering the people’s questions directly from the Bible many who have never had Bibles before are obtaining them. Then by means of regular weekly studies they are being helped to understand the heart-cheering truths of God’s Word. Today they are active witnesses having a regular share in the Kingdom proclamation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The special pioneer was again invited to the royal kraal on “Good Friday”. The clergy were also there and each one was given five minutes to speak. On this occasion the pioneer spoke on the subject “Whose Prayers Are Answered?” He didn’t get very far before the clergy seized him bodily and forced him to sit down. But the paramount chief shouted, “Carry on, Mashazi, instead of five minutes, I give you an hour to deliver your talk.” At the conclusion of the speech many people of good will expressed appreciation of what they had heard.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark256"></a>SOUTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In this colony of the British empire, our brothers are endeavoring to present themselves approved before God. They have worked diligently trying to help the people of that land gain a knowledge of the truth, and many have been gathered together. There are 9,088 now preaching the gospel. This is a new peak. They had a 37 per cent increase in the average number of publishers. Our brothers have had a hard time gaining proper recognition from the government, but they have persistently gone ahead with their good work of telling the people about God's kingdom, and ground is being gained. During the year a permit was obtained for the importation of literature, which has been something new for them for quite a while. The literature sent should help the people in Southern Rhodesia in studying and gaining a clearer knowledge of the truth. Some of the experiences furnished by the branch servant are interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brothers were putting on a public talk in a compound and news reached the manager that Jehovah’s witnesses were causing a disturbance. He asked to si&gt;eak to the brother in charge and inferred that Jehovah’s witnesses were spreading communism. Tactful handling of the manager by the brother resulted in literature’s being placed and finally a building offered free of charge for company meetings. In another case a farmer received accusations against Jehovah’s witnesses. He brought accused and accusers together and before all showed how the “Watchtower” boys were his best workers. Now he himself has a study going on in his home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “rich man” class is certainly dead and in torments in this little country. A large and ever-increasing number of the people have turned their backs on them. A very interesting experience came from a circuit servant, bearing out this fact. A pioneer brother working in a compound was asked to preach in the Ethiopian church of the compound, as the regular minister was away. Needless to say, the pioneer did so. When the clergyman came back he was quite furious, but instead of being supported by his congregation he was ordered to go away and “not to return any more because you have been robbing us of our money and power. Now we have the right worship and this place will be used in its proper sense”. Now there is a company there and the former Ethiopian church is the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is amazing how quickly the good will have been taking an active stand in recent months. Listen to this report from a circuit servant. “Among those in attendance were three members of the Methodist church. At the close of the meeting these people asked me many questions. . . . They all took literature and the following Sunday all attended the public talk. After the meeting they said, ‘We are joining Jehovah’s witnesses. Take us in the witness work.’ The next day all went in the field service with a pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Happily, this year we can report no less thrilling experiences from among the European population. At long last the Europeans of this country have come to a point where they are entirely dissatisfied with conditions, local and abroad. The slow-moving English have been suddenly spurred to action and many are quickly taking their stand with Jehovah’s preachers of the good news. They realize that we really have something to offer the people. As one eager young man put It: “You do not offer the people a false hope. Yours is a practical solution.” As a result European Interest is cropping up everywhere. The local company enjoyed more than a 100 per cent peak increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Outstanding in the eyes of the people is the fact that ours is a clean worship in word and deed. The religions of Christendom have been here for over half a century, and yet the natives still have their several wives and immorality is the order of the day. In contrast is the report from a missionary. “One of my calls has a house boy who some months ago was going to get another wife. Recently he was asked by his mistress why he had not done so and his answer was that he was studying with Jehovah’s witnesses and they wouldn’t allow him to join them if he had more than one wife, so he didn’t get another.” Such experiences, while amusing to some, show that the truth and Jehovah’s spirit are accomplishing what the religious clergy could not do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This report would not be complete without mention of the grand work done by our faithful band of pioneers. Although they average 9 per cent of the publishers for the year, July and August saw us go over the 10 per cent. During the year they made 47 per cent of the back-calls and conducted 45 per cent of the studies. Surely this Is going to result in multitudes yet coming to a knowledge of the truth. The previous year we averaged 292 pioneers and at the end of the year 10 were dropped from the ranks due to low hours. This past year we averaged 745 pioneers and yet only 20 had to be removed. This in itself shows the marvelous work these foremost fighters are doing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark257"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark258"></a>SURINAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">On a busy Saturday night you can walk down the main street of Paramaribo and you will see groups of Javanese, small, slender, wiry of build and very shy. Over there you will see East Indians separated from all others, not so much because of their language, but because of their religion. There, too, you will see Chinese strolling about, and, as in all places in the world, they are the merchants. You will see the Djukas who come in from the bushland. Surinam being a possession of the Netherlands, one would expect the Dutch to also make their appearance in the town, and they do. There is indeed a great mixture of people to witness to in Surinam. This country is a rich field for the preaching of the Kingdom, but it is difficult to reach all of the people. The branch servant’s report is most interesting and gives you some rare experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On one of the rivers outside the city an English brother is busy. He is getting old, over seventy, but he is strong. He has plugged right along, conscientiously sending in his reports to the company monthly. It is refreshing to work with him. Because he is well acquainted with all in his territory he can be quite plain-spoken. This day he went to visit one of his old friends and neighbors, a Catholic. He said: “Get your book out, we’re going to have a study.” The book was brought and without more ado the study (the first one) was begun. When it was over his friend accused him of trying to steal him from his church. The brother just laughed, said that was not his purpose, and said that he would be back for another study. “I’ll not be home,” was the reply. But back went the publisher, and he has held at least one more study there. Never say die!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you went with him in the field service you would go in his dugout canoe over the deep, black water of the twisting river. Because of the simplicity of the country and the heat of the day you could take your shirt off if you liked and at least loosen your shoes as you paddle along between the spread-out calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And he has had success. A young man with whom he had placed literature traveled four hours by boat to contact him again. A conversation; a Bible study arranged. Now short months later and the young man is getting ready to come to the circuit assembly in Meerzorg to be immersed. He has begun to go in the field service, the first time alone. His being baptized will be a good example for others, too, as the good will here are inclined to delay too long before being immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The publishers enjoy very much taking advantage of holidays to take a witnessing trip in a group outside the city. Lunches are brought, people are witnessed to, songs are sung, and on one such trip a public lecture was held. Many from that country section came to listen, including South American Indians from a nearby village, who listened very attentively. A good witness was given before the bus brought all back to town later in the afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Circuit assemblies, however small, are quite nice. We had one a few months ago in Nieuw Nickerie. Six were able to come from Paramaribo and there were ten at that time in Nickerie itself. Placard witnessing was done for the first time in that town, posters were painted, and 87 listened to the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is practically an inexhaustible source of potential Bible studies here. It remains only to be purposefully tapped in order to yield a rich supply of new publishers. As in many places, perhaps, the vast majority of studies among the company publishers are being conducted by just a few. In the past year they have resulted in a fairly good increase in publishers. What would happen if a greater number of publishers would apply themselves to conducting lively, theocratic studies, staying with the good will until he is ready to take part in the service and then going with him regularly each week in the service until he has formed a hard-to-break habit of regularity and is capable of holding his own in the field? When that happens things will really start moving. Now all are doing pretty well, next year we hope still better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That little stencil machine you sent us has proved quite a help too. Before that dated handbills had to be ordered from the United States three months in advance, and when something unforeseen would occur in the meantime the handbills for one talk would be wasted. But now we can order blank handbills in quantity from the U. S. and the companies can send orders for dated ones to us. It’s quicker. With it we have also been able to start sending a monthly field service report of work done in Surinam to every publisher along with his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informateur,</span><span class="font6"> which comes from Holland. This keeps the condition of the work in the land before the brothers. We have just begun to do this, printing it on blank handbill-size newsprint ordered from the States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was certainly good news to hear that four more pioneers would be sent from Gilead school to help us in Paramaribo. Their coming will certainly mean more prosperity and increase to Jehovah’s honor.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark259"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark260"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses are causing quite a stir throughout Sweden. They have taken a very definite stand for God’s kingdom, as have their fellow workers in all parts of the world. But as their group increases in number it becomes more noticeable. They now have a new peak of 5,140 ministers of the gospel, and, as the report shows, neither the clergy nor the government likes Jehovah’s witnesses. This, however, does not affect the ministers of the Most High. They continue to say to the prisoners, “Go forth!” And what is more, they are coming forth in Sweden. The branch servant’s report gives us some interesting things to think about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The big question when brothers have met this year has been: How about the 34 per cent increase? For the country as a whole this desired mark was not reached; we were in fact not getting half way toward the goal, although there were several companies that did reach it. But that our witnessing has had a telling effect is borne out by the following report in a Stockholm daily from a very religious industrial town of 43,000 persons in the south of Sweden: “Advertisements showed services were held last Sunday at 40 places in town, but the list is not complete because some do not advertise. Some Roman Catholics and a small number of Jews are carrying on their religion more or less hidden, whereas there is much commotion connected with Jehovah’s witnesses who are colporteuring their Watchtower with glowing faith, among sheep as well as goats. This sect, by the way, seems to have selected Sweden as their special missionary field, and it cannot be denied that the Christians at J—■— are looking upon the publishers of this sect much the same as the mandarins in China must look upon missionaries from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">faraway town of J---.” And the newly appointed arch</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">bishop of Upsala recently stated to his clergy: “The Church must distribute good literature in order to counteract the activities of certain sects.” The discussion about hell which started anew some years ago has taken on new impetus during the past year and it was interesting to note, in an article by a State Church priest who was summing up the various interpretations and explanations given, that we were commented upon like this: “Jehovah’s witnesses, who are becoming more and more loud-voiced, are declaring hell, or eternal punishment, to mean extinction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;,</span><span class="font6"> which appeared in Swedish during this year, has been a real boon in our efforts to help the teachable ones to see the truth on the subject of hell as well as other Biblical topics, and, consequently, the home Bible-study work has gained quite some ground. We were glad also to get the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The Prince of Peace”, </span><span class="font6">not to speak of the “new” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font6"> The new style of this magazine, which is now appearing with two 24-page issues every month, has been very much appreciated, and not the least is the “Questions from Readers” column. We are indeed grateful for the lead along the right path of clean, undefiled worship which we are getting through this magazine. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazine is now appearing twice a month in this country and is doing a good work in helping people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The issue of bringing up children in “the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah” has been brought to the fore here also, especially in two divorce cases where husbands have wanted to get rid of their wives and to have the care of the children because the wives are Jehovah’s witnesses. In one case the primary and appeal courts ruled that the child must go to the father, as it would be “injurious to the mental and spiritual health of the child to be brought up in the atmosphere of hatred and Intolerance characteristic of this sect”. When the year ended this case was pending decision by the supreme court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the other case the local State Church priest stated on the witness stand that “it might be dangerous to leave the boy with his mother seeing that her teaching would bring him into conflict with conscription law when he gets of military age”. (The boy is now three years old!) So the issue is being clearly seen. And the government’s policy of repeatedly punishing those who for their conscience’ sake cannot comply with conscription-law demands is beginning to cause some people to think seriously. Even a public prosecutor wrote as follows in a case against one Jehovah’s witness who had appealed his sentence: “Appellant’s objections seem to be directed against the law itself and not against the application of it in this case. What he says, however, is worthy of notice. That deeply religious persons who because of their beliefs are getting into conflict with the demands of conscription law should be punished as criminals is unfortunate. When this policy is compared with the humane treatment now afforded real criminals, the viewpoints of appellant are still more supported. The present law, however, does not seem to allow for a dismissal.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The public meetings are a good help in breaking down prejudice and getting people interested in investigating the message. From one part of the country where there is a small but expansion-minded company, the following newspaper clipping was sent in: “One day in the spring an energetic gentleman appeared in this community and started to invite people to a lecture Friday night. . . . Curiosity was soon aroused and it did not last long until the lectures had to be held out of doors for lack of space indoors. . . . In the result there is noted among the public a strongly increasing interest in this work, maybe for the most part because of the discussions now going on at work places and elsewhere all over town, and there have been mass excursions to the outdoor meetings where, after the lecture is over, old and young are wanting to have their questions answered.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One nice experience had by one of the circuit servants may well conclude this report: “My wife met a man about thirty years of age who thought the Bible was difficult to understand and contradicted itself, but he was wondering if this might not be due to some faulty translation. He was answered by the reading of a paragraph from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> which he much appreciated. The next day we both went there together for a return visit, and a study in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> was started at once. When we left the man was invited to attend the public lecture on the Sunday ' and the study following it. He came to these meetings and listened very attentively, whereupon he provided himself with a copy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font6"> and ordered a copy of the Aeir </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures. </span><span class="font6">Arrangements were also made to have a regular study started at his home. All of this was very nice, but the touching thing about it was that that man is blind. How happy and grateful we are that we have the great privilege of helping even literally blind persons to see the wonderful things which our God has prepared for the meek of heart.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark261"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark262"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Situated in the center of Europe in one of the most famous spots of concentrated beauty is the little country of Switzerland. Here the Society has a branch office and printing plant and much printing has been done during the year, supplying French and German literature. There is still a lot of work to do in releasing the prisoners and those who are free to express the Word of God without hindrance are going ahead making a good announcement of Jehovah’s purposes. The branch servant sends in an interesting report and excerpts of it are published here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The past year has, under Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, been one of expansion. Twenty out of the 100 companies in the land attained their 34 per cent quota. The average publisher increase was 14 per cent, with a publisher peak of 2,728. The various language sections contributed as follows: German section increased by 12.8 per cent. French, 22.8 per cent (against 13 per cent last year) ; and Italian section, a 45 per cent increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A high light was the October district assembly in Basel, which repeated many of the New York convention features. Many of the 100 Swiss publishers who attended Yankee Stadium gave vivid reports. The public meeting attendance was 3,600 and following this enthusiastic assembly both units in Basel exceeded their 34 per cent quota, reporting a total of 352 peak of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A circuit assembly in Catholic Lucerne had an interesting feature. A Catholic young men’s club, reportedly encouraged by their priest, came to the public lecture intent on mischief. About 50 of them sat in the top gallery and soon began booing and stamping. Following the speaker’s appeal for quietness, the appearance on the balcony of a good squad of “heavyweight” ushers kept the disturbance under control. After the lecture, no less than four groups of them were receiving an intensive witness with open-Bible proof of the fallacy of Catholic tradition, and later some were seen leaving with a book, a booklet or a magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is in Catholic areas that much progress by pioneers has recently been made, despite clerical and police opposition. In a town where two pioneers worked with isolated Interest a company is now established with 21 publishers. Both companies in Italian-speaking Switzerland reached their 34 per cent quota. A lone pioneer working in the Catholic mountain valleys had the thrill of seeing the local company rise to 12 publishers, the 34 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reporting on another Catholic area a pioneer says: “Here fear of man is all-powerful. Recently while working with an interested person in a village, we reached the priest’s house. He invited us in and then began to crossexamine me like a prosecuting judge. First he wanted to know who sent us. I told him, 'Surely you know it is Christ that sends his disciples to preach the Kingdom.’ ‘Have you a permit?’ he asked. ‘Yes, the same as those that Jesus gave his disciples to preach his Kingdom till the end of this world.’ The priest then said he would call the police, so I reminded him this would be similar to the manner in which the scribes and Pharisees acted with Jesus when they denounced him to Pilate. The following week when I returned to the village, all told me the same thing, they had been warned that if they took our literature they would be excommunicated from the church. However, all listened and thus I placed two books. They wanted to know why the priest was against us and had prohibited their reading the books. Today a company of five is organized.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many interesting experiences are had by the Gilead graduates in the Geneva missionary home, which is located where many U. N. diplomats live. They often have occasion to witness to these men and two Bible studies are now held. It is quite interesting, they report, to hear some of the U. N. people admit the hopelessness of this failing organization and that the message preached by Jehovah’s witnesses seems to be the only reasonable hope for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This year has been no exception in producing its crop of legal problems, prominent being the ‘peddling without a license’ issue. Twenty cases were reported during the year, five were successfully settled out of court and eight cases came before courts, including the appeal case from last year in canton Vaud. This appeal came before the Swiss supreme court on September 3, 1950. This court considers written legal argument only, and over a long period has consistently ruled against us on the peddling issue. After some 70 minutes’ discussion the court handed down a 5 to 2 judgment against us, following the old precedents. Despite this judgment the publishers have continued boldly preaching, and two months thereafter in Lausanne, the seat of the supreme court and also in canton Vaud, a three-day district assembly was held featuring intensive house-to-house and street witnessing work. Not a single charge by the police! And Sunday witnessed the largest public meeting ever!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To crown the year came the London Internattonal convention, followed by Paris and Frankfurt, attended by many Swiss publishers w’ho have returned encouraged and strengthened, which we are sure will show its fruits in continued grand theocratic progress. A joy to close this year was the visit of over 250 American and Canadian brothers, including many from Brooklyn Bethel, to the Bern factory and office following the European conventions. So we look forward to yet more opportunities to “Praise Jah, . . . because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark263"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark264"></a>THAILAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This country is very interesting and Jehovah’s witnesses are having great joy in preaching the good news there where the Buddhist religion is most predominant. The present branch servant has done much to reorganize the work and excellent success has been the result. With the assistance of more Gilead graduates new fields have been opened and splendid increase has been observed during the past twelve months. Jehovah’s witnesses in Thailand have every reason to rejoice, because the “other sheep” are coming to the organization. The report on the activities of the year is very interesting and parts of it are published for our comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Early in the 1951 service year, two German pioneer brothers, who had pioneered in Thailand for many years, returned from Gilead’s 15th class. Shortly thereafter a circuit assembly was held in Nan, a native village in northern Thailand. Many of the brothers from the different sections of the north were present and rejoiced to hear the encouraging news concerning the New York assembly and the work of their fellow publishers In other lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On April 4 the long-awaited visit of Brother Knorr and Brother Henschel became a reality. Good news awaited our brothers upon their arrival. We had reached our 34 per cent increase in publishers! This had come in March, when 119 publishers reported time in the field. Arrangements had been made for a three-day assembly, which began shortly after Brother Knorr's arrival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The climax of the assembly came when 367 persons listened attentively to Brother Knorr’s public lecture “Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land” in the auditorium of the University of Moral and Political Sciences. The vast majority of those attending were people of good will, many of whom have Bible studies in their homes each week conducted by the missionaries and local pioneers. Brother Knorr’s visit was a great stimulus to both the missionaries and the native Thai publishers and pioneers. This is well shown by the fact that during that month, April, an alltime high of 126 publishers reported activity in the field service, a 42 per cent increase!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before Brother Knorr’s departure arrangements were made for the remodeling and painting of the Society’s premises in Bangkok, which serve as a branch and missionary home. Brother Gruber, who was in charge of the work of remodeling and painting the home, succeeded not only in saving the Society a considerable sum of money but also in turning the home into a convenient and beautiful place to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Eight missionaries are serving in Thailand at present, and all are trying hard to learn the difficult language of the Thai people. During the year good progress has been made in this respect and some of the missionaries are now delivering theocratic ministry talks in the Thai language, and all are now able to give a better witness to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year the special pioneer activity, a new feature of the work for Thailand, was begun. Two faithful Thai sisters were enrolled as special pioneer publishers and sent to the city of Nakorn Sritamaraj in southern Thailand, and another pioneer brother was sent as a special to the city of Chlengrai on the northern border. Though having worked in their special assignment only a few months, they already have many Bible studies in operation, and the prospects for the future appear quite good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The circuit servant’s visits during the year have contributed much to the increase of the work, and the experiences of the servant, Brother Burkhart, have certainly been many and unusual. Accompanied by a Thai pioneer brother as interpreter, he has visited the companies scattered among the jungle regions and rice fields in northern Thailand. For almost half of the year we have the “rainy season”, at the height of which come the heavy monsoon rains, turning many roads into a sea of mud and many times flooding large areas, making travel extremely difficult. Often it is necessary to go by oxcart or small boat, traveling along through the rice fields in order to reach the companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The circuit servant tells of working with one small company where it was necessary to walk barefoot through the mud all week long, sometimes wading through water knee-deep to reach the houses in order to give a witness. Public lectures are given anywhere a crowd can be gathered: schools, markets, under trees, in prhate homes and sometimes alongside the ever-present Buddhist temples. Musical recordings in the local dialect are played first and the people come running to hear the music. After a few minutes the lecture is begun and almost all remain to hear the message of the Kingdom. In many instances good interest has been manifest and in one trip around the circuit a total of 1,000 persons heard the lecture at 17 public talks. On his next visit to the companies, Brother Burkhart hopes to be able to deliver his public lecture in Thai without the aid of an interpreter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One interesting experience is that of a Thai man living high in the mountains of northern Thailand near the Burmese border. This man and his family had been converted from Buddhism to the Presbyterian religion several years before, but in many ways he was dissatisfied with the teachings of the church. One day his search for the truth was rewarded, for in the mail came a Thai copy of the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font6"> His sister, who lives in Bangkok, had obtained the book and, knowing of her brother’s interest in the Bible, had sent it to him. After reading </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font6"> he saw at once that it was the truth and began showing it to bis friends and the leaders of the church. The church leaders, of course, opposed his reading the book but some of his friends also agreed that it sounded like the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This new publisher is very joyful that he has found the truth and this is shown by the fact that during his first two months of field service he averaged 25 hours a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the coming of more Gilead missionaries soon and the opening of a new missionary home, it is certain that an even greater witness will be given during the coming service year, and we look confidently to Jehovah to give the increase as we continue to seek out and feed his “other sheep” in this land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark265"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark266"></a>TURKEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">At the present time there is not the freedom of speech in Turkey that there is in other democratic lands throughout the world. There are laws forbidding the spreading of propaganda. However, Jehovah’s witnesses in Turkey continue to preach the good news and to help the “other sheep”. It is not advisable to have public meetings, but one may talk to people and discuss the problems of the day in harmony with the scriptures dealing with these problems. Jehovah’s witnesses find many opportunities to do this. Progress has been made during the year and a few excerpts from the branch servant’s report are interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the close of the 1950 service year the expectations of the brothers in this land were running high. Prospects were now in view that an ample supply of the Society’s literature could be brought into the country through special arrangement. More teachers from Gilead were promised to come and there were hopes that a branch could be opened whereby the local problems could be handled more effectively. Throughout the service year the Watch Tower store was opened. Likewise, as was promised, more Gilead-trained teachers did come and a branch was established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To continue in the witness work in this land is extremely difficult. Despite the fact that a new Democratic party was voted into power early in 1950, and despite the fact that the president of Turkey, in his opening speech to the Turkish Parliament, declared on November 1, 1950, that “the Constitution is being looked into and all the articles contrary to the spirit of democracy will be done away with or replaced by new laws”, freedom of worship still does not exist in this land. Again, in February of 1951, the Parliament members in Ankara discussed religious matters in Turkey. During the session one member said that from the 14th of May this year ‘everybody will be allowed to freely practice his religious duties and to make prayer freely’. So, with those promises it was hoped that during the year of 1951 Turkey would join with the other democratic lands and grant freedom of worship to her subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the night of March 23, Memorial night, Jehovah’s blessings upon the activities of the brothers was clearly made manifest, for 70 persons attended this celebration, with three partaking of the emblems. This was like a small convention to these brothers, as it was the first time In the history of the work here that all the pioneers and company publishers could meet together in one large hall. Surely Jehovah was pouring out his blessings upon the efforts of the brothers under the newly established branch arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord’s “other sheep” are being found and they are not afraid to identify themselves. The following experience that one of our missionaries had will prove that point. This is what she writes: “A study was started with an interested lady on the subject of the parable of the sower. From the very first study she expressed unusual interest and it was not long until she showed herself to be of the right kind of soil because she immediately started witnessing to all her relatives and friends. She started attending the company meetings with a friend of hers and now within a month’s time they are both publishers full of joy and enthusiasm and attend the meetings more regularly than many of the other publishers do.” Thus we can see that the Lord’s “other sheep” respond gladly when the Kingdom message is presented to them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark267"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark268"></a>URUGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses in Uruguay continue to call out to the “other sheep” to associate with them in the grand work of proclaiming the Kingdom. They are associating rapidly in a marvelous way and a splendid witness is being given in this small country. The work, however, is not done without opposition, and the priests of that land object strenuously to the good work that Jehovah’s witnesses are doing in educating the people in the Bible. The branch servant’s report is beneficial for all the Lord’s servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the arrival of seven additional missionaries In December and two In April the number of Gilead graduates here totaled twenty-one, living in three different missionary homes. These have set the proper example, especially in conducting home Bible studies, and now the company publishers average close to one study each throughout the country. This foundation work produced a high number of publishers, more than 34 percent above the previous peak. Studying the Bible an hour each week has impressed in the minds of many people the vision of Jehovah’s kingdom and how it will usher in an even better life than they now live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For that reason many have gradually accustomed themselves to attend the Kingdom Hall meetings, and their numbers have increased so much that we find our present halls too small and we are looking for new ones. Five years ago it used to be a problem to get enough people to fill our one hall, but now we find the job is to get more halls to hold so many people, and especially so in the capital city of Montevideo. To accommodate the many new attenders some good people have opened up their private homes for company meeting places. One brother tore out a brick wall between the bedroom and dining room to enlarge it, and this year is going to do away with another wall to make it still larger. Six missionaries in a small city were holding their meetings in the garage of the missionary home, but now find that they are going to have to enlarge their dining room and use it to accommodate the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a border city a police commissioner, overflowing with a desire to carry out the theocratic commission that he sees so neccessary, gave up his police work and recently filled out an application to organize the 25 people who attend the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study in his house into a company of eleven publishers. The Lord's spirit has certainly operated freely in this active Isolated man. He has permitted it to flow without obstruction, because although he was a public official in a small town lie was not ashamed to confess publicly his faith in God’s kingdom. He spoke the truth so openly and with such joy and enthusiasm that all of the town respect this energetic and wide-awake person and do not speak a single word to his discredit personally. Some (to them in a rather complimentary way) even call him the priest of the town, no doubt recognizing that he is doing the work that the priests should have been doing all these years. He has made a change in occupation. Now he carries prisoners from their false religion to the meetings in the same truck that he used to use to lock up the lawbreakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another experience of a pioneer in one of the small towns Is very interesting. The pioneer had gone into a hotel lunchroom and had seated himself at a large table, which is the custom, as all the guests eat together. There was a priest at the table and he was talking to the people there about a certain man, a stranger, who had come into the town with poisonous teachings. He said this man was criticizing and protesting against the church. He turned to the pioneer and asked: “You are the fellow, aren’t you?” The pioneer pointed out that he was preaching the Bible to the people from house to house and he planned to continue that work. The priest warned him that if he went any more to the houses of the people he would follow the witness with a sound car.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The priest did just that. He announced: “Be on the alert, all Catholic citizens. This strange man is protesting against the Immaculate Mother, our holy miraculous Lady In heaven.” Of course, he said other things too. but he kept this up for three and a half hours while the witness of Jehovah calmly went from door to door preaching the message of the Kingdom. Many books were placed by this pioneer and crowds gathered around him from time to time to ask him questions. He was able to give a splendid witness. The priest told those within the hearing of his voice to bring the books that they obtained to him and he would have a public burning. However, this never came oft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a few weeks the circuit servant came and a public meeting was announced and 80 people came out to hear this talk. At the close of his lecture he asked where the priest was who had offended the minister who was going from door to door, and the speaker inquired if the priest hadn’t come there to talk at the same time. A voice from the darkness answered: “I am over here.” So the reply from the speaker was: ‘‘Why don’t you come out into the light so that we can see you.” He did come to the platform, but he was stopped by a policeman who said he should wait until he gets permission to speak. The circuit servant concluded his talk, finishing his remarks with information pertaining directly to the matter of the immortality of the human soul, and from the Scriptures he showed there is no such thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At this point the priest insisted that the human soul was immortal, so the witness handed the priest a Catholic Spanish Bible and invited the priest to take his turn and talk and to prove his point from the Bible. The priest said that that would be easy and referred to the death of Martha’s brother Lazarus. He searched desperately for the account but could not find it. Then the witness offered to help him and proceeded to point out the chapter and the book in the Bible. But even then the priest could not find what he wanted. He was very much confused before this restless audience that wanted him to do some talking. In desperation the priest said that the witness had given him the wrong kind of Bible; what he wanted was a Catholic Bible. The circuit servant took the Bible from his hands and then read to the audience a portion in the front of the Bible, showing that it had the approval of the archbishop of Spain. At this point the audience began to laugh at the priest because he had not even recognized the Bible of his own religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The priest never did find anything in the Bible nor State anything that proved that man had an immortal soul. He could not refute Jehovah’s witnesses. Finally someone called out: “Is the talk finished?” Then the brother said: “Yes, it is all over.” The people started to leave, and then the priest jumped up on the speaker’s stand bitterly bemoaning the fact that the people had listened to a foreigner and had rejected their own priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the people were gone the lights were turned out and the priest was still left there in the dark. The priest was so furious he wanted to fight the circuit servant, but a policeman took over then and told the priest to go home. If the Catholic Church’s teachings are based on God’s Word, then their priests ought to know how to use it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So a good work goes on in Uruguay and the people are hearing the news of the Kingdom and are seeking after it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark269"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark270"></a>VENEZUELA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah God’s active force has made the work grow and prosper again in this land of Venezuela. It has been a most fruitful season for the cultivators and the waterers of this fertile field in South America. The increases have been most unusual. The publishers more than doubled during the year, from 224 to 474, and they reached a peak, in addition to that, of 588. There are a lot of “other sheep” seeking after truth and righteousness and Jehovah’s witnesses in Venezuela are helping them all they can. The branch servant reports the following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The service year started off with an average of 224 publishers in the field, but later eight new peaks were established, and the season was finished with an average of 474. This resulted in a 112 per cent increase, for which we thank the Lord. He has been very kind to us in giving such a rich increase. The companies also doubled, as they grew in number from seven to fourteen. At Memorial time it was a real joy to see a total of 901 persons in attendance, to compare with last year’s 299. During the year 120 symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by water immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Early in the service year after the New York convention delegates had returned, we had an interesting assembly for all Venezuela. The program was similar to the one used in New York, and the new light was much appreciated by all. Some interesting experiences were given. One pioneer brother told of clergy pressure in the city of El Tigre to prevent free assembly by the witnesses in their Kingdom Hall. By proper explanation given to the civil authorities their meetings were resumed, to Jehovah’s glory. The company servant of Maracaibo told how eight months ago a person of good will, mother of a large family, began to come to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> study, and after two months’ study in her home began to go in the service. Now there are six of her children who are just as active as she In all features of the work. The peak attendance of the assembly was 228, who came out In a heavy downpour of rain to hear the talk “Can Xou Live Forever in Happiness on Earth?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ranks of the missionaries were increased and three new homes were established, in Valencia, Barquisimeto, and Maracay. Now 33 specially trained planters and waterers are at work to care for the people of good will in Venezuela. One full-time worker reported this experience: “While engaging in the door-to-door work a householder told me of a friend who had one of our books and was very interested. After several attempts the man was found and he explained that having obtained the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Kingdom Is at Hand’ </span><span class="font6">several years ago, he had studied it thoroughly and was holding a study with a friend of his. He was overjoyed to hear about the work, especially to learn that there was an organization with which he could associate. He now attends meetings, goes in the service, conducts three studies, and wants to be baptized at the next opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last November a full-time circuit servant was appointed, and during the year he had many thrilling experiences while visiting the companies and isolated groups of publishers. One outstanding experience was when he visited an isolated group In a small village inside the heavy jungle near the Orinoco river delta. The only means of transportation to this village being by boat or canoe, one of the brothers who owns a boat came up the San Juan river to Caripito, the nearest river port, to get the circuit servant. After three hours’ ride in the little boat they reached the village, and apparently this brother was very well known in the village of 800 inhabitants, as he introduced the circuit servant to almost everyone in town, including the owner of the village theater. The theater owner was very surprised that a minister had come to their village to teach the Bible; so he offered his theater free for the public talk “They Shall Not Labor in Vain”. The talk was advertised by these few publishers and brought excellent results, with 100 persons responding to the invitation. After the public talk several persons of good will expressed their appreciation for the information given on the Word of God, one saying, “That’s what we need, a minister to educate us in the Word of God.” The owner of the theater was glad about the reaction of the people toward the message, and wanted the minister to come back to conduct a series of lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While visiting the company in Puerto La Cruz, he had another occasion to be joyful, seeing how the Shepherd gathers his “other sheep” in strange ways. In 1949 there was a pioneer here who planted some ‘seed’ among the people of good will. When the circuit servant came around, to his surprise, there were 25 of these persons publishing, without literature or mature help. A total of 83 came to hear the service talk and 108 for the public talk, most of them neighbors who were invited by word of mouth. The auditorium used was a natural one alongside the Neverl river. It was the first time the new brothers had a big attendance like this, and so they were convinced that a multitude of “other sheep” will yet associate with them in dispensing the good news. Yes, indeed, the harvest is great but the workers few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The visit to a small company of four publishers in Las Piedras brought many joys and privileges, as It is almost virgin territory. The publishers couldn’t go out every day; so the circuit servant went to work by himself. Not having any books or booklets to offer, he presented the magazines. To his surprise 62 magazines were quickly placed with the friendly people of this territory. Most of them asked him to come in and sit down, thus giving a chance to explain a little more the importance of the message contained in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brothers printed some handbills to advertise the public talk and the oil company granted them the auditorium of a club. Sunday morning they distributed all the handbills around the neighborhood. At seven o’clock, the time to start, nobody was there, but five minutes later the people began rushing in until 93 persons of good will filled the hall. When the talk concluded all the literature available disappeared in less than five minutes, and the brothers were glad to realize that some day there might be a big company of Jehovah’s witnesses composed of these very same people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So ends another year of giving praise to Jah, and the publishers of Venezuela are thankful for the part they have had in piling up a great witness to His name. The branch is now five years old, and one can begin to see the result of the planting and watering that took place several years ago. The Lord is giving the increase and it is hoped to attain another 100 per cent increase in the coming year. With the prospect of publishers and companies in every village and city of this large country we know there is still a great work to be done. It will be accomplished by Jehovah’s grace and to the honor of his great name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark271"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark272"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah, in his goodness, has seen to it that spiritual food has reached our brothers in Yugoslavia. They certainly need the strength and comfort that comes from the Lord’s Word and they have benefited greatly by it during the year. Times are still very difficult and it is impossible to go about with freedom of speech telling the people of the Kingdom as they do in other lands. The government there wants no one to preach God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But here again we find an increase in the number of publishers proclaiming the good news. The brothers are constantly trying to find ways and means to feed the truth to others and the Lord is blessing them in this arrangement. Good success is the result. A report came through from Yugoslavia this year and you will be interested in how our brothers there feel and what they are doing to magnify the Lord’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When we see how the Devil, through his instruments, continues to make every effort to discourage us and stop us, it is necessary for us to have full faith and confidence in Jehovah and the conviction that it is his will that the Kingdom message be preached among all the nations before the end comes. Such preaching being his will, no power can stop this work, and we must always look out for opportunities of talking the truth to our neighbors. This the faithful in this country have done. As the flow of truth improves and widens, they will be able to do even more and others will join them and speak of the Kingdom as the only hope and of the glorious prospect of life eternal in the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of the 18 brothers sentenced in February 1947, 9 are still in prison. After these, other publishers got shorter or longer sentences, so that at present there are 20 of our brothers in prison. All these we regularly help with food packages. In this respect we were very grateful to the Lord that we received from abroad some food and a quantity of clothes, shoes, etc. With these we were able to help many destitute ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is our resolution to serve faithfully with the Lord's help under the direction of his “faithful and discreet slave” and to thus participate with our feeble strength in the vindication of his holy name. We do not know what the Lord in his wisdom will permit to come upon us yet, but whatever may be our experiences in the future we will ask him to strengthen us so that we may endure faithfully to the end. For this we pray and thank Jehovah, to whom all praise is due.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark273"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark274"></a>IN APPRECIATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are very grateful to their God for the undeserved kindness shown to them, for truly it is a privilege and honor to be one of those called to declare the good news to the nations. The congregation of the body of Christ, which had its beginning nineteen hundred years ago, was chosen especially by God to do this great work. Today there is a remnant of this body of Christ still upon the earth. But they are not alone in making this expression of appreciation, because today thousands upon thousands of “other sheep” are busying themselves with the Kingdom interests. Christ Jesus has informed us that he has “other sheep”, and these he will gather together so that there will be one Shepherd and one flock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The report of Jehovah’s witnesses as set forth in this </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font8"> for 1952 shows that there is one flock and that all of the flock have the one Shepherd. The report reveals their joy in service and the happiness they have in associating one with another in declaring the good news of the Kingdom in all parts of the world as they have opportunity. All of these witnesses of Jehovah are “keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah” (2 Pet. 3:12, AB<sup>7</sup>), for they know the day is not far distant when this wicked system of things will be completely destroyed and Jehovah God, through his reigning King Christ Jesus, will usher in the new world of righteousness for those who love Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, even in this present evil world, these witnesses of the Most High God do not find it such a great burden to be Christians. It is true</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you. Take my yoke upon you and become my disciples, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for your souls. For my yoke is kindly and my load is light.” (Matt. 11: 28-30, A<sup>T</sup>W) Compare the two classes in the world today: Those who have accepted Jehovah God’s undeserved kindness and have gone ahead in preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, and those who have not and who prefer to stay with the old wicked world. Which of the two groups have the greater sorrows and the greater load to carry? At one time those who are now Jehovah’s witnesses were sighing and crying because of the abominations that were loaded upon them while they were in Babylon, but they heard the call from others of Jehovah’s witnesses who were saying to the prisoners, “Go forth!” Thousands have come forth, as you will see on the chart of their year’s activity. All of them were loaded down with the anxieties of this system of things at one time, but now they are refreshed because they have come to Christ Jesus and have gotten under his yoke with him. They have become his disciples. They are learning from him. Now they see things from an altogether different viewpoint. A new world is just ahead. They know this. They are thinking differently. They have turned to God’s Word and are able to begin making their minds over. Now their appreciation of better living has been greatly enhanced. Living now is something worth while because they have something good to do. It is not just working for the old world and striving and fighting to get ahead and eking out an existence. They are no longer serving old world dictators and bosses who domineer over them. Now they see clearly that a new world of righteousness will be established and that the King is mild-tempered and lowly in heart. They have a hope of everlasting life in peace and happiness in that new world. Even now they have found refreshment for their souls because they have come to know the King Christ Jesus and Jehovah their God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work or yoke that Jehovah God through his Son Christ Jesus has given them is kindly and Christ’s load is light. He has not asked us to do more than we possibly can and he has given us all the advice and comfort that one should need in these last days so as to keep our joy and pleasure in living bright in our lives. Jehovah’s witnesses do appreciate what God has done for them and that they have come to a knowledge of him and his Son and that they have the glorious privilege of proclaiming the good news of his kingdom throughout the world. They have come to know that selfishness is of no value. It gets one nowhere. But the undeserved kindness of God shown to the “other sheep” has taught them how to love one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All of those who are associated with Jehovah’s witnesses, whether they have been in the Lord’s visible organization a long time or a short time, are very much interested in the growth of the organization, because it is building itself up in love. Love is the attribute upon which Jehovah’s organization works and is held together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the past twelve months the president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society had the opportunity to visit 52 assemblies of God’s people in all parts of the world. These witnesses were scattered through 35 countries, as far west of New York city as Burma, as far south as Australia, and as far east as Finland. He found Jehovah’s witnesses in all of these countries working together in love and at unity. He found them wholly devoted to Jehovah God. They asked the president of the Society to express their love and greetings to all their fellow workers in other parts of the world. It is a real pleasure to do this through the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook, </span><span class="font8">and it was also his privilege to convey these greetings in person as the opportunity was afforded while visiting different conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is interesting, too, to observe that during his visit to the brothers in these 35 countries visited in 12 months, the president of the Society gave 52 public talks to an aggregate audience of 299,236 persons. It certainly was a pleasure to meet with so many “sheep” during the year and to have the warm fellowship that is found only among those who have shared in the undeserved kindness of Jehovah God. Love permeates the whole organization, and that is what is making the visible organization of Jehovah God grow continually, all to his honor and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am very grateful to the Lord for the opportunity of again submitting this report on behalf of the Society. I hope it brings joy and gladness to the hearts of all of Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere and that all of you will continue in love, serving Jehovah God and promoting clean, undefiled worship, and eventually gain eternal life in the new world of righteousness.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark276"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark277"></a>Annual Meeting</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">Pursuant to the charter and bylaws of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, a nonprofit Pennsylvania corporation, the members of this corporation met on October 1, 1951, at ten o’clock in the forenoon in the offices of the Society located in the Wabash Building, 410 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">22, </span><span class="font7">Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to the facts presented by the secretary and treasurer of the Society, there was present a quorum necessary to transact the business. In the absence of the president of the Society, Nathan H. Knorr, who was in Europe, the Society’s vicepresident, Fred W. Franz, presided. One of the matters of business at this meeting was the election of directors to fill three vacancies occasioned by the expiration of the terms of Milton G. Henschel, Nathan H. Knorr and Lyman A. Swingle, who were elected on October 1, 1948, for a term of three years. At this meeting these same three persons were re-elected to fill the positions of directors for another three-year term.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Other matters that were brought before the attention of the members present were letters received from different individuals who are members of the corporation but who were unable to attend. These letters conveyed greetings from Finland, Switzerland, Hungary, Romania and a number of other places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lyman A. Swingle gave a brief discourse outlining the accomplishments of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society since its organization. He showed how Jehovah’s witnesses were faithfully carrying out the work God had for them to do at this time. Grant Suiter, the secretary and treasurer, gave a report on the international convention held at London, England, as he was present at that assembly. Following this interesting report, Fred W. Franz, who had </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">255 </span><span class="font7">visited a number of European conventions during the summer just past, talked on Isaiah, chapter 49, showing the organization of Jehovah’s people and the accomplishment of His work through it. He also urged the brothers to attend the Washington, D.C., convention, October 12 to 14, 1951. The meeting closed with a motion duly made and seconded that the members of the corporation send their love and greetings to all their brothers throughout the earth and that mention of this should be made in the 1952 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The meeting of this corporation again showed the unity and oneness of action on the part of God’s servants. All are very grateful that Jehovah God has blessed the work of this corporation in its service to Jehovah and his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few weeks later, at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 2, New York, the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Pennsylvania corporation, met and unanimously elected Nathan H. Knorr as president, Fred W. Franz as vice-president, Grant Suiter as secretary and treasurer and Hugo II. Riemer as assistant secretary and treasurer. The board of directors is happy in its privilege of service and the members of the board will do everything they can, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, to advance the interests of the Kingdom and promote true worship throughout the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Say to the prisoners, Go forth.”—</span><span class="font7">iIsaiah 49: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Are people free to think as they wish? Do individuals have the freedom to worship according to the dictates of their own consciences? Are the masses of humanity in the world today free from fear and want? Will mankind ever be free from sickness, sorrow and eventual death? At some time in every person’s life these questions will run through his mind, whether he be a Christian or a heathen, whether he be an agnostic or an atheist. People do not like to be fenced in, penned up or, especially, imprisoned. But how to gain this desired freedom is everyone’s problem. The entire world is divided up into sections, and these sections are controlled by certain political bodies or religious authorities. Too often, too, commerce plays a powerful hand in the regulation of the affairs, political and religious. No matter to what continent of earth you turn, you find the people held in subjection to this great world organization. How will they ever be free from the oppressiveness and ignorance, free from want for so many things?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s Word, the Bible, gives us the answer. When one reads God’s Word and believes it he can free his mind from the bondage into which it has been driven and held. The Word of God is a Book of Freedom. Jehovah’s witnesses in all parts of the world are taking that book into the homes of the people and are educating them along the lines expressed in that good Book, the Bible. If people read this good news they become enlightened as to why mankind has been hemmed in, why he has been brought into a subservient condition, why he cannot enjoy life by serving this old system of things. The more he studies God’s Word and sees what Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">has purposed for men, the greater becomes his freedom of mind and body. It is not long before an honest-hearted person gains this accurate knowledge of the purposes of the Lord and takes his stand for Jehovah’s kingdom, which will bring him life, liberty, peace and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who have this freedom now “say to the prisoners, Go forth”. (Isaiah 49:9) And they will continue to say this until such time as all those who are held in bondage and who want to be freed come forth to serve the Most High God Jehovah. In the days when the apostles were working diligently to announce the good news of the kingdom of the Most High they had hands laid on them and they were put in public places of custody. In Acts 5:17-21 the account shows us how during the night Jehovah’s angel opened the doors of the prison and brought the apostles out. And he said to them: “Be on your way and take a position in the temple and keep on speaking to the people all the sayings about this life.” “After hearing this, they entered into the temple at daybreak and began to teach.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(NW)</span><span class="font7"> Worldly religion, which was being taught by the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the priests in the days of Jesus, was a hard thing to break away from. But when someone gained his freedom from false religion he was freed for a purpose, and that purpose was to preach, just as stated above concerning the apostles. The command was given them to “keep on speaking to the people all the sayings about this life”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus was fully cognizant of his commission from his heavenly Father, as set forth in Isaiah 61. Therein it was stated of him: “He sent me forth to preach a release to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send the crushed ones away with a release, to preach Jehovah’s acceptable year.” That is the way Jesus stated it when he was in the synagogue. (Luke 4:18,19, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font7"> He knew the people had to be enlightened concerning the kingdom of God, the only hope of the world. He knew he was on earth to declare good news to the people, and certainly the good news he had was a release to those who had been captives to this old devilish world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The wmrld’s human population is really in prison in Babylon. And the work that Jesus started in freeing some from this Babylonish system has continued to this day, and now’ thousands upon thousands are freeing themselves because they have learned that the truth set forth in the Book of Freedom sets one free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Are you going to be made free? Are you going to remain free after having gained that blessed freedom? Jehovah’s witnesses answer they will by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness. Having been freed from this old world’s way of thinking, they think as God thinks, as he has expressed himself in his Word. They preach God’s thoughts to the people that they may be free in heart and mind and be lifted out of the bondage of this dying old world. We are living in a glorious time. We are in the days w’hen from one end of the earth to the other we, as Jehovah’s witnesses, must declare to the prisoners: “Go forth!” Let us keep on declaring that good message. Let us keep on teaching these prisoners and let them become free men and w’omen, as Jehovah’s witnesses are all over the w’orld.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah is a great Ood, and a great King above all gods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 95:3, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you make the living and true God your refuge, you cannot have any part with the demons, the false gods. You must serve the purpose of the true God and must tell others what his purpose is. In. this time of world opposition to him you must prove he is your refuge and strength by believing and acting in harmony with his testimony. (Isa. 43: 10-12) What a God he is! Before him all the false gods must shortly bow in defeat at Armageddon. He is to be feared, rather than the totalitarian aggressors bent on world conquest for enthroning their political gods and form of religion everywhere. Those who make him their refuge and who trust in his strength credit him with godship. (Ps. 96:4; 97 : 9) Because he supplies secret strength to his witnesses, they have been able to endure the most determined and fiendish persecution from human agents of the false gods. Greedy dictators craving world empire have punished those who would not join iu idolizing them. But when these dictators went down, Jehovah’s witnesses have lived on.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore openly confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may get healed.</span><span class="font6">—Jas. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5:16,</span><span class="font6"> jVW.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark282"></a><span class="font6">By praying for those who are spiritually sick and who plainspokenly confess their sins to us and seek our spiritual aid they “may get healed’’, spiritually so. This saves them from lapsing into spiritual death which would end up in their destruction from all future life. In their case Almighty God would destroy “both soul and body in Gehenna”. (Matt. 10:28, .VIF; Jas. 5 : 19, 20) Those sins which the spiritually sick person confessed and from which you prayed for him to be healed will be covered over. God will remember them no more, but will renew his peaceful relations with the returned sinner. It is by the sin-canceling blood of Jesus that the sins are thus covered over, but your prayer helped to move the divine arrangement of things to such a result. For such a privilege of lifesaving service you can be very thankful. Il<sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send,...?... And he said, do, and tell this people.—Isa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6:8,9, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The divine service had a claim higher than family obligations. And so as Isaiah could arrange his domestic affairs he would leave his home and go to the people and tell them what God told him to tell. He built up a company of disciples or pupils. (Isa. 8:16) The people were not sent for, but God sent his spokesman to them. The Greater Isaiah and his disciples, that is, Jesus and his apostles, showed that it is the right way for those sent by God to go to the homes of the people. So the Isaiah class remnant today do not stand on invitation by the people, nor are they sought out by the people of Israel’s modern counterpart, Christendom. Jehovah takes the initiative and sends and commands them to go to the people. Since they are under a vow of dedication to him and since they have volunteered, they must go, and the authorities of Christendom have no right to stop them. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Also the rich man died and was buried. And in Hades he lifted up his eyes.—Luke</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">16:22,23, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was still more deadly than John the Baptist to the “rich man” class in their linen and purple clothing and at their sumptuous table. Declaring themselves righteous, they once appeared lofty in the eyes of the Lazarus class, but they were actually disgusting in God’s sight. Jesus exposed them as suchtotheLaz-arus class. Thus he stripped them of their linen of self-righteousness. He disrobed them of their purple claims to royalty in God’s kingdom when he said that the harlots, sinners, and tax collectors of the beggar class went into the Kingdom before them. He climaxed this with the awful judgment: “The kingdom of God will be taken from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits.” (Matt. 21: 43, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> He spoiled their religious table for them when he turned from them and committed the Kingdom mysteries and the privilege of Kingdom preaching to the poor Lazarus class. When they killed him, this sealed their death to God’s favor. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">You are going to hear of wars and reports of wars; see that you are not terrified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 24:6, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses copy Jesus and obey his instructions. That is why they have not joined worldly armies and taken part in the war efforts of the nations in any way. This does not mean they are pacifists opposed to war and resisting it and interfering with worldly governments in prosecuting wars of aggression or of defense. They could not be warresisters, for they submit to the fulfillment of Jesus’ words ahout the consummation of this system of things. Asked by his disciples, “When will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence and of the consummation of the system of things?” he told them: “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.” (IfW) So how could the Christian witnesses of Jehovah oppose worldly wars or try to prevent them since Jesus prophesied that they were certain to be fought? He did not tell them they would be in the fighting. They would merely hear them or hear reports of them. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, a man with a measuring line in' his hand. Then said I, Whither goest thouf And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem.—Zech. 2:1,2, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The class prefigured by the young man was quite a small organization during 1914-1918. for then there was only a remnant of God’s faithful people who were truly examining the prophecies and trying to ascertain their meaning in order to find out what their work would be in this great organization of Jerusalem. They wanted its measure and wanted to know more about God’s work. Today we find in the earth a group of Christian men and women who, like this young man, are sincerely interested in the Jerusalem which is above and which is the mother of us all. (Gal. 4:26. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> They are really interested in God’s organization and in its expansion. Walls are not its boundaries. No, it is an expanding city like an unwalled village. Due to its constant growth because of incoming crowds, it would be hard to take accurate measurements. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By his stripes there is healing for us.—Isa. 53: 5, Ro.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not by any mysterious course in metaphysics, mesmerism, or other hypnotic power, but by direct grant, Jesus conferred on his specially chosen disciples the authority to perform physical cures. With the express command that they were to do these without financial charge! Then he died a martyr's death for our everlasting healing. Did the divine health program abruptly cease for all time at Jesus’death?No ; Jehovah God saved it from collapse by raising him from the dead to take his seat at God's right hand in heaven and there exercise all authority for God in heaven and on earth. At Pentecost this Jesus poured out holy spirit upon his faithful disciples on earth. With it he conferred upon many of them the gift of miraculous physical healing power. Thus the health program from heaven went on among mankind. The miraculous healings and cures of human hodies continued on till the last of the apostles and their Christian associates died. By then the church was established in faith. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Let marriage he honorable among all, and the marriage bed be without defilement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 13:4, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah established an honorable thing in marriage between man and woman. Jesus Christ his Son dignified marriage. He did not himself marry as a man—the divine purpose did not include his marriage on earth—but he accepted an invitation to a wedding in Cana of Galilee and contributed to the joy there by turning water into wine for the wedding guests. He also used marriage celebrations to illustrate truths about the kingdom of the heavens. He was used by Jehovah God to restore marriage to its original Edenic level. The Creator made woman for man that by marrying the two he might people this earth with a perfect human race, all issuing from one parenthood, all one flesh and blood, bound together by ties of family relationship. God’s means to an end are always honorable and bring credit to him as Creator. His will is that marriage must always be held in honor by his worshipers. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 119:99.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What place does God’s Word occupy in our lives? Do we place it above the word of everybody else, above human fihilosophies and man-made re-igious traditions and the commands of men which run contrary to God’s will? If w-e follow God’s Word and keep his commands through it and pay attention to its advice, we shall have God’s approval and blessing. It will work for our spiritual good, keeping us always in the relationship of children to Him and under his protection by his angels, and guaranteeing to us the gift of eternal life for our faithfulness. God assures us, as he did the Israelites of old, that if we take heed to his Word we shall avoid much trouble and grief. But if we do not consult and keep familiar with his Word and do what it says, we shall run into personal, private trouble and difficulty and we shall miss the divine approval and blessing. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Become doers of the word, and not hearers only.—Jas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1:22, SW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If people of this world followed the Bible, they would not kill one another, but would beat sword into plowshare. Nation would not lift up sword against nation. Nor would they learn war anymore. Would not that be practical? Would not the Bible prohibition on stealing and bribery be a good guide for politicians? In Israel the kings were to have a copy of God’s law for guidance; politicians today have the Bible. It would be a blessing if they followed it as much as they quote it. As for the economic system that makes the few rich and the many poor, it could not so operate under Bible principles, which in several ways made provision for the poor. And would not the Bible be practical in stemming the rising tide of crime, turning it back, drying it up completely? Obedience to its commands would eliminate fornication, adultery, divorce and broken homes, venereal disease and illegitimate children. Moral parents would teach children. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For as often as you eat this loaf and drink this cup, you keep proclaiming the death of the Lord, until he arrives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 11:26, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord Jesus died A.D. 33. For nineteen centuries since then his obedient disciples have observed this supper, or evening meal, on the proper day of each year. The celebration of it annually until this year 1952 has meant its celebration more than 1,900 times, which makes it “often” indeed. Contrary to the claims of some religionists, Jesus personally has not had to suffer again that many times, that “often”, because the apostle Paul says not. (Heb. 9:2426) In this twentieth century a faithful remnant of his “little flock” continues obediently to observe the Lord’s evening meal. For this people upon whom his great name is called Jehovah God has provided this cup and table. These things he provides in order to unify his people as one body, with all members of it being at peace with one another, helping and serving one another. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Not general worldly knowledge, such as the terrific speeds now attained through modernday inventions, but something far different. The running to and fro is with regard to searching after knowledge; it means to read earnestly and thoroughly, to the end that the student might be taught. Jehovah purposed that the prophecies given to Daniel should be fulfilled and clearly revealed in the “last days” of the Gentile nations, and thereby knowledge would be increased. Until Jehovah's set time comes to fulfill the prophecy and to give his spirit to his people, impelling them to search his Word diligently through and through, as it were, page by page, prophecy by prophecy, no one could possibly have an accurate understanding. At best, it would be a guess. Understanding has been reserved for the “consummation of the system of things”, in which we have been since A.D. 1914. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Who hath despised the day of small things?—Zech. 4:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A.D. 1914 a new system of things was coming in and replacing the old. So in these last days a 4,000-year-old world is to end, and a new world is to come in. The fulfillment of prophecy may seem to some insignificant; but do not be deceived. Keep in mind that a great mountain, which filled the earth full as it were, grew out of a small stone cut out of tho mountain without human hands. When Jehovah sets his hand to accomplish any purpose, it is done and no power anywhere is able to prevent him, for He is almighty. His people will yet endure much brutal persecution, for they still live in an ungodly wicked world, but their unity and peace which arise out of knowing they arc the nucleus of the new earth society will never be shattered. Never will they be broken to Eieces by the enemy's power.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">A </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">certain beggar named Lazarus used to be put at his gate, full of ulcers and desiring to be filled with the things dropping from the table of the rich man.-Lukel6:20,21,NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Jewish name indicates the beggar to be a Jew, not a Gentile. It is a Greek form of the name “Eleazar”, meaning “God is helper”. The facts show this “beggar” class began with Jews, out it was enlarged to include Gentiles, so that today it is mostly Gentile. Lazarus was of the same Jewish community with the rich man. No wall of partition was between them because of rape or natural extraction. The difference between them was because of the superiority and privileges which the religious clergy had selfishly assumed to themselves. The beggar Lazarus therefore pictures the poor who realized their spiritual need, of the Jews then and of Christendom now. Being spiritually neglected by the lofty religions leaders who held them in disdain, they naturally became ulcerous and siek spiritually. To such neglected, diseased ones Jesus came to minister God’s healing Word. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">flesh.—2 Cor. 10:3, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses have conscientious objection to taking part in the war and defense efforts of Christendom and the rest of the world, their objection being based on God’s Word the Bible. But how can they be conscientious objectors and not at the same time pacifists? They are not against war between the nations, and they do not interfere with the war efforts of the nations nor with anyone who can conscientiously join in such efforts. They fight only when God commands them to do so, because then it is theocratic warfare. Were they today to claim to be pacifists, it would mean for them to denounce all the preChristian witnesses of Jehovah who took up arms to uphold Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and his theocratic nation of Israel. But this denunciation we cannot make. Jesus never did so. Jehovah himself is no pacifist. Neither are his witnesses such, though they are conscientious objectors. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Acts 10: 38, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah said to his fellow worker, his only-begotten Son who became the Jewish Messiah : “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” (Gen. 1:26) So Jehovah the Creator and his Sou Christ Jesus know all about the human system, a joint creation of theirs. They knew how to make it function perfectly at the beginning. They know what nut it out of order down till this day. They know what to do to rid it of every disturbance and put it in perfect running order again. This knowledge they will fully prove in the righteous new world now so near. Still, all through human history, from man’s fall into sickness and death, Jehovah has revealed himself as the divine Healer. He especially manifested his power to beal by his beloved Son when on earth as the “man Christ Jesus”. No physical affliction in others could resist his treatment, not even death. It was God’s spirit or active force operating through Jesus that did this. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And I heard the voice of the Lord, saving, Whom shall I send?—Isa. 6:8, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is Jehovah that asks this, because he is the One that does the sending of his witnesses and ambassadors. He was the One that sent Jesus his Son to earth to prove himself “the faithful and true witness”. Isaiah of old had children. Jesus is the Greater Isaiah to whom Jehovah has given children, namely, his anointed followers, and these, too, Jehovah sends forth to preach and bear witness. To carry the genuine divine message to others they must be sent or commissioned by Jehovah. Without the ordination with which the Most High God sends his representatives a person docs not come in God’s name. But being sent by God’s authorization he does not have to ask permission from anyone to preach. The invitation to service from Jehovah at his temple was given as a general call, and the opportunity was opened for anyone who heard to respond. Like Isaiah, the remnant were free to respond in 1919. The clergy failed to. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">As we get closer to the battle of Armageddon, we do not know what cataclysmic forces will be operated by Jehovah God to overwhelm this world and blot it out. The political, military, commercial and religious elements of this world are certain to quake with fear at the sights and sounds and to grow frantic at the sure prospect of destruction for themselves. We under God’s kingdom shelter need not fear. We may naturally be frightened, as Moses was at Mount Sinai, but we shall not share the world’s fear. (Heb. 12: 21) We know God is controlling the forces of destruction and we know at whom he is directing them, not at us but at his enemies, our enemies. We have made him our refuge and shelter, and he will safely shield us, passing us over just as his destroying angel passed over all the homes in Egypt marked with the blood of the passover lamb.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Make me to understand the way th^^preeepts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Aside from Jesus Christ, God's Word did not foretell the personal work, course and activities of any individual. His Word foretells his dealings with his theocratic organization under Christ, and about its work, experiences, persecutions, its deliverance and its triumph. So if we do not see the organization but try to apply prophecies to ourselves individually, we cannot see prophecy’s true fulfillment and understand God’s Word. If we are not attached to his organization and working in harmony with it and undergoing its experiences, we cannot get the sense of God’s Word and do his work right. It took Jesus the head of God’s organization to open up the minds of his disciples to grasp fully the meaning of the Scriptures. Today God has built up his visible organization with those whom he has delivered in fulfillment of Bible prophecy. In our days the unfolding and understanding of God’s Word has been by this spirit-filled organization. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">—2 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cor. !i:13, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Will you who know God and who are acquainted with his Word show your faith by good works? When one studies and knows his Word and exercises faith in it, it is not a matter of taking a chance on the new world. It is a matter of being sure what the outcome will be. If you are sure, you will try to convince others who are ready to pull away from Babylon. If one flees from the old world and from the nations that are spoiling him, just what will the outcome be? Primarily, it means the individual will be in line to receive everlasting life. He will have the opportunity of worshiping the Most High God, his Creator, for eternity. But in order to receive the blessings of this life he must accept the Son Christ Jesus ; for the scripture says whosoever believes on Him will be able to get everlasting life. Are you, as a Christian, going to help him learn these things? It will not be easy; it will take patience and time on the part of both.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">You cannot be partaking of “the table of Jehovah” and the table of demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 10: 21, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The apostle so speaks because the things symbolized by the Memorial emblems were provisions made by Jehovah in behalf of those belonging to Christ. Paul’s expression “the table of Jehovah” is understood by textual critics to be quoted from Malachi 1: 7,12 (Greek </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">LXX).</span><span class="font6"> “The table of Jehovah” may have reference to the entire arrangement of the Lord’s evening meal. But if it refers to one particular feature of it, then it must be to the unleavened bread, for it is bloodless. The loaf represents the “body of Christ” in which Jesus’ little flock of Kingdom joint heirs share. It is God that has arranged for the “body of Christ”. He creates it, setting the members of it according to his pleasure, Jesus Christ as Head and the 144,000 as body members beneath him, each occupying an assigned place. Association with Jesus the Head is a provision God made for those of the little flock, and to them alone is this privilege given. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The rich man died and was buried. And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, he existing in torments, and he saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in the bosom position with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 16:22,23, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By refusing Jesus, the rich man class died to the privilege of being associated with Jesus Christ as the promised Seed of Abraham. Till their physical death they lived on in the flesh, like the gadabout woman of whom Paul wrote: “The one that goes in for sensual gratification is dead though she is living.” (1 Tim. 5:6, AW) The Law to which they held proved to be death to them, condemning them to death as accursed sinners. (Rom. 7:9-11) Living on in the flesh, though they were dead in God’s eyes, they could see what happened with the Lazarus group and could be chagrined by it. This class was buried at the latest three and a half years after Pentecost, because then the gospel was preached to the Gentiles for the first time and the rich man class among the Jews were not the ones to do the preaching. They were as dead, buried. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Return your sword to its place, for all those who take the sword will perish by the sword.—Matt. 26: 52, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was seized by an armed band under circumstances that could provoke armed resistance. The facts that developed show he did not resort to a sword when his illegal arrest came. Why, then, had he suggested to his disciples to get a sword and let at least one sword be taken along to Gethsemane? He did it to show that he chose not to resort to armed resistance but would give himself up voluntarily in harmony with his Father’s will. Peter tried to put up armed resistance, used the sword and struck off a man’s ear. Then Jesus spoke to Peter as quoted above. In order to drink the cup that his Father had given him Jesus acted in a way that to some seems like pacifism. He was, however, not going before his Father’s court or before the courts of the land on a charge of armed resistance. He did not expose himself to being killed under armed resistance; he must die willingly, sacrifi-cially, like a lamb led to slaughter. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 6:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus without setting a date, Jehovah does set the practical limit for our work amid the people of unhealed Christendom. We must carry on till she is reduced to the devastated state described here prophetically. The time is getting near when the “ten horns” of the beast, backed by the whole body of that beast, will turn on Christendom’s whorish system of Babylonish religion and will wreck it. That will be the beginning of Armageddon, but at the grand climax Jehovah’s heavenly hosts under his King Jesus Christ will execute his righteous judgments against all the ungodly elements, religious, political, social and commercial. This is what Christendom will have come on her for shutting her eyes, dulling her ears and fattening her heart toward the testimony of the witnesses whom Jehovah sent. So despite the siege conditions against Christendom, we must carry on with our message. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">bones.—Prop. 3: 7, 8, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sickness, diseases and accidents have their normal causes. All the sickness that has entered the earth resulted from the original violation of God’s law. Likewise today, sickness and disease are due to some violation of God’s laws concerning physical well-being. They are not due to the direct touch of Satan. Just because a person believes the good news of God’s kingdom and devotes himself to follow in Jesus' steps, God does not work a miracle and change his bodily organism any. Oh, he might be able to prolong his life by better living henceforth as a Christian, both morally and physically, because he learns more and more of the truth and gives his body decent treatment. He does not abuse it as those in the world do with their bodies. Unselfish activity in God’s work does one good in both mind and body. Study of God’s Word and applying it has a salubrious effect upon us. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">That is just the way with the adversary. If he cannot seduce Jehovah’s people into verbally renouncing God and his pure worship he tries to work their ruin by enticing them into immorality. As with the Israelites back there, we are virtually on the verge of entering into the righteous new world. Though so near to our glorious goal, there is still danger of falling short of reaching it as modern counterparts of those thousands of Israelites. Do not forget: We are flesh and blood like those men were. Temptations common to them can likewise appeal to us and cause us to fall. Just because we belong to the organization which Jehovah has saved is no guarantee that we cannot personally fall into sin and miss out as individuals and so not enter into the new world with the theocratic organization.

<p><span class="font6">What Isaiah was here told to tell the people was not really the content of his message but was to be the effect of it. What he actually told them is contained in the remaining sixty chapters of his prophecy. The Greater Isaiah, Jesus Christ, applied to himself what Isaiah was here told to tell. Jehovah’s words at the temple sound as if his witnesses today must command the people not to understand what they hear and not to perceive what they see; and as if his witnesses are commanded to make the people’s hearts fat, make their ears heavy and shut un or besmear their eyes. But Jehovah does not force the people this way; otherwise, he would be responsible for their dire fate. He merely makes the people hear and see his witnesses in action. Then by his prophecy he foretells the effect of it upon the people or how they will not respond favorably.—Matt. 13: 14,15. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

Even in his day Paul said he had preached and brought into the truth fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, sodomites or men kept for unnatural purposes and men who lie with men, etc. All were gross offenders against moral law. Jesus himself told the outwardly moral priests and religious elders that the tax collectors and harlots were going into God’s kingdom ahead of them. (1 Cor. 6: till, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW;</span><span class="font6"> Matt. 21:31,32) But now they had been cleaned up by the truth. So no longer must they fashion themselves after the customs and standards of this world but must conform their thoughts, affections and behavior to God’s truth and commandments. So when these come into the truth and God receives them into his theocratic organization, they have to make radical changes in their lives, including tneir home arrangements.

<p><span class="font6">Divine physical healing was a feature of Christ’s first presence and of the infancy of his congregation, but it was due to pass away with the death of his apostles and their associates. Authority to heal was one of the gifts of the spirit which, since Pentecost, was imparted only through the apostles or in their presence. Men who got the gift of miraculous healing through or in the presence of the apostles could not impart the spirit to others. So they could not pass on the gift of healing power to others. Consequently when the apostles died and also those associated with them, then the spiritual gift of miraculously healing people in a physical way ceased to be imparted or exercised. Today we are nineteen centuries removed from the apostles through whom the gifts of healing were imparted. So in the physical absence of Jesus and his apostles it is futile for a Christian to pray for the spiritual gift to heal others and for himself to be miraculously healed.

<p><span class="font6">The theocratic organization affords us a great deal of help and protection, not to speak, too, of the invisible holy angels under Christ. Yet there are also personal defensive measures we must individually take. In these measures the written Word of God performs a necessary and vital part; it is powerful for our protection. We are in a real fight. Think of what we are up against—all the great invisible host of wicked spirits is against us! They put us under pressure to destroy our faith and to entice or force us away from God’s service. We would quail in terror if we did not assure ourselves that God has made provision for protecting us. But we may not leave all the responsibility of protecting us to God. He has provided certain things for us to use for protecting ourselves and our Brothers, and we must use these. What? The pieces making up the complete suit of spiritual armor.

The survivors ■will be informed and will know it is Jehovah by his mighty Warrior Jesus Christ who has set the then visible desolations in the earth. Sueh desolations will not have destroyed the earth or ruined it beyond restoration to a paradise state like the garden of Eden. They will only have ‘brought to ruin those ruining the earth'. (Rev. 11: 18, ATF) God will not destroy his footstool, the earth, but will glorify it under the kingdom of his Christ.

Many millions of people today give the Bible much lip-service, as did the scribes and Pharisees; but also like these they fail to live up to it, add to and subtract from it, make it void, and Sersecute and sometimes kill ehovah’s witnesses who do take the Bible as a practical guide and try to live up to its commands. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">According to God’s will the cup Jesus was given to drink he also shares with his little flock of Kingdom joint heirs. This he made sure when he said to two of his apostles who had applied for specific seats in the Kingdom with him: “The cup I am drinking you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am being baptized you will be baptized.” (Mark 10:39, AH') The cup he was then drinking and which his heavenly Father had poured and given him was God’s will for him. This will was recorded aforetime in the Holy Scriptures and it marked out suffering and a disgraceful death for him as if he were a sinner, a blasphemer and a reproach to Jehovah God. This latter feature was what made it so hard for Jesus to drink, so that he took the matter to his Father three times in prayer and then resigned himself to drinking this portion of the divine will. This course led to gaining the Kingdom. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Was Jesus there teaching pacifism? No; but thus he showed that his followers must not be disposed to injure anyone else, even under provocation, where merely personal matters are concerned. They should not resort to the Law of Talion or Retaliation, handed down by Moses, at Exodus 21: 23-25 and Leviticus 24: 19, 20. But even where eye was to go for eye, tooth for tooth, life for life, this like for like was not to be exacted personally by the one hurt. The balancing of accounts was to be laid before the legal authorities, rather than for the injured one to take the law into his own hands. That was the law given through Moses. But Jesus Christ is the Prophet whom Jehovah promised to raise up greater than Moses, and so Jesus’ law is superior and supersedes the Mosaic law’. Hence we must heed what he says if we are faithful as his followers. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font6"> 2/1</span></p>

Today we see gathered into this unwallcd city even greater numbers of those who Jehovah knows belong to him. His witnesses see this expansion work going on. They live in the growing city. With this great ‘‘mass of men” there is a mass of cattle. This may fitly represent the wealth of God’s organization.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 25:6, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the theocratic nation of Israel there was no common-law marriage even though a religious clergyman was not called to solemnize the marriage. Yet the marriage was legally arranged for. An intermediary or go-between dealt with the parents or caretakers of the young man and woman for whom the marriage was sought, and then a contract was entered into. From then on the man and woman were considered engaged or betrothed. Any immoral act by the woman before her bridegroom took her to his home was a violation of the marriage contract and was a case of adultery for which she could be stoned to death. It was thus with Joseph and Mary when she became pregnant by holy spirit. After a period of betrothal the bridegroom took his bride from her parents’ home. He publicly conducted her to his domicile amid the joy and good wishes of the neighborhood, followed by a wedding feast. Thus the marriage was made public knowledge and there were many witnesses. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yet still shall there be in it a tenth, though it again be consumed,—like an oak and like a terebinth, which, when felled, have a stock in them, a holy seed shall be the stock thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 6:13, Ro; A.S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That “tenth” appears to be the faithful spiritual remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses, who were pictured by the faithful Jewish remnant that returned to the land of the formerly unfaithful Judah and Jerusalem and renewed God’s pure worship there. The remnant, the last of God’s “holy nation” on earth, are a “holy seed”, a “sacred race”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Mo)</span><span class="font6"> This holy seed will remain like a stock in the earth and will sprout again after Armageddon’s devastations. (Job 14:7-9) Surviving with them will be the great flock of “other sheep”, who have turned to Jehovah and his kingdom and who have been healed. Jehovah’s pure worship will thus sprout again under most favorable conditions after Armageddon and will spread to the ends of the earth. Then ‘the whole earth will be full of Jehovah’s glory’, just as the seraphs at the temple foretold. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God for us is... a help in distresses most willingly found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 56:1, Ro. Pss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is human nature for people, when helpless in trouble, to appeal to their gods for aid and deliverance. But prayers to Jehovah God are vain if their intentions are contrary to his will. It is not his will at this time to establish world peace in order for the nations to return to normal. If he restored peace, the nations would only consume its benefits on their selfish desires, showing they are &quot;lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God”. The timetables of His Word set our period down as a time marked for international troubles. So, making God our refuge and relying on his strength means for us to accept the trouble his Word has forewarned us of and, while this trouble rages about us and against us, to look to him to be our “very present help” (AV), “a help in distresses, soon found.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Ro)</span><span class="font6"> Always at the worst of the situation how soon and how willingly Jehovah God let himself be found and proved himself to be a help in trouble! </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">To the visible theocratic organization we can look to give us an assignment in which to work, and this will keep us from straying onto another’s territory and causing confusion, irritation and friction. It will bring our efforts into harmony with those of all other Kingdom publishers in the territory in the local congregation and will result in peace and unity. This will please God. While we work under God’s general direction by collaborating with his theocratic organization, he leaves us free to decide upon our more personal or private movements. On numbers of occasions the apostle Paul was guided directly by operations of the spirit or visions from the Lord. This was for his general movement ; but in other respects he had to lay out his personal plans and decide upon what arrangements were best to make. He then had to work at them and see how far they matched God’s will. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2:7,8, Bo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The faithful followers of Christ Jesus must be for Jehovah’s kingdom. They no longer want to be spoiled by the nations and come under their subjection; so they flee this old world of Babylon with its devilish rule and place themselves under the rulership of the King of heaven, Christ Jesus, who they know now rules up there. He was placed upon his throne by Jehovah God and made ruler in 1914. What a marvelous thing has happened since! Today we find a great crowd of people who have listened to the Kingdom message and who say: “Praise Jan, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.” (Rev. 19:6, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> The time has come for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and those who have fled from the Babylonish organization recognize he has become king by enthroning his Son.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 10:16, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Memorial cup represented more than Jesus’ dying as a ransom sacrifice, a sacrifice that would validate the new covenant and remove the sins of his disciples who are taken into the covenant. The ransom sacrifice did not itself require Jesus to suffer reproach and persecution and finally to pass out of this life in disgrace. That part of the potion in the cup was poured in by the Father to test to the limit the integrity of the Son of God to show Jesus’ unswerving support of God’s universal sovereignty. This portion of the cup he had to drink to prove his worthiness of the Kingdom for which God had covenanted with him. Since Jesus took his disciples into the covenant for the Kingdom with him, they are also obliged to drink this cup with him, so as to demonstrate their integrity toward God and prove their worthiness to reign with Jesus Christ in heavenly glory. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">In the darkness of night the burglar could not be identified if he escaped, and so he might be struck to halt him. If the breaker-in died, then the person protecting his property was guiltless. But if he broke in during daylight and was struck a fatal blow, then the striker was guilty of killing the thief. In daylight he could identify the thief and report him to the Law and have the Law catch him and compel him to make restitution and suffer a fine too. But in killing the thief the protector of property was going too far. Certainly all the property a daylight thief could break in and steal is not equal to the value of his life. If he got away, or if the invading aggressors got away, and the Law never was able or failed to bring them to justice, then though we have suffered the loss of material goods we have not brought bloodguiltiness upon ourselves.

<p><span class="font6">Marriage should be dignified and made a responsible matter by legalizing it before witnesses and registering it with the proper authorities of the land. Once married, man and wife should hold their wedlock in honor by being faithful to their vows to each other. They should treat their marriage relationship seriously as something not easily broken on any grounds except marital infidelity, even though the laws of the land on divorce are very liberal and broad. Marriage is something that restricts them in their relations with others of the opposite sex. For man and wife to have sex relations is not a defilement of the marriage bed but is the rendering of a marriage due, according to 1 Corinthians 7:1-7. But for either the husband or the wife to commit adultery with an outsider is a defilement of the marriage bed. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

Leaping for sheer delight they zealously run the race. Before them is their work, and it will be accomplished according to the King’s schedule. No time have they to dally along the road; no holding back. Brighter shines the Kingdom light. Just as the powerful sun scatters the darkness of the night and causes it to disappear and irresistibly moves on from brightness to greater brightness, so Jehovah’s holy servants increase and expand their efforts. Were all the world’s inhabitants to object and fight against it, they could not stop or delay one second the sun’s rising and shining. So Jehovah’s people shall shine as brightly as the sun. All the terrible forces of Satan’s world cannot stop the light of truth from shining for even a second. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Love never fails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 13:8, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In these last days, with the spirit’s outpouring, the “fruit of the spirit”, which is love, has not failed to appear. It abounds in the true Christian congregation today. Paul made it clear that love would remain after the miraculous gifts of the spirit passed away. The gift of miraculous healing marked the babyhood of the Christian congregation in order to build up its faith and to identify it as God’s chosen people from then on. But now that it has come to manhood or maturity after these nineteen centuries of Christian experience, the true remnant of Christ’s followers do not exercise that gift. Now we Christians have something grander and larger than physical healing. Many are the so-called “healers” in heathendom and Christendom. And yet how they all display the lack of love in that they covet financial reward, fame, notoriety, prominence, and selfish power over people! So they are nothing to God despite their wonder-working. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

Admittedly there is serious need of physical healing. Yet this physical wellbeing would never spare her from the woes and destruction of the impending war of Armageddon. It is the spiritual healing that is the more urgent, the more important, the really vital healing. For it is only those who seek and gain the spiritual recovery who will survive the terrible desolations and destructions of the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” and enter the healthy new world.

<p><span class="font6">Publishers of the good news have been making calls on persons every week, conducting Bible studies in their homes. But is this enough? No. We must help such persons to get a firm hold on eternal life and help them to declare the right kind of confession publicly. We want them to know God so well that they will be able to preach to others also, doing so because they want to, not from coercion, but rather because of love for the truth and a desire to see Theocracy’s increase. During the year past there has been increase. But what can we do in 1952 to improve our activity? If the general trend is to increase, then our individual results must also take an upswing. Sometime during the past year each country had a peak in publishers, making a grand total of 442,380 different persons doing ministerial work for all countries. If all these engaged in the field service every month, the witness would be tremendous during 1952.

<p><span class="font6">Jesus offered the Memorial cup to his disciples with the words: “This cup _ means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf.” (Luke 22:20, 'VW) This same cup is the &quot;cup of Jehovah” because the new covenant is the agreement or contract he makes in order to take out of all nations a “people for his name”. But it is Christ Jesus who acts as mediator between God and men by providing the sacrificial blood to put that new covenant into force. The ones taken into this new covenant are the “people for his name”, beginning with the faithful Jewish remnant at Pentecost and later taking in the Gentile believers from the centurion Cornelius onward. These God gathers, saying: “Gather yourselves unto me— ye my men of lovingkindness, who have solemnised my covenant over sacrifice.” (Ps. 50:5, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ro)</span><span class="font6"> This new covenant is an additional fact which shows that drinking the Memorial cup is limited to those who are members of Christ's body. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Now the religionists of Christendom are in a spiritually dead state like the rich man of the parable. Certainly they are not alive to the fact that the &quot;appointed times of the nations” closed in 1914 (A.D.) and that there God’s kingdom was put in power over the earth with the promised Seed of Abraham, Christ Jesus, in the throne. They despise the remnant of the Lazarus class, J ehovah’s modern witnesses, for preaching such a message. The religious “rich man” class have scorned the prophetic meaning of world events. They have turned down the message taken up by modern “Lazarus” and sought refuge in a human substitute for the Kingdom, the United Nations.

<p><span class="font6">In none of the world capitals is there any real, deepdown gladness, not even in the capital of the United Nations, nor in the religio-political capital, Vatican City. One city, though, is enjoying a refreshment and a gladness that the world does not know and cannot understand. It is the new world city toward which the true Christians have been traveling for the past nineteen centuries, God’s capital of the universe. Now it has established its power over our earth. In 1914 Christ Jesus, the Chief Son in God’s organization, was enthroned and thus brought forth to active Kingdom authority. He reigns at his heavenly Father’s right hand. So now there is unusual gladness in the heavenly Zion. It is no wonder, then, that Jehovah’s witnesses on earth who represent his kingdom are also glad. They do not mourn over the end of this world which the handwriting on the wall announces to the nations. They rejoice with the new heavens.

<p><span class="font6">Gratefully we acknowledge today how the cleansing of the modern Isaiah class was performed by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness. For them to he restored to the favor of the King their lips had to be cleansed. The message those lips spoke must be pure, uncompromising, free from fear of men and religious traditions and human philosophies and selfish eulogies of men. (Prov. 22:11; Zcph. 3:9, AS) They were to be witnesses of Jehovah as Universal Sovereign and so must offer to him the “sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name”. (Heb. 13:15, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font6">The need of preachers, ambassadors, prophets, proclaim-ers was involved here.

But knowing these things, realize that the organization which produces proofs of fulfillments of prophecy in and through it must be Jehovah’s people, God causes his word to come to pass, and he reveals his sacred secrets to whomever he wishes. Grasp the importance of these fulfilled visions, realize their import, know that we are in the day of prosperity and the time of blessedness is here since 1926. God’s “servant” is revealed to the nations by his witnesses on earth, and that servant will have to be recognized before God’s favor will be granted them.

This hinders them from seeking association with God’s organization, and this suits the pur-{)ose of the Devil well.

We can thus see how responsible we are to pursue right conduct so as to show correctly and faithfully before all the world what the theocratic organization stands for in morals as well as in doctrine. Christians who turn to immorality and thereby bring undeserved reproach upon the organization come therefore under a special condemnation from God. Let them not think their sin will not find them out and that they can escape. His judgment is not moving slowly.

Such curative methods are not barred to a Christian of faith. Wc need not delay the proper treatment or care of ourselves by praying and waiting on miraculous divine healing. It would be wrong to pray and wait for an answer to such a prayer. Why?

That is why Caesar through his governor Pilate put the Son of God to death and thereafter persecuted Jesus’ followers. Jesus’ sermon on the mount says we cannot serve two masters, especially when both masters are foes to each other. Jehovah’s witnesses have “taken solemn vows to dedicate their lives to the service of God” and they are controlled by a “belief ... in relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation”, including any earthly relation to Caesar.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Righteousness is a breastplate of protection for our hearts, and the peaceful gospel message equips our feet to march on in field service in a peaceable way. Promoting peace rather than tactlessly stirring up strife makes it easier going for us over longer distances. Righteousness and the good news of peace you learn from the Bible and with the help of the theocratic organization. Our faith, which rests on knowledge of God’s Word and on our acquaintance with him and his works, prevents the burning missiles of bitter words of reproach and false accusation from sticking in us and inflicting a mortal wound on our spirituality. The more we know God's Word and the more experience we have w’ith his dealings, the larger our shield of faith becomes. For a protection of our head or mind God has provided the helmet of salvation or “hope of salvation”. By faithfully enduring and gaining God’s approval we increase our hope. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark284"></a><span class="font6">Death ended the beggar condition for Lazarus and put him in a favored place. The Lazarus class died when the Kingdom news began to be told to the poor ones whom the religious clergy despised and neglected. Through Jesus the Lazarus class were having the good news preached to them, and that led to their death as a beggar class, spiritually diseased and hungry. No longer were they going to the “rich man’s” gate for food, but were flocking to Jesus the Messiah. Those conscious of their spiritual need and hungering and thirsting for what was right were being filled and comforted. Said Jesus: “The Law and the Prophets were until John. From then on the kingdom of God is being declared as good news, and every kind of person is pressing forward toward it.” (Luke 16:16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Yes, the lowly Lazarus class, which once begged from the rich man class, was pressing forward toward the Kingdom and seizing it. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The proclamation of the holiness of the God of the righteous new world is very powerful. It causes a shaking, disturbing the self-complacency of creatures who trust in their own righteousness. This would unsettle any who stepped over the threshold to approach God. It would make them concerned about their heart condition. Happily for us, we have a forerunner who has entered into the great temple of God for us, namely. Christ Jesus, the great Priest-King after the likeness of Melchizedek. The righteousness of his sacrifice makes up for our inborn imperfections and sinfulness. Yet we must search our hearts, to see that they are holy in their devotion to truth and righteousness. Those of the house of God must especially do so. The filling of the house with smoke denotes he is present there with unapproachable glory. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W h/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The rich man class contradict: Moses and the Prophets are not enough. The clerical class today does not want to part with religious traditions, age-old ceremonies and pagan philosophies, which they have sanctified into their religious systems and teachings. They let the people have the Bible, but they do not recommend to their congregations the pure teaching of Moses and the Prophets and now the rest of the inspired Scriptures written to show the fulfillment of Moses and the Prophets. They do not want Jehovah’s witnesses, or Lazarus class, to recommend the Holy Scriptures to <sub>t</sub> the people, exposing the religious traditions, ceremonies and philosophies. No, but let God, the Greater Abraham, give some supernatural sign that will show whether tie Lazarus class are true or false and that will not result in such pain for the rich man’s “five brothers”.

<p><span class="font6">The Most High God will now have a clean visible theocratic organization. He will see to it therefore that now since his coming to the temple it is kept clean from immorality and other reproachful things. A person guilty of immorality may claim he has a right to mix in with the organization and may protest against being disfellowshiped. He protests and argues that by having access freely to the organization he will be helped to overcome his immoral relations with one of the opposite sex and thus be saved from the evil consequences of his course. But God’s Word orders the disfellowshiping of such immoral person as an expression of His judgment against him. Unless the guilty repents and straightens out his life, he may not be forgiven and taken back into the society of the theocratic organization. God judges adulterers and fornicators with condemnation and has no relations with them. He forbids his people to have relations with them. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The city of God, gladdened by the streams of the Kingdom river, is the place where the Supreme One of the universe dwells. He has sanctified the place with his holy presence. He has put his name upon the people in that theocratic organization. His temple is there, which means that his pure worship is carried on there by his devoted witnesses. His worship is a safety to them, safeguarding them against all the false ways and policies into which the religions of this world are leading the people. Since he has sanctified the organization with his presence and name, he is determined to keep it clean and pure. No wonder that the enemies who touch his theocratic organization with evil intent are as if touching the tender pupil of his eye. They will suffer for it. No creature, demon or human, will destroy his clean organization. It is a permanent thing. The Most High God keeps his promise to preserve the faithful in it. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">No event taken singly signifies we are in the last days. But when all of these happenings come to pass upon one generation, in the foretold series or sequence, with none missing, then all of these things together constitute the sign. When we see this composite sign, it is time to heed Jesus’ warning to flee to God’s organization for safety during Armageddon. Delay would be fatal for us. Too cold to flee in that wintertime and too late to work out salvation on that sabbath period. On that occasion it is Jehovah who will work through Christ at Armageddon, to vindicate His name. If we are to do the necessary working and fleeing in preparation for surviving Armageddon, we must discern the sign now, appreciate it now, find out Jehovah's requirements for us now, and take the essential precautions now by obeying right now his counsel of how we can weather Armageddon’s storm. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It is not to any one of us, but is to the organization whom he addresses as his wife that he speaks these words. He is dealing with his visible organization and he knows those who belong to it no matter how isolated bodily they may be from others of his organized people. It is his organization that he is teaching through its head Jesus Christ. Those who lovingly hold with that organization get the benefit of his dealings and teaching. Just because you have the Bible and have it as your guide and basic instruction Book, you cannot act independently and imagine you have direct connection and dealing with Jehovah apart from and with slight to the theocratic organization. His Word does not teach that you can go on your own with just the Bible and with a private operation of the holy spirit upon you. It is necessary to see God’s handiwork and to recognize the organization he has built up and deals with. He uses it to guide us.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ho Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon. For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: After glory hath he sent me unto the nations which plundered you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Zech. 2:1,8, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s people have been delivered from the Babylonish organization and from the nations that plundered them. Because they fled from these organizations they are tormented by the Babylonians. Oh, yes, they are still in the world, but they are no longer a part of it. They have come to the unwalled city under Jebovah’s protection and they know that “Jehovah knows those who belong to him”. Regardless of oppression, they will pursue righteousness and godly devotion. They will stand up against all the opposition that is brought to bear against them, because they know that even as Christ and the apostles were persecuted aud permitted to go through many trials and tribulations, so even today they must do likewise, and it is only by endurance that they will be able to gain the victory. It is the aim of Jehovah’s witnesses to help the people. Hence they cannot give up. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">You cannot be partaking of “the table of Jehovah” and the table of demons. Or “are we inciting Jehovah to jealousy”? We are not stronger than he is, are we?—1 Cor. 10: 21, 22,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The provision of being united with his firstborn Son in one spiritual body was given or worked out bv Jehovah for the “little flock’’. In order to stay in union with the Head Jesus Christ it is necessary to keep patterned after his image by copying him in his earthly course. That is why we are told: “Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? Further, what harmony is there between Christ and Belial?” (2 Cor. 6: 14,15, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> So we cannot compromise the “table of Jehovah”. We cannot participate in the body of Christ and take a piece of the Memorial loaf and at the same time partake of the “table of demons”, worshiping idols, and having unclean connections. If we try to do so, we incite Jehovah, who is stronger than we are, to jealousy. That would mean our destruction. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 7:23, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A person cannot become a Christian witness of Jehovah unless he takes a vow by which he fully devotes himself to God through Christ and so assumes superior duties. He acknowledges God as supreme, the Fountain of life, the Provider of the way to eternal life. He approaches God through Jesus Christ. He acknowledges Jesus as God’s Son who laid down his human life for him, thus providing a purchase price for him. No political state, no “Caesar”, emperor or dictator can do these things for the dying sinner. And so he does not attribute his debt of life to any political system, but attributes his life to God and seeks to render it to him through Christ. He acknowledges the scripture: “You do not belong to yourselves, for you were bought with a price. By all means, glorify God.” (1 Cor. 6:19,20, AW) So life, implicit obedience and superior duties Christians render to God as belonging to him. They surrender their lives in God’s service, not that of men. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

It might appear that the worst has been reached and the visible part of the city of God is certain to be moved and dealt a staggering knockout blow. But in such an expectation the gloating enemy will be disappointed. God lives and has not forsaken or been driven from his organization.

<p><span class="font6">By means of his restorative work of mercy to his anointed remnant since 1919, the great heavenly Physician performed a modem miracle of spiritual healing. It has astounded Christendom, but has also chagrined her. The restored organization of his people abounds with the peace, truth and spiritual prosperity with which he has filled it. By activating them in his witness work in all quarters of the earth he has made their organization become a praise and glory for him before all the nations, and the name of “Jehovah’s witnesses” has become a joy to numberless multitudes. For his visible theocratic organization this is a day of brightness amid the thickening gloom and darkness of the worldly nations.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Keep your balance in all things.—2 Tim. 4: 5, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no question that Jesus and his apostles truly exercised the gift of miraculous healing by God's spirit. Did they exercise this miraculous power for their own physical benefit? Never! At the close of a 40-day fast Jesus did not satisfy his extreme hunger by turning stones into loaves of bread. The suggestion to use his power in such a selfish way came from Satan the Devil, not from God. When Jesus got tired from journeying, he sat down to rest, as by the fountainside at Samaria. When he grew sleepy, he slept for recuperation, as on the pillow in the stern of the boat when crossing the sea of Galilee. When his apostles returned from a strenuous missionary tour and reported to him, he took into consideration their physical and nervous frame and invited them to withdraw with him into a lonely place to “rest up a bit”. So Jesus did not resort to the miraculous for the benefit of himself and his disciples. He was sensible. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Is all the Christian needs for determining God’s will the Bible alone? He has a right to have a personal copy of God’s Book and he is under apostolic instructions to make a private study of that Book. But he cannot depend upon just himself to understand it fully. The prophetic writers of old did not understand the meaning of the prophecies they uttered and wrote down. How was it, then, that the early Christians came to get an understanding of those Scriptures? By the help of God’s spirit or active force with its illuminating power operating upon their minds. Not only that, but they also received gifts of the spirit which manifested itself in various ways by miraculous power. Because of the important part the spirit plays in us as Christians, we should not grieve it by working against its operation or by living contrary to what it seals us as being, namely, God’s possession. But having this spirit does not relieve us of studying his Word. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">So it is written concerning those who enter into the divine government of the new world. Jehovah God is now building a new world society, and it must measure up to the clean, righteous staudards that will prevail in his new world. Only those who strive to measure up to them will he carry through the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” which ho fights against this unclean world, and they will live into the clean post-Anna-geddon world. There will be no polygamy sanctioned then in order to carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race. No immorality of any kind will be permitted, and there will be no divorce between those who share in fulfilling the divine mandate. As the flood of Noah’s day wiped out the immoral standards and practices of the antediluvian world, so the great tide of Armageddon will wash away this world’s moral corruption. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W i/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Korah, Dathan and Abiram became arrogant and, along with two hundred and fifty Israelites who were leaders in the community, gathered together and protested against Moses and Aaron. So Moses told this wicked group and the whole community of Israel, “In the morning the Lord will show who belongs to him and who is holy, that he may have him come near him; and whomsoever he chooses he will have come near him.” (Num. 16: 5, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AT)</span><span class="font6"> When Dathan and Abiram came out of their tents and stood in the doorways with their wives, sons and little ones, what happened? The ground moved away from under their feet and they disappeared, swallowed up alive in the crevice that was made. They descended into Sheol, the grave, and perished from among the children of Israel.

They do not arm themselves or carry carnal weapons in anticipation of or in preparation for trouble or to meet threats. They try to ward off blows and attacks in defense only. They do not strike in retaliation. They do not strike in offense, but strike only in defense. They do not use weapons of warfare in defense of themselves or the Kingdom interests. While they do not retreat when attacked in their homes or at their meeting places, they will retreat on public or other property and <sup>f</sup>shake the dust off their feet'.

But now since God has reversed matters and shown whom he really favors and has taken to his bosom, they are comforted. Of course, they are still verbally abused and violently persecuted by the “rich man” class; but they are comforted with God’s comfort and refreshed and renewed by the good things from his table. They eat, drink, rejoice, sing for joy of heart, and are blessed, whereas the “rich man” religionists hunger, thirst, feel shame, cry and howl sorrowfully, leave their name for a curse, and face destruction.

He now reigns over the earth by his Christ whom he has enthroned as King of the new world. Just as long ago Job was restored from his captivity in Satan’s power and was healed of bis deadly disease and was vindicated, so God's faithful remnant have experienced restoration, pardon from sins, and spiritual healing. And just as the beggar Lazarus died to his diseased, hungry state at the rich man’s gate where despised eurs licked his ulcers, so the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses have experienced a change of condition. Like Lazarus, they now find themselves in the bosom favor of the Greater Abraham, Jehovah God. They no longer feel sick spiritually.

For this the plague of God has come upon them. They are shown to be cursed and doomed to a disgraceful death. In 1918 they succeeded in killing Jehovah's “two witnesses” at the climax of World War I. Because of such a flagrant act of contempt for God’s kingdom by Christ they were smitten with a death-dealing spiritual plague from God. They betrayed themselves to be unclean in his sight, spiritual adulteresses with this world, and hence enemies of God. They have ever since stayed in this accursed state.

This kind of disposition they will be able to use when talking to people in the world, and they will be able to persuade all kinds of people to listen to the message they have. They may not be proud or haughty, nor do they feel they arc better than anyone else. In order to contend for the victory in this contest of faith, they must preach the Word in a manner pleasing to God and in a manner that will attract the people who seek after truth and righteousness.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 10:16, RS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the contents of the Memorial cup represented “his kind of death” in vindication of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty, Jesus fittingly said the wine meant “my blood” and he gave it to his disciples to drink. As the Memorial wine represents shed blood, it spells death to the one whose blood was spilled for the new covenant. According to Jehovah’s covenant made with Noah right after the flood, he safeguarded all creature blood as sacred and made drinking blood, and especially human blood, deserving of death to the drinker. (Phil. 3: 10, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW; </span><span class="font6">Matt. 26:28; Gen. 9:1^) Now when the disciples drink the cup of Memorial wine, they are in symbol drinking blood, but drinking under divine command. So it means for them to shed their blood or to die as Jesus did in the cause of his Father’s universal sovereignty. So they prove worthy of life with Jesus in his kingdom.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Num. 1:3,49, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The consecrated priests and Levites were exempted from conscription for military service in Israel. Since Jehovah’s witnesses are consecrated by God as followers of Christ, they should likewise be exempted from military duties with carnal weapons. God now exempts them, not requiring them to fight as did Joshua, Gideon, Samson, Jephthah, Barak and David of ancient times. God has made these Christian witnesses his ministers of the Kingdom gospel. Each one of Jehovah’s witnesses has as his vocation the ministry and is a minister of the gospel, whether able to render full time or only part time. Not merely the full-time servants among them, but each and every one of Jehovah’s witnesses is under a vow of dedication, which involves “duties superior to those arising from any human relation”. God’s Word therefore appoints each of them a minister of God and preacher of the gospel. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

We dare not fear their fear. We may not now resort to human refuges and become like the faithless people of this world. We must make known that Jehovah of hosts is the God of victory and is with us and is our secure retreat. This we will do, not by bragging about our organization, but by taking him at his Word and displaying our confidence in him. He is with us if we are with him, not becoming part of this doomed world or indulging in friendship with it, but adhering unwaveringly to his organization and expanding his pure worship. By our course of action as well as by our words we must demonstrate that our trust is not in weapons of carnal warfare but that we are fighting on Jehovah’s side with the spiritual armor from him. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Jewish members of the Lazarus class died to their former beggarly condition under the Law covenant and were no longer subject to the “rich man” class or dependent upon the Jewish clergy class for anything. They had “died together with Christ toward the elementary things of the world” which the “rich man” class taught. Their life was now “hidden with the Christ in union with God”. They no longer begged from the rich man. No, they followed Jesus’ command, “Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy,” and avoided them. (Col. 2:20; 3:3 and Luke 12:1, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> In place of being buried and going to Hades, the beggar “was carried off by the angels to the bosom position of Abraham”. Thus the Lazarus class is not pictured as a class dead in sins, but as very much alive, “alive toward God.”—Eph. 2:1; Gal. 2:19. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is King in his temple. He is immortal and will reign for ever and ever. What a comforting fact that is, since Christendom’s attempt to rule as king has miserably failed and that religious system is now dead in God’s sight! All further dependence upon Christendom for good, stable government of the earth is foolish and vain. The source of all rightful government is the Universal Ruler, Jehovah God. Jesus Christ taught his disciples to pray for His government. At the time of its setting up there must come a vision of the Supreme Universal Ruler at his temple. It is at his temple that he reigns. In ancient days he reigned over his chosen people Israel, and then his presence at the temple was symbolized by the ark of his covenant. So now that he has taken his power to reign over earth as well as heaven, the vision of him at his temple has come to us. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 12:9, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paul’s case shows we do not have to have divine healing of our physical infirmities and sickness in order to accomplish something in active service as a witness of the Most High God. Paul illustrated what God through Christ can make out of a man afflicted with a thorn in the flesh which constituted a weakness for him. Like Paul, we can be happy over what the Lord accomplishes through us despite our ailments, weaknesses or disabilities which divine healing fails to remove from us today. If we accomplish anything in spite of these, we are bound to conclude it was the Lord who did it through us, and not we ourselves. This keeps us from growing elated and swell-headed. It reminds us we are powerful to do anything only by his power which tents over us. It allows God’s power through Christ to be made perfect in operation through us, in the face of our admitted debility. For this reason the glory for our accomplishments must go to God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 16:23, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The remnant of the Lazarus class were falsely accused and misrepresented as hypocritical sinners by the religious clergy, just as the bereft, disease-stricken Job was accused by his three self-righteous friends. They have now experienced a glorious change of condition, in the same way that Job, nearly dead and seemingly afflicted by God, was healed and given a new lease on life for 140 years, was blessed with twice as much as he had before, was rejoined with his wife and was blessed with seven sons and three lovely daughters the same as before. (Job 42:10-17) Once those of the remnant of the Lazarus class were lying as dead and inactive, like the two witnesses of Revelation, chapter 11. The “rich man” class intimidated and maneuvered them into deathlike inactivity. But in 1919 God’s spirit began restoring them to life in his service to be his witnesses. So they came into the favor of the Greater Abraham, Jehovah God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

The righteous coming out from the heavy times of persecution, suffering, bans and other forms of opposition were like the sun shining its way through clouds. Now in all brilliance the message of the truth powerfully penetrates all the faraway places, for no place seems hidden from the sunshine of the truth. One would expect in a natural way that after all the hardships and prison experiences of Jehovah’s witnesses they would be worn out and weary and in sneh a condition not able to go forward now with God’s work in the postwar period. Yet not so with these who were the ones so hard pressed by Satan. Satan is no conqueror and his power is broken. All he can do now is scrape together the remnant of the Gentile powers and hold them the best way he can till Jehovah’s strong arm destroys them utterly.

Hence today, not only persons whom God has called to the heavenly kingdom with Christ Jesus may offer this prayer, addressing God as their Father, but also the great crowd of his “other sheep” who hope to get eternal life on the earth to be perfected under God’s kingdom. Calling him “our” Father denotes we recognize he is the Father of a family and that there are other members in the family and that we are sons of God along with our older Brother, Jesus Christ the beloved chief son of God. This broadens out our prayer to include lovingly our brother sons of God. By this form of introduction we recognize God as the original Life-giver and also the One who has made provision for us to be rescued from the death we are now dying because of Adam’s sin and to be ushered into the righteous new world with its everlasting life. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jeremiah’s message was to accomplish the destroying of the false prophesyings and to tell of the destruction of wickedness, while at the same time it was constructive, for the building of hope in the hearts of those who loved righteousness. It was a message of deliverance to them. And in fulfillment of the prophecy Jehovah’s witnesses today do a twofold work, announcing the uprooting and overthrow of the wicked Satanic world (Matt. 15:13, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW), </span><span class="font6">together with all its false doctrines, and the building up of a great crowd of people in the faith that leads to life. Jehovah’s servants plant the message of truth in the hearts of men of good will, studying the Bible with the people who desire to learn; and this produces fruit after cultivation. Thus these gain words of salvation and seek refuge and life through God’s organization. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">This is the day for liberty to be proclaimed throughout all the earth, among all races and nations. In the sixteenth century before our common era Moses handed down the Jubilee as God’s law to his chosen people, the nation of Israel. God, whose name is Jehovah and who is the great Liberator, was there making a picture of a great liberation to come, not merely to people of the nation of Israel, but to all mankind. Jesus Christ began the proclamation and laid the foundation for the great liberation nineteen hundred years ago. He set out on a work of release or liberation which was to spread beyond the Jews or Israel and to reach all peoples. His work of release was a work greater than that done by the ancient prophet Moses. He brings a liberation to mankind by his truth and his kingdom and which was prefigured by the Jubilee law of release. So now his true followers today must take up the joyful proclamation and boldly sound it as with a trumpet blast to all races, peoples, nations and languages. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Pet. 5:2,3, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Being ministers and preachers, they do not abandon their neutrality as conscientious objectors and turn aside to engage in military support of this or that side of any worldly conflict. Jesus predicted their neutrality and their preaching activities at this militant time. (Matt. 24 : 7, 9, 14) So now each and every witness who is under vow to Jehovah God through Christ must obey Jesus’ prophetic command and fulfill his commission as an ordained minister of the good news of the Kingdom. There is no exemption to any consecrated minister. Those taking the lead among them must set the example, and the others must imitate them. These leading ministers do not engage in carnal warfare, but preach. The rank and file of Jehovah’s witnesses, being also ministers of God, copy their faithful example and peacefully preach. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">7'he loaf which we break, is it not a sharing in the body of the Christ? Because there is one loaf, we, although many, are one body, for we are all partaking of that one loaf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 10:16,17, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When a Christian is really devoted to God and eats of the Memorial bread, he is thereby confessing that he is “sharing in the body of the Christ”; he is a member of it. Has he glorified or exalted himself publicly to membership in the spiritual body of Christ? No; but he has met God’s requirements and he recognizes that “God has set” him in the body of Christ. This in itself rules out all the “other sheep” from partaking of the Memorial emblems, as they are not members of Christ’s body. They cannot partake and say: “Because there is one loaf, we, although many, are one body,” that is, “one body” with the members of Christ’s body. The body of Christ was represented by the “one loaf”, and the members of that spiritual body “are all partaking of that one loaf”. For that reason there must be complete unity among them, for “we, although many, are one body”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Not only is God's anointed King the foundation cornerstone, but he is also the chief headstone, and is to be brought out and placed in position. This is the crowning stone of the structure. The Lord Jesus forms not only the basis, supplying everything fundamental as the very beginner, author and leader of our faith, but he is also the perfecter, the crowning beauty, the “altogether lovely” one, the grand and all-glorious King of Zion, and Jehovah’s glory rests upon him. Those who see this royal majesty in his exalted position are greatly blessed and filled with delight, for such ones know he is now reigning and the time for the Kingdom rule has come. So, knowing these sacred truths, they hail the anointed King with “shoutings” when he is placed in position as the headstone. Now since 1918, therefore, is the time when he must be heralded “with thundering shouts”, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Necessarily those who publish the advance notice of God's act must be his witnesses. This service is a favor and an honor, and Jehovah would not choose any others than people loyal to him and who will speak the word which he lays upon them to speak, no matter who scoffs. He would not choose those out of harmony with him and ashamed of his Word and who treat it lightly, placing philosophies, scientific theories, and religious traditions of men ahead of God’s Word and who commit spiritual adultery with this world. As for saving anybody, Jehovah’s first concern is to save his worthy witnesses. He also saves those who give heed to this witness and who aid in spreading it to others. (2 Pet. 2 : 5-10; 1 Tim. 4 : 16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> By this we appreciate more fully how we need to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses in order to be saved from the world calamity. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">A law is a rule of action or conduct according to which a person or thing will operate or move. God the Creator did not put sin’s law in mankind. Our first parent Adam under influence of the Devil put it in human flesh and he passed it on to us as an inheritance. Unless controlled or resisted, that law of sin is bound to rule you and move you. What possible way is there of controlling or resisting it? It is by the ‘law of the mind’. Not the old mind, for this is sinful like the world, but the new mind which tends to make you an image of God the Creator of your new personality. This new mind dictates a new rule of action and conduct in your life. Due to your new process of thinking the ability to wish for better things is present with you, but the ability to do what you wish in a perfect way does not reside in you. But your comfort is that you do not find pleasure in having sinned, but your mind clings to God’s law and approves it and is set on doing it. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It is no exaggeration to say that all religion today is under reproach, the true religion and the false. The false is suffering reproach because of its hypocrisy, ignorance and confusion,, because of the depravity and illiteracy in which it has left the people, because of the failure of its aims and policies and because it has no certain message of light to show the people the way to a clean, prosperous, happy, peaceful and secure world. False religion is an ally and an inseparable part of this sordid world and fights with it against the only living and true God. Even Christendom does so. The re-Froach now falling on the re-i g i o n of both Christendom and heathendom is therefore not without cause. It is deserved. It was with this religion in mind that the slogan was first raised in London, England, in 1938, “Religion is a snare and a racket.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not the sharing of the blood of Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 10:16, CB.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yes, it is a “cup of blessing” over which we bless God. It indeed represents death with Jesus Christ, baptism into his death, but to share in that kind of death is a privilege, as the apostle wrote. (Phil. 1:29, jVIV) That cup has God’s blessing, for it represents God’s will for Jesus and his little flock. That cup or the privilege of drinking out of it was given for the little flock that they might display their integrity on earth now to the utmost and might gain an “entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ”. (2 Pet. 1: 11, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> So with deep appreciation those privileged to drink the cup bless God for it. For it is a privilege to vindicate him by death with Christ and afterward to be resurrected by Him to immortal life in Christ’s kingdom. Since Christ’s death validates the new covenant and he set the example in death, his disciples drink the cun in remembrance of him. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Mark 10:38, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God is the great Baptizer or Baptist. The baptisms which he performs are either to life or to death, to salvation or to destruction. That water baptism was a right symbol for Jesus to undergo Jehovah God showed, for then he baptized Jesus with his holy spirit. In this way he acted as the great Baptizer and did that which led finally to Jesus’ salvation to immortal life in heaven at God’s right hand. There Jesus began a baptism into death as a man, a human creature. Three years later he indicated this to his disciples with the above-quoted words. His baptism into death was finished with his death on the torture stake at Calvary, outside Jerusalem. Then God completed the great act by saving his obedient Son out of death, resurrecting him to immortal life as an invisible spirit in heaven. John the Baptist could never perform such an immersion. Only Almighty God could do so. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">This followed on the restoration of Jehovah’s faithful remnant in 1919, when they came back to Zion, God’s capital in which his beloved Son Jesus Christ was reigning since 1914. The King Jesus Christ acted as Judge of the remnant to show them their faults and taints of worldliness and to cleanse them and deliver them from oppressive Great Babylon. He acted as a royal Counselor to them by unfolding the meaning of God’s Word, in this way fulfilling the prophecy, “His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor.” Under guidance of this heavenly Interpreter the remnant carefully examined God’s Word and in it they found a “multitude of counsellors” for their safety. (Prov. 11:14; 15: 22) By his restored Judge Jesus Christ, Jehovah cleansed away their soils from Babylon, and the Judge revealed to them the judgment of the Lawgiver Jehovah. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 42:1, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ Jesus is the great Servant whom God has raised up now to serve as Liberator, now when the whole earth is threatened with a new bondage, that of blasphemous international communism. He repels the invasion of Communism and other isms into the lives of lovers of truth and righteousness and also releases many who are in bondage under these systems. It is now a foolish thing to listen to some man or group of men when they lift themselves to prominence and then, to draw followers after themselves, proclaim that they will bring about the people’s liberation. The granting of full liberty to men rests with Almighty God. He has made his own appointment of someone reliable to free the prisoners of this oppressive system of things. To this day he sticks to that appointment. So it only leads to heartbreaks to look to anybody else than the One the Most High God has appointed. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">There was given me a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan, to keep striking me, that I might not be overly exalted. In this behalf I three times entreated the Lord that it might depart from me. —2 Cor. 12:7,8, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">False apostles, disturbers and assailants of Paul’s apostleship and work would be a “thorn in the flesh”, to keep him from getting too elated over his ministry. But if the “thorn” was an irremovable affliction of his eyes or other part of his body, it could serve as an angel of Satan to prick him with pessimism or an inferiority complex and a consequent discouragement. Whatever the thorn’s nature, he prayed three times for its removal. He did so at a time when the gift of the spirit for healing was still bestowed and operated. The Lord did not answer his triple prayer, but assured him of undeserved kindness. Because Paul was left weak by the unextracted thorn, it gave the Lord the opportunity to give Paul a strength to do things which was not his own. This showed that Christ’s power overshadowed him. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Sowing good may seem impractical, but it has its satisfying harvest in due time. Sow evil, and you reap that in time also. Go out with a “chip on your shoulder” and someone will knock it off. Be cross and grumpy and grumbly, and others will be that way toward you. Shout angry words, and others will return them with interest. Strike a man, and you will very likely receive a blow or two in return. But treat people courteously, smile, be friendly, show kindness, act in sincerity, unselfishly, with Christian love, and in all probability they will respond in like manner. “Cast your bread upon the surface of the water, for after many days you will find it.” (Eccl. 11: 1, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AT)</span><span class="font6"> You may do quite a bit of sowing before the time of reaping arrives; but eventually, after many days, results will prove your good course practical.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Examine me, 0 Jehovah, and prove me.—Ps. 26: 2, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The advice and instructions in God’s Word apply to all individuals in his organization or associated with it. It does not say one thing to one person and another thing to another person so as to please each one according to his individual likes. God does not bend or alter his law just to suit selfish desires or inclinations of some individual. His law is theocratic and according to His will and rule of action. It is not determined by the selfish will of any individual creature. So the advice and instructions given are often general and set out the principle to follow but leave each one a free moral agent to choose to follow the faithful principle set forth or to follow his selfish desire. In that way God allows each one the opportunity to prove how much love and confidence he has toward God the Giver of the Word, and how eager he is to do the divine will.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Preach a release to the captives and . . . send the crushed ones away with a release.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 4:18, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the Kingdom witness, the modern-day sounding of the Jubilee trumpet, has been given everywhere to the extent that God has decreed, then the enslaving control of Satan’s world over earth’s inhabitants will be smashed and forever removed. All who continue in willful slavery to it will be destroyed with it. For this reason it is that now the Jubilee trumpet must be sounded by giving the witness to God’s kingdom, the government of everlasting life in a free new world. By the power of the truth about God’s kingdom the people of good will who hear the Jubilee trumpet must make their break for liberty from Satan’s world of slavery. They must flee to God’s kingdom as the rightful government of all mankind. So listen to the Jubilee proclamation, act upon it without further delay, that you may gain your freedom. Then, as free men and women, join your forces world wide to “proclaim liberty throughout all the land”. That way you may live and never die. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If he suffers as a Christian, let him not feel shame, hut let him keep on glorifying God in this name.—1 Pet. 4:16, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some think the name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Christian</span><span class="font6"> was originally given as a name of reproach to Christ’s followers. (Acts 11:26) Yet we can accept that name, just the same as we can accept the name “Judean” or “Jew” in a spiritual sense. Why? Because we adhere to Jehovah’s promise to Judah, that “the sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be”. (Gen. 49:10, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AS) </span><span class="font6">We can accept, too, to suffer as a Christian, according to what Peter says above. So you can either take the name “Christian” in vain and bring reproach upon it as Christendom does, or you can suffer unjustly as a Christian. If you live up to the name “Christian” in spite of the suffering it brings, you can glorify God in this name. In the same way a distinction needs to be made between the false religion and the true religion. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Father, let your name be sanctified.—Luke 11: 2,</span><span class="font6"> AW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This petition means more than our merely holding God’s name sacred. It means that his name has to be relieved of all the reproach cast upon it and must be forever vindicated. Those who sincerely offer the Lord’s prayer for God’s name to be sanctified will be most careful to bring no reproach upon it nor will they ridicule it just because they do not like the persons who bear it. They cherish it. As God’s children we can, of course, sanctify his name in our lives, but the sanctifying of that name universally will come about by ' God’s act through Jesus Christ. Since 1919 he has sanctified his name by restoring his faithful remnant of spiritual Israelites to his organization and its work in all the earth, as Ezekiel 36 : 21-32 foretold: “The nations shall know that I am Jehovah, . . . when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(AS)</span><span class="font6"> But the decisive sanctification of his name before all the universe will come at the battle of Armageddon.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In those days . . . ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, . . . of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">that God is with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Zech. 8:28, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What did this mean for our days? It meant a greater crowd would manifest themselves. Ten men would take hold of the skirt of a spiritual Israelite or Jew, a witness for Jehovah, one who is diligent in service and wholly devoted to Him, because they will hear that “God is with you”. Will we, then, not let them hear that God is with us and show them the evidence of it? It is very essential for us to proclaim the Kingdom, that all who will may share in our blessings and rejoice in Theocracy’s increase. When the thousands, yes, maybe millions, someday come into Jehovah’s unwalled city before Armageddon, he will protect them no matter where they are on earth. When opposers of his kingdom harm one of these little ones it is like touching the pupil of his eye, for “Jehovah knows those who belong to him”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 16:23,24, HW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “rich man” class weep and gnash their teeth at the reversal of conditions against them and in favor of Jehovah’s witnesses. They are as dead and buried in Hades as regards God’s approved service, and yet they are in torment because of seeing how the remnant of the Lazarus class have been taken into his service and are being used in it so mightily world-wide. God has withheld his sorely-needed message from them and they suffer from a spiritual “famine ... of hearing the words of Jehovah” among themselves. Back there the Jewish clergy cried out, “Father Abraham I” in a plea for favor as his natural seed. As his descendants they had expected better treatment from God because of such natural relationship to that ancient “friend of God”. Oh for relief from God on the basis of this relationship ! Today Christendom’s clergy address the Greater Abraham and ask mercy. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 46:2,3, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The psalmist seems to refer to a real earthly cataclysm, when Jehovah destroys this old world. His act then is the “strange act”, the act of God, for which we have been looking, yes, praying. Our hope and trust arc not misplaced in any things created by man’s ingenuity, because we know they are doomed and will pass away with this old world. We have long witnessed and suffered amid this old world and now it will pass away from us because we are not of it. But we ourselves shall not pass away with it, for we are of the new world of righteousness. We belong to God’s theocratic organization under his kingdom. His visible organization will not pass away, but is as stable and permanent as his kingdom. So, come what remarkable, violent changes may in the earth's physical appearance at the end of Satan's world, we will not fear. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: and he touched my mouth with it.-Isa. 6: 6, 7, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Isaiah’s vision shows that our cleansing was not by human means, but was by seraphic or superhuman means. The golden tongs which the seraph used to pick up the red-hot stone or live coal were from the golden lampstand in the holy compartment of the temple. So they were part of the equipment of illumination. To cleanse our lips concerning what they say and how they say it there must be spiritual enlightenment, as symbolized by the golden lampstand. The altar from which the live coal was taken was in the temple court and represents Christ’s sacrifice. So the live coal came from the right place to purge the lips as by fire. It pictured the cleansing message, which destroys the traditions and precepts of men and imparts fearlessness, zeal, so that the Kingdom message becomes a burning fire within one’s bones.

<p><span class="font6">The adversary may use male influence in the congregation, as a modern Balaam force. He may also use female influence, like Jezebel’s, to bring about the corruption of those who belong to God’s people. He can use either sex to induce the temptation. His aim is, not just to cause ruin to some individuals, but rather to corrupt the entire organization and to bring reproach upon it and its God and so to prejudice honest persons against it. There is every need now for us to pray and watch against temptation to immorality, especially now when we are so close to the new world. If we have escaped from the sink of corruption of this world, why should we let ourselves be dragged back into it under false, glamorous inducements of “free love” and of easy forgiveness from a merciful God for our sins of immorality. Do not be roped in by promises of freedom of conduct. It means slavery. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W i/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 12:8, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Spiritual health to which men of good will can only attain now has a salutary effect on mind, heart and spirit and even on their physical condition. But after Armageddon there will come the erasing of all human imperfection and sin from among the inhabitants of the new world. That new world will be the time and place for it. That will be the seventh thousand-year period of human experience. It corresponds with the seventh day of rest and of physical recuperation which Jehovah legally set up among his chosen people of old. That seventh millennium will mark the fixed time to usher afflicted mankind into rest and release from laborious attempts at self-perfection and deliverance from sin and all its attendant imperfection, old-age decrepitude and death. That was one reason why Jesus did many miracles on the Jewish sabbath day. He showed what he would do for the ailing bodies of mankind on the millennial sabbath day of which he is Lord.

<p><span class="font6">We cannot mix the things of God with those of worldly religion and at the same time gain divine approval. It did not gain his approval when Jerusalem apostatized from the revealed worship of Jehovah God aud religiously held to his name but at the same time swore by false gods. So he warned of the day of his wrath. At the foot of Mount Sinai Moses’ brother Aaron yielded to the voice of the people who wanted visible gods and he made a golden calf. Then, in the spirit of calf worship in Egypt which they had left, the Israelites said : “These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.” Aaron built an altar to the calf and proclaimed : “To-morrow shall be a feast to Jehovah.” (AS) It turned out to be a wild, boisterous corruption of morals. Jehovah burned with indignation at this attempt to link him with demon worship. He had 3,000 feasters executed. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">God’s kingdom by his Son Jesus Christ is the one and only government of liberation. The great atonement sacrifice of Jesus Christ the High Priest has been presented in heaven, and during the past nineteen centuries his faithful followers have received the benefits of it through faith. Now in addition Jehovah’s theocratic government with Christ as King has been established. As the people’s emancipator it must destroy completely the Devil’s world organization, visible and invisible, and this it will do at Armageddon. With the covering of mankind’s sins now possible through Christ’s sacrifice and with God’s kingdom now set up, now is the time for the proclamation of the Jubilee for all mankind to be blasted forth. Who is to proclaim it? Christ’s anointed followers and all persons of good will who receive the message with faith and joy.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">world.—John 17:16, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because they are wholly dedicated to God by their vows to him through Christ, Jehovah’s witnesses are no part of this world which is governed by the political systems. For this important Bible reason they tell officials of the government that they conscientiously object to serving in any military establishment or any civilian arrangement that substitutes for military service. Jesus told Caesar’s representative Pilate: “My kingdom is no part of this world.” Then Jesus told him why he had not engaged in any military effort to liberate the Jews from Caesar’s domination. He came to be Jehovah’s witness and to take followers out from this world and make them Jehovah’s witnesses like himself. So because they are no part of this world, they are forbidden to meddle and take part in its affairs and controversies. Spiritual Israelites are just as much separated from the nations and their enemies as the natural Israelites were. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is the biggest optimist in the universe, and his inspired Book, the Holy Bible, rings with optimism from the opening of Genesis to the close of Revelation. His witnesses, who have run a continuous course for the past six thousand years, are the biggest optimists on earth now. We have every right to speak of ourselves as being the biggest optimists. With more earnestness than ever we accept the fact that the end of all things has drawn close. But this does not make us feel there is nothing to live for any more. It does not make us lose all interest in living and make us retire from touch with human society and go into a hermit's hut or a religious monastery, loaf around and do nothing but pray. Actually it makes us appreciate we have everything to live for. We are looking for a new world to begin with the most wonderful opportunities for living.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Dcut. 31:21, Ro.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The mind is that part of our make-up from which thought originates. It is that faculty of our consciousness with which we imagine, gather information, reason and reach certain conclusions. It operates according to a certain law or rule of action, so that, if the mind is turned to evil, it follows that rule of operation in the evil direction and moves farther and farther into it. The inclination of the bent of mind grows greater, especially with the pressure from the Devil, and so there is an advance from bad to worse. God, who endowed man with mind, knows how it operates better than the best college psychologist or psychoanalyst of today. He instantly detects the bent of man’s mind and knows what it will lead to. That is why he gives warning to us against the consequences that are sure to follow any imagination. His Word foretold thousands of years ago today’s moral, mental and religious state of this world. Being now proved accurate, it shows God justified in declaring this world would end. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

The older men of the congregation, who are full-grown in the faith and full of wisdom from above and acquainted with God’s instructions, are the proper ones for the spiritually sick one to call in. If he were ailing physically, he would call in a doctor, if he could afford it, or would resort to some medicinal remedy.

<p><span class="font6">We want always to be found in the “ark”, baptized into the Greater Noah, at the awesome day and hour. According to 2 Peter 3: 15, we are to “consider the patience of our Lord as salvation”. We should see that he is patient toward us, giving us time to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. Part of this work consists in trying to help as many other sheep as possible to come to repentance that they may seek God’s haven of protection and be saved from the destruction ahead. He does not want any of these to be destroyed but wants them all to attain to repentance that leads to salvation in the ark. Educating and leading them into the ark’s system of things takes time, and Jehovah has been kind enough to be patient for a sufficient time. But that time is hastening to its end at his fixed day and hour. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

So to that extent the commission to the Servant also applies to us, and we become his fellow servants. We become members of the servant class. This is specially true of those who are anointed with God’s spirit as Jesus was and who are made joint heirs with him of the heavenly kingdom. It is their obligation according to the divine commission to join in ‘saying to the prisoners, Go forth, and to them that sit in darkness, Show yourselves’. If we faithfully carry out this commission, then we are not receiving God’s undeserved kindness in vain. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Who among men will be the ones to survive the world’s end at Armageddon and pass into the new world of lasting peace and security? It will be those who heed the command of the Most High God to desist and give in. This advice corresponds with that given at Psalm 2: 10-12 : “Now therefore be wise, O • ye kings : be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

<p><span class="font6">Jesus never worshiped or served demons. When the “ruler of the demons” offered Jesus the kingdoms of this world in exchange for Jesus’ worship, Jesus replied that he obeyed the divine command to worship only Jehovah God. He worshiped no idol, only the living God. In no way did he participate or have fellowship with demons. All through his ministry he expelled demons from possessed persons and refused to let them testify that he was Christ. Hence if we want to have unity with Christ as members of his body and want to partake of Memorial emblems in a worthy manner, we cannot indulge in idolatry of any sort. Especially so now when worldly organizations and heroes are idolized, such as the United Nations and famous world figures.

He trusted God to guide him in carrying out these plans and to back him up in them as far as it was in harmony with God's purpose. Did God let Paul’s plans get interfered with? Paul shows God did, for he says to those in Rome: “I was many times hindered from getting to you.” Telling of hindrance elsewhere, Paul wrote the Thessalonians : “We wanted to come to you, yes, I Paul, both once and a second time, but Satan cut across our path.” Paul was not improperly blaming something onto the Devil. No doubt by his fanatical dupes on earth Satan raised up effective barriers against Paul's coming back to Thessalonica when he wanted to go there.

<p><span class="font6">The kingdom that is to come is the kingdom concerning which God made a covenant with King David and about which Daniel prophesied at Daniel 2 :44. Hence when a child of the heavenly Father prays for His kingdom to come he is praying for God’s kingdom in Christ’s hands to break to pieces and obliterate all the political systems of this world at the battle of Armageddon. When our heavenly Father’s kingdom was set up in 1914 did it mean that his kingdom had come, that is, come in the way meant in the Lord’s prayer and that we should now stop making this petition? No; for, as pictured by the prophetic dream which Daniel interpreted for King Nebuchadnezzar, the kingdom had been given existence like the rock which was cut out of the mountain without aid of human hands. But this Kingdom rock must still come against the idolatrous image of Satan’s world organization and hit its visible part, knock the image from its base and destroy it at Armageddon. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

Their spokesmen may say, because they cannot understand Jehovah’s Word nor explain it, that there is nothing to it. But they all know there has never been such distress, shaking and instability of Satan’s divided world as now. The message from Jehovah disturbs and troubles them. Even Babylon’s religious wine does not comfort them. It fails them. The “handwriting on the wall” sobers them up a bit.

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God does not approve of it when his people enter into treaties with his religious enemies either by marriage or by political bargains or by commercial deals by which they are compelled to take the names of the gods of such allied persons into their mouths and give them legal recognition. That principle or rule of action holds true for God’s true people today, for the things that had to do with the natural Israelites of old serve as a warning example to us who are living at the end of Christendom’s system of things. Let Christendom go on indulging in such compromises with the gods of paganism and with the blasphemies against the truth of Jehovah God, as, for instance, addressing the nope as “Your Holiness”, “Holy F a t h e r,” etc. The real Christian, the worshiper of the true God, will not compromise today and ascribe to the gods and mighty ones of this world the things that belong to God. He follows Matthew 22: 21. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And I heard the voice of the Lord [Jehovah], saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?—Isa. 6:8, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By the plural pronoun “us” Jehovah was meaning, not himself and the seraphim at the temple, but himself and his only-begotten Son who became the man Christ Jesus and by whom He had created all things. Hence the glory which Isaiah saw at the temple represented primarily Jehovah’s glory and secondarily that of his Son. This glory the Son shows forth when Jehovah sends him as his “messenger of the covenant” to the temple for judgment work. (Mal. 3 :1-3, AS; John 12 : 3941) At his glorious coming to the temple in 1918 he took up the work of judging and cleansing his devoted remnant upon the earth, that these might go for him and for Jehovah with the “pure language”. The service is not forced upon anyone, but is opeu for volunteers. The type of service is not disclosed at first, but whatever it turns out to be, it is Jehovah’s service and is at his origination. The call came in 1919. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">So he called and said: “Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 16: 21,, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christendom’s religionists today address the Greater Abraham, God, as “Father” and plead with him for mercy in their tormented condition. How could the Lazarus class bring this “rich man” class any relief now? Well, by a drop of the water of truth that would refresh the religious clergy in their spiritual anguish and torment. How could this be accomplished? Only by having the Lazarus class stop preaching the “day of vengeance of our God” and stop exposing hypocritical religion and pronouncing the fiery judgments of Jehovah upon Christendom. So they want the Greater Abraham to have those in his bosom favor to compromise. Let them not preach the naked truth, but preach nice things for the religious clergy and give them a better look in people’s eyes. That is, do not do as God commanded Jeremiah who pictured his witnesses: “Whatsoever I shall command thee thou shalt speak.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">selves.—</span><span class="font6">2 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pet. 2:1, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These false teachers and introducers of false practices will acknowledge Christ Jesus and will agree with 1 Corinthians 6: 19,20 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(NW),</span><span class="font6"> which says: “You do not belong to yourselves, for you were bought with a price.” So with counterfeit words they will call him Lord, Master and Owner, but will deny him by the way they live in private. It was when warning the Corinthians against committing fornication with a harlot and becoming one body, one flesh, with her that the apostle reminded the Christian congregation that they did not belong to themselves but had been bought with a price and must therefore glorify God as a body of Christians. It is by an unclean course of life, loose conduct, such as their Owner never did practice or approve of among his bought slaves, that these false teachers deny their Owner who bought them with his precious blood. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W J,/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Heal me, 0 Jehovah, and I shall be healed.—J er. 11: 11,, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God heard the prayer of his repentant, brokenhearted remnant. From 1919 on he regathered them, repaired the breaches of their organization and reorganized them for more effective service than ever. He built them up on earth as the visible theocratic organization to represent his heavenly Jerusalem which was now radiant with Kingdom glory. Here, not physical cure of fleshly organisms, but spiritual cure of the remnant of his witnesses was needed, to recover them from unclean fear and from religious foolishness. “He sendeth his word, and healeth them, and delivereth them from their destructions.” (Ps. 107:17-20, AS) He opened their eyes and ears more fully to get Scriptural understanding. They had been lying as dead under the world’s repressive laws and measures, but now they were revived by God’s spirit. Up they stood and engaged in free, fearless activity as his witnesses to tell out the good news. A spiritual resurrection indeed. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 am Jehovah that healeth thee.—Ex. 15: 26, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Without the aid of the electronic scientists of today, Jehovah God can make a healthy world. Mankind’s health poses an unconquerable problem for man, but not for Jehovah God the Almighty. Undismayed he moves ahead in carrying out his promise to create a diseaseless new world, where obedient mankind will enjoy perfect life forever. It was a completely healthy world that he established with Adam and Eve and their “covering cherub” back there in Eden. What, then, brought on these things called disease, sickness and ill-health, with death as the end? It was the violation of God’s inflexible law! No creature can tamper with His law and expect to remain well. By this we mean not only the physical law of nature but also the moral law, and this primarily. There is a connection between keeping the Creator’s laws and our health and well-being. The diseaseless free new world will be made up of happy creatures who keep their Maker’s laws perfectly. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 146:1,7, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time for releasing the children of God’s organization Zion from Babylonish captivity is when Jehovah commences to rule as King. His kingdom rule we must connect with this great deliverance to really appreciate divine prophecy which clearly marks the time for us. It is a time of great jubilation, the prisoners free, the dispersed of spiritual children returning to spiritual Zion, their real home-coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And why should it not be a time for mueb rejoicing? Zion’s conquering Commander marches forth victoriously, and the captives are freed and the Signal is raised on high leading them back to God’s city, to their “home”. The day of all days is here. The psalms voice many expressions of exultation concerning the time when Jehovah would rule as King. “In that day” all things living are called upon to rejoice. Heaven rejoices, the earth is glad, and multitudes are singing for sheer joy, praising Jehovah who is worthy. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Return evil for evil to no one. —Rom. 12 :17, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If a person acts wickedly toward you, why should you make yourself into his evil image? This is the impractical way of the wicked old world. Because one calls you names, must you berate him? If one lies or backbites or gossips about you, must you repay him in kind and yourself become a hateful liar or backbiter or gossiper, lowering yourself to his level? Would he not thereby show himself the stronger, in that he changes you into his image, his evil practices becoming your practices? If your adversary is wicked, must you abandon all your good principles and convictions in the name of being practical, or in the name of some other such senseless expediency, and lower yourself to his wicked level, and eventually be a sharer with him in God’s wrath? Rendering evil for evil sets in motion a vicious circle of evil-doing. The circle of evil gains momentum as each races in the other’s footsteps, trying to outstrip him in evil-doing. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">We are therefore ambassadors substituting for Christ, as though God were making entreaty through us.—2 Cor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5:20, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As “ambassadors substituting for Christ” Jehovah’s witnesses have conscientious objection to serving in the military and related establishments of the nations. Ambassadors are exempt from military service in the nation to which their government sends them, especially in a hostile nation. Remember, in Bible times ambassadors were sent, not to friendly nations, but to nations at war or threatening war. God’s ambassadors substituting for Christ are sent, not to friendly nations, but to hostile nations. All nations of this world of Satan are hostile to God. The message given these ambassadors to deliver, “Become reconciled to God,” shows that the nations are not friendly. How, then, could these ambassadors Scriptural-ly serve in the military forces of such nations or consent to do so when required by national law? To desert the ranks of God’s ministers means to fight God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is watching what is going on throughout his entire organization, lie knows how his people will be treated. His Son said : “You will be objects of hatred by all persons because of my name.” (Luke 21:17, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Even so, a greater witness than ever in vindication of Jehovah’s name will be given. We are in the last days of this old world and we must expect these things. Now is the time to gather together a great crowd for his name’s sake, and this crowd is being gathered together with haste. So a sharp call and a loud one goes out unto the ends of the earth to all the inhabiters of Babylon who are sighing and crying to flee from her and escape from her oppressive acts now and her complete destruction later. If you love Jehovah, then seek his protection and come to his city, the unwalled village, for he is a wall of fire round about it.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Gen. 6: 9,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We today have as much good judgment and common sense as the man Noah did in a former world. He and his family went in a course different from that of the world. Let us who are informed on the world’s end now and who want to be wise imitate our ancient forefather. Like him let us withdraw support from this doomed world and walk with God. It is the only way of walking about which to be optimistic, for it leads to surviving this world’s end as it did in Noah’s day. We, who take God's word as Noah did, are working for success. It is up to us to prove to mankind that the Bible and Christianity have not failed but are alive today and powerful for leading men to real success, to life in perpetual happiness in a safe and sane new world. Almighty God also is interested in proving that his Word the Bible and the faithful imitating of Christ have not failed. So he will back us up in our endeavors to vindicate him and his Word, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The one stronger than I am is coming, . . . He will baptize you people with holy spirit and fire.—Luke 3:16, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jesus, glorified in heaven, poured out the holy spirit at Pentecost upon his faithful disciples on earth, “tongues as if of fire became visible and were distributed to them, and one sat upon each one of them.” But that could not be called a ‘baptism with fire’, for the appearance of a flame would have had to envelop and cover their whole bodies to be a baptism in it. The apostle Peter then quoted Joel’s prophecy (2:28-32) to show it was there being fulfilled. This prophecy shows that the fire is separate from the spirit and is associated with death and destruction, blood and smoke mist. It is evident that the fire symbolizes destruction. Beginning with the day of Pentecost the wheat class of believing Jews were baptized with holy spirit from heaven. The chaff class of rejected faithless Jews were baptized with fiery destruction in the year 70, when Jerusalem was destroyed, many perished and others were led off captive. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3:13, 15, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is every need, every incentive, to keep our minds renewed. Our bent of thinking must be kept in the true direction that it may result in the desirable consequences, while we swerve neither to the right nor to the left. The ‘law of our mind’ must be strengthened according to God’s Word and it must be made the rule from which we do not deviate, despite the weakness of our flesh. This requires mental effort and watching our thoughts as well as going where we can always get our minds refreshed and renewed with the truth, the advancing Word of God. That means we must attend the meetings of God’s people and join with them in considering and discussing his Word. It means we must join with them in lovingly and faithfully building up one another on our most holy faith. Never forsake meeting together. This is no time to suffer a mental relapse into corruption.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">people.—Isa. 49:8, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Almighty God preserved Jesus by raising him up from the dead to immortal life as the exalted spirit Son of God. In this way Jesus Christ could carry on with his liberation work and be on hand for it in this day. God has given him for a “covenant of the people”. How a “covenant”? A covenant is a solemn engagement to do something. God has solemnly engaged or bound himself to loose true liberty lovers from prison and bondage, and he has given his Son Jesus Christ as a covenant or pledge that he will do this. He has provided and appointed Jesus to be the One to set people free. As certainly as there is a resurrected and glorified Jesus at the Father’s right hand in heaven, just that certainly there will be a loosing of right-hearted people from slavery to the modern Babylon. So the One to look to is this glorious Servant whom God has given for a covenant. All human leaders will prove frauds. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">In this day of the coming of Jehovah’s Messenger and High Priest to the temple of worship Christendom’s religious systems have not endured and stood approved. But the anointed remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses have submitted to the purifying of their worship and have come through approved. To this remnant delivered in 1919 there was committed the great privilege and heavy responsibility of carrying forward the clean, undefiled worship of the true God, Jehovah, and extending it to the ends of the earth. So they have discarded human traditions and philosophies of every kind and have been brought into full accord with God’s pure Word. (John 15:3) They have been led by their High Priest in theocratic worship, a worship which means serving God as Supreme Ruler and with the control over his temple being exercised down from Him as Supreme Head and not up from any inferior level. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

His theocratic organization recognizes your authority from his Word, the Bible. So it uses you as one of its representatives in the field and it co-operates with you, supplies your needs, and renders you assistance. It gives you the benefit of what legal help and protection it can furnish you. It helps you to fight for the truth in unity with your brothers all over the earth. You cannot stand alone. You must fight shoulder to shoulder with your fellow witnesses. You must not fight physical combats with men and women outside the theocratic organization. Certainly you must not do so within the organization. You must fight the common enemy, and not your brothers.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 46:4, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ Jesus proves he is ruling in the midst of his foes by safeguarding the river of Bible truths at its source in heaven. His ruling power keeps it continually flowing to his faithful sheep on earth in the theocratic organization. They constitute the visible organization that now increases its gladness by drinking from the never-failing streams of this river of truth from God’s Word. Totalitarian foes of God’s kingdom ban and dissolve their legal organization and seize its properties. But they cannot stop Christian individuals from acting as Jehovah’s mouthpieces by preaching with just the Bible alone, or even without it if deprived of it and limited to the knowledge of God’s Word in their hearts. Let them arrest these faithful Christians and hold them bound in prison. The Word of God Jehovah is not bound as long as their mouths are unsealed among fellow prisoners and exiles. There are underground rivers. Just so, if need be, the river of Kingdom truth can flow by underground movement. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

No longer are they postponed. This truly is the day which Jehovah has arranged, the time for the realization of his marvelous promises. Let us as witnesses of Jehovah fully enter into it and take our stand amid the inhabitants of the earth as those who belong to Jehovah’s city Zion and to the new system of things, as those who know that the Kingdom is set up in heaven and Jehovah reigns.

Jehovah’s witnesses, the Isaiah class, tell them the truth in an endeavor to save them from coming destruction, and warn them to flee from the wrath to come. But to do this they will have to change their ways. In their spiritually inebriated condition they refuse to hearken. No, they cannot hear. And say they, ‘Why should we be pestered by such petty matters which these Jehovah's witnesses say, continually annoying us?’ But that is the way it is going on, says Jehovah, even ‘command on command’.

<p><span class="font6">Sticklers for divine physical healing in these “last days” argue that if we do not possess and use the miraculous power of healing it proves we are not the true organization of God. Such religious healers do their works, not to support divine truth, but to perpetuate religious lies. They apparently cure physically, but fail to impart the more vital healing which is spiritual, leading to life in the new world. They release people from the power of a bodily ailment, but do not liberate them from the power of the Devil and his organization, this world. Measured by these facts, their works of healing are not manifestations of God’s spirit. When Jehovah foretold that he would pour out his spirit upon all kinds of flesh, ne did not put the healing gift to the front as the proof of that spirit on his people. Prophesying, or preaching God’s Word of prophecy! This is what is foremost in proving the outpouring of His spirit upon all flesh devoted to him.

<p><span class="font6">There are other things besides Satan’s organization from which mankind needs to be emancipated. Christ Jesus plainly pointed out what these things are and showed how release from them will be brought about. He was not deceiving the people when he presented himself as the Apostle of liberty, but his heavenly Father Jehovah God sent him on this mission to give rest to mankind from all their troubles. He showed in what way mankind were slaves who could not escape by their own efforts and how he must loose them from all enslavers. Yes, they were in the power of Satan the Devil, but they were subject besides to something more personal than the Devil. His words at John 8:31-36 prove that all mankind are slaves of sin, since all are doers of sin.

The facts show they too are carrying on in princely functions, even if it means taking oversight over just a group of ten or less. They expect to become children of the “Everlasting Father”, Christ Jesus the King, during the millennial kingdom after Armageddon. Such “other sheep” must be faithful in what appointed service they now have. If proving faithful now in this time of test, they may have a continuance of their special service under their King, the “Everlasting Father”, and they may have a part after Armageddon in the realization of the above-quoted prophecy. Faithful men of old, resurrected, will share with them.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">8:11, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Jesus’ words Abraham represents the Greater One in whom all families of the earth will be blessed, Jehovah God the Great Father. Therefore Isaac, Abraham's only son by his wife Sarah, represents God’s only-begotten Son Jesus Christ whom God anointed to be King of kings. Jacob received life from Abraham through Isaac and so was Abraham’s grandson. So the Christian congregation receives life from God through Jesus Christ. (Eph. 5: 23, 25 ; 1 John 3 : 16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Hence in the trio of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom the Christian congregation is well pictured by the last one Jacob, and it is made up of joint heirs with Christ Jesus in the Kingdom. It has a Jewish remnant or nucleus to begin with and the many Gentile believers “from eastern parts and western” are added later.

So apart from our change of condition since 1919, which is like Jonah’s coming out of the huge fish’s belly to live on earth as Jehovah’s witness and preach to the Ninevites, a sufficient sign, the Lazarus class of Jehovah’s witnesses need not expect God to work any astounding miracle upon them or with them so as to hasten the repentance of the rich man’s brothers’ class. We need no support now by a resurrection of faithful witnesses of old. We are not authorized to compromise the divine message for this day of judgment of the nations by holding back from telling all the counsel of God.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">They have eyes full of adultery and unable to desist from sin, and they entice unsteady souls. . . . They have turned aside and followed the path of Balaam.—2 Pet. 2:14,15,</span><span class="font6"> NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those individuals with eyes full of adultery follow the path of Balaam with a love of the reward for wrongdoing. When this prophet failed in using his prophetic office for a curse to the Israelites, he thought of another way by which to cause their fall and bring the divine curse upon them. What was this way?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Immorality! This subtle way would counteract the divine blessing Balaam had just pronounced and would induce the Israelites to work for God's curse on themselves instead of his blessing. What was that? Why, entice them to give free rein to passion and to fornicate with attractive heathen women. By this breakdown of their integrity you can lead them on to eating idol sacrifices. Impure relations between the sexes is one of the seductive ways by which Satan tries to break down the soundness of the Christian church.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Give us today our bread for this day.—Matt. 6:11,</span><span class="font6"> NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By asking bread or food and drink for no more than today this prayer adopts the right attitude. It does not presume we shall be living tomorrow, mindful of Proverbs 27:1. In harmony with this prayer for just today’s portion of food Jesus a little later on in this same sermon on the mount told us how God feeds the birds and clothes the flowers and said: “Never be anxious about the next day, for the next d v will have its own anxietii s. Sufficient for each day is its own evil.” So we ask today for only our daily bread. The way Luke 11:3 words it in the similar prayer reads: “Give us our bread for the day according to the day’s requirement.” (NW) This promotes no spirit of hoarding things to the denial of such things to other children of God. The Lord’s prayer advises no greedy spirit. To the contrary, it advises godly devotion with contentment, which means great gain in a real way, a gain in happiness and blessing now and eternal life hereafter.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God is a refuge for us. —Ps. 62:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The demons and the “ruler of the demons”, Satan the Devil, are the invisible tormentors, oppressors and troublemakers for the people. They scheme to drive the people away from God and into destruction at his hands. To rid the holy realms of heaven of their harmful influence war in heaven was necessary after God’s kingdom by Christ was set up there in 1914. The demons and their ruler have been hurled down to earth, and the woe this was foretold to mean for earthlings has come true. (Rev. 12:12) There are no protection, stability and permanence under the demons, not even for their friends, servants and worshipers. They are malicious, fiendish and unloving, and cannot Srotect their worshipers and evotees from God’s righteous wrath. They could not do so at the time he loosed the global deluge against the world of violence in Noah’s day. They will not be able to offer protection to the nations, or even escape execution themselves, at the “war of the great day of God the Almighty”. So trust God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 38:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While we are not to attribute our recovery to divine healing today, this does not mean we are not to be grateful to God and to voice gratitude to him if we convalesce. Nor does this mean we may not take the matter to Him in prayer when we are sick or our beloved fellow Christians are sick. Every circumstance and affair in our lives is a matter which we can take to him in prayer. Still, we may not ask for divine healing and expect it, even if we use as a basis Jesus’ words at John 15:7. We know what the sayings of Jesus are as regards his followers for this day, and they do not tell of miracles on the physical organism of his followers at this time. The proper thing we can ask is for our heavenly Father to help us to endure in Christian fortitude during illness or physical impairment. We can ask him to help us to act as faithful witnesses through it all, not to lose faith in him, to suffer no spiritual injury because of it. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial.—2 Pet. 2: 9, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Daniel, Jeremiah, Moses, Noah and others of God’s witnesses were carried right through times of destruction; and this illustrates how Jehovah will carry some of the anointed “r e m n a n t” class through the battle of Armageddon into the new world. The Scriptures show that numberless others survived as well, picturing how many of the other sheep of the Lord will be carried through the time of destruction of this old world and keep on living in the new world of righteousness under Jehovah’s rule. What a privilege, unmatched and glorious, to be here in the middle of the witness work right down to the end of this old world! By faithfulness we shall see all that Jehovah caused us to preach come to pass. That will be something to behold. Then will be the untold blessings of the new world. That is Jehovah’s salvation for those who love him. Even now, by faith we see these things. How we rejoice I </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Amos 3: 3, 6, 7, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this time of world crisis God is at work in the earth before he performs the terrific act of God which he has foretold. He tells us there must be adequate causes for certain observable effects. He also tells us he would keep his witnesses informed of his purposes and of his coming act. Since he long ago spoke by his recorded Word foretelling the world calamity, and since he now makes this recorded Word of prophecy talk through fulfillment of the prophecy which marks the time of the end, how can Jehovah’s witnesses do otherwise than prophesy? (Amos 3:8, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AT)</span><span class="font6"> And they are not doing otherwise than prophesy, let the doomed world like it or not.

<p><span class="font6">Like the priests and Levites of Israel who were specially dedicated to Jehovah’s service at his temple, they have no inheritance in this world. So they do not fight for territories ; and if they suffer loss of property through persecutions by their home government or through invasion of the land by armed aggression, they trust in God to provide them with life’s necessities. Rather than be killed in a violent endeavor to protect material properties of this world, they prefer to live in a despoiled condition that they might keep on witnessing for God’s kingdom and “preach the word” and “be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season”. No matter what political or governmental changes may take place over their heads, they in their neutral position are obliged to submit to them and to carry on with God’s work the best they can under the altered conditions. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 10:17, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our unity must be not merely with one another, but particularly with the Head Jesus Christ. He is the Principal One. We must keep “holding fast to the head, to the one from whom all the body, being supplied and harmoniously joined together by means of its joints and ligaments, goes on growing with the growth which God gives”. (Col. 2:19, .VIF) Because of arguing this vital matter of unity in his first letter to the Corinthians Paul suddenly made reference in the tenth chapter to the Lord's evening meal, or the Memorial. He held before them as a warning example the Israelites in the wilderness who fell away from Jehovah to the worship of idols representing demons, so committing spiritual as well as physical fornication. As an argument for them to “flee from idolatry”, he told them to consider what he had to say about the Lord’s evening meal. The basic thought of that meal was oneness with Christ. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.—Isa, 6:1, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Israel’s human king who once sat on the “throne of Jehovah” at Jerusalem dies for lawlessly invading the temple, but the real King is seen enthroned in his temple. The reign of Jehovah the true King at the temple counterbalances the death of the presumptuous king under divine curse. The Christian Greek Scriptures apply to Jesus and to his disciples of the first century the commission which Isaiah received at the temple and which he recorded at Isaiah 6: 9,10. This proves that the Isaiah class, of which Jesus is the Head, existed in the first century and that it partly fulfilled the prophecy already nineteen centuries before our day. (Heb. 2:13,14) The final fulfillment of Isaiah’s vision takes place upon the remnant of Jehovah’s anointed witnesses, the Isaiah class of our time. It takes place after Jehovah began to reign in 1914 by enthroning his Son Jesus Christ as King. So the facts show the temple vision occurred in 1919. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font6"> 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Those who held Jehovah’s consecrated people captive during World War I were determined never to open the prison doors and let these prisoners loose to go home to Jehovah’s organization. Babylon’s gods and their devotees and servants predicted that there was no future for Jehovah’s worship and organization on earth and that his people would never again be free to return. They were determined to work to that end, in order to bring reproach upon Jehovah, the God of Jacob or Israel. Once more, however, Satan’s mighty organization was wrong. Again its mighty ones visible and invisible proved to be false gods. Again they were exposed as being false prophets, unable to bring their words to pass. Jehovah vindicated himself by delivering his remnant. His pure worship was restored. It will be preserved. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

Oh, then, let us no longer be fashioned after this world of wickedness, so near its end, but acquire the new mind filled with the knowledge of God’s will. Let us keep that mind renewed by faithfully doing his will, and live now as blessed proclaimed of God’s kingdom and as inheritors of his glorious new world. Then, if God favors us with survival of the battle of Armageddon and we enter the new world without dying, although we shall not have new bodies instantaneously we shall have new minds wholly in tune with the righteous new world. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Those who oppose us Jehovah has promised to oppose. That means he is on our side and backs us up. At the battle of Armageddon he will confuse our oppressors and opposers. He will maneuver them into fighting one against another and thus destroying one another. So it will come about that they will eat the flesh of one another and drink the blood of one another. The final conclusion will be that all flesh—our enemies while yet alive in the flesh, and we, also —will he made to see that Jehovah is the only Savior of his people, those who come to Zion. If we cleave to him and serve with his great Servant Christ Jesus, we are bound to get full deliverance at last.

<p><span class="font6">The source of the joy and gladness of Jehovah’s witnesses is a secret to this world, and it makes all the nations marvel that no world woe dries it up. The psalmist discloses the source of their irrepressible gladness. It is a river, vital to the life of the visible organization of God’s people, for it means life-giving refreshment to them. It is a river of divine blessings to them, a river of truths about his kingdom long ago promised and now set up. Along with this river goes the joyful privilege of spreading its Kingdom truths to all who seek good government, security and lasting peace. Forth from the throne of God and of his King reigning at his right hand the life-giving river of truth flows. (Rev. 22:1,2) We have no fear of a shortage of this water of Kingdom truth, for it flows from an inexhaustible source through Jehovah’s theocratic organization. Our foes would like to cut off this water supply, but cannot. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Their angels in heaven always have access to my Father who is in heaven.—Hiatt. 18:10, FW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In strictly personal matters and in everyday matters the early disciples had to determine God’s will just the same as we have to do now. The time for open angelic appearances and audible directions of God’s holy spirit is past, just as the time for the miraculous gifts of the spirit has passed. Happily, though, we still have God’s holy spirit or active force with us, and we still have the ministrations of his holy angels to depend on though they do not become visible. We are not to expect the unseen angels of God to be constantly hovering at the side of each of us and directing us in every step wc take lest we go the wrong way or meet an accident. Yet we have the comforting assurance that God’s angels are rendering an important service in our behalf. They are now subject to the glorified Jesus and we know he uses them to help and serve his faithful followers on earth, that they may gain salvation in the coming new world. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Let him call the older men of the congregation to him, and let them pray over him, rubbing him with oil in the name of Jehovah.—Jas. 5:14, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The older men are not merely to pray with the spiritually sick, but must also rub him with oil in the name of Jehovah. The “oil” here is the soothing word of instruction from the Holy Scriptures and it restores the spiritually sick one to unity with the Christian congregation which is in God’s favor. Correction which leads to spiritual health is described as soothing and curative by the psalmist. (Ps. 133: 1,2; 23: 5; 141: 5; Prov. 15:30; Luke 10: 34) So the older men of the congregation are to rub the spiritually sick one with oil in the sense of stimulating him with the soothing, healing, comforting, corrective Word of God. In the name of Jehovah they are to do this. That is to say, in faithfulness to Jehovah God and according to his purpose, so as to aid the spiritually ill one to recover and have a part anew in vindicating God’s name and proving the Devil a false god and liar. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The mere fact that there were false alarms in the past does not prove the present alarm sounded by Jehovah’s witnesses to be false. It is folly to judge a matter before you hear it. (Prov. 18:13) The Scriptures show that Jesus does not come in a flesh-and-blood form visible to man at the time of his second presence. His kingdom is in heaven. He is enthroned there. But he turns his attention toward earth, to cause warning to be given prior to Armageddon, the battle of God Almighty, wherein the wicked will be wiped from the face of the earth as thoroughly as they were in Noah’s day. Armageddon is no fight between nations, but is Jehovah’s battle, fought through Christ and his angels, against Satan and his demons and their visible representatives on earth. Warning is given in advance so that honest persons who love righteousness and who are willing to use their minds may discern the approach of Armageddon and take the necessary steps for survival. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon.—Zech. 2:7, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah saw to it that the remnant of his people of Zion escaped from this wicked Devil-ruled world to a place of safety in his city, along with his “other sheep” who are now coming out. He commands them to escape from Babylon and become a free people—if not in body, then in conscience; and they do. They come out from under its oppression, servitude and sinful way of life. No longer are they slaves to that wicked organization. They render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, but not what belongs to God! Their eyes are opened to a new world and a new world society. Those who have already been freed from the oppression of Babylon, even though in some cases they are still in jails, work camps or concentration camps, are not satisfied just to hold this freedom to themselves. At every opportunity they talk to strangers, even though physically still captive in Babylon.

<p><span class="font6">The ark which the Greater Noah, Christ Jesus, constructs consists of a new system of things, a new divine arrangement which affords us protection and preserves us for eternal salvation. The congregation, the theocratic organization which he builds, must live within this new system of things and must think, speak and work in harmony with it. This ark or theocratic structure is the laughingstock of the world, for it is built according to God’s instructions and for his purpose. It is different ! The world has seen nothing like it and does not understand it. Hence faith in God is required for its construction, and those who work for this new system of things must exercise faith to carry on under the scoffing and reproach of this world.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ex. 20: 7, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Men take God’s name in vain when they misapply it to persons or to things that should not bear it or when they attach it to lies and counterfeit messages to which his name does not belong as originator and sponsor. (Jer. 23:16-31, AS) As a nation the Jewish people of old took his name in vain, for they were called by his name, Jehovah’s people, but they did not live up to that worthy name. (Isa. 52:5; Ezek. 36 : 20, 22, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AS)</span><span class="font6"> Ever since adopting the name “Jehovah’s witnesses” in 1931 Christians have been living up to that name. But did these witnesses act presumptuously in taking His name? No; for a true son is not ashamed of his Father’s worthy name. The name befits the work they did before 1931 and have been doing since. At Jehovah’s rejection of the faithless Jews the faithful Christians became the chosen people “for his name”. They are therefore not presumptuous in taking that name and making it famous. If Jehovah’s witnesses have brought reproach upon His name, let their enemies say how. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

He was the first to tell the good news of deliverance to the remnant of his capital organization Zion. He did so through the Bible, and on it he shed the light of his revelation. In 1919 he broke the grip of mighty Babylon and released his prisoner people. He restored them to his theocratic organization and to its free, fearless activity.

<p><span class="font6">We cannot leave out of account the power of God’s spirit in this matter of making us new, making us different from what we were when we were part of an ignorant world. So we need God’s spirit. But we cannot expect it to work upon us automatically to change us mentally and bring about a transformation of our lives. From the sacred Record we see that God’s spirit does not operate apart from his Word. Hence if we want this spirit to work in our lives we must get acquainted with His Word. This is the only thing that gives us information and instruction different from what this world has to offer. Only it gives us a vision of the true God and of what his adorable qualities are and what he purposes to do to clear himself of all the false charges laid against him and to change living conditions for mankind’s lasting good.

<p><span class="font6">For Isaiah of old, it was as if he were Israel’s high priest and seeing past the inner curtain of the temple and beholding God’s glory. It made him feel his lowly condition in God’s sight. So the opening of the eyes of understanding of the remnant of the Isaiah class today to behold corresponding things was likewise meant to impress them with how far short they come of the divine glory. Isaiah 12:1 indicates Jehovah was angry with the remnant of his witnesses for their fear and failure during World War I. On this basis they might have been destroyed with the world at that time when judgment began at God’s house. But his shortening of the days of tribulation upon Satan’s organization made for their being spared and also for all the other sheep to he spared who have since then been gathered to the fold of the Right Shepherd.

<p><span class="font6">The remnant of the Lazarus class are spiritual Jews. Upon their “skirt” we now see “ten men . . . out of all languages of the nations” take hold and go up with them as companions to Jehovah’s theocratic organization. They are like Job’s brothers, sisters and acquaintances who came to comfort him, besides those beautiful children whom he fathered in his old age. (Zech. 8: 20-23 ; Job 42:11) They are the “other sheep” whom Jehovah’s Right Shepherd, Jesus Christ, brings into unity with the Lazarus remnant, making them one flock under one Shepherd. In this way, too, these “other sheep” become intimate companions with the remnant and come into the bosom favor of the Greater Abraham, and they share in the present “good things” and comfort of the remnant.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bind up the brokenhearted, —Isa. 61:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The spirit of Jehovah God is upon his witnesses for them to “preach good tidings unto the meek’’ and to “bind up the brokenhearted”, rather than to break hearts by carnal combat. Now when the river of life-saving truth is flowing out from the throne of God's established kingdom, his witnesses must be like trees whose leaves are “for the healing of the nations” and “for medicine”, rather than wounding them. This is the “surpassing way” of love, the love of God with all a person has and the love of one’s neighbor as oneself. (Rev. 22 : 2 ; Ezek. 47 : 12 ; 1 Cor. 12: 31-13: 7, iff) Jehovah’s witnesses are not pacifists, but are ministers and conscientious objectors on Scriptural grounds. In taking this stand, draft boards have been enabled to see that they stay neutral toward this world and that they remain God’s ministers and ordained preachers of the gospel, with Scriptural and conscientious objection to taking part in worldly wars. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

In fact, they are commanded to share the waters and invite others to them. No socialized medicine this, carried on by taxing the people.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">God's organization is more important to him than the salvation of an immoral or disobedient creature. The vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty and the keeping of his name above reproach is of higher importance than the preserving of willful sinners. Hence these paramount things must come first. Accordingly God shows due respect for the organization which bears his name. He executes his judgments against the defilers and keeps it clean. Since God so respects his organization, then we must exercise fear and must respect it too. It is our solemn obligation to watch our conduct and avoid bringing reproach upon it or corrupting it. For one thing, therefore, keep marriage honorable and the marriage bed undefiled. We may not defile or bring reproach upon the organization by impure conduct and stay in it, for this would act like a yeast to ferment the organization. 17 .}/</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Counting from the end of the “appointed times of the nations” in 1914, we are 38 years into the “time of the end” of this world. During these crucial years Jehovah’s witnesses have sought shelter and strength in him, and they can confess for themselves that he is a “well-proved help in trouble”. If it w’ere not for this, they would not be here today nor increasing in numbers. But we are entering the most serious and trial-some years of this “time of the end”. The final conflict of Armageddon draws near. So let us not forget that Jehovah God does not change any more than his Word changes. (Mal. 3 : 6, AS) His strength is displayed amid our weakness. No trouble can grow so severe in the future that he cannot help us through it, if we abide trustfully in him as our refuge and do not look to this world for help by a compromise with the world which is God’s enemy. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

Her children have been brought out from mystic Babylon. Freedom has come, and Babylon’s end is here. The erstwhile conqueror now is conquered. The glory of that great city is ended, and her mighty ruler, Satan, is laid low and despised. Some who move along with the released captives become lawless, wicked and contemptible, however, and it is to their everlasting shame. They came out of Babylon’s “dust”, but do not live in Zion. They die as an “evil slave” class.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 30:21, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The voice behind us is God’s voice from the past, speaking through his written Word as it is made plain through his organization. This organization is needed to integrate all our efforts throughout the many nations. It is needed for serving all believers unitedly with the revelations of God’s Word. It brings all Kingdom publishers into co-operation with the one “pure language” of the truth. It prevents our working to cross-purposes, or duplicating our efforts, or having territories overlap, or having weaknesses resulting from disunity, and other things hindering our getting God’s work done. God directs his organization through its Head Jesus Christ. If we want to get the benefit of his leadings we need to work with the organization. If the enemy isolates you, then carry on as you have been taught and trained through the organization. This is the proper thing to do, rather than look for an angel to appear and give specific directions. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">All partakers of the Memorial emblems must keenly sense their unity with the Head Jesus Christ in doing God’s will. We must remember him as the vital one with whom to be in union and must not create divisions among ourselves and so destroy the united body. It is Jesus’ blood that validates the new covenant and we must not act toward that blood as if it were a common thing, willfully sinning by sectarianism, idolatry, greed, and works of the flesh. Christ Jesus, who provided his blood for the new covenant, died to vindicate Jehovah’s name and universal sovereignty. We should copy him in the kind of death he died, becoming “united with him in the likeness of his death” that we may also be “united with him in the likeness of his resurrection”. So keep free from guilt against these vital things, not playing hypocrites at the Memorial or Lord's evening meal. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">——Jas. 1:11,, 15, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When God faced Adam and Eve with the prohibition against eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, that was not a tempting of them with evil, for the tree was not evil in itself. Jehovah warned them against eating it disobediently and informed them of the evil consequences. Hence they could not be tempted toward it according to ignorance. It was when Eve listened to the serpent’s deceptive talk that she became tempted. God’s warning against eating created no appetite or desire in her for the tree, but the serpent’s false description of the results of eating it contrary to God's prohibition and warning created in her a wrong desire. This was what worked up a temptation for her, as James says above. Because of not dismissing this desire as wrong and as against God, but entertaining it, the temptation drew her into sin and cheated her. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/ 15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">At the end of this old system of things Jehovah speaks to us by means of his Son. We have a record of what he said and we can study it. Not only that, the greatest event in history has occurred, namely, Christ Jesus has been placed upon his throne and is ruling as Jehovah’s King. He is God's reflected glory and the exact representation of his being. He is much better than the angels because he has inherited a name more excellent than any of these. If what the angels said prior to Christ happened, more surely will the sayings of the Son of God take place. Certainly we must listen to his commands and do them. It is because of the instruction of the Son of God that Jehovah’s witnesses go out and proclaim the Kingdom message. We must keep in mind that the one speaking and giving directions is God’s only-begotten Son. We are to walk in his steps, follow his example and preach the Word. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

This brings you no happiness but only suffering and hurt. So how are you suffering and how will God judge you? The way he says at 1 John 3:15. Maybe you say you do not indulge in stealing other people's material goods and so would never suffer for stealing. But are you stealing a fellow Christian’s gixid name by slander? Or, by your ambitions to shine and be worshiped by your brothers, are yon stealing worship and praise that belong to God? Are you always seeking the welfare of your brothers and of God's lost and scattered “other sheep”, or are yon selfishly, jealously or resentfully and unforgivingly seeking for the injury of your brothers'? Are you curious and interesting yourself in other people’s matters? Suffering for doing these things is not Christlike. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses are God’s ambassadors sent to all the nations, with the same message for all. Hence they have not enlisted in the fighting forces of any of the nations. They maintain strict neutrality toward such nations in their mortal combats. They keep true to the divine government, which sends them as ambassadors, even though this neutrality and this Kingdompreaching cause them to be</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“hated by all the nations”. They have not fought for the unreconciled systems which God will destroy at Armageddon. Hence their conscientious objection! Their warfare is spiritual. For this spiritual warfare they are ordered : “Take up the complete suit of armor from God”; and such spiritual armor they must take up that they may &quot;be able to stand firm against the machinations of the Devil; because we have a fight, not against blood and flesh”, but against spirit forces. (Eph. 6 :11-13, IflF) Such terms show God’s ambassadors are not pacifists. 17 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Dan. 5:13,30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Babylon’s crowd would like to hear a pleasant message, that is, that this old world will endure indefinitely. But will Jehovah’s witnesses soften the judgment message from Jehovah? Will they try to please the cars of Satan's seed? By Jehovah’s mercy they boldly declare the full import of the message with ever-increasing volume and finality, as Daniel did. They know that Jehovah’s hosts of execution are on the move and that Jehovah will shortly take over the complete rule of earth through Christ Jesus. It is true. It is right. They cannot hold back. Just as Daniel stood alone and unarmed, so Jehovah's witnesses do not carry carnal weapons. They do not try to accomplish the overthrow of the wicked world through their own power, but they stand as Jehovah’s announcers and impress all the people by their boldness and complete trust in Jehovah. Never did they speak with more boldness than now. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Cornerstone of Zion is the King Christ Jesus. When the “appointed times of the nations” ended in 1914 the day of Jehovah commenced and his King was authorized to start operations in the midst of his enemies. He wins the battle after approximately three and a half years, or by 1918. Just as at the first advent Jesus appeared and was anointed and three and a half years later presented himself as king, so in the completion. In 1914 he began acthity as priest and king, and three and a half years later offered himself as king. Again he is the tried and tested Cornerstone. For three and a half years he battled evil and conquered. So the Stone of Zion was laid in completion in 1918. The King not only is now’ present but has proved himself the victorious one of God's choice by ousting from heaven Satan and all his demon forces. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lore . . . does not look for its own interests—1 Cor. 13:4,5, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">At Philippians 2: 25-30 there is not the trace of a suggestion that Paul performed divine healing to save Epaphro-ditus from dying. Nor did he prevent him from getting near the gates of death, even though his fellow worker was of great help to Paul. But God blessed what means were used to bring him back to health and so God had mercy on the sick brother. Incidentally, if Epaph-roditus were not to sleep in death but to go immediately to heaven at death, would sparing him for further earthly life have been a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">mercy</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> to him? Besides him, there was Trophimus. In Paul's last letter before his death at Rome he writes to tell Timothy: “I left Trophimus sick at Miletus.” (2 Tim. 4:20, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Why, now, did the gifted Paul leave Trophimus sick, and why had not Trophimus asked Paul to use his gift of the spirit upon him to heal him? Because miraculous power is not to be used for our personal convenience or for the relief of devoted Christians in the church. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">That thou mayest say to the piisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves.—Isa. 49:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The remnant of Christ's body formed a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">servant</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> body under Jesus the Head, and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">servant</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> class is not for serving itself only but for serving others to whom Jehovah sends his servant class. The Right Shepherd Christ Jesus said he must gather “other sheep” and bring them that they might be one flock with the remnant under one Shepherd. A great crowd of these other sheep are straying about abused by the false shepherds of the Babylonish religious systems. They are, in fact, prisoners of Babylon and are in the death-dealing darkness there. They, too, need to have Jehovah's great Servant say to them, Go forth, show yourselves, come out into freedom and the light of truth and divine favor! They, too, must come to Zion and submit to the theocratic organization so as to escape destruction at Armageddon. Now the eyes of the remnant are open to see they must serve these, besides the servant class. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">We are not trying to display human worldly wisdom to blow up ourselves in people’s estimation. We humbly conduct ourselves as persons who have received God’s undeserved kindness and we do not want to waste it by missing the good purpose for which it was conferred upon us. A big part of that undeserved kindness is expressed by God’s putting us in the ministry, to serve out the good news to other people. If we are conscientious about the way we carry on this ministry and use it right, not to gain power over the people or to make money off them or to live off them, then we shall not only have a clear conscience ourselves but also recommend ourselves as God’s ministers to the consciences of people who hunger for the truth. That is the way Paul felt about it.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 16:26, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The chasm pictures God’s judgment, which cannot be reversed and which divides the rich man and Lazarus classes. It forbids any mercy or relief to Christendom. She is abandoned since making her decision following World War I. She then decided against God’s established kingdom and favored the international conspiracy for ruling the earth by human agents in defiance of His rightful sovereignty and in opposition to his King Jesus Christ, whom he put on the throne in 1914 to rule amidst his enemies. The Kingdom is here to rule in triumph. Now this world, including Christendom and its religious powers, must be abandoned to destruction. Her “rich man” class are like Esau, who sold his birthright for selfishness and moved to Mount Seir. Afterward when he wanted to inherit the blessing he was rejected, for, “although he earnestly sought a change of mind [in Isaac] with tears, he found no place for it.”—Heb. 12 : 16,17, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW; </span><span class="font6">Ezek. 35. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W S/l</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Eph. 6:17,18, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sword is a spiritual one for battling with the enemy at close quarters. The spirit of God forged, hardened, shaped and sharpened that sword, because the writers of that Word were just men and so they needed the spirit or active force of God to move them to write His message. Hence His spirit speaks to us by that Word and that Word is an expression of his spirit. His spirit is invincible, and that is what makes this sword of God’s Word invincible against man and devil. Jesus set us the example in using that spiritual sword, God’s Word. His quoting God’s written Word and saying “It is written” killed or stopped cold the traditional arguments and worldly philosophies or unscriptural reasonings of the religious dupes of the demons. But along with his expert use of this sword from God Jesus prayed, regularly. His prayers were heard. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The 1,290 days are reckoned from the date of the setting up of the abomination, in the latter part of January, 1919. This period of 3 years and 7 months ends at September, 1922. Then the doom of the abomination was to be pronounced. Three years and seven months passed from the time the abomination was placed until it was publicly pronounced as condemned, there at the Cedar Point Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in September, 1922. There, too, another situation ceased, which had obtained from the time the continual sacrifice of praise to Jehovah was interfered with in 1918. For now this sacrifice of praise to him was restored and it was again being offered in his temple. At this same time the horrid abomination, standing in the place of God’s kingdom, was exposed as a subterfuge. So ended the 1,290 days of Daniel. W 7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">May we see our duty now to do this by resisting all infiltration of immorality, unchastity and worldliness into the theocratic organization by persons today like Balaam and Jezebel. In this behalf the rule for us is, “Let marriage be honorable among all, and the marriage bed be without defilement.” Husbands and wives will harmonize with this divine rule. They will endeavor to honor their marriage by dignifying it according to the ideal standards which God’s Word sets for it. (Eph. 5:21-33, A’TV) We cannot consistently gain our own salvation and at the same time hinder others from doing so because of our immoral, reproachful behavior which involves God’s organization. If we disown God by our conduct, he will disown us by disfellowshiping us.

<p><span class="font6">It is not for failure on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses to tell his message that Christendom faces destruction. In sending his witnesses he had a kindly purpose, namely, to announce the Kingdom of salvation and to give advance warning of the evil to follow a rejection of that kingdom. This shows how vitally important the message we bear is. Rather than be healed by it, Christendom rebels against it. All the same, the message does have a good effect too. The spiritual remnant themselves have been affected by the Word this way, and now, too, a great flock of “other sheep” of the Right Shepherd. With softened hearts they receive the message proclaimed by the witnesses. They let it sink deep into open ears of understanding, and with eyes of faith they see how Jehovah is using his witnesses to accomplish his work. So they abandon doomed Christendom, turn to Jehovah and associate with his organization of witnesses and get healed. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

No, there must be a full test of the unswerving devotion of his theocratic organization to him. The wicked intent and malice of the enemy must be allowed to bare itself, and the situation must become such as to show that all human help is unavailable and unable to save. How, then, is God's help of his organization “right early’’? Because it is early in the bright new day for his people. How often in past history of his people it has been at dawn that the deliverance of them has been realized ! So, too, it will be for the deliverance of the visible organization of God’s people. Outwardly, with the forces of darkness massing and pressing in upon them, how dark the depths of night might appear for them! But his complete deliverance of them at the height of the battle of Armageddon will usher in a new day for them. It will be the early part or morning of eternal day for them.

Your being made a new personality which stands out different from this world results from knowledge, accurate knowledge of the great Creator. His Word reveals him to you and shows you how he conducts himself, what he thinks, and what his principles or rules of action are. It is a glorious vision that you get of him by means of his illuminated Word. By looking at him through your accurate knowledge, you can be made new and become an image of him by reflecting what he is, imitating him in conduct and thought, expressing yourself like him, and meeting his requirements of you. Thus you can be changed from one stage of glory of likeness to him to another stage, and his holy spirit will work in you in this behalf.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thy word is a lamp to my feet, and a light on my path.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 119:105, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Word the Bible is the best seller of all time. For many it is also becoming the best dust-collector of our time. The most-sold but proportionately least-read book. Why? The Bible’s worth comes under assault from many quarters. The scientist says it is not scientific, the atheist says it is contradictory, the modernist clergy say it is legend, the fundamentalists make it appear ridiculous and void, and the people generally dismiss it as impractical for guidance in this hard-headed, realistic, wicked old world. But it is not unscientific, not contradictory, not legendary, not ridiculous and void, and above all it is not impractical. The scientist, the atheist, the modernist and fundamentalist clergy, and the people generally are wrong, for the Bible is the most scientific, consistent, factual, reasonable and practical book on earth. It alone is the reliable lamp and light for the feet and pathways of mon. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Death ruled</span><span class="font6"> as* </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">king from Adam down . . . That, just as sin ruled as king with death, likewise also undeserved kindness might rule as king through righteousness with everlasting life in view through Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Christ our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 5:14,21, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">So we were all subject to the cruel king death from our birth by being born from Adam, and not even the law of Moses proved to be a way of escape from his reign. This explains why everybody is sinful, imperfect, and dies. Whereas the law of Moses only showed up all mankind, including the Jews, to be sinners, God’s undeserved kindness came to man’s rescue and provided a way for fallen mankind to gain righteousness, the reward of which is everlasting life in a righteous new world. If Moses’ law failed to do it, then no human government can make us righteous by law and give us a clean standing before God. IIow, then, can we be freed from the condemnation to death which rests on us because of being born in sin? Only by what God’s undeserved kindness does for us through his Son Jesus Christ.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Evciyone [Anyone,</span><span class="font6"> A/o] </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">that divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he that marries a woman divorced from a husband commits adultery.—Luke 16:18, N</span><span class="font6"> W.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">When Jesus spoke, the Law covenant through Moses was passing out and the new covenant through the Greater Mediator, Jesus Christ, was superseding it. Under this if a Christian got a divorce from a marriage mate on any grounds other than sexual unfaithfulness, then if either of these remarried that one would be guilty of adultery. The Christian standard of marriage under the new covenant would be that established by God iu the garden of Eden with Adam and Eve. The man had but one living wife given him for the purpose of raising children to fill the earth and subdue it to a paradise state. God provided no divorce for the perfect pair. Likewise a married Christian must be the mate of only one living partner and should be faithful to that one. This statement irritated the Pharisees who followed Talmudic teachings.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord your God is testing you.—Deut. 13:3, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God subjects us to trial or test, not to cause our downfall but to prove what we are, to make what we are come to view. He does not tempt us with evil to wickedness, but we ourselves under Satan’s influence create the temptation by thinking how nice it would be to do or to have something contrary to God’s will, and then not dismissing the desire created by this improper thinking, but considering it more and more. In this way we are drawn out and led to ignore God’s counsel and warning. We enter into temptation. God proves what we are by trial. (John 6:6) When he tried Abraham, he proved Abraham’s faith and used him, not for an evil purpose, but for making a wonderful prophetic drama by having him sacrifice his beloved son Isaac. God was not asking Abraham to do something He himself would not do, for Abraham here pictured Jehovah God. In the great test of God as to the depths of his love for men he proved himself big-hearted enough to sacrifice his Son. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

And on this side of the river and on that side there were trees of life.-Rev. 22:1,2,</span><span class="font6">2VW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The spiritual remnant with a heavenly destiny were not the only ones to be healed as to their relations with God through Christ. A great crowd of others with an earthly destiny also needed the benefit of the heavenly Physician’s health work. They needed to be invited to the waters of Kingdom truth. They needed to have applied to them things with curative powers. So God commanded that his healed remnant should themselves go forth on a healing mission in these ominous days preceding Armageddon. For it is only the spiritually healed one who will get through Armageddon and emerge into the hale new world. So he has made his faithful remnant of Kingdom heirs to grow up like sturdy trees of righteousness on the banks of the river of truth. The standing of those rows of trees of righteousness there is a sure sign water is there. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Pct. 4:19, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God is the Creator of all souls. If he judges you worth saving to eternal life in the new world, he can re-create you as a soul in the resurrection from the dead. He can thus preserve your right to life as a soul for the new world. He does not forget your record of faithful service to him, and he will never deny you what it deserves. (Heb. 6:10) Hence he protects your right to the promised life in the new world. All the while, then, that you are doing good, you can confidently commend your souls to him, knowing they are in safe hands, and whatever men may do to you they cannot really harm the eternal interests of your souls. How wonderful it will be, when Armageddon strikes for the execution of divine judgment, to be found doing God’s will and with our souls fully commended to our faithful Creator! Only in that way may we expect to survive Armageddon. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

The King now reigns in righteousness over them. In behalf of peace and for the sake of righteousness he has set up an arrangement among them to fulfill the prophecy that “princes shall rule in justice”. This prophecy sets up the standard of conduct in office for such “princes”, that the organization may be kept clean, righteous. Those theocratically made servants in the organization must exercise justice and impartiality, with heavenly wisdom. Only then can they be noble representatives of the King of righteousness and be let continue in office by him.

<p><span class="font6">With Armageddon scheduled for this generation, the Bible is specially practical for our day. Primarily so because it charts our course through the perilous storm of Armageddon’s winter and guides us through the portals of a new world more refreshing and lasting than any literal springtime could ever be. If we accept and follow the Bible as our practical guide now, after Armageddon we will look over the destruction wrought by the unleashed wrath of Jehovah God. We will see the wreckage and ruin of this so-called diesel civilization, that was too proud and conceited and sophisticated to fit itself to what it considered a cameltrain philosophy. Like dung upon the ground will lie the unburied bodies of those who would not heed God. Strewn over the earth, unlamented, says Jeremiah 25: 33.

<p><span class="font6">The Christian’s warfare is not against blood and flesh. His real foes cannot be touched by carnal weapons, and hence he takes up God’s spiritual armor. He turns his fighting qualities and energies into the spiritual warfare in order to liberate people from the bondage of the wicked spirit forces dominating this world. He is in God’s spiritual army under Jesus Christ. For him to desert it and join this world in its fights would be disloyalty to God and Christ. It would deserve to be punished with destruction without hope of any life in the righteous new world. He must keep his agreement with God and pay his vow to him, for those who are “false to agreements” are by God's law “deserving of death”. (Rom. 1: 31, 32. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font6">So Jehovah’s witnesses keep neutral toward worldly conflicts and obey the command to take part in suffering evil.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Acts 2:38, id, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The life-seeking Jews needed to be saved from the baptism of fire that threatened the nation. Three thousand believed Peter’s message that Jesus was glorified in heaven to be both Lord and Christ, and later thousands more ; and they were all baptized in Uis name for the forgiveness of their sins and to receive the gift of the holy spirit, participating in its baptism. In course of time these followed Jesus’ instructions and did not enter into Jerusalem at Passover time A.D. 70. So they did not get trapped there by the Roman legions that besieged the city, and they did not fall by famine, pestilence and the sword nor get captured and led off into exile as slaves of Rome. They were spared from a fire baptism upon that faithless nation. In this they pictured how persons with faith in God and Christ today will be spared from a like baptism shortly upon Christendom. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah's remnant delivered in 1919 have a part as his coworkers in famishing all the gods of the earth or causing them to waste away, disabling them. How? By exalting Jehovah before all nations as the only living and true God, the invincible God who brings deliverance. By announcing that his agency for this deliverance has come, namely, his kingdom by Christ Jesus, and hence that this deliverance from great Babylon is now possible for all people of good will in all nations. Also by displaying their own God-given freedom from Babylon and by showing that Almighty Jehovah has broken Babylon’s yoke from their necks. By showing, too, that the gods of the nations are false gods, that they have no power against the word, work and organization of Jehovah, for he is “the God of gods”. Also by demonstrating that the true, acceptable religion, the clean, undefiled worship exists in the theocratic organization of Jehovah’s free people.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—John 17:11, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What we want is to be transformed with a hope of endless life in happiness in the new world now so close at hand. In this behalf we need to fill our heads with information from the great Fountain of life, Jehovah God. We need knowledge to replace ignorance. We need light to replace darkness. And such knowledge and light we get by means of God's Word, the Holy Bible. It is this Word which sanctifies us. That is, it separates us from this world and brings us close to God. This was why Jesus prayed for his followers to be sanctified by it. The reason why it sanctifies you or sets you apart from this world is because it is different from what this world thinks, says, writes and teaches. So tear away Satan’s blinding veil which he has put over your eyes by means of this world. With unprejudiced eyes and honest hearts come to God’s Book and earnestly and prayerfully study it to learn the enlightening truth. Then your mind will be freed from bedarkening traditions and philosophies of men. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus Jesus answers the question, How long must I keep on working? As long as this witness must be preached to the nations, the end will not come. It is quite evident that thousands upon thousands of persons have not yet been given ample opportunity to take their stand on the side of the Kingdom. What shall be done? With thousands of persons of good will coming to Jehovah’s organization and becoming ministers of the good news after a period of study, and this at the rate of 49,000 a year since 1948, one would think the Theocracy's increase would be even greater each year. Could it be greater? Is each one dedicated to God getting a firm hold on eternal life by declaring the right confession publicly? It is good for every one of Jehovah's witnesses to analyze his work carefully. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of the Christ? . . . You, cannot be drinking the cup of Jehovah and the cup of demons.—1 Cor. 10:16,21,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark289"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ’s body members do not share in providing the blood of the new covenant. Only Jesus does that. By his blood he mediates the new covenant in their behalf. So in that sense they could not be “sharing in the blood of the Christ”. How, then, can Paul’s words above be true? Because this cup is the “cup of Jehovah” in still another sense. How so? In that it pictures the portion which Jehovah has poured. Jesus and his little flock of Kingdom joint heirs must drink it to prove their integrity to Him and their worthiness of the Kingdom. It symbolized God’s will for the drinker, and drinking it spelled suffering and death on the torture stake for Jesus. But God’s will for Jesus did not end in his death. It also included Jesus’ resurrection from the dead to immortal life in heaven, and so a saving of him out of death. It was for him, therefore, a “cup of salvation” also.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">When King David was ruling in the midst of his foes in the Promised Land he had to come against all them and subdue them all until he had reached every border of the kingdom's God-given domain. Likewise Christ Jesus the Son of David, who is now ruling in the midst of his enemies, must yet come like a thief at an unexpected day and hour against them lined up at Armageddon and must break up their organized power and grind them to powder. The first expression of the Kingdom’s coming was when it began the tribulation on Satan’s world organization and hurled him down from the heavens. The complete expression of its coming will be when it revives this tribulation which has been interrupted since 1918 and wipes out Satan’s organization at Armageddon. There Jesus the King binds him and his demons, casts them into the abyss and seals it up for a thousand years. Then he begins reigning for a millennium. So then is when the prayer is fully answered.

<p><span class="font6">Confined invalids and cripples are reporting time they devote to witnessing, and they are listed among the more than 435,000 active witnesses whom the Almighty has raised up in this year 1952. These confined ones should not be neglected. We should care for them, cooperate with them, supply their service needs, furnish them spiritual food by personal visitation and other means. Besides persons in hospitals, sickrooms, and other places of confinement who are letting the light of Kingdom truth shine out, there are others who are blind, deaf, dumb, crippled or otherwise handicapped and afflicted. These are nevertheless going out into the field and proclaiming the Kingdom and accomplishing a mighty witness, all in demonstration of God's power amid weakness. So none of suchlike should be disheartened. Let them carry forward their fine efforts and put God’s power to the proof. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">There are two courses open for us to chose from: either to be faithful or unfaithful, fearless or fearful. Jeremiah’s prophecy shows we will pass through much persecution and still Jehovah will always provide sufficient help in every time of need. The prophecy is strengthening to our faith, because it discloses that he will preserve his faithful witnesses as a body right through the battle of Armageddon and into the new world. True, there are going to be some who start in the Christian way and then become fearful through deficiency in knowledge of and trust in Jehovah, looking for salvation in modern-day Egypt instead, which is seen in the prophetic story of Urij ah. This should be a warning to us. Let us be as faithful as Jeremiah, always. Yes, some faithful individual witnesses may die in the fray, as a testimony to Jehovah’s honor, but that is to their gain.

<p><span class="font6">Seeing them “in the kingdom of God” means seeing with the eye of understanding that Jehovah, Jesus Christ and his congregation of spirit-begotten followers form the kingdom of God and are the ones in that heavenly kingdom. The expression here “all the prophets,” together with Jacob, represents the congregation of spiritual Israel, the members of the “body of Christ”. In the prophecies such ancient prophets were used to foreshadow these spirit-begotten Christians and to forecast their role or course of action. So together, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and all the prophets picture the theocratic government. So when people from all directions come and recline at the Kingdom table, it means that these believers are taken into the Kingdom class and feast on Kingdom truths.

The same degree of loyalty and faithfulness is required of those who have the heavenly hope and those who have the earthly hope. Complete dedication of everything one has is required of all who will enjoy the happiness of God’s universal organization. His &quot;other sheep” today are happy because they know that the earthly organization of Jehovah to which they belong is under the immediate control of the heavenly organization, and they will make up earth’s new society under the rulership of Zion’s King. All should remember that the whole inhabited earth must know that the heavenly Zion’s King is now in authority and is ruling. The Cornerstone has been laid there in completion and the judgment is on. The unbelievers will be destroyed but the believers will be saved, protected and blessed forever. Behold, therefore, your King and be happy, you who believe in him.

<p><span class="font6">Jesus restricted his preaching to the Jews and Samaritans that these first might have the Kingdom opportunity extended to them. So here again we see the need of the servant class, if Jehovah’s Servant is to be a “light to the Gentiles” and His “salvation unto the end of the earth”. The Chief Servant would have to use his followers as his ambassadors and send them to the Gentiles, if light and salvation were to come to such uncircumcised nations. This he began to do when he sent Peter to the Italian centurion Cornelius to preach the good news about Jehovah and his Christ. That Isaiah’s prophecy here includes in a secondary way the servant class under their Head Jesus is stated under inspiration. The apostle Paul and his companion Barnabas applied it this way when they quoted it at Acts 13:47. There is no question about it.

<p><span class="font6">Every Christian outside should respect the marriage bed of a husband and wife and not yield to any part in causing a defilement of it. For a Christian to procure a divorcement where the marriage mate has not proved immoral and then remarry is a violation of the marriage bed. Seripturally it is bigamy. Likewise a professed Christian who practices polygamy is dishonoring marriage and defiling the Christian marriage bed. A Christian will honor his own marriage or that of another because it is what God instituted. A Christian will not covet another’s marriage partner and will not commit adultery or fornication. These things are sin and displease God. The apostle Paul warns against such sins, “for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.” (Heb. 13:4, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW}</span><span class="font6"> This fact should act as a deterrent against one’s dishonoring marriage and defiling the marriage bed. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

Yes, the way out of Babylon’s darkness is made clear, for the Kingdom sun shines upon it. The faithful therefore declare the Kingdom truths with boldness, without fear of man or conditions, for they know whom they serve and why they serve, and where they are going. Shine forth, then, yop people of Jehovah, so that the returning multitudes will not lose their way or stumble as they eagerly make for the holy city. Those who shine forth are the wise ones and shall be rewarded by Jehovah forevermore.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 6:3, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Their saying “holy” three times makes this quality very emphatic. It shows that the Almighty God is inherently devoted to righteousness, incapable of doing anything wrong. That is why the earth over which he has taken his great power to reign by Christ must be made a holy place. The earth is his footstool, and it will be made glorious, for it was with prophetic import that the seraphim kept calling to one another, “The whole earth is full of his glory.” So this unholy world cannot go on forever. Not yet is our earth full of his glory, but it will be full of it as a result of the oncoming “war of the great day of God the Almighty”. His majestic splendor will be everywhere throughout the earth, and all the living will know he is King.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted. Jehovah of hosts is with us.—Ps. 46: 6, 7, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Those in the theocratic organization will remain solid and unmoved upon their “ei er-lasting rock”, Jehovah. This Almighty One with his heavenly armies is on our side. So who can be against us and win? Like Jesus in Gethsemane, we do not now ask for his legions of angels to intervene in a violent way for us before the divine time. Y<sup>T</sup>et we know they surround us with their protection. “The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth the m.” (Ps. 34: 7, AS) We know that at present they are “spirits for public service” whom God sends forth to minister to his Kingdom heirs and their companions of good will. (Heb. 1:14, AH’) Take courage, then, even though you seem standing alone. Jehovah of hosts is with each one of his people upon whom his name is called, because they stick on his side and proclaim his name. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Do not mind being thought queer. This being thought eccentric and queer by this world is nothing over which to feel embarrassed. This being talked about with scorn and reproach is nothing over which to feel bad or to feel condemned. It is something over which to fed grateful to God, because we have the privilege of suffering reproach with Him and his Son. Imagine the way people must have talked about Noah and his family for not indulging in the violence, fleshly corruption and evil imaginations, schemes and hypocritical religion of that final century before the Flood. It was because Noah’s course condemned the world. But their evilspeaking and condemning of Noah and his household did not prove these in the wrong, for these survived the flood, but the evilspeakers were flooded out of existence.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Since the mind is that faculty of our consciousness with which we gather information and think, then for it to be made over we must gather information other than what this world has brought us up on, thus giving us a certain mental cast or structure. This world professes to be wise and brainy in this twentieth century, but it is built and operated according to ignorance. This has come largely through willfulness due to selfishness. By this we mean ignorance of God’s truth, his will and his purposes. If we pattern our lives after this system of things and its nations, then, whether willfully or unknowingly, we are patterning ourselves after those who arc in mental darkness and alienated from godly living because of the ignorance in them and because of their unfeeling hearts. Is that the kind of people we want to copy? If we do, then our minds will never be made over but will be blinded. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 66:22, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Christendom has been thoroughly corrupted. One terrible by-product of her hypocritical, apostate course is atheistic international communism ! This anti-Christian social and political system is sworn to wipe out Christendom. The prospect of World War III with atomic weapons of mass destruction offers Christendom no sure prospect of postwar religious existence or activity. So it looks as if the false god Satan and his world religion had won out </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> time for sure. But not so ! Again Jehovah has met the challenge. Again he has produced a remnant for his name, a remnant devoted to his pure worship. Let a third world war come, yes, let the end of this world come and with it apostate Christendom’s end, yet Jehovah's faithful remnant are here to stay till victory crowns the faithfulness of clean, undefiled worship.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Gen. 5:32;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7';7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In whom does Noah’s wife find her correspondency today? Obviously in the “bride” of Christ, the “Lamb's wife”. They are the “body of Christ”, his 144,000 faithful anointed followers who make up his spiritual “little flock”. Noah had his wife well before the end of that ungodly world and possibly long before the birth of his three sons. So Christ’s bride began forming long, long before the end of this wicked world, namely, nineteen centuries ago, at the beginning of this Christian system of things. In this “time of the end” she is represented on earth by the remnant of his anointed little floek. Noah’s wife did not forsake him. She followed him into the ark and did not die off but spent some of her years after the flood, though not to bring forth further children to Noah. So with the remnant now. Jehovah God is the great Baptizer of them into the Greater Noah. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Cyrus the Persian, in his first year, let the captive Jews return to the site of Jerusalem and rebuild Jehovah’s temple. They did not have to fight for their liberation by force of military arms, but Almighty God restored them for his name’s sake and because they repented and devoted themselves to his worship. But even after their restoration to their homeland the Jews did not become pacifists. This fact is noteworthy in the case of Nehemiah ! He was made governor of the Jewish province in Palestine and was sent to build good walls for the restored city of Jerusalem. The pagan enemies accused him of trying to secede from the empire. What action did he take? God’s cause was involved and the liberty of his people to worship him freely. That was why the Israelites chose to fight. It was not for the glory and power of the Persian empire that they fought. They fought for their brothers who belonged to God’s organization and who worshiped him. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.—Jer. 8:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Now is the favorable season of harvest and summertime in which we study God’s Word, preach the gospel, warn others, bring forth fruits of righteousness, and store up treasures in heaven that will assure us God’s protection during Armageddon. We may have to change our eating habits now, shifting to good spiritual food for our upbuilding and strengthening in Christian work. Now, before Armageddon starts, is the time for it. When wintry destruction sets in the favorable season for work will be gone, the harvest will be past, the summer will be over, and many will see that they are not saved. Like the bird or the bee or the bear that might wait for the first blizzard to be convinced of winter's coming, these tardy persons will be caught unawares and be swept into destruction. When winter starts it is too late for animals to prepare for survival. So it will be for persons who wait for Armageddon’s start to begin flight.

<p><span class="font6">Remember that those who are merciful now will receive God’s mercy during the destructions of Armageddon and will survive into the new world. Our work now of preaching the good news of God’s kingdom is a work of rescuing lives from destruction at Armageddon. The merciful rescue-workers will be rescued and preserved during Armageddon. We must exercise mercy toward the people to whom we preach, even if they are ungrateful. If we did not forgive the people in our territory to whom we proclaim the good news but who ignore us or mistreat us, we would not go back and work our territory over again with the life-saving Kingdom message. We represent God's kingdom, and his kingdom is a government of forgiveness toward man, for Christ Jesus the King of kings is God’s High Priest and his followers who will be kings in heaven with him are also to be priests of God with him. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">This is not the time to be looking back and mourning, and becoming so swallowed up in our weak selves that we lose sight of Jehovah’s theocratic organization and his glorious deeds of today. The remedy for an introverted, morbid state of mentality is to look ahead, not back. Keep the mind occupied with progressive thoughts. Keep it busy considering forward-looking plans. Keep your thoughts on the obligations ahead of you and how you are going to meet them. Remember the Bible studies for which you have to prepare, the talks you have to prepare for the public platform, the demonstrations you have to get ready for the weekly service meeting, and all the other things God has in reservation for you. Do not pull yourself down, do not weaken yourself, do not halt your progress by painful looking back at your sins or by looking buck wishfully at the things behind.

All those who undergo the full divine treatment till the great Physician discharges them from treatment because completely cured will be able to meet the loosing of Satan and his demons at the end of the thousand years. None will then be too weak to meet and repel his deceptive assaults and hold on to their perfect health of body, mind and heart against his infectious efforts. Those who yield to his misleading will do so, not due to some lurking disability in their system, but willfully and on their own inexcusable responsibility. God and his King will not let these rebels against theocratic government and righteousness live on and contaminate and infect the new world with death-breeding sin. They will destroy them utterly, cauterizing out the disease possibilities with the fire of everlasting destruction.—Rev. 20: 7-15. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah keeps the organized ruling powers of this world from overwhelming his people and wielding influence over them to force them into iniquity or lawlessness against God leading to their being cast away by Him. He will also watch or er the internal condition of his people and see that no lawless person rises up and stays in control among his people who arc seeking righteousness and meekness as subjects of the King of righteousness. The “princes” whom the King has appointed hy his theocratic organization to “rule in justice” will be watchful, too. Each one will serve as a protection.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The land must not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine, . . . For it is to me that the Israelites are slaves, being my slaves whom I brought out of the land of Egypt.—Lev. 25 : 23,55, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The chief oppressor of the human race is Jehovah’s great adversary, Satan the Devil. Jehovah God stands for true liberty of all his creatures. Satan the Devil stands for their enslavement. He opposes the divine purpose to free them, because this means freeing them from the Devil’s power.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We cannot underestimate the value, importance and power of God's Word. We must give it a continual place in our lives, ahead ot the words and commandments of any men who would make God’s Word null and roid, even under persecution. For our guide Psalm 119:161 (AS) says: “Princes have persecuted me without a cause; but my heart standeth in awe of thy words.” Hence we cleave to God’s written Word and obey it. By taking heed to his Word we can cleanse our path and keep it pure, clear through this dirty world. His Word taken into hearts and heads can make our minds over, and in this way can transform our lives away from all imitating of this corrupt system of things over to a course acceptable to God, in full harmony with him and leading us to eternal life in his new w o r I d.—Rom. 12:1, 2, AW. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The rich man admits Lazarus is a witness of Jehovah. He wants the Greater Abraham to send Lazarus away from his bosom to preach to his brothers in such a way and with such a message that it will not show them up to be dead toward God. It should not put them in mental torment. On the contrary, it should give them the false assurance that they are still in divine favor, reposing, like Lazarus, in the bosom of the Greater Abraham with all the promised new world blessings in view. The rich man class of today want God to make his witnesses change their unorthodox way of preaching and also the message. Soft-pedal this message of the “day of vengeance of our God” and let up on ‘overturning the strongly entrenched things’ of error, false religion, worldly friendship.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Do you not know that we shall fudge angels!—1 Cor. 6:3, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah must set himself right, not only before men, but also before angels. That means holy angels as well as hostile ones, Satan’s demons. Although a world ended in Noah’s day, yet Jehovah God did not send Noah to serve notice upon Satan the Devil to inform him that that wicked one was then to be destroyed. Now, however. God Almighty is causing a most unusual message to be delivered. Most unusual in what way? In that it serves notice upon Satan and all his demons that they too are to be destroyed at the end of this world. At Armageddon they will be cast still lower than the earth, into the great abyss to be held in solitary confinement there for a thousand years. Their pride keenly hurt, they object to being reminded of this now by the preaching of Jehovah’s witnesses. Neither do they want people on earth to be told about it. That is why they fight against the proclamation made by Jehovah's witnesses. Satan now rages against them like a cornered lion. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ex. 23:32, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God backs up his pure worship. His great adversary, together with all the demons under him, endeavors continually to work impurities into it and adulterate it and make it hypocritical so that even Jehovah God will reject it and abandon it to be destroyed. So there is a contest of gods or mighty ones over the issue of religion or worship. There can be no compromise between true Christianity and the religion of this world. Before bringing the Israelites into the land of Palestine which he had promised them, God made this matter perfectly clear to them. At the beginning of their forty-year journey there he said to them: “They [the pagan inhabitants] shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me; for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.” (Ex. 23:33, AS) In the face of that divine statement who can object to the slogan that false, worldly religion is a snare and is worked as a racket? </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Where a child proves himself loyal under trial, will not a loving earthly father rescue the child from a wicked assailant and oppressor? Yes; and so will the heavenly Father, too. Since 1919 God has delivered the remnant on earth of his Kingdom heirs from great mystic Babylon, Satan’s world. All the people of good will in all nations see the salvation and deliverance Jehovah has effected for his remnant, and they are being shown the way to get deliverance from Babylon also. But answer now to our prayer means more than just keeping us out of Satau’s power and rescuing us from his mighty organization while lie leaves him and his organization still on the loose. Answer now to our prayer means a deliverance by preserving us against Satan's final attacks in this time of the end and destroying him and all his organization whereas we survive the end of his world. This salvation or deliverance God effects by means of his kingdom for which we pray. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">This proves that this prophecy of the release of the bound ones must be fulfilled now before the battle of Armageddon while there are nontheoeratic nations, peoples, kings and queens. These earthly systems and rulers are unable to hold their own people of good will under them when they hear the liberation call of Jehovah’s great Servant, Come forth! Show yourselves! Emerge into freedom and into light! Despite their mobilizing of the peoples by dictatorial measures, they are obliged to yield these “other sheep” over to the theocratic organization of Zion. They are obliged to bow and admit defeat of their endeavors to prevent all this gathering to the Signal which Jehovah has raised on high.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Whoever divorces his wife except on the grounds of fornication and marries another commits adultery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 19:9, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Neither here nor in his sermon on the mount did Jesus condemn God for allowing the Jews to practice divorce according to his law given through Moses. (Deut. 24:1-4; Matt. 5:31,32, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Jesus was not here saying that the Christian who gets the divorce because of the sexual unfaithfulness of his mate may only get rid of such mate and deprive such mate of bed and board and not be free, however, to marry another Christian woman. Under God’s law to Israel the man getting a divorce from his morally unclean wife was not barred from marrying another Israelite woman. So Jesus was not interpreting divorce by a Christian in such a way as to forbid his remarriage. Jesus’ words mean strictly this: If the Christian procures the divorce on grounds other than the immorality of his marriage mate such Christian is committing adultery if he remarries, for the marriage bond was not really canceled in God’s sight by the legal divorce. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Now a good conscience toward God is attainable by means of the Greater Noah, Christ Jesus. Through him we get rest for our consciences and we enjoy peace with God. This good conscience toward God is what all lovers of eternal life crave and request in their prayers toward God and in all their efforts. We long to have a consciousness of being no longer sinners but to have a righteous standing with him and be at peace with him. Now it can be won, not by just putting away fleshly filth as the Jews tried to do in an effort toward self-righteousness, but by faith in God and in his provisions through Christ Jesus. God’s forgiveness of our sins is now possible only through Christ’s blood. Any of our own works for justifying ourselves by merely cleaning up our flesh outwardly are dead works; they have no life-giving quality about them. They do not make us alive toward God and his proper service. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">11/15</span></p>

We may expect to find many faithful even though behind totalitarian iron curtains, forced out of communication with the rest of God’s people. We may expect to find some when we are in concentration camps or scourged by mob violence. This one thing we know for sure: we cannot expect favor from this wicked world, for this old world is not for God’s kingdom. Jesus said: “My kingdom is no part of this world.” And we know this, too. We have been warned concerning these conditions, and despite them all we will interest ourselves only in the assembling of the “other sheep”, for this vindicates God’s name. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah challenges all the gods of this world. When we remember that in India or Hindustan alone there are some 330 million gods and goddesses and then when we take the gods of the religions of other lands into consideration, we see it is a case of millions of gods, visible and invisible, against the one God, Jehovah. All materialistic people will have to admit that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">worship</span><span class="font6"> of such gods is a reality even in this modern world, and that belief in such gods and worship of such gods have played a powerful part in the course and destiny of all nations, without a single exception. The battle of the gods is near. The question is, Who will triumph? Backed by the outcome of previous contests, the answer is certain: The battle will go only one way, and Jehovah will triumph as God, the only living and true God of the universe! </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Any uncleanncss of lip in these days following 1914 when .Jehovah began to rule as King is wrong and is a sin. Hence when the seraph touched Isaiah’s lips with the red-hot coal he said, “Thy sin [shall] by propitiation be covered.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Ro)</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> The sin of the remnant was covered by the propitiatory sacrifice of Jesus, represented by the altar from which the seraph took the red-hot coal. So instead of being struck with a death-dealing curse like presumptuous King Uzziah, the remnant were graciously forgiven through Christ because of their repentance and were not destroyed. The lip cleansing was not a preparation of them to go home at once to heaven. It was a preparation of them for earthly service at a most critical time in human history. So they were present'd to use their cleansed lips with frcencss of speech in this day of judgment. This cleansing has made us different from all of Christendom. We must never suffer a relapse.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Happy aic you poor, because yours is the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 6:20,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> AW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">You do not need selfish material riches to be really happy. Jesus Christ on earth as a man was among the poorest of the poor measured by earthly goods. He was laid in no fine cradle at birth, but in an animal’s manger, because there ■was no room for visitors at the village inn. As a preacher of God’s kingdom he had no home of his own, “nowhere to lay down his head.” (Matt. </span><span class="font6">8:20, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> But because of his spiritual riches he had real and loyal friends, particularly his Father in heaven and the people of good will on earth. </span><span class="font6">He </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">had </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">joy no creature could remove. He was the happiest person on earth, so that he could well describe true states of happiness in his sermon on the mount. By getting acquainted with him all poor people can now be made spiritually rich and can enjoy hope of early being made possessors of all other riches in the equitable new world under his kingdom. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Be transformed by making your mind over.—Rom. 12:2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">If you want to escape being destroyed with this system of things you must heed Paul's entreaty without delay and quit being fashioned after it. L’o not be misled by the foolish slogan invented to tickle a self-conceited person’s vanity: “You can change the world Do not waste your time either with the similar slogan which says: “Change the world before it changes you.” Remember God's wise instruction which tells you you cannot change this world. God knows the bent of mind of this system and he pronounces it doomed. The Devil is the “god of this system of things’’. Can </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> change </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">him?</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Of course you cannot. This world, which lies under his power, is unchangeable. It must and will be wiped out. The way for you not to. be changed by this world is, not by religiously trying to change it<sub>?</sub> but by doing what the inspired apostle says above. This you must do before this world ends, or else yon will end with it. This course is your only safeguard. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Saturday, September 6 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">lie who eats and drinks without a proper sense of the Body, eats and drinks to his own condemnation.—1 Cor. 11:29, Alo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial partakers must keep clearly m mind that they are “Christ’s body’’, symbolized by the one loaf, and hence they must keep unity as “one body”. We must have a “proper sense of the Body”, sensing our personal unity with the Head Jesus Christ. If we do not, then we will become spiritually “weak and sickly” and even be “sleeping in death”, as many of the Corinthians did back there. (1 Cor. 11: 30, W) For this, Jehovah God had to discipline them through his theocratic organization represented by the apostle Paul, that they might not be condemned with the world and be destroyed as it will shortly be. To be spiritually strong, healthy and alive toward God's organization and its work, we must respect what the Memorial means. We should scrutinize ourselves with respect to these matters, seek God’s forgiveness for any misbehavior, and then determine to follow right conduct and approve ourselves by God’s measurements before partaking.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By faith Noah . . . constructed an ark for the saving of his household.—IIeb. 11:1,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> jVIV</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Noah</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> means “rest” or “consolation”. But Noah was no lazy man of inactivity cither before or after the flood. He was the visible leader in the most important activity of that day. He was also a “preacher of righteousness”. The first thing he did after he and his family came out of the ark following the flood was to build an altar and offer sacrifice to Jehovah. This was restful to the Lord Jehovah. So Noah brought comfort to mankind at its new start after the flood. Like Noah, Christ Jesus ushers men into rest, even now. During this “time of the end” of this world he gives this rest and refreshment to all the sheep, both the remnant of his “little flock” of heavenly joint heirs and also the great crowd of “other sheep”. But after the battle of Armageddon baptizes this old world with fire, he will comfort mankind with the great sabbath of rest for the thousand years of his reign. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves also forgive everyone that is in debt to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke ll:!<sub>h</sub> NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">While we may selfishly crave forgiveness of sins for ourselves through Jesus Christ, God reserves to himself the right to withhold this forgiveness if we are mercilessly unforgiving toward others. To bo forgiven our forgiveness must precede our prayer, or our willingness to forgive others must accompany our prayer. We must be grateful and merciful enough to toigive the same sinner a number of times, seventy-seven times, if necessary. No matter how many times we forgive our fellow creatures, it could never equal the extent of God's forgiveness and mercy to us through Christ. Jesus paid the full debt for us. Canceling our sins is not a debt that God owes us, but is a matter of his loving-kindness and mercy through Jesus whom he provided to be a sin-covering sacrifice for us. Since we address God as our Father, we must prove we are his children by showing forth his traits, including mercy. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Above all things, have intense love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Pet. k '■ 8, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">We have to stick together as Noah’s family did before the flood. We have to love God’s organization and to love those who are members of his theocratic organization or who are sheltered under it. Love is the perfect bond of union for us. We must exercise it in imitation of God and must resist the hate-breeding infection of this selfish world. None of us are perfect yet, even though we are so near the new world of righteousness. Hence unintentionally, through weakness and imperfection, we are going to commit sins against one another. These we must forgive and cover over, and love alone will help us to do this. Satan’s world will never destroy this love from among God’s organization, but love will live through Armageddon and on into the new world. The old world will be destroyed for its selfishness. So we avoid selfishness. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A righteous man’s supplication when it is at tvork has much force.—Jas. 5:16, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Prayer works in cases of spiritual sickness. But are we not also privileged to pray to God in our physical sickness and speak to him about it? Yes, we are. But we are not to pray for divine healing. The day for that is past. That gift of the spirit passed away with the decease of the apostles and their immediate associates. Furthermore, this miraculous healing was to be a sign to outsiders and to be performed upon them. It was not to be used for the selfish comfort of the faithful believers. True</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Christians, the servants of Jehovah God, do get physically sick. His own Word testifies to that. The apostle Paul had some physical affliction, which he likened to a “thorn in the flesh”. Did he pray about it? Or, so highly gifted as he was, did he miraculously pluck this thorn out of his flesh himself, or did God do it for him with divine power? No. Instead, the Lord assured him his loving-kin d n e s s was sufficient for him. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 46:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The divine presence in the midst of the organization produces a sense of security among those in it. They know it is the right organization to stay united with, for it will never be moved and made to totter, stagger and fall to ruin. This does not mean that material buildings occupied and used by members of the organization may not be seized, invaded, expropriated and destroyed by the foe. Remember that “the Most High does not dwell in houses made with hands”. He doos dwell in his theocratic organization, whether its members on earth are housed or not. So our trust is not even in buildings devoted to his service. It is his theocratic organization, therefore, that will never be moved by enemy assaults and caused to collapse, for God’s presence within it makes it permanent though all the world round about it ends. Founded on Him, the “everlasting rock”, his theocratic organization will last forever. So those who trust in him will last forever, because they take him at his word and seek refuge with his organization. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.—Dan. 12:12, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those days ended in 1926. The birth of God’s kingdom in the heavens as having occurred in 1914 had now been revealed to them. No longer was it a question with His remnant as to how long they would have to work on earth before entering heavenly glory. But rather, here present with us is Kingdom service, just as though the Kingdom had come down from heaven to the people of God and they were living in it. No longer were they concerned, whether it meant remaining on earth one or many years, for they were so very happy. They had been brought together in the “last days” for a purpose, not to do a mighty Kingdom work in heaven, for they could do that without being gathered there, but to serve on earth before they went there. Spiritual Zion was re-established, her King enthroned, and God would now use his people to sound forth his name worldwide, to be a praise in all the earth. What a joyful time was now in store for Jehovah’s people, and that forevermore! </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Today, after a career of nineteen centuries, the congregation is at its maturity or full growth of Christian manhood. God has put away from it a number of things peculiar to its babyhood, such as the gift of the spirit for performing instantaneous cures on the human body and mind. So the remnant of this Christian congregation who are yet on earth do not exercise such a gift of the spirit. They have no Scriptural reason to expect from any source or by any channel a miracle of divine healing in their case. But this results in no real loss or embarrassment to them, because their hope and eternal destiny is spiritual, heavenly, and not physical, earthly. Even in the first century during the operation of miraculous healing the most faithful of the Christians were subject to physical illnesses and died of them. Not all died a martyr’s violent death or grew old like John. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I trust in thy word. —Ps. 119: 4'2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God provided his written Word for us to consult. If we do not consult it, it will not serve us as a guide. In it he reveals himself to us. He opens up his mind and heart to us, telling us what he thinks, what he has already done and is now doing and will yet do, and informing us what he would like us to do in order to gain his favor and the gift of eternal life in his new world. He makes known to us that his name is Jehovah ; and he shows us his attributes of wisdom, justice, power and love and how all four attributes work together without clash. So our only way to know about him definitely is by his written Word. Getting to know him through it we learn to develop confidence in Him and to respect his advice and to see that his commands are authoritative. We build up faith that his Word is right and without mistake or misdirection. This makes us consult it in our problems and take its advice. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">There can be no fusion of the rich man and Lazarus classes, no fraternizing ! “Come out of her, my people,” calls the divine voice from heaven, “touch not the unclean thing.” The Lazarus remnant have left the Babylonish world and its religious confusion so as to be clean to bear Jehovah's vessels of worship. God is determined to keep the organization of his people clean now. All hypocrites are thrown out. The rich man cannot be brought in contrary to Jehovah’s decree. But now the “other sheep” class hear the Right Shepherd’s voice sounding the divine call to come out of worldly Babylon. They do so, flee to the upraised Signal of Jehovah's kingdom, and gain entrance to the one flock under his Royal Shepherd. These sheep the Shepherd puts to his right and divides them off from the “goats”.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah's deliverance of a “great crowd&quot; of other worshipers is significant. It marks up a further victory for him as the living and true God. In this time when all religion is on judgment it represents a triumph for the clean, undefiled worship of Jehovah. But now his High Priest and King presses on to further triumphs over the false gods of Babylon as he goes ahead “conquering and to complete his conquest”. (Rev. 6:2, A’lF) Under him we must push the offensive still further against the gods and false worship of this world till they are exposed to all sheeplike persons of good will in all nations and until these turn to the worship of the God of gods, Jehovah, and gain deliverance from this doomed world. (Ps. 135: 5 ; 136:2) There are yet other lands and territories to be entered, there are yet other multitudes of good-will persons to be enlightened and delivered.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Seeing things so clearly, can we now hold back from giving the witness? Can we remain silent when our invisible King Christ Jesus reigns? Will we quit witnessing for Jehovah on account of fear, threats, hardships, persecution, reproach, or anything else? Will the stones now have to cry out instead of living witnesses to announce the Kingdom? All the prophecies answer, No! In ancient times Jehovah kept his visible servants witnessing faithfully to the end, preserving them through the destruction of organizations foreshadowing the destruction of the present evil system of things at Armageddon. Therefore in these last days Jehovah, whose prophecies never fail, will likewise preserve his own fearless, visible servant body and their companions through Armageddon as a testimony to his supremacy. So let us do all within our power to have a part in the wonderful victorious completion of the witness work by being active and unafraid down to the end. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">When we were in an ignorant mental state we did not love God with our minds. The greatest of the commandments that was ever given to men requires us to love God with all our mental powers. What we think on habitually greatly affects and influences us and induces us to take a certain way. To be thinking one way and yet be doing another thing outwardly is hypocrisy. We must think lovingly toward Jehovah God. That means thinking to please him by obeying him and taking faithful care of everything that honors his name and furthers the interests of his kingdom. We cannot wholeheartedly serve God with a double mind. If you divide your attention between this world and God and do not make your mind over wholly to the image He approves, it will in course of time betray itself without fail. Love of God with all your thinking process is what you owe him. lie commands it. It safeguards you. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

It cannot go onI” This militarized -world, with its conscription and universal military training laws, cannot prevent Jehovah's Servant’s work of releasing the prisoners. Neither can the oppressive totalitarian dictators do so. The rescue of those upon whom they prey and whom they have held captive takes place under their very nose, whether by underground or by aboveground methods. The public services which all these rulers render the people and for which wc justly “pay back Caesar's things to Caesar”, these things the servant class uses to carry on Jehovah’s work, gathering his “other sheep” now to the side of his theocratic government.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The vast majority of professing Christians and their leaders do not actually care what the Scriptures state, for they have no fear of God. Should any reader doubt this, then put it to the test by going yourself from house to house and speaking to them. Test the clergy and priests and other officers in these religious organizations, and find out how little they know of God’s Word, of the purposes of Jehovah and of the sign of the &quot;time of the end”. They are in darkness and go along with this evil system of things, and know not the right way to go. They are so blind they cannot see the key to true knowledge when it is held up before their eyes. They pray for God’s kingdom to come and Christ to rule, and then blindly grope about for an organization among men that is big enough to support them and their schemes. Posing as representatives of the “Prince of Peace” they go out to bless the machines of war. In soft words they say, “Love your enemies,” and then heap honor on those who kill the enemies.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">As God’s ambassadors are sent to all nations with the one message of reconciliation, then all who become reconciled to him become one earthwide association of brothers. In just that way Jehovah's witnesses are an international congregation of Christian brothers. God’s Word forbids them to split up over selfish interests and start fighting one another; it commands them to keep united and preserve peace among themselves. On this account they have not abandoned their neutrality toward this world and joined the armies of this divided world under their enemy Satan the Devil. To do so would have meant to become pitted against their spiritual brothers, God’s children. This would have resulted in fratricidal warfare for which they would be held strictly accountable by their heavenly Father. Contrary to taking or seeking to take the life of their brothers, they are exhorted to lay down their lives for their brothers in imitation of Jesus Christ. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">So, too, in 1919, the “faithful and discreet slave” class volunteered their service. It was then a case of acting dead to divine service, like the leprous King Uzziah, or of rousing oneself to activity and answering the invitation and being sent. It took faith, love and courage to answer the divine call to service in this world’s “time of the end”. As Isaiah with lips cleansed felt qualified to respond, so the cleansed, forgiven remnant felt qualified and humbly offered their services. Did Jehovah turn down the volunteers for this final witness to the world because they were not ordained by the clergy? Not if judged by his ready acceptance of Isaiah’s services. He did not ask whether Isaiah was a priest, a Levite, a single or a married man, a schooled man or a common laboring man. He let him hear the open invitation and then respond with appreciation of the purification for God's use. Likewise he accepted the voluntary services of the remnant now purified. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W J<sub>t</sub>/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Dan. 12:7, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">During World War I God’s witnesses were not filled with the great joy of the Kingdom rule, but “in sackcloth” they deplored their condition as they saw no certain relief ahead. Certainly during those 1,260 days or “time, times and a half” they were in an uncertain, anxious condition, and then at the end of those days great hatred and persecution came upon them. So the 1,260-day period was fulfilled from October, 1914, to April, 1918, during which time the Lord Jesus Christ became King, enthroned in heaven, and set about Kingdom work and the deliverance of his faithful servants from Babylonish bondage. He took decisive action against the prince of the power of darkness and forcibly removed this wicked one from his exalted position, not merely unseating him but throwing him out of heaven. He broke his power, so he no longer can scatter God’s children. Let us rejoice. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">That which corresponds to this is also now saving you, namely, baptism.-l Pet. 3: 21,</span><span class="font6"> A'W<sup>7</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What brought salvation from the deluge was for the survivors to be baptized into Noah the ark-builder. The seven who went into the ark with him had to have confidence in him as Jehovah’s prophet. They had to be unbreakably attached to him and walk with him as he “walked with God”. They had to be incorporated into a system of things not of that world, a theocratic arrangement in which Noah was the chief builder, the chief consultant and shipmaster or pilot. So they had to submit to him as the head who took the lead and directed the body of fellow workers. Doing all this, they were in effect baptized into Noah. However, Peter points to another baptism at this &quot;time of the end” of this world, a baptism which includes the Right Shepherd’s &quot;other sheep” as well as the remnant of his little flock, for he brings them all together to become “one flock, one shepherd”. This is the baptism into the Greater Noah, Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Hom. 12:11,</span><span class="font6"> A'U'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The realization that this world is fast approaching its end does not render the witnesses of Jehovah aimless in living and cause them to droop their hands. No; but it spurs them to action, to more intensive activity for God’s cause than ever before. The Devil, knowing his end is near, is out to do all the damage he can to induce men to become bitter and oppose God, so that when he, the Devil, goes down all humanity will go down with him into destruction. His intent is that, when God does gain the victory at Armageddon’s battle, he will have none on earth over whom to exercise his universal sovereignty. Now, if that is the effect on the Devil, then no less so the realization of the near end of the Devil’s world rouses Jehovah’s witnesses to unusual efforts. Even clergymen are compelled to admit that, despite the conviction of the world’s end soon, they have more zeal for Christian activity than the clergy have. They are the biggest optimists on earth today. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jesus was perfectly clear that the Christian standard of marriage is the one established by God at the beginning in Eden when he gave the perfect man only one living wife. Thus God made only two “one flesh”, the man and his one wife, not three or four or more one flesh. So when a polygamist, in perfectly good standing with his community according to the customs and laws of his land, wants to be a real Christian he must dispose of his excess wives. A polygamist, if he keeps on as such, denies his Owner who bought him, for his Owner Jesus Christ set up the standard of having one living wife for his followers. A polygamist cannot be appointed to a responsible position of service in a Christian congregation by the visible governing body of Jehovah’s theocratic organization. Is that the requirement for only the most prominent servants? No, but also for subordinate ones. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W If/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">There are Christian individuals that strive to heed the Bible precepts and succeed in large measure. If one, or a hundred, or a few thousand can do this, can the remaining millions plead that the Bible standards are too idealistic, too far above imperfect man to be practical to shoot at? If application of these principles would end wars, dirty politics, oppressive economic systems; if it would empty jails, end crime, quench delinquency and drunkenness, and eliminate many diseases, would it not be a practical endeavor? Applying the principles to daily living is not as hard as it may seem at first. The procedure is to change over your mind, which directs your body. Alter your will, desires, interests, disposition, mental outlook and heart condition. With these inward driving forces changed for the better our actions will automatically change for the better. The key to effecting such change is what the mind feeds on. The Bible is the storehouse of the needed mental food. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">If wc are to gather persons of good will into the unwallcd city now because it is Jehovah’s time, Jehovah's witnesses want to be prepared to take care of them. Those who have taken up his service must be faithful in all their work, large or small. The little details relative to house-to-house witnessing are just as essential to faithfulness as the looking after a large company. We have greater work ahead of us, the gathering of a big crowd of the “other sheep”; for they are coming in now in greater numbers than ever before and we must be in position to receive them. Should wc cringe bar k and say it is too much for us when ten persons take hold of our garments and demand our time to tell them the truth because they have heard about our God and that he is with us?

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement.—Lev. 25:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Only through Christ Jesus can wc gain a Jubilee rest from the slavery of sin and death under Satan the Devil. This was foreshadowed by the Jubilee-year arrangement, for the Jubilee trumpet was to be blown, not before the sacrifice for the atonement of the people’s sin had been offered, but after. So the Jubilee year could not begin until first the sins of the entire people of Israel against God’s law had been atoned for by the sacrifices made at God’s temple by his priests. Those atonement sacrifices on the atonement day all pictured the one sufficient sacrifice which the “man Christ Jesus” as High Priest would offer to God for the sins of all mankind. From this we can see that the grand Jubilee release for mankind could not really begin until first after the atonement sacrifice that takes away sin had been laid down by God’s High Priest on earth and presented to God in heaven. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">We must prove to ourselves what his will is by getting a new mind. That means getting new information, new knowledge, in our minds. If it is to disclose God’s will to us, then that information, knowledge and enlightenment must come from him, and we can get it only from his Word with the aid of his spirit and organization. When we thus prove to ourselves what it is, we come to appreciate that his will is one of goodness. No better purpose could anyone have for us. It is the only thing that is acceptable to God. We can therefore not alter his will, but must bow to it and seek to comply with it in every respect. And then as our information grows and we gain greater knowledge and study his will further, we see it is a complete will. It covers everything we need to do in order to carry out our part in God’s life-giving arrangement and to share in vindicating him. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

No; this material bread is not a free, unearned handout. God has surrounded us with all the means for providing us with bread, but we must get busy and work to get it deservedly. There is no room allowed for sponging on our hardworking fellows, but God enforces the rule among his able-bodied children : ‘If anyone does not want to work neither let him eat.’ (2 Thess. 3:10) In keeping with our prayer to him for the daily ration for today, we trust him to provide us physical and mental strength to work and deserve it. Our prayer for just today’s bread may put us on a day-to-day basis in our dependence on God for nourishment, but he will fatherlike provide it during our journey through this old world, just as faithfully as he provided manna for the Israelites. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

Growing weak and disorganized, it liquefies in terror. In the dissolution process the hand of every selfish man outside God’s organization will be turned against his neighbor, and they will fight one another’s interests. The symbolic “ten kings” of the beastly political system will turn upon the harlot of Babylonish religion with which they committed spiritual fornication and will eat her fleshy parts and burn her refuse with fire. The political beast of world domination andthefalse-prophet system which made such deceptive political predictions will be pitched alive into destruction symbolized by the fiery lake burning with sulphur.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 19:11, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By his acts since A.D. 1914 Jesus Christ could never be accused of being a pacifist. Why not? Because Revelation 12 :1-12 answers that after the birth of God’s kingdom and the enthronement of his Son Jesus Christ “war broke out in heaven”. No pacifist, it was this King Jesus Christ who battled against Satan and his demons and hurled them down to his footstool, the earth. Now the humiliated Satan is using his demons to drive all the nations to Armageddon for the “war of the great day of God the Almighty”. (Rev. 16:14-16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> But who are Jehovah’s “mighty ones” whom he brings down to the “valley of decision” in order to settle forever the paramount issue of world domination? They are the “Lamb of God” and the angels who fought under him in the “war in heaven” against Satan. On earth this lamblike One looked like a pacifist, but now he is the “Lion of the tribe of Juda”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 34:7, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ours is a time of great peril, particularly so since the war in heaven dislodged Satan and his demons from their position up there and they have been confined to this earth. Now he is concentrating his bitter warfare upon tbe remnant and their fellow witnesses. True, there is a great encampment of visible enemies round about us, backed by the invisible Dragon and his demons. But we have faith to believe we have encamped about us invisibly Jehovah’s angel who defeated the Dragon and his demons in the war in heaven and who now holds them underfoot here at the earth before he crushes them at Armageddon. Were it not for this superior angelic protection the remnant of spiritual Israelites and their faithful fellow worshipers would have been overwhelmed and wiped out before now, in order to halt their bearing witness.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He that feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me, and I in union with him.—John 6:56, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Israelites in the wilderness did not drink blood of any kind. They were forbidden to do so, not only by the divine covenant with Noah their ancestor but also by the stated terms of the Law covenant through their mediator Moses. The manna from heaven which they ate was bloodless. In this sense it was like Jesus’ flesh. Flesh could not be eaten unless drained of its blood. Hence what obedient mankind of the new world will partake of for everlasting life will be like bloodless flesh, which Jesus provided by coming down from heaven. Jesus said that those drinking his blood as well as eating his flesh remain in union with him and he in union with them. This means they are made members of his body, being baptized into Christ and thereby being baptized into his kind of death. Jesus’ food was to do his Father’s will, and they feed on Jesus’ flesh by doing God’s will together with Jesus and finishing it as he did.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 16:31, RS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are commanded to use Christendom’s own possession of the Scriptures, Moses and the Prophets and the inspired testimony about the risen Christ and his kingdom. Thus equipped we are to preach fearlessly. Let the goats stop their ears and persecute us in their religions anguish and torment. We cannot compromise and predict any relief from God for them. But seeing we have been so greatly comforted by the Greater Abraham, Jehovah God, we are obliged to go and “comfort all that mourn” with the comfort with which He has comforted us through Christ. Let those who have ears to listen, listen and be comforted. In that way many more straying sheep will hear the Right Shepherd’s voice and turn from their beggarly, sin-diseased, downtrodden condition in this world and come into the favor of the Greater Abraham along with the remnant of the Lazarus class. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 will come near to you to judgment; and 1 will be a swift witness . . . against the adulterers.—Mal. 3:5, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christendom has paid no attention to the definition. of pure, undcfiled religion, which means not only caring for widows and orphans but also keeping oneself without spot from the world. We cannot compromise with the enemy and strike up friendships with this world and remain unspotted, uncorrupted, and free with the freedom which only the truth can give. Christendom’s moral, social and spiritual condition today proves that to us. She bartered away her independence and her hopes of becoming Christ’s bride by becoming instead the church of the political state, the Roman empire. Such spiritual adultery meant enmity with God. Shortly it is to bring upon Christendom the penalty like that prescribed for harlots and adulterers in God’s law to ancient Israel. So at Armageddon she will be the first to be destroyed, like an adulterous organization that has apostatized from God. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span></p>

The wicked persecutor Haman was hanged on gallows he had built for Mordecai, and Mordecai was advanced to higher office. By the emperor’s authority he wrote a law into the government statutes, providing for the Jews on the fixed day of assault by their foes “to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them”. Did the Jews pacifis-tically refuse to act upon this law for their self-defense by force of arms? No! On the 13th and 14th days of Adar they fought valiantly for the defense of their own lives and those of their brothers. Jehovah God was with them in this and handed them the victory. The Jews, his witnesses, he used as executioners of the enemies. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 6:10, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The anointed remnant of the Isaiah class today do not force the people of Christendom into this unfeeling, unresponsive spiritual state. What the remnant really do is, not make, but show up the people or prove the people to be just as Jehovah foretold at Isaiah 6: 9,10. So today, 33 years after Jehovah’s witnesses were revived and sent forth in 1919, how many people of Christendom see and hear and believe? Not the vast majority, by any means! Nor millions! Failure this? No! But surely cause for discouragement and quitting? Contrariwise, the prophecy of Isaiah 6: 9,10 has proved true. If Jehovah’s witnesses had compromised their message and tickled people’s ears, they would not have realized the fulfillment of the prophecy toward their witness work. Had Christendom acted favorably, she would have turned to Jehovah and his kingdom and been healed. Sadly, she is not healed. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">They took no note until the flood came and swept them all away.—Matt. 24: 39, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God has exercised the greatest religious tolerance for 4,319 years now, or since Babylon was founded shortly after the flood. This divine patience has allowed for honesthearted persons to escape from false religion before it at last goes down. The modern counterpart of the flood is the battle of Armageddon. The early Christians lived as though it would occur in their generation and they would survive it in the Christians’ ark. But we today are the ones warned by prophecy and its fulfillment to be prepared for it to occur within our generation. The presence of the great crowd of other sheep with us gives added proof to the certainty of this. We do not want to experience the baptism of fire which 2 Peter 3: 7-12 describes and which is reserved for the wicked heavens and earth that now exist. So it is urgently necessary that we hold to the true baptism. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 19:31,38, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So it is that in modern times, as the climax of the Kingdom proclamation work is being reached, Jehovah has raised up a great crowd of witnesses to let the people know his purposes. They will be found preaching by word of mouth wherever they are. They go from house to house, organize public lecture meetings, distribute magazines and printed folders, carry information signs publicly, and hold Bible studies in the people's homes. Some, though aged and infirm, find ways to take part in publishing the good news by speaking to those who visit their homes, writing letters to friends and acquaintances, making telephone calls to friends and strangers, mailing the message in printed form, or even reading to other ill persons with whom they may be associated. All who have the desire may participate in making Jehovah's purposes known. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">23: 26, AS, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That means giving our hearty attention to God as he discloses himself and taking note of his ways. We can do this only by studying and keeping close to his Word and watching his dealings with his organized people. This will help transform us. Uis Word is becoming newer to us all the time, not only by newer and better translations of it in our language, but especially by the fulfillments of its prophecies and by the clearing up of its teachings under the illuminating power of God’s spirit and his use of his theocratic organization. Let us think God’s thoughts. We cannot penetrate into all his thoughts. We cannot advise or instruct his mind. His is so much farther ahead and loftier than ours is. But we can receive information, secrets, revelations, from his mind. What thoughts of his he does disclose to his people by his spirit and through his Word, we can think and so not err. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">before.—Job 42:10, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The test on Job foreshadowed how the Job class, beginning with Jesus himself (who never got sick), would be exposed to the testing of their integrity toward God by Satan. However, this test was not to be by literal accidents, loss and terrible diseases due to Satan. No ; but by persecutions and opposition from this world which would bring loss of close associates, and bring us a disgraceful, misrepresented appearance in the eyes of the world, making us look loathsome to them, so that they would accuse us of being religious hypocrites and under God’s curse. Job’s miraculous restoration, therefore, foreshadowed, not the divine healing of our physical ailments and our being made immune against further accidents, but how Almighty God would restore the faithful remnant of his anointed witnesses to his favor and would counteract all the false accusations and misrepresentations of his servants before all the people of good will. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">At the Jewish village or city recording office where genealogies of families were kept the children of marriage were registered and thus each child could trace its ancestry. The husband was also registered as the legal son of his father-in-law. All this arrangement made for the legal protection of the rights of both the husband and the wife and also of the children. It held each one responsible for personal conduct toward the other iu the family and marriage relationship. The Jews were the first to become Christians and they carried this arrangement over into the Christian congregation. This makes it right and proper for common-law marriage couples today who become consecrated Christians to legalize their marriage and thus bind themselves before the law as well as before God to be true and loyal to each other. This opens the way to enter fully into privileges in the organization and to act as appointed servants in it. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">32:1,2, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is now, in this perilous “time of the end” of Satan’s old world, that we sorely need such protection and help, because we do not get it from the official element of Satan’s organization. And since we do not get the desired hiding-place and covert and refreshment and shade from the ruling element of his organization, we must turn to the official servants in Jehovah’s organization. He promises that his King and his princes will each one of them be such desirable things to us in this time of need. They will see to it that we get what is righteous and just. The righteous King and his princes will bear rule in the land picturing Jehovah’s theocratic organization, and all those within or under that organization will get the benefits of their righteous and just rule.

<p><span class="font6">More room is needed for Zion’s children, and this is being acquired. But not by military aggression and unjust encroachment, invading and grabbing other people’s lands. No; but by peaceful expansion, with the good news of peace. Thus those who feel there is not enough room for them go out as home missionaries and as foreign missionaries to other lands and establish settlements of Jehovah’s worship there. So the work of releasing other sheep spreads to the ends of the earth. Overgrown companies have been split, resulting in the formation of new companies at new places to receive the new incomers and to provide room for still more to enter and be incorporated in the organization for publishing the message of release from Babylon. By thus causing Zion to overflow with children evidence is given to show Jehovah is God and that those who wait for him will not be disappointed. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 28:16,17, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The determining factor in the commencement of divine judgment is the laying of the Stone, the King Christ Jesus, in Zion in completeness, in 1918. Jehovah is exact and right in all his dealings, and the erection of the building on the cornerstone will be performed with minute exactness. There is no place in it for revilers, scorners and scoffers, and certainly not for the modern-day “drunkards of Ephraim”, the rulers of Christendom. In Jehovah’s structure the “living stones”, his anointed Christians, are measured, squared, and leveled, to the true and sure foundation. But the organization of the false religionists is completely out of line and condemned. It is due for demolition. In 1919 they were so out of line with God’s purposes that they accepted the League of Nations as “the political expression of the kingdom of God on earth” in preference to Jehovah’s King, his Stone. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Seventy years the Jews or Israelites were exiles in Babylonian provinces. Did theyjom the armies of Babylon and fight for its world domination? No; although some Jews, like Daniel and his three Hebrew companions, were taken into the governmental service in spite of their conscientious worship of Jehovah God. Government servants of high rank those three Hebrews might he, yet they refused to violate their conscience and bend to Emperor Nebuchadnezzar’s decree and commit idolatry, saluting the image of the political. state, the golden image which the dictatorial ruler had set up for united worship by all elements of the empire. (Dan. 3 :1-30) When Babylon was overthrown, the captive Israelites were not mixed in with Babylon’s armies fighting against its overthrow. They knew Jehovah’s prophecies had foretold its overthrow, and so why fight against fulfillment of divine prophecy, and for an oppressive world power at that? </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">How fitting a picture Noah’s sons and daughters-in-law are of the “great crowd” of other sheep of today! These also are being baptized into the Greater Noah, Christ Jesus. Not, however, into Christ’s death. Though some may die in the remaining time before Armageddon, they never sacrifice their prospect of perfect life in the earthly paradise. They sleep away in hope of resurrection to human lite under Christ’s kingdom of a thousand years. So it is by their hearing the Right Shepherd’s voice today proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom and then by devotedly following him as God’s anointed King that they are baptized into the Greater Noah. For this reason they live changed lives. They no more waste time in imitating the manners of this world, but live according to the new system of things, the ark of safety. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Carefully examining the Scriptures daily.—Acts 17:11, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Study your Bible. Gain its wisdom. Appreciate its practicalness. Conform yourself to its principles, obey its commands, and have the divine protection it promises obedient ones. You will have the hope of surviving the winter of Armageddon that will catch unawares and freeze in the cold grip of the grave the majority of men. Do not ignore the sign of Armageddon’s approach, no more than do the animals ignore winter’s coming. Just as they heed the instinctive urg-ings planted in them by God to make preparation, so you act upon your God-given intelligence as you look around you and see the composite sign of the end of this present wicked system of things, and prepare to pass through it in accord with Jehovah’s provision. Enter into eternal life in a new world free of sin and suffering, sorrow and death. This is the only practical course now, in the midst of this dying old world. And since the Bible is the only book that makes this course clear, the Bible is The Practical Book. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And do not bring</span><span class="font6"> us </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">into temptation.—Luke 11:</span><span class="font6"> 4, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">now does God answer this prayer? For one thing, he does so by strengthening us to stand the trial he lets come upon us and also by forewarning us. Before letting the spirit drive Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan he filled the Son with the holy spirit and also opened up the heavens to his vision. God does not let us work up a temptation innocently for ourselves by ignorance. (1 Cor. 7:1-5; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font6">Tim. 6:9,10; Matt. 13:22, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> Thus God does not leave us ignorant of the source of temptation. Ho makes arrangements to protect us against our own weaknesses. (1 Tim. 3: 2, 6) So God keeps us from being tempted along with the world by warning us what things really are and by opening our eyes of understanding so as not to be deceived with the world and thus be drawn into temptation with it. In that way he keens us from the temptation that has now come on all the world, just as he promised us by Christ Jesus. —Rev. 3: 10; 2 Pet. 2 : 9. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Give them warning from me. —Ezek. 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So there is good reason for the time allowance which God has granted since 1914. It is not just to let human suffering take place on a scale greater than ever before or more flagrant wickedness to be carried on. Not that I But it is in order to discharge God’s responsibility to serve final notice and in order to send his chosen witnesses with a final warning. So this is a. period of God’s undeserved kindness, allowing people of good will who are in danger to take advantage of his patience and mercy. They are thus given a fair opportunity to act and work for their own salvation by God’s means, and not by human means. They should never presume upon his patience and think he is slow and they may linger a little longer with the world and enjoy more of it before making a last-minute break for safety under God’s organization. There is now no time to lose. As 2 Peter 3: 15 (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font6"> says: “Consider the patience of our Lord as salvation.” Seek salvation. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well, and Jehovah will raise him up. Also if he has committed sins, it will he forgiven him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Jas. 5:15, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The older men who are called in must pray in faith, believing that God’s Word is right and has power to help the sick one to see the error of his way and to recognize the right way. Such a united prayer of faith, together with the invigorating application of God’s Word, will make the spiritually indisposed person well. It will build up his confidence in God’s promise and in the rightness of God’s Word and way and will restore him to that way. Thus “Jehovah will raise him up”, giving him strength to go in the way of truth and righteousness; and lifting him up out of his despondency and a feelingof being abandoned by God. If now he responds to the prayer offered unitedly by older men of faith and to their healthful stimulation of reproof, correction and exhortation from God’s Word, and turns around and resumes the right way, what sins he has committed will then be forgiven him. This on the basis of Jesus’ sacrifice for sins. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah is on my side: 1 will not fear.—Ps. 118:6, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It helps to build up the confidence of all the scattered sheep in Jehovah the Great Shepherd when we ourselves show no worldly fear but manifest unshakable reliance upon him. We must vigorously help those other sheep now to find the one safe refuge and enter into it. Our Christian obligation now is to be fearless in Jehovah God’s service, under the shadow of his mighty hand. He encourages us not to droop our hands out of fear, but to keep them busy in the constructive work of Bible education among people of good will. So keen calm and go on peacefully about your work as his ministers of good news. As never before, make the time count now, for the time in which he is showing patience and may yet be found is short. He will never forsake his faithful ones, but will help us, “and that right early.”—Ps. 46:5. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Over him stood seraphim, each having six wings, with two of which he covered his face, with two he covered his loins, and with two he hovered in flight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 6:2, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The name of these spirit creatures means “fiery ones; burning ones”. Execution of Jehovah’s judgment as by fire as well as the cleansing of his faithful remnant as by fire was at hand. The seraphim were most respectful of his person. Keenly sensing his holiness, they covered their faces and lower limbs with their wings, just as officials in the most dignified Oriental court in ancient times would do in the king’s presence. Because of their closeness to the Sovereign of the universe they were all the more self-effacing in order not to distract from his personal glory. But here Isaiah, a creature lower than the angels, was beholding with wide-open eyes the sight of the Most High God. It is now a solemn thought for us to reflect that Jehovah God is at his temple of judgment attended by these fiery seraphim. It is a most dignified, solemn, awesome circumstance. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Then he said: “In that event I ask you, father, to send him to the house of my father, for I have five brothers.’’—Luke 16:27,28, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He still calls Abraham “father”, but he confesses he has a closer relationship to another father and has five brothers. Who this father is Jesus told the rich man class at John 8: 44. So this class show their real sonship by the resemblance of their works to those of their father the Devil. The rich man and his five brothers total six, a number distinguishing the organization of imperfectiou and sin, the enemy organization. So they are the visible seed of the great Serpent, as Jesus called them. At this end of the world the five brothers picture all those professed Christians of Christendom who associate with the religious leaders, follow their guidance and act goatishly toward Christ’s remnant of brothers. Their works betray who is their father. So the rich man’s prayer is really to their true father, Satan the Devil, that he may make the Lazarus class quit tormenting unfaithful Christians.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Be hospitable to one another without grumbling. In proportion as each one has received</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a gift, use it.—1 Pet. 4:9,10, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For such hospitality there is great need in view of the emergencies, privations and hard conditions of this day. So we can open our homes for conducting home Bible studies and for holding local public Bible lectures. We can entertain Bible conventioners and pioneers whom we can assist this way in actively serving God in the witness work afield. We can engage in relief work to help our brothers in lands that have suffered from war, dictatorships and persecution of God’s people by totalitarian rulers with concentration camps. That we may get the benefit from doing this, we must do it ungrudgingly. Then, too, we must keep busy in upbuilding our brothers with all the spiritual resources we have at our command. Any gift with which God has endowed us or which he has helped us to cultivate is to be put to use, especially now in the “time of the end”, when it is so urgently needed. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The form of worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our Bod and Father ts this: to care for orphans and widows in their tribulation, and to keep oneself without spot from the world.—Jas. 1:27, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Religion has the meaning of “system or form of worship”, regardless of whether it is true or false, pure and clean or apostate. Hence, we are justified in using the word “religion” as applying to Christianity when it means the pure, clean, undefiled religion. True Christianity, true religion or form of worship, will live down the reproaches that are heaped upon it. False religion or worship will never survive the reproaches that are being heaped upon it, nor the judgments that God is bringing against it. God is the Judge of what pure worship is, for he is the Author of it. All religion is therefore on judgment before him today. The true will be made manifest and be blessed by him. The false will be condemned by him and uprooted from the earth. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lol in righteousness shall reign a Icing yea even princes [sarim] with equity shall hear rule.—Isa. S3:1, Ro.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the Society of the anointed remnant made the due arrangements and the appointments of servants, the theocratic organization was restored among Jehovah’s witnesses and went into force among them October 1, 1938. Since the Society of the anointed remnant was acting as the “faithful and discreet slave” of the King of righteousness at the temple, such restoration of the theocratic organization with properly appointed servants to carry on the work brought to a fuller realization the prophecy above. Since </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sar</span><span class="font6"> was applied to a man put in charge of as few as ten people, the theocratic appointing of servants to take the lead and oversight among ten of Jehovah’s witnesses would be part of the prophecy’s fulfillment. Yes, when Christ Jesus came again with Kingdom power and found the “faithful and discreet slave” class and appointed it over all his visible belongings since 1918, this too was a fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy concerning the princes.

<p><a name="bookmark291"></a><span class="font6">Those who have come to Jehovah’s organization, Jerusalem, recognize him as their God and Jerusalem as his organization and feel safe because he is their protector. They need not depend on the walls or bulwarks that nations of this world set up to protect themselves, because “Jehovah knows those who belong to him”. The good news of the incoming new world attracts the meek to God’s Word, and that draws them closer to Jehovah. Having come to his unwalled city, trusting in him and having confidence in his Word, they are not afraid of what might happen to them. They are sure of protection. Was not God able to protect the congregation of Israel from being engulfed when the earth opened and swallowed up the unfaithful opposition? And to preserve Noah and his family through the flood? Is he not able to preserve those who have come into his unwalled village? He certainly is! </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Keep this mental attitude in you which was also in Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus.—Phil. 2:5, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We must observe God’s Son, “the leader and perfecter of our faith.” (Heb. 12:2, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font6">We may not be able to know fully the mind of Jehovah, because it is unfathomable to us: but. says 1 Corinthians 2:16 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(NW),</span><span class="font6"> “we do have the mind of Christ.” Yes, we do have what he thinks; we share his thoughts, for he came to earth and disclosed them to us. In proportion as we are zealous and mature Christians, our thoughts are his thoughts. So we can appreciate why he spoke and acted as he did, and why he humbled himself under his heavenly Father’s hand, even to the disgraceful death on the torture stake. We can keep his mental attitude by having the mind of Christ, his thought, and to this end we have to study God’s Word, which gives us the account of what Jesus said and how he lived and what prophecies he fulfilled and what prophecies he is now in course of fulfilling or will yet fulfill. By God’s law we are entitled to freedom not only of thought but of expression. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">In this dark day it is very important to know God’s will. It is only by examining what is written in his Word that we can arrive at what his will is. Many problems enter a Christian’s life in this world, especially as he now finds that the world is hostile to him and yet he must do what God wants him to do. Many personal matters give him trouble and he gets perplexed as. to what the divine will is for him. The difficulty is, the Bible was not written to him personally to mark out each step </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font6"> takes, and so how is he to determine what God’s will is for him? The inquiring person may take his problem to God in prayer. How, now, will he get his answer? By just opening the Bible after prayer to wherever it happens to open and putting his finger blindly on a text, and then taking that text to be the answer indicating God’s will for him? No; that is leaving the matter to chance, not handling God’s Word rightly. He must study it intelligently. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 8: 6, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are still active as the great Healers, performing marvels now in a spiritual way. The physical healings in apostolic days so long ago were merely secondary to the more wonderful and more important spiritual miracles. The physical healings passed away in due time, as was foretold, but the works of spiritual transformation have continued on through the centuries down till now. Today hundreds of thousands of persons of good will are beginning to appreciate these wonder works which are more important for eternal life in the new world than temporary physical cures in this world could ever be. The good effects physically on those who received miraculous bodily cures in apostolic times ended with their death. The good effects on those who have believed and experienced God’s power through Christ in a spiritual way continue, in that they will be with them when resurrected to life in the promised new world. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">During all the years since the liberation in 1919 Satan and his demons have tried to corrupt the organization and worship of Jehovah’s delivered people. But their High Priest at the temple has kept them clean. Furthermore, Satan has tried to destroy them by bringing against them the violent forces of fascism and nazism, and now, too, the forces of international communism. But down to this year 1952 his efforts by these means have been in vain. By every device he has tried to drag them back to slavery and make them a part of this world, but to no avail. Jehovah’s liberated and cleansed people hold fast to clean, undefiled religion in its true meaning. Not only do they care for widows and orphans or bereaved ones in their tribulation, but they also keep themselves without spot from this world. By God’s power they will continue doing this.

Due to enemy action against us, some may not have as much as we do. In this case it is our privilege to share with them, to strengthen them for God’s work with integrity. We shall always have something so as to distribute equally what God provides. As it was with the Israelites when collecting manna each day in the wilderness, “he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.” (Ex. 16: 18, AS) Our heavenly Father will also supply us daily with the spiritual food through his theocratic organization, provided we daily come to his table not only feeding our minds on his written Word but also feeding our spiritual selves by doing God’s will and sharing his Word of truth with others. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">After we have a good or clean conscience before God which relieves us of the consciousness of being condemned sinners and outside of his favor, we must keep our consciences good and clean. This requires more than mere faith in Christ’s sacrifice. It requires real baptism into him now. Why? Because, though you may bear his name and confess him with your lips, you can disown him by the way you live. You can show you do not belong to him by your works, works which are not like his example and which he never commanded as your Master and Owner, who bought you with his own blood. Jesus never had any consciousness of sin in himself. (John 8: 46) So we must have the inward consciousness that we are not copying the world or keeping in friendship with it while we are in it but that we are sincere in what we are doing in a godly way, having more than just a form of godly devotion.

<p><span class="font6">We have enlightenment from God through his Word and theocratic organization. So we have no reason now to be puzzled. Having joy over why we are suffering strengthens us to keep our integrity under test. We are sharing, not just in the common sufferings of men, but in the sufferings of the Christ. This suffering must precede the glory of living in the new world, after Christ fully reveals himself at Armageddon. In all the suffering, let us keep sound in mind and keep God’s spirit upon us. (1 Pet. 4:14, AW) We may not have outward glory upon us now, but God’s spirit upon us now is a “spirit of glory”, the guarantee of glory to come in reward for the present suffering.

<p><span class="font6">A real keeper of the sermon on the mount will not resist a wicked person, taking advantage of the law of retaliation to give like for like, injury for injury, where it is purely a personal affair and where fulfillment of his commission to serve God is not directly involved. Christians must not take the law into their own hands, to return an injury to others. Rather, ignore the personal wrong and show the mental attitude of Christ and go on with his service. Let the wicked abuser remember your self-restraint rather than any hurt he might have gotten from you in return, which hurt would prove you are as violent as he is. Show proper respect for orderly government, even if it is human. Uphold the legal processes of the land and the laws that are not against righteousness and God’s law. By loving acts and by prayer show yourself willing to help even your foes and persecutors to fiud the way to salvation.

Not only the older' ones spiritually but also the younger ones should be humble, subject to the leading of God's hand. We must all do this for the sake of hunting, gathering and feeding the Great Shepherd’s sheep. As the other sheep are now being divided off from the worldly goats, let us welcome them all, as many as come, to the flock.

Instead of sanctifying pagan doctrines, philosophies, rites and practices by adopting them into her religious system, Christendom has defiled herself with this world. She has desecrated Christ’s name which she bears. Yet she pretends to be promised in marriage to him. No matter how pure she claims her origin to be, from Christ the true Vine, yet today she too has turned into a foul, rank, wild vine in God’s sight.

God assures him he does not sin if he marries “in the Lord”, but he tells him what will be his portion if he stays single and what if he marries. He is free to stay single and enjoy the larger sphere of service and the special privileges for which singleness adapts him. He is free to marry, without thus sinning, to enjoy the privileges of wedlock. But he must part thereby with some control over his own body and must expect “tribulation in the flesh”. There is no sin in exercising his wish in this case. What does he wish? God’s will only is that, if he does marry, he must love his wife, keep the marriage bed undefiled by committing no adultery, and bring up his children in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah and prove his integrity, paying his vows to God. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jesus here meant that many Gentiles would exercise faith when the Kingdom gospel was preached to all the nations. By reason of their faith in God’s message about his Christ they would be transferred from a pauper condition of alienation from God and spiritual starvation, and would be brought like Lazarus into Abraham’s bosom. That is, they would be taken into Jehovah God’s favor and to his heart and be adopted as his sons and heirs of the Kingdom with Jesus Christ, the Seed of Abraham. They would come into the favor of the Theocracy where the Jewish remnant was, and would feast at the “table of Jehovah” on spiritual riches of Scriptural truth and sacred service as his witnesses.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; . . . and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 49:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The entire anointed servant class is produced for a service against God’s foes. This is why God made the Servant’s mouth like a sharp sword and made him like a polished shaft or arrow. The tongue of the Servant and his followers takes up God’s Word and so makes use of the “sword of the spirit”. It declares the judgment of Jehovah against his enemies, exposes the hearts of religious hypocrites, puts to death false doctrine ana human traditions. As his servants use it He hides them in the shadow of his hand. So, though they are out in the open fighting they are still under his protection. From far off Jehovah sends the servant class, like a polished arrow shot from a bowstring. God kept his Son, his great Spokesman, close or stored him away like an arrow in a quiver, reserving him for use at the due time. All the servant class he has reserved for use at the proper time, at which time he propels them by his spirit against the foes of God’s kingdom. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Abraham said: “They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to these.”—Luke</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">16:29, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was the Jews who then had the Mosaic Law, the Prophets and the other section of the Hebrew Scriptures headed by the Psalms. Abraham showed he did not agree with the rich man’s request concerning Lazarus. Just so, too, the Lazarus class is not to be allowed to take away Moses and the Prophets or to ignore them or take from them or add to them. The Scriptures they already had must stand without change or compromise. The rich man class and their “five brothers” today have, not only Moses and the Prophets or the Hebrew Scriptures, but also the Greek Scriptures of Christ’s disciples. The “rich man” class had not strictly heeded these Scriptures and conformed his life and teaching to them. Hence he suffered. So if the “five brothers” or other members of the religious part of the Devil’s organization listen to these Scriptures and regulate their lives by them, only then will they not get into the “rich man’s” hopeless, tormented state. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 6:12, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A sin of transgression against God’s law puts us in debt to him. For our sin he could demand and exact our lives; he could banish us from his holy organization and from fellowship and association with it. He could withdraw his peace from us, breaking off all peaceful relations with us. He could make us turn in to him all we got from him by his undeserved kindness. We owe him love, expressed in obedience; and when we sin we fail in paying our debt, of love to him, for sin is unloving toward God. This petition would not be authorized unless there was some basis for God’s forgiveness of us. The basis for it is not just his love and mercy in an abstract way and without regard to his perfect justice which requires death for sin. The basis for forgiveness is his love and mercy expressed in the human sacrifice of his Son Jesus Christ which completely met all the demands of justice in our behalf. So to pray this, we must accept Christ’s sacrifice. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hold a good conscience, so that in the particular in which you are spoken against they may get ashamed who are speaking slightingly of your good conduct.—1 Pet. 3:16, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If we do this, then when we come before God himself for questioning we can make an answer to him out of a good conscience. Then he will judge us with approval through Christ Jesus. It may be, too, that some honest-hearted person who sees you are willing to suffer for tbe sake of holding a good conscience toward God will be impressed and will be led to see that your God is the living, true God and so will turn to Him for salvation. Let us be baptized in Christ’s example, for he is the Greater Noah in the ark of a new system of things for salvation. Baptism for us to be saved now rests with him. So by all means let us request and keep a good conscience toward God. In that way we shall be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger and shall realize tbe purpose of our baptism into the Greater Noah for our salvation. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s. —Matt. 22:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The matter here discussed was not Caesar’s military draft or voluntary enlistment in his army. What Jesus declared lawful according to God’s law through Moses was to pay tax to Caesar even though Caesar had extended his empire by carnal weapons and had taken away the independence and liberty of Jehovah’s chosen people. Even a man who conscientiously objected to serving in Caesar’s armies of aggression should Say him taxes as a conqueror.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Iven if Caesar applied a large part of it to his military program, yet what he did with the money was no responsibility of the conscientious objector. By Caesar’s taking over the country’s control and running the government all the subjugated people were receiving material benefits, and for this they were to pay back to Caesar the tax as due him. Hence a conscientious objector who is devoted to God to be His witness is not authorized to engage in subversiveness or promote pacifism. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">No douht you will apply this illustration to me, “Physician, cure yourself.&quot;—Luke 4:23, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By this his townsmen were meaning Jesus should practice his miraculous powers on his former neighbors, as if to say, Curing begins at home, for the benefit of your own first. But Jesus tried to appeal to his own townspeople by his preaching rather than by the miraculous relief of sickness. Had he followed their idea, “Physician, cure yourself,” he would not have been run out of town by them and threatened with stoning to death. So because of their lack of faith he did his miracles on outsiders, just as the prophet Elijah did. He knew that healing powers were not for personal advantage, but for a sign to outsiders, just like the gift of tongues. The one gifted with the power of divine healing was not to be a selfhealer. The healing power was to be used for others, not for the healer’s own comfort, nor for him to enrich himself by this practice and accept pay. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Are they not all spirits for public service, sent forth to minister for those who are going to inherit salvationf</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 1:14, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The answer to the apostle’s question is Yes. We are living at the time of Christ’s presence in his glorious kingdom, and one of the visible evidences of this is his separating of the people of all nations into two classes, sheep and goats, symbolically speaking. Mighty angels attend this separation work, for Jesus predicted this. (Matt. 25:31) We are living in the consummation of this system of things. So the angels are concerned not alone with gathering the sheep but also with keeping the organization of true Christians clean from all frauds. With the immediate participation of his angels the King has been gathering out of God’s visible organization all who fraudulently pose as being heirs of God’s kingdom but who are sons of the Devil. If, now, we are active in letting the dividing light shine out, the angels under command of the King Jesus Christ will co-operate with us. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By</span><span class="font6"> maintaining strong faith, based on knowledge of God, his witnesses can stick to the witness work. There is nothing at all to fear. Jehovah has promised to provide for his servants and protect them. It is a time to dwell on and speak of Jehovah’s majesty and all the mighty acts He has done. The fight will become heated. What a marvelous experience it will be to be right there in the middle of it and see Jehovah’s victory! Then we will be amazed at the strength he gives. We must always believe his promises. We must trust in him. We must have absolute reliance upon his Word of truth. That is why it was preserved down to our day; the prophecies were written for our benefit. Filling our minds with the Scriptures, we shall be strong; we shall know just what to do. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For Jehovah hath built up Zion; he hath appeared in his</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">glory.—Ps. 102:16, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s purpose is to build a heavenly organization which is to be a sanctuary. It is called Zion. It is his own habitation and he will dwell in it forever. All its “stones” are of his own selection, preparing, testing; and he will be responsible for laying them in place. The most important of these is the foundation cornerstone. The real, complete Zion is the heavenly city made up of the faithful slaves of God who are spirit-begotten, anointed, tried, tested and approved, built upon the “sure foundation” Jesus Christ, the Cornerstone, God’s anointed King. How beautiful and delightful and indicative of Zion’s purity are these precious words: “This is my resting-place for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.” (Ps. 132:14, AS) This city has been in course of preparation for nearly two thousand years. Its building up takes place when Jehovah appears in his glory. The capital city of the universe is Zion, the joy and delight of the whole earth, for his beloved Son is its foundation and everyone in it speaks Jehovah’s praise. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2:8, Ro; AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who renounce unrighteousness and take their stand on Jehovah’s side, he will look after as his very own, because “Jehovah knows those who belong to him”. (2 Tim. 2:19, AAV) If anyone touches these that he has chosen and blessed, it is like touching the pupil of his eye. Jehovah’s organization, the free Jerusalem above, is our mother and is the closest thing to Him. He has created her and made her for his praise. It will be just too bad for the individuals or nations that fight against God or his witnesses. These belong to him and in due time he will execute judgment against opposers. This does not mean Jehovah will not allow members or part of his organization to suffer hurt. He will; in order that the ones hurt may prove their integrity and faithfulness. However, he will take cognizance of the offenders, while he advises us: “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says Jehovah.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The God of Jacob is our refuge.—Ps. 46:</span><span class="font6">7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Having the God of Jacob as our lofty retreat, there is no need for us to organize refuge farms in isolated places, retire to ourselves there and quit the field of activity as Kingdom publishers. Trust in the great God of Jacob is not demonstrated by hiding in seclusion but is demonstrated by courageously going forth onto the field of action and spreading his message of life. “Jehovah preserveth the faithful.” (Ps. 31:23, AS) Retreating into bim as our high tower means to keep in unity with him wherever we may be in the line of duty. That way we stay inside the organization of his theocratic people wbo are scattered all over the earth. By carrying out organization instructions as contained in God’s Word, we work like our fellow witnesses everywhere else. We unitedly publish the name and government of Jehovah, bidding all lifeseekers to take refuge under Him. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The overseer should therefore be irreprehensible, a husband of one wife,... Let ministerial servants be husbands of one wife.—l Tim. 3:2,12, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is required of such servants in congregations to be husbands to but one living wife. This is not to be understood as saying that monogamy is required of only servants but polygamy is allowed for the rest of the congregation. Certainly polygamy was not practiced by the women in apostolic times in having many living husbands. So polygamy of the women was not why the registration requirement was made of aged widows to receive material support of a congregation, that of having been the “wife of one husband”. (1 Tim. 5: 9,10, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font6">So monogamy applies to Christian women as well as men. Since the appointed servants of the congregation were to be examples of the Christian flock, they were to be examples to the believers in this matter of being married to one living wife also. This in itself shows that the standard for all of Christ’s followers is that of a man’s having but one living wife, just as God arranged it with Adam in Eden. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Let your will come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 6:10,</span><span class="font6"> AW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not that God’s will is to be done by human creatures on earth as it is done by spirit angels up in heaven, but, rather, that God will do what he wants to do here on earth by means of his kingdom just the same as he does it up in heaven. At his appointed year, 1914, he brought his kingdom to birth by enthroning Christ Jesus as King in the midst of his enemies. And Jesus is faithfully carrying out his will toward this earth just as he did toward heaven when he fought and cast Satan and his demons down from there. Jesus once came to earth as a man to do his Father’s will here. After destroying Satan’s wicked heavens and earth at Armageddon, God will build up a new human society the members of which will love to do God’s will. Since his will to have a new heavens and a new earth will be done, and since his will is to preserve this earthly globe through Armageddon, his will can and will be done here also as it is done up in heaven. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">12:17, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is practical to live in accord with God’s Word. Some may protest that if all men did it would be fine, but since the majority do not it is useless for a few to do so. Yet these same men fight for their political and social convictions, even though they may be in a minority. Christians stand firm in their beliefs. Other worldlings may say God’s kingdom will be fine when it gets going, but until then they must do something to improve conditions. However, Christians do not sit idly by, awaiting the Kingdom’s full sway over earth. They are given so much to do that it is imperative that they redeem the time in order to complete their gospel preaching. Unimpressed, the worldlings want to do things in their own way, trusting in their own schemes, their own efforts, their own right. That is highly impractical, in view of the fact that Jehovah God is the wisest and mightiest force in the universe. At Armageddon he will in a very practical way sweep into oblivion all who oppose him. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3:21, Ro.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Peter makes a strong plea for a good conscience in us who are baptized into the Greater Noah in this “time of the end”. We cannot be baptized into him within the ark unless we go after a clean, good conscience, for Christ Jesus always had and kept such a conscience, through all his sufferings. The self-righteous hypocrites accused him, but he knew he was suffering for no wrongdoing of his own but for doing the good will of God. As followers of his we must suffer, especially in this time of his second presence as the Greater Noah. But when we suffer at men’s hands, let us make certain we do not suffer for our own wrongdoing. (1 Pet. 4:15, NW) For our baptism into the Greater Noah to be for our salvation we need to preserve our inward consciousness of being blameless according to God’s laws and commands.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4:7, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses think Noah’s example at the end of the ancient ungodly world is the most scientific, and that to follow it in this “time of the end” of the postdiluvian world guarantees life. Like Noah and his family, Jehovah’s witnesses of today are interested in perpetuating the human family beyond the cataclysm of Armageddon. In harmony with this they are now imitating Noah's example of faith and are bringing in droves of God’s “other sheep” under his theocratic organization in the face of the approaching world’s end. Jehovah God has given us the spirit of soundness of mind. So we declare his promise that the earth will survive Armageddon and that God’s will is to be done here in converting the entire globe into a paradise. Armageddon survivors and those resurrected from the graves may prove themselves worthy to inhabit it forever. So in the face of the end we do not lose our mental balance, but we act consistent with our belief. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">12:2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If to prove to ourselves God’s will we have to have our minds made over, it is evident that this system of things is not according to God's will. Hence we have to quit being fashioned after this system, in order to prove to ourselves what is God’s good, acceptable and complete will. This system may take pride on being much farther advanced than the ancient world which ended in the flood of Noah’s day, but it is exactly like it in the same respects for which the flood came. There is a continual bent of the mind toward evil, a continual bent of thinking contrary to the will of the Creator, Jehovah God. (Gen 6:5, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AT)</span><span class="font6"> The whole system of things which worldly men are trying to bring into line with modern thought is fashioned according to wrong thinking, and the longer the system goes, the farther it angles away from the absolute truth. It is not according to God’s mind. That is why it must go, and that shortly. It is now on its way out!

In the decisive contest of the gods at Armageddon, all the false gods of this world, visible and invisible, will topple from their pedestals in defeat and be destroyed, and their unclean false worship and religion will perish with them. That means their worshipers will perish with them, to the everlasting reproach of the false gods and false worship. But the Most High God Jehovah, by his royal High Priest Christ Jesus, will preserve the true worshipers through that mighty, destructive, world conflict.

He is not letting suffering come upon us to destroy us, but is seeking to perfect us in obedience by the things we suffer.

And so these symbolic leaves, when applied to the people of good will everywhere, are healthgiving, curative, acting like medicine. Hundreds of thousands have already come to these trees by the riverside, have eaten the Kingdom fruits offered and have applied to themselves the curative leaves by accepting the educational services of Jehovah’s anointed remnant of witnesses.

If you have pleasant experiences and get encouraging results from your efforts, you can thank him for these expressions of his favor, for every good gift and every perfect present comes from him the Father of celestial lights. If there is opposition or trials, if favorable results do not quickly show up, you can study the matter and determine how far Satan is responsible or how far the fault lies with you in your lack of preparation for service, your lack of tact, your bringing reproach on the message by personal conduct, or other causes.

<p><span class="font6">The great deliverance promised begins when the “appointed times of the nations” run out, A.D. 1914. This period of time stretches for 2,520 years, from 607 B.C. Throughout those many centuries God’s nation never had a king of David’s line ruling on the throne, for the crown was reserved for him who has the right to it. His coronation with it was not to take place at the first advent of Christ Jesus, but at the second. He was not to be King over just one small part of the earth, but to be King of all. He is “King of kings”. No city on earth was to be the seat of this mighty King, but heaven itself. His prophetic name, “Mithael,” means “Who is as (or like) God?” Christ Jesus is the “image of God”. At last he stands up as the “great prince”. Why? To aid, defend and deliver his people and destroy their enemies. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">According to this, there has always been a conflict between the worship of Jehovah, the God and Father of Christ Jesus, and the worship of all the so-called “gods” of this world, including Christendom. The worship of the only real God Jehovah is the true worship. Outnumbered many thousands of times by the worshipers of such gods of this world, those who worship Jehovah as the only God face the same question now as in all the past sixty centuries of human history, Will their worship survive? Will it triumph? About the answer to this question there can be no uncertainty. The one living and true God Jehovah will triumph over the false gods despite their millions in number. Hence the true worship of Jehovah God will triumph over all false worship and will alone survive.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1:15, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is so easy to develop a defiled conscience, one that condemns what is pure in God’s sight. How? If we follow man-made standards of self-righteousness and hold fast to them and do not advance with God’s advancing light on his arrangements for salvation. The Pharisees got defiled in this way, so that they saw nothing clean in what Jesus and his disciples did and taught. How did they get that way? By accepting religious fables and commandments of men in place of those of God. So we are told to “be healthy in the faith, paying no attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn themselves away from the truth”. To avoid this we must pay no heed to religious fables or to fleshly family trees which fill us with pride and cause social distinctions and unchristian disunity among us. We have to get our consciences enlightened and cleansed by the truth of God’s Word. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Every one that Paul there names was a fighter. Jehovah gave them victory. We could go through the list of Jehovah’s witnesses from Abraham onward to show they w'ere not pacifists. The history of Jehovah’s witnesses runs all the way back to Adam’s son Abel, whom his brother Cain killed because Abel had received favorable witness from Jehovah God. The apostle Paul, in chapters 11 and 12 of his letter to the Hebrews, shows that fact. In all that history of almost six thousand years the record fails to show Jehovah’s witnesses accusable of “opposition to war or to the use of military force for any purpose”, which is the definition of pacifism. Such pacifism not even the Bible itself can be charged with teaching, and neither can Jehovah’s witnesses, who stick most scrupulously to the Bible. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Let Christians enter into marriage in an honorable way. Let no single girl entice a single man into sex relations with her with the aim of obligating him to marry her. That is fornication by them both even if afterward he does feel obligated and marries her. Likely, however, her easy virtue will create a contempt in him for her, so that he will want as his wife, not her, but a woman with honor who resists all inclinations or suggestions to immorality. Let no young widow with animal passions entice or yield to a man for sexual gratification. On the other hand, let no single man think he has premarital freedom and can have sex relations with one girl after another, until he comes up against one with the moral standards he wants in a wife. By such sex tolerance he is a fornicator and a selfish corrupter of womenfolk. Guard against men who sneak in for such immoral reasons. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">What about people of good will who survive the battle of Armageddon because of having had spiritual healing now? Will they be instantaneously healed of every bodily affliction and miraculously perfected? No. This would not comport with their still being in the same human bodies and still having traces of sin and evil inclinations which they inherited from Adam. They will no more be perfected in an instant after Armageddon than the faithful witnesses of ancient time, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, etc., will be resurrected as perfect men by God’s power through Christ the King. For all who survive Armageddon and for those who will be raised from the memorial tombs the physical healing will be gradual until human perfection is reached, at the latest by the end of the thousandyear sabbath. This gradual progress in physical health will depend upon their progress in the way of righteousness under Christ’s rule. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">So didst thou lead thy people. —Isa. 63:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If each of us were left to himself just because he has a copy of the Bible and were to direct his movements independently as he thought he understood that Word, what? It is likely, or possible, that there would be a great deal of confusion or working in competition among us. So, besides individually possessing God’s Word, we need a theocratic organization. Yes, besides having God’s spirit of illumination, a Christian needs Jehovah’s theocratic organization in order to understand the Bible. He needs to attend the meetings arranged for by that organization and to study with fellow Christians. He needs the organization, too, in order to work in harmony with God’s purposes and to be directed aright in his movements. The reason is that God deals with his organization and not with individuals who are outside of his organization or who defiantly try to act independently of it. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has proved right, but not so the gods of Babylon. Given the chance to do good by voluntarily releasing Jehovah’s witnesses from their power and also given the chance to do evil by exterminating the witnesses from the earth, they have failed to show themselves gods in comparison with Jehovah the God of his anointed remnant. When war in heaven followed the enthroning of God’s Son in 1914 as King of a new world, the demon gods of Babylon, including Satan their ruler, were given a forced fall from heaven down to this earth, the footstool of God’s .King. So Jehovah, by his King Christ Jesus, has vindicated himself as the true God, showing his power over the mighty enemy organization Babylon. He has vindicated himself as Almighty God by delivering his remnant from her power. His pure worship was thus restored and renewed on the earth, and it will be preserved. It will gain the victory! </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Christians nineteen centuries ago saw they had spent enough time in the past on the vanities of this old world. They saw that an endless new world was coming and they must prove themselves worthy of living in it, no matter how far off its establishment might be. In this way they were setting a proper example for us today. Like them we should not selfishly think we might as well enjoy the world as long as it stands and take a chance of turning to the standards of the new world just before we die or before this world passes out. Like them we must be wise and realize we are making a record now for our judgment before God. In order for that judgment to be one which awards us eternal life in the new world, we must live and act accordingly from now on. Let us not fool ourselves. Our responsibility counts from now on. Only by withdrawing our love and support now from this world can we escape from being condemned and executed with it. Let us face the world’s unjust criticism for doing so. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">. According to the inborn law in our minds, they desire or find it easy to gravitate to sin and selfishness. To supplant this with a better law. we have to have our minds made over with new knowledge. But after we have gathered it from God’s Word, we must work at our minds which are filled with this divine knowledge. Against the sinful inclinations and against the tendency to mental laziness and forgetfulness, we must cultivate proper mental habits. In this way we really develop a ‘law of the mind’, a certain mental cast or mold, a mental rule of action, and this becomes a controlling force in our lives. With our blessed knowledge from God’s Word wo must train our minds in right ways of thinking and in right processes and efforts. Our everlasting existence depends upon our establishing a righteous ‘law of the mind’. Our destiny depends upon what we fix our attention on. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">This is the time to shun the empty speeches of those who have so much to say but who do not have God’s backing, much like Korah and the 250 older men of influence of the Israelites, all of whom were fighting against God’s servants. Individually, everyone must see to it that he understands God’s Word, studies it well and keeps presenting himself before God in service so as to be an approved person. Doing the work assigned to you to do is what counts. Service in God’s organization anywhere satisfies! When one turns to the Father of all mercy and relies on him, doing His will, one finds that great stores of blessing are on hand for him. One must truly be interested in God’s work and want to know him well. “Jehovah knows those who belong to him,” and we should certainly want to know him. To do so means life everlasting. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Eyes of the mind or of understanding need to be opened to see the light of life, otherwise we shall stumble into destruction. The blind religious guides led the blind people to the pit where both tumbled in together to destruction. So which is it more vital to remove. the physical or the mental blindness? Which miracle is the greater, the physical or the spiritual? Physical miracles do not compare with the spiritual miracles which cause people formerly deaf to God’s Word to hear it now with understanding. By spiritual miracles men whose tongues were dumb as far as praising God opened their mouths to declare his fame, preach his Word and witness to his kingdom. Resuscitations of the physically dead only to die again in the flesh, were these miracles greater than raising people who were dead toward God in their sinful, alienated condition to live, act and serve Him? For the anointed Christians this means immortal life in the new world, glory with Jesus Christ in his heavenly kingdom. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">If we are thus armored, we need never back down before our assailants, and the Devil and all his hosts of demons cannot do us one bit of spiritual harm. We may be killed because of their invisible influence on their earthly agents, but God will safeguard and preserve our inheritance of life in the new world, granting us a resurrection in his due time. We may be in prison or concentration camp because of demonized men and governments, but our enemies cannot take our spiritual armor off us. We can still retain this armor and fight in it there in detention, for Paul himself was wearing this armor in prison at Rome when he wrote the Ephesians to wear it. And as we fight in it we can keep in communication with God and his invisible organization by means of prayer, every form of prayer, praise, thanksgiving, appreciation, petitions. _ Prayer makes us feel divine aid near.

<p><span class="font6">We need to keep vigilant about praying, privately and with our brothers. Prayer makes our appreciation of our relation with our heavenly Father and Deliverer stronger. It keeps us in communication with him. We have a real fight on our hands, not against blood and flesh with carnal arms, but against superhuman enemies, the wicked spirits. Our personal armor is the complete spiritual outfit God has provided for us. As we fight against _ these spiritual hosts with this complete suit of armor on, we need to keep awake, alert to pray and to appeal for heavenly aid. We cannot get along without prayer. It really has an effect if we pray with faith and earnestness, in harmony with God’s will. We need to pray for boldness to preach God’s Word and deliver the witness, in favorable season, in troublesome season. We are privileged to pray, not for ourselves only, but for all our brothers. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It is false religion, impure worship, that heaps reproach upon the clean religion and pure worship. It does this enviously and unjustly. Not only that, but it also tries to get true grounds for taunting and speaking abusively of true worship by bringing about a corruption of it. This it does by trying to make the pure worshipers relax, grow unsteady about their principles, yield to worldliness, and Become just like the people of the world though carrying the names of God and his Christ. It tries to draw the pure worshipers into a deal or bargain, a compromise, with false religion for some selfish advantage, such as material prosperity, popularity in this world and a tree enjoyment of what this system of things has to offer. From Abel's time pure worship has had to fight against contamination with the world. Satan says it cannot be done. Jehovah says it can be done and will be done. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For if someone because of conscience toward God bears up under afflictions and suffers unjustly, this is an agreeable thing.—1 Pet. 2:19, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Do not suffer because of going after “flesh for unnatural use” and committing fornication with one whose flesh does not belong to you in marriage relationship. Such things went on outside of Noah’s ark, when men, Nephi-lim and married materialized “sons of God” committed such things in disobedience to God. (Jude 6, 7) Be sure that when you are forced to suffer at the hands of men in power and others in worldly authority it is because you requested a good conscience toward God and you are trying to hold it by keeping His commands. In that way men will be able to find no fault in you except that you are obeying the law of your God. In that case there is credit to you for such suffering, because you are preserving integrity toward God. Then you are like your Exemplar, the Greater Noah Christ Jesus, for he was a model for us in suffering for conscience’ sake. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Be certain about one thing: Jehovah is not letting his worship be stamped out by the Devil’s world organization. His worship on earth will go on forever. There must be a visible organization to receive all on earth who want to worship God in freedom, before the battle of Armageddon. So from and after 1919 he used his great Servant to restore the remnant of spiritual Israel and he reorganized them to act as his witnesses in this momentous postwar period. He led his reorganized people to see that the only organization for them now was the theocratic organization, not democratic organization. Jehovah has made the remnant of spiritual Israelites part of his servant class, under his Chief Servant Christ Jesus. In that way they could serve as the faithful and discreet slave whom Jesus had foretold and whom he said he would appoint over all his earthly belongings, the interests of the Kingdom. It is our part to work with this servant class. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">We have the satisfying evidence of angelic help and protection. In what way? In that the visible organization of Jehovah's servants is preserved amid au embattled world and our Kingdom witness prospers. This angelic guardianship, however, does not relieve us of being just as careful as we can, to guard against accidents. We eannot expect the angels to protect us against our own carelessness, rashness and foolhardiness. In the midst of wolves, we are instructed to be as cautious as serpents and to beware of men. We must not test God too far with what is unreasonable. The Devil quoted Scripture to Jesus, but Jesus refused to force God to save him by means of the angels, tempting God or putting him to the test beyond what be had really promised. So with us today, who are God's children, but not nearly as important as Jesus. While we have angelic protection for the sake of God’s work and cause, we dare not test God and expect his angels to keep us from harm and accident in spite of it. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Pet. 2:2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When a professed Christian turns out of the way and follows an enticer into loose conduct, he not only injures himself but also brings reproach on the pure organization of Jehovah God. People outside who observe their unclean course take them as an example of what all others inside the organization are. Naturally they begin to speak abusively about the organization and the “way of the truth”. This is just what the adversary wants. He wants to bring reproach on God’s true organization and have it take on a shameful appearance. God’s organization represents the way of the truth. So when any members of it walk contrary to the principles of the truth, then outside observers are led to look upon them as hypocrites. Who wants to join a hypocritical organization?

<p><span class="font6">Satan is the seatterer or shatterer of God’s people. He is the roaring lion trying to devour someone. To bring about the end of his power the very heavens must be shaken, and such an act could come only from the Almighty God and his King, Christ Jesus. The shaking of the powers of the wicked heavens does not of itself bring immediate and complete deliverance to God’s people. But by it something has been set in motion, and it is Christ Jesus as earth’s rightful Ruler opening his campaign against the enemy. Now the Devil’s seat of authority in heaven is gone, his power is broken. At his ousting from beaven he was not destroyed, but is permitted to wage war against the saints of God on earth to wear them out. Now that the shattering or dispersing of God’s people is ended, they will be gathered together, for the power of him who scattered them is broken.

<p><span class="font6">Today, in the “time of the end”, not only individual Christians, but also entire religious systems which claim to be the “house of God” are on judgment. It is a more critical time. It is hard enough for a righteously inclined Christian to hold onto his integrity in this debased world in order to work out his salvation. So how about those who offer no Christian resistance but yield to this world and its loose ways just for the pleasures of sin? Peter asks: “Where will the ungodly man and the sinner make a showing?” Yes, where will they? They will find themselves more tightly enslaved by this world through their longer indulgence in sin and hence unable to make a desperate break for liberty at the last moment and to stage a successful comeback before divine judgment is executed. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">In the present-day contest of the gods Jehovah has scored a victory indeed by delivering, purifying and preserving his spiritual remnant, his spiritual Israelites, despite all that modern Babylon can do. It has been as when he delivered his chosen people Israel from bondage in Egypt. Then it was he said: “Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments.” (Ex. 12: 12, AS) And now in this “time of the end” he executes judgments against not only the demon gods of ancient Egypt, but the gods of the entire Babylonish world. His remnant declare these judgments. Action such as this stirs up the ire and indignation of all the demon gods and also their religious victims. But it is our duty, and it is in the interests of the freedom of all people of good will, for us to defy these false gods of Babylon. For this very reason we were spared and delivered in this “time of the end”, namely, to be witnesses to the almighti-ness and supremacy of the true God Jehovah before all the false gods of the world.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 1)9:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This joyful prophecy extends now to the Right Shepherd’s “other sheep” who must be rescued from Babylon before Armageddon. That fact is revealed to us at Revelation 7: 16,17, where it is quoted. Their being out of nations, tribes, peoples and tongues makes them a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Gentile</span><span class="font6"> crowd, when compared with the 144,000 spiritual Israelites. The Revelation shows they come to Zion and submit to the theocratic rule of Jehovah. The applicableness now of the vision of the “great crowd” to the other sheep was revealed to the remnant of spiritual Israelites in 1935. Since then they have flocked to Zion. To make their coming easy Jehovah has made a way for them over mountainous obstacles and has raised un highways for them across the deep places. All along the road he has fed them, even on hills that appeared bare, always supplying them with living waters of truth. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">With God’s Word in our hearts we really have a new powerful influence at work within us. It is no dead Word that has lost its interest, its truth, its practicalness, its interpretation of the events of our day, and its protective power against degradation by these immoral times. It has vitality, it carries conviction, it can show what is in us better than any psychologist. It is no dead letter; its judgment will surely be executed. (Heb. 4:12, AW) With that dynamic Word of God in us we have a new force actuating our minds to correct our thinking and our lives. If we no longer care to be fashioned after this world, but want to be Christlike, real Christians, then we simply must have this new stimulus, which works in the right direction for our betterment, our transformation.

<p><span class="font6">Our ministry as Jehovah’s servants and witnesses is a glorious treasure, and we can now appreciate why this treasure is committed to creatures of earth who are like earthen vessels. The service reports of modern days show that God is accomplishing a mighty work through men and women and children who are fully devoted to him but who are handicapped with some physical impairment. They have enough truth so as not to pray and wait upon God . to perform the miracle of divine healing and relieve them of what ails or hampers their bodies, before they try to get something done in his service. They do not have to have the power of divine healing remove their natural infirmities and defects in order to be convinced themselves or to convince others that they have the truth and are witnesses of Jehovah. Just as they are they try to serve as ministers of the good news of his kingdom which must now be preached world-wide. W </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span></p>

(Deut. 8:5, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">AS)</span><span class="font6"> A father that loves his son does not carry the chastening too far, so it is more than the son can stand. He gives him only as much as he can take at the time. So with our heavenly Father. He builds us up for the trial that we may come through successfully. Being aware of our weakness and limitations we pray in the Lord’s prayer to the heavenly Father that he will not try us and chasten us any more than an earthly father would his child. Is that not a proper prayer of a child to its father? We have his written guarantee that he will not do so.

Then by the theocratic organization Jehovah led them from one truth to another, opening the eyes of their hearts and the ears of their understanding to see and hear these truths. Being taught to be reasonable and level-headed by such truths, they no longer acted rashly or hastily, rushing into sin. They gained true knowledge and spoke with understanding, no more stammering in fear and unsureness. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span></p>

Has he succeeded in overwhelming Jehovah’s worship and wiping it off the earth by all his means of corruption and destructive violence?

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in justice.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:1-23:32:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 32:1</a>, <em>AS</em>) These heartening words point to the administration of a righteous government, now at hand. Without here questioning the motives of many who have held public office in an effort to benefit their fellow men, all will acknowledge that such have been in the minority, and their efforts have brought no permanent blessings. How thrilling, then, to point to God’s kingdom and its servants, the “princes”, whose rule is for the honor of God and the blessing of all its subjects! The just rule of these “princes”, under the King of righteousness, Christ Jesus, is now being announced.

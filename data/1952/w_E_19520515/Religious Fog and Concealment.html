<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“When people just broadly approve of ‘God,’ ‘faith,’ ‘prayer,’ etc., it is about as vague as fog, gives no direction to their lives and no fuel for going anywhere.”—“Rev.” George F. Tittman, rector, St. Mary’s Episcopal Church, Arlington, Va.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“As it now functions, the church represents a false God and a false Christ but more tragically it conceals the true God and the true Christ.”—“Rev.” Dr. Paul T. McClurkin on resigning from the First Congregational Church, Hadley, Mass.</p>

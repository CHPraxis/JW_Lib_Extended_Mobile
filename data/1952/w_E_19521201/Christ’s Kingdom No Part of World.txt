Christ’s Kingdom No Part of World
● As long as the current percentage of religious and Biblical illiteracy exists, the clergy would do best to discharge their responsibility in their own avowed field, rather than ignoring it to dabble in others. God is not in earth’s political wrangles. His kingdom is separate from such, and only through his power to abolish the wicked system will his blessing come to earth, not through any current politician. Christ and his apostles recognized this, and though in the world they were no part of it—a course far different from today’s clergy. (John 15:17-19; 17:16, 17; 18:36; James 1:27) God speaks for himself through his Word. Those who contradict it should be rejected.

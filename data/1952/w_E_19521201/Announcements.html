<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>FEAR OF THE SOVEREIGN JEHOVAH</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Let all the earth fear Jehovah.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:8-19:33:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 33:8</a>, <em>AS.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Not a nation on earth today is free from fear. In fact, the world is now in the state so accurately described by Jesus, who predicted for this time that men would be “faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth”. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:26-42:21:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 21:26</a>, <em>NW</em>) But there is another fear which is healthful, upbuilding, reassuring and conducive to right living and long life. That is the fear of Jehovah, which is pure. It impels one to serve Jehovah out of love for his goodness, and Jehovah guards the eternal interests of those who fear him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:7-19:34:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 34:7</a>, <em>AS</em>) Millions of people need to be taught that fear of Jehovah is the way of life, and that, in brief, is the purpose of the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine. During January, 1953, <em>Watchtower </em>readers may join in presenting this journal to the people on a year’s subscription for $1. Three booklets will be given as a premium. Help people to fear Jehovah as Sovereign by directing their attention to his Word. Each issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>does that faithfully.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Here it is! There will be a trailer camp in conjunction with the 1953 International Convention. The Butterworth and Marks farms, located on Old New Brunswick road, near New Market, New Jersey, will again be the site of the camp. These properties that the Society has rented for this purpose comprise between eighty-five and ninety acres, which should provide ample room for all desiring accommodations for tents or trailers. Additional property will be available if more is required.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">While this is about forty miles from Yankee Stadium, improved highway facilities have been built during the past two years that will make traveling to Yankee Stadium easier. The New Jersey Turnpike is a through highway to the George Washington bridge. Also, improvements have been made in the present four-lane highways to the Holland Tunnel.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">You may begin making personal plans now if you wish to stay at the “Trailer City”. The camp will be equipped with a store, supplies, running water, etc., to make it more comfortable and convenient. It may be possible for some to get hold of camping equipment now and hold it through the winter for next summer. Whatever the case may be, planning should begin now, so that come next July you will be ready to travel.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We would suggest, however, that you do <em>not </em>write until you receive the form for trailer camp accommodations through your local company in the spring. There will be a nominal registration fee for each unit, to cover the cost of utilities and temporary buildings required. It is expected that the camp will be equipped with sound direct from the stadium so all the programs can be heard the same as in 1950.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● The Christmas tree has now made a complete cycle. Pagans first used it in midwinter celebrations. Those calling themselves “Christians” did not take time to really convert the pagans they absorbed, just gave their corrupting ceremonies a Christian name. The pagans were satisfied, so were the “Christians”, even though the midwinter celebration was at a time of the year when Christ could not have been born. Now the Communists believe, as did early so-called Christians, that there is no need to oppose the people’s customs, right or wrong; so they merely performed another name-change. According to the <em>Romanian </em>News, February 3, 1952, the new name is the “Winter Tree Celebration”, or “the children’s winter vacation”, or the “Winter Festival”. Bucharest had a Christmas tree (we beg your pardon, <em>Winter tree</em>) seventy feet tall, “thousands of lights, ribbons, golden globes and little metal bells.” A “fairy tale city” was set up, with “Father Frost, painted on a huge panel, advancing with gifts”. With the evergreen tree decked with lights and spangles, and “Father Frost” to give the gifts, the Christian name has been removed and a non-Christian celebration is back to its pagan origin.</p>

Or what portion does a faithful person have with an unbeliever? And what agreement does God’s temple have with idols?—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:14-47:6:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:14-16</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

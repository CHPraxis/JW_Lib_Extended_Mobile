<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">NEW YORK is still talking about the 1950 international assembly held by Jehovah’s witnesses. The sixty-seven countries that crowded into the Yankee Stadium spelled out in bold letters, before the eyes of the United Nations and the world, that it is possible through true worship to dwell together in peace and unity. Not only did Jehovah’s witnesses of many nations worship together, but they worked together, ate together, and lived together! Never had the old world seen such harmony ring among a mixed multitude! Meetings were held in twenty different languages, and new releases were in sixteen languages other than English. Firsthand reports were heard from those who labored many years behind the barbed wire of Hitler’s concentration camps. News and experiences were heard from those who crossed the Iron Curtain. Thrilling experiences were heard from brothers who came from the Far and Near East.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“What I learned from this assembly,” said a young brother eleven years old, “will last me four or five years—until the next one, or even more.” The next one is July 19 to 26, 1953! Will you be there? There is more to learn. Once again Jehovah’s witnesses of many nations will have opportunity to prove to the world that they are a united people, a free people, a friendly people. Their experiences will be just as thrilling and touching. To be able to work with these brothers of many nations and to listen to their problems and see their zeal will be encouraging and faith-strengthening. To see the love the brothers have for each other will be a foretaste of new world living. Once again the old world will be made to sit up and take notice that of the “increase of his [Jehovah’s] government and of peace there shall be no end”. Do not miss it. Prepare now that you might be free in ’53 to spend a long week of eight days with a united world in worship at the Yankee Stadium.</p>

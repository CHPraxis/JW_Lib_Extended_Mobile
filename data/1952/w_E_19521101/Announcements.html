<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>“TRIUMPHANT CLEAN WORSHIP” WITNESSING PERIOD—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:27-59:1:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Jas. 1:27</strong></a><strong>, <em>NW.</em></strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Clean worship” must be directed toward the one true God. Any other worship is idolatrous and unclean, Scripturally condemned. It is vile unfaithfulness on the part of the creature to ignore the Creator and render worship to idols, demons or men. “Clean worship” triumphs over false worship because it is strong, enduring and unshakable. “The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring for ever.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:9-19:19:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 19:9</a>, <em>AS</em>) That right attitude of deep respect toward God will produce fruit in right works. It will seek to serve others, bringing them the knowledge that has so abundantly blessed the receiver. So, “clean worship” means to care for bereaved and desolate ones, giving them the comfort the truth contains. During December the following offer will continue to be presented to such people: three bound books, <em>What Has Religion Done for Mankind? “Let God Be True” </em>and <em>“This Means Everlasting Life”, </em>all on a contribution of $1.50. Demonstrate clean worship by presenting this offer to others, and report your activity to the Society at the month’s end. (Address under front cover)</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>WHO SPEAKS THE TRUTH?</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This is a day when the air is filled with varied opinions and teachings. Foremost among those who voice their views, especially in spiritual matters, are the leaders of multitudinous religious organizations. Honest persons are puzzled in trying to determine whom to recognize as speaking the truth on questions of vital concern. For your help we recommend the book <em>“Let God Be True”. </em>In its 320 pages basic truths and sound doctrines are made plain and understandable. God’s Word is plainly set forth, and the erroneous teachings of men are boldly identified and subjected to the uncovering power of that Word. Complete with index of subjects and scripture texts, this book (available in 30 languages) is sent postpaid for 50c.</p>

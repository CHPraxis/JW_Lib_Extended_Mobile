<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A young farmer in El Salvador, though having never attended school, used to tuck his books in his waistband and teach himself during noontimes and while his oxen rested from the plow. He could see the wondrous potential in the green fields and forests and could not understand why such a potential should be destroyed. Neither could the clergy satisfactorily explain that to him.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">His curious mind continued to search for the answers to these and other perplexing questions. He got the answers in a rather strange way on the eve of his sister’s wedding. During the merriment, a guest tried to kiss the bride. A pistol fight ensued between the groom and the guest as the crowd melted through doors and windows. The lights went out. When the shooting stopped our young friend crawled from under the bench where he had taken cover and had found a green book entitled <em>“Let God Be True” </em>that had been abandoned. From this book and other publications, which he later obtained, he found the answers to his questions. Now he is a full-time minister, preaching the good news of the Kingdom among his neighbors, fording streams, braving storms and sleeping nights in the open, so that more of his humble forest folk can also have their questions answered.</p>

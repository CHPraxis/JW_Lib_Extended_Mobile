The Complete Cycle
● The Christmas tree has now made a complete cycle. Pagans first used it in midwinter celebrations. Those calling themselves “Christians” did not take time to really convert the pagans they absorbed, just gave their corrupting ceremonies a Christian name. The pagans were satisfied, so were the “Christians”, even though the midwinter celebration was at a time of the year when Christ could not have been born. Now the Communists believe, as did early so-called Christians, that there is no need to oppose the people’s customs, right or wrong; so they merely performed another name-change. According to the Romanian News, February 3, 1952, the new name is the “Winter Tree Celebration”, or “the children’s winter vacation”, or the “Winter Festival”. Bucharest had a Christmas tree (we beg your pardon, Winter tree) seventy feet tall, “thousands of lights, ribbons, golden globes and little metal bells.” A “fairy tale city” was set up, with “Father Frost, painted on a huge panel, advancing with gifts”. With the evergreen tree decked with lights and spangles, and “Father Frost” to give the gifts, the Christian name has been removed and a non-Christian celebration is back to its pagan origin.
What partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? Further, what harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what portion does a faithful person have with an unbeliever? And what agreement does God’s temple have with idols?—2 Cor. 6:14-16, NW.

Works of Charity
● How many donations are given to be seen of men? It is so rare that someone does not want a lapel button, his name on a stained glass window, or some other public acknowledgment that when such happens—that is news! Away down in Texas a newspaper recognized this when it reported “‘Unknown’ Donor Gives $300 Yearly to Illinois Church”. Yet Jesus was specific regarding charity: “Take good care not to practice your righteousness in front of men in order to be observed by them; . . . Hence when you start making gifts of mercy, do not blow a trumpet ahead of you, just as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be glorified by men.” Even on such simple matters, today’s “Christianity” is a long way from Christ.—Matt. 6:1-4, New World Trans.

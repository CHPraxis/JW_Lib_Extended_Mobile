DO YOU PRACTICE A RELIGION?
Do you practice a religion of some kind? Most people do, but even if you do not you are interested in bettering your lot and that of your loved ones. Religion is considered to be an indispensable aid to that end. Of the many kinds of religion on earth, which one actually does prove to be the best for one’s lasting welfare? Published in order to answer this vital question in an authoritative and understandable way is the 352-page book What Has Religion Done for Mankind? It not only will point to the reason for the obvious failure of religion in general, but will also enable you to find the religion worth having and practicing. This well-arranged and beautifully-bound volume sent to any address, postpaid, on a contribution of only 50c.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Every year in Ivorogbo town there are “Easter” celebrations, including dancing, singing and the various denomination’s “holy communion” services.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Last year the local company of Jehovah’s witnesses invited the townsfolk to their Memorial service on the evening of March 23 in order to witness the proper Scriptural celebrating of the Lord’s evening meal.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">After the Memorial service discussion arose and spread all over the town, with the result that no processions or “Easter” celebrations were held, except for a feeble attempt by a few of the older religionists to carry on as before. In the service effort that followed some of the townspeople expressed their desire to participate and, all together, 59 persons went out into the field, including the regular publishers, numbering about 30, who took the new ones along for training.—Nigeria Branch.</p>

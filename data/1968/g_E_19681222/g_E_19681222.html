<h5><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>How Will Schoolchildren Be Affected?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">I</span><span class="font2">N THE state of New York there is a law that provides that “each minor from seven to sixteen years of age shall attend upon full time day instruction.” It goes on to say that the dominion of the state “is absolute as far as attendance of children upon instruction is concerned during the ages prescribed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But nearly one million children did not attend school in the city of New York for several weeks of the present school year. Why were they not able to obey the state law? Because the teachers’ union had called a strike that closed most of the city schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This was a violation of the Taylor Law, which forbids strikes by public employees. It might also be said to violate the education law by preventing children from attending school. With respected adults openly breaking laws, what effect will that have upon the schoolchildren?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In raising this question no attempt is being made to condemn the teachers for their desire to protect themselves from being dismissed from their jobs without satisfactory charges. The point in question is the effect their actions, as well as those of other persons in the dispute, may have on the children’s respect for law and order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There can be no doubt that most of these teachers are dedicated persons who are very much interested in the children in their classes. This is clearly indicated by those teachers who set up makeshift classrooms in community centers, apartments and other places so they could teach some of their pupils without having to cross a picket line. What is more, they did this without pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But since the actions of the adults in the school dispute were, in many instances, contrary to law, what impression will that leave on the minds of the children? They saw laws violated, not only by teachers, but also by other adults. Will such disrespect for laws by adults make them feel more inclined to respect the laws of the city, of the state, of the country?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Juvenile lawbreaking is already a serious problem. In its report on crime in 1967, the Federal Bureau of Investigation stated, according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">U</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">jS. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">News &lt;£ World Report</span><span class="font2"> of September 9, 1968, that crimes “committed by youths of both sexes were climbing at a higher rate than crimes committed by older persons.” It went on to point out that “arrests of youths under eighteen were up 59.2 percent” from what they were in 1960.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In view of these facts, is it not of vital importance that all adults involved in the field of education set a fine example of obedience to laws and to those persons in positions of authority just as parents need to do? But during the course of the school strike children saw grownups violate laws. They heard adults hurl vile epithets at one another and saw mob actions that required squads of policemen to maintain order. What kind of impression is all this going to leave on the young people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A teacher that is dedicated to living by Christian principles wants to set a proper example for the children. He believes in obedience to the law and wants to obey it. But what can he do when dissenting factions close down the schools or create a situation in which he becomes subject to physical injury if he tries to obey laws that the authorities are unable to enforce? All he can do is to wait until the worldly people settle their differences. Then he can proceed to carry on in harmony with existing laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The conflict also creates problems for Christian parents and their children. They also want to be obedient to “Caesar’s” laws, because Jesus Christ said: “Pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar.” (Mark 12:17) These parents want their children to take full advantage of the education provided by the state. They want to obey the education law, but as Christians they cannot become embroiled in disputes between factions of this world, for Jesus said they are to be “no part of the world.” (John 15:19) Like the Christian teacher, they can only wait until order is restored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although those responsible for the closing of the schools in New York city may sincerely believe that the action was necessary in order to safeguard the jobs of the teachers, the question as to how the children will be affected deserves serious consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The children saw dissension among the disputing adults become so fierce that police had to be stationed night and day around certain schools for days at a time. With adults acting in such a disorderly way, are not the young people likely to show less respect for the authority of their teachers as well as for the authority of city officials and law-enforcing agencies? Was not this dispute a bad adult example for the children?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Has the time come when young people are to be taught, by actions if not by words, that the law is to be obeyed only if it does not result in personal inconvenience or interfere with selfish interests? Is it no longer possible for adults to settle grievances without resorting to emotional demonstrations, name-calling, vile epithets, violence and disrespect for the law? Some young people have already done such things on school campuses, and are not more of them likely to do such things in the future in view of the adult examples they have seen?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In recent months the public press has repeatedly drawn attention to what appears to be a trend toward anarchy, the complete rejection of law and ruling authority. With what has been seen in New York city, people have good reason to wonder how children are being affected and to ask if anarchy is indeed what the future holds for human society.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;">Why do man's efforts to establish peace so consistently fail? What is the answer?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font2">HE hearts of mankind everywhere yearn for peace. How they wish that the killing of loved ones, the violence and rioting in cities, and the ruining of the earth would cease! But will they? Will mankind’s hope for lasting world peace ever be realized? What do you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some persons view the prospects as bleak. They liken the hope for peace to that illusory lake of water frequently seen as one speeds down a desert road. The car never catches up to it. The water always stays just a short distance down the road. Really it is not water at all, but simply an illusion, caused by the extreme heat near the surface of the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Is the hope for lasting world peace also only a mirage, an illusion? Is it something that mankind was meant ever to seek, feel at times that he almost had in his grasp, but never actually realize? This is what an increasing number of persons apparently are beginning to think.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Why Has Peace Been So Illusive?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What is the problem? Since the desire of all peoples, regardless of race or nationality, is for peace, why can it not be achieved? Is it that the methods by which mankind seeks peace are at fault? Have the hopes for lasting peace been founded on a wrong basis? Has mankind looked to the wrong source for the establishment of peaceful government?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is obvious that governing the world of mankind is an extremely complicated</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">process. Yet, since humans are intelligent creatures, it is generally believed that they can successfully rule themselves without God. But is this view correct? Can men really govern themselves properly without the Supreme Sovereign? Or is this a fundamental misconception, an illusion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Humans may appear capable of self-government; furthermore, efforts by them may seem the only way that world peace can be established. Nevertheless, what may appear to be the solution to establishing permanent world peace may not be at all. Remember, illusions can occur. This certainly happens frequently in connection with physical vision.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>How Appearances Can Deceive</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Consider the moon, for instance. Undoubtedly you have looked at it many times. Have you observed it when it was low on the horizon, perhaps between some trees and lying just over a farmhouse or some city buildings? Did it not appear unusually large? Have you not also observed the moon later at night w’hen it is higher in the sky? Did it not appear smaller there? But, of course, it was not. It is an illusion. The terrain of the earth, including the trees, houses, hills and fields, causes the mind to perceive the moon as being larger when it is situated near the horizon than when it is higher in the sky. Our mind can thus be influenced to believe what is actually untrue. Further evidence must be considered to determine the truth.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19681222_files/g_E_19681222-8.png" alt="" style="width:152pt;height:103pt;">
<p><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;">Which dish of ice cream is larger?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Observe how this is the case in the accompanying illustrations. Does not one dish of ice cream in the picture appear larger than the other one? Yet they are of the same dimensions when measured. The farther dish of ice cream appears larger because it is not drawn in proper perspective. It should be drawn smaller to appear equal in size to the closer dish of ice cream on the counter.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19681222_files/g_E_19681222-9.png" alt="" style="width:120pt;height:55pt;">
<p><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;">Do the horizontal lines appear of equal length?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">Also note the two sets</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Consider another example. Observe the horizontal lines, one with the inverted arrows and the other with the outgoing arrows. Would you say that the lines are the same length? “Of course not,” you may respond. But they are. It is another instance in which what appears to be the case is not so. The mind is influenced to draw a wrong conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of parallel vertical lines. Does not one set appear to spread apart in bow legged fashion? And does not the other set seem to come together in a knock-kneed way? But this, too, is an optical illusion. The vertical lines are perfectly straight. These examples illustrate how easily physical illusions can deceive one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In a similar way, popular views or ideas can also prove to be misconceptions, illusions. Could this be the case with the popular view that humans are capable of ruling themselves successfully? What does examination of the evidence reveal? Are human rulers really a reliable source to which to look for peaceful government?</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>is Self-Rule the Answer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An investigation of the history of man’s attempts at selfgovernment reveals that human rulers almost invariably have plunged their peoples into wars of bloodshed and violence. Their major expenditures have been for building up a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">strong, well-equipped </span><span class="font2">fighting force. Seldom has there been any real peace. Nor has the twentieth century been any exception. Within the past fifty-five years human rulers have led their peoples into two horrible world wars that were more expensive, more destructive of property, and more costly in terms of human life and suffering than perhaps all other major wars in history combined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After the second world war, however, many human leaders claimed they finally had the answer to establishing permanent peace. It was a world organization called the United Nations. World leaders praised it as the only hope for a peaceful world. For example, on April 5, 1949, Dr. Herbert V. Evatt, then president of the General Assembly, said of the United Nations: &quot;Nothing else is a substitute for it; nothing else can be a substitute for it.” Influential clergymen agreed with the political leaders. '</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19681222_files/g_E_19681222-10.png" alt="" style="width:96pt;height:168pt;">
<p><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;">Are the vertical lines really straight?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">But how successful has this human peace effort been? Is the United Nations as a peace-enforcing agent an illusion— a deceptive, misleading hope for mankind? Or has it proved to be a real instrument for preserving peace and security?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An editorial in the New York </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font2"> of September 24, 1968, observed in this connection: “The General Assembly of the United Nations, once widely hailed as ‘the world’s last best hope for peace,’ opens its twenty-third annual session today in an atmosphere of diminishing hope for the world organization and for the cause of international peace and justice it was designed to promote. The ‘black and gloomy’ world outlook was noted last week by Secretary General Thant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The United Nations has not stopped major wars, such as the recent Vietnam war. Nor has it prevented the more than 300 revolutions, coups, uprisings, rebellions and insurrections world wide since the end of World War II. It was powerless in the wake of Russia’s military force moving into Czechoslovakia. It is becoming ever more evident that the United Nations is just another in man’s long, unbroken line of failures to govern himself successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those who have carefully evaluated the evidence can see the shortcomings of human self-government. Observed the prominent magazine editor David Lawrence: “The more we search for an alibi, the more we discover that unhappiness on earth is man-made. Our key weakness is that we have not solved the problem of self-government.”* And the well-known</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">• U.S. News</span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;"> cf </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World Report,</span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;"> September 25, 1967, p. 128.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">columnist Walter Lippmann said: “For us all the world is disorderly and dangerous, ungovemed and apparently ungovernable. Everywhere there is great anxiety and bewilderment.”! This agrees with the words of the inspired Bible writer: “It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.”—Jer, 10:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But if human self-rule is not the answer, what is? Will permanent peace ever be established? Happily, there is a solution. The hope for lasting peace will be realized!</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Rule by God the Answer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jesus Christ pointed to the only sure solution as being “the kingdom of God.” Yes, a government under Almighty God’s direction.’ Although some may believe that such a rule by God is only an illusion, really the illusion is the belief that humans can successfully govern themselves independently of God. Never have they been able to do so. On .the other hand, divine laws, called by some persons the laws of nature, control all the universe. Rule by God’s kingdom is the only answer to realizing permanent peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Government by God was the theme of Jesus’ entire earthly ministry, as he once explained: “Also to other cities I must declare the good news of the kingdom of God, because for this I was sent forth.” (Luke 4:43; 8:1) Jesus also taught his followers to remember that heavenly government in their prayers, saying: “You must pray, then, this way: ‘Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.’”—Matt. 6:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The realm or domain of this kingdom for which Christians pray includes the entire earth. Here, the Bible teaches, God’s will will be done everywhere. The benefits</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">t </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Newsweek,</span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;"> October 9, 1967, p. 21. </span><span class="font2">of Christ’s ransom sacrifice will be applied in behalf of all obedient humankind, so that all effects of sin and death will be erased. What a wonderful prospect! The Bible promises: “God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more. The former things have passed away.&quot;—Rev. 21:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is what Almighty God promises to accomplish by means of His kingdom. In whose promises, then, will you place your hope?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It may be true, looking at matters from a worldly viewpoint, that the United Nations and other peace efforts of men appear to be a more tangible hope. But, then, outward appearances can be very misleading, as we have seen. One needs to examine deeper and consider the evidence. And both the facts of history and God’s Word the Bible reveal that man is completely incapable of providing righteous government. Only God can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The most reliable evidence, from God’s Word, therefore shows that man’s rule must soon give way to God’s rule. In a prophecy regarding our days the Bible says: “In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin. And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite.’’—Dan. 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That this kingdom of God is real, and no illusion, is apparent from the fulfillment in our day of many Bible prophecies regarding it. Jesus Christ and his apostles pointed forward to the present unparalleled fear, violence and distress and identified these conditions as marking the “conclusion of the system of things” or “last days.” Jesus also said that at this time God’s established kingdom would be preached earth wide as the only hope for peace. (Matt. 24:3-14; Luke 21:7-31; 2 Tim. 3:1-5) This preaching is now being accomplished in 200 lands by hundreds of thousands of envoys of God’s heavenly government. Yes, the kingdom of God is a reality! And soon its power will be manifested in its destruction of all political kingdoms of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do you desire to enjoy the blessings of God’s rule? Would you delight to be a subject of God’s kingdom and serve under His guidance and direction? You would? Then you must prove this by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font2"> submitting yourself to God. This involves learning His requirements by studying his Word the Bible, and doing God’s will. (John 17:3; 1 John 2:17) Only in this way will you be able to enjoy the lasting peace that will soon be realized earth wide under God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">&quot;A </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Miracle”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“It is, quite simply, a miracle,” confessed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek</span><span class="font2"> magazine of October 25, 1965. &quot;No other word can describe the beginning of a human life. No technique can pinpoint the momentous time of conception. No scientist can tell what wondrous forces then take over to develop the organs and myriad nerve networks of a human embryo. No doctor knows what causes the contractions of labor in the mother that bring new life into the outside world. Miraculous too is the innate capacity of the human organism for survival.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Truly, the hand of the All-powerful Creator is manifest! How wise we are if we exhibit the appreciation expressed by the Bible psalmist: “I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful, as my soul is very well aware.”—Ps. 139:14.</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font2">The human brain is often likened to an electronic computer. But </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Science Digest</span><span class="font2"> of December 1967 stated: “Even the most complicated computer man has yet built can’t compare in intricacy with brain. Computer switches components number in thousands rather than in billions.

<p><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Man’s Brain Far Superior</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While a thorough understanding of just how the brain works is beyond our grasp at present, there are things about it that can be understood. One is that the human brain is far more complex than that of any animal. That is why man alone of all earthly organisms has the faculty of reason, and why only he can constantly improve upon his knowledge and ability, or upon the knowledge and ability of others. Animals are guided by instinct implanted in them and cannot continue to build on knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you did not know how to play a piano, could you expect to sit down at one for the first time and produce beautiful music? No, but with proper train-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ing and practice, you could develop this skill. Yet, no amount of training would enable any animal to do this, for they do not have such a capacity. Or if you did not know how to fly an airplane, could you expect to sit at the controls of a jet airliner for the first time and fly it? No, but with training, thousands of persons do. No animal could ever be trained to duplicate this feat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Man’s superior brain,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">then, helps to account for the gigantic gulf that exists between the abilities and accomplishments of man and those of beasts.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Development Not Automatic</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, man’s great mental capacity does not mean he develops knowledge or skills automatically. Intellectual progress is not implanted in the brain like an instinct. It must be cultivated. That is why, although man’s brain has a vast capacity for improvement, if it is not properly used, very little improvement will be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you want to acquire a certain skill, you must feed your brain with the information necessary for that particular skill. Then you must put that information to use 'by beginning to perform that skill. This establishes patterns in the brain that gradually enable you to master the skill. If knowledge is not taken in and used, then a person will not develop intellectual abilities or skills. He will remain illiterate and unskilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is a similarity between feeding the body with food and feeding the brain with information. Your physical health is largely determined by the food you eat. If your physical food is poor in nourishment, your health will suffer. Malnutrition extended over a period of time can cause death, as resistance to disease is lowered. A total lack of food will kill the body in a few months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Similarly, your mental condition largely depends upon what you feed your brain. If your mental food is poor, your mental health will suffer.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Early Training Vital</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">If</span><span class="font2"> a person’s brain has been poorly fed and poorly exercised in childhood, mental health and ability may be impaired for the rest of his life. When minds are improperly developed in youth, it becomes difficult, as an adult, to reverse the pattern that has been established. Such a person easily falls into lazy mental habits. He does not usually enjoy serious mental activity. His reading ability and reading habits are often poor, even being limited to picture magazines and comic books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first five or six years of life are critical in this regard. Patterns of thinking are fairly well established by this time. If these patterns have been good, the child will find it much easier in later life to develop abilities and skills. If these patterns have been inferior, then he may experience difficulty later on in overcoming this poor start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But is not one’s mental ability fixed at birth? Is not the capacity for intellectual development simply inherited? Inheritance does play a part, but generally the child's environment plays a greater part. In an article entitled “Never Underestimate the Mind of a Child,” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Science</span><span class="font2"> News </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Letter</span><span class="font2"> of February 22, 1964, 'stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The mind of a young child is quicker than you think it is, and can learn far more than We give it credit for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“During the early years, a child’s intelligence can be greatly influenced by a responsive'environment conducive to learning and exploring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“This contradicts the traditional idea that human intelligence is fixed in a child at birth, and that its development is predetermined by heredity. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“If a parent, teacher or mentor begins to work with a young child early enough, he can exert considerable influence over the child’s intelligence, . , . The mental processes of thinking, reasoning, and reacting become established very early in life, even before school, and become a permanent part of the individual throughout his life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In tests it was discovered that, in a favorable environment, a child in his first four years of life is able to increase his IQ (intelligence quotient) much faster than in later childhood. Also, the report said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Many preschool children have been unfortunately ignored, . . . Latest experiments prove that three-year-old children, who already are performing the rather difficult mental operations of listening and talking, can learn to read and write, tell a story to a tape recorder and type it out as it is played back.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hence, when parents feel it is not necessary to teach their children such things as reading or writing until they go to school, they make a mistake. Precious opportunity has been lost, for by the time the child enters school his mental habits have been formed to a striking degree. The less the mind is used in early years, the less it is able to overcome the poor start later on. One report in the Scottish </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express</span><span class="font2"> of March 29, 1962, even said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;The more that scientists learn about the intricate structure of the human brain the more it seems likely that people in general are endowed at birth with the same basic mental equipment.. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;What makes us different in intellectual ability and achievement is the extent to which we use this magnificent apparatus.&quot;</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>The Brain's Structure</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The way the brain is constructed helps us to understand why it is difficult for older persons to develop mental abilities if they have not been doing so earlier in life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ordinarily, most body cells divide to form new cells. This process replaces cells that have been injured or that have died. For example, a person may get sunburned and a layer of skin peels off. In time, it is replaced by another layer of skin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, this process of cell replacement does not hold true in the case of the key brain cell, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">neuron,</span><span class="font2"> or nerve cell. The neurons take in information from the various senses, such as those of sight, gearing and feeling. They send out instructions to various parts of the body through the spinal cord. Most neurons are already formed at birth, some being added during the first few years of childhood. But then, no new neurons are formed. As a person ages, some may be damaged or may die, but no new ones replace them. The fact that the brain grows from about one pound at birth to about three pounds in adulthood is not because so many new neurons are added, but because each increases in size, as do other parts of the brain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The human brain is said to contain over 10,000,000,000 (ten billion) neurons that are located in the outer portion, or “bark*<sup>1 </sup>of the brain. This outer portion is called the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cortex,</span><span class="font2"> or “gray matter.” And to allow the brain to have an abundance of these vital neurons, the thin cortex is folded somewhat like an accordion, permitting far more surface area. That is why, if the brain were to be stretched out fiat, it would occupy an area of several square feet!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to neurons, the brain contains about 100,000,000,000 (100 billion) smaller cells, called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">glial</span><span class="font2"> cells. These make up a supporting framework for the neurons. The brain also contains a network of very small blood vessels that take nourishment to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The neurons, the vital brain cells, are awe inspiring indeed. Each one of them consists of a cell body that is in itself fantastically complex. And each neuron has a maze of hairlike fibers extending from it, perhaps 25,000 to 50,000 of them. These microscopic extensions, called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dendrites,</span><span class="font2"> come close to the dendrites of other neurons. But they do not quite touch. A tiny gap remains between them. This gap, or space, is called a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">synapse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What happens when a neuron, a nerve cell, is activated? </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Science News</span><span class="font2"> of December 2, 1967, states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;When the nerve fires, tiny amounts of chemical transmitters at the synapse or meeting of nerve cells are released to carry an impulse across the junction. These same chemicals have been deeply implicated in emotional behavior.. ..</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Some of [researchers’] work suggests that the spaces between the neurons have electrical and chemical properties that are highly relevant to memory storage.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is thought that the thousands of nearconnections each neuron has with other neurons is what enables the brain to interpret signals from the senses, compare them with information already stored, judge their values, and then plan what action to take. The capacity of one brain can be seen in the fact that there are over 10,000,000,000 neurons, each having tens of thousands of near-connections with other neurons!</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Establishing Patterns</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How does this complex mechanism work to establish the mental patterns that distinguish one person from another in memory, ability and personality?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While it is not certain just how the neurons and their dendrites set themselves in established patterns, some possible explanations have been offered. One such is reported on by the New York </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Times Magazine</span><span class="font2"> of October 9, 1966:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A neuron, when stimulated, is capable of transmitting a tiny electric current along its surface and down its various projections [dendrites]. Ordinarily the current might stop at a synapse [the gap between dendrites], but under certain conditions the chemical environment at the synapse changes in such a fashion as to allow the current to jump the gap and pass to another cell... .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Suppose, then, that with every sensation you receive, a particular group of synapses is somehow affected in such a way as to make passage of the nerve current easier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Suppose, in addition, that the group of synapses is so arranged that the current flows from one cell to another to another and finally back to the original cell, forming a closed cycle. The current will keep going over and over that cycle for a period of time, like a racer lapping a track. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;As long as-the body can somehow sense a particular current cycle and select it from all others, it can remember the sensation that set it up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“With time, however, the effect on the synapses might wear off, the current cycle fade away, and the memory be gone. It would have been a short-term memory.” This may help explain why some things can be completely forgotten. They have not been impressed on the brain enough. They have not made firmly routed circuits or patterns in the brain cells. But what if certain impressions are more frequently or more strongly impressed on the brain? Then what? The article explains:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“But each time that the current cycle was somehow sensed and the memory recalled, it might be that the change in the synapses was intensified, so that the current became stronger. Eventually, even the physical structure of the cells might be changed; more dendrites might form between the adjoining cells making up the cycle, easing the way for the current. Eventually, the current might be so firmly set that it would continue indefinitely without additional reactivation. The memory then would have become long-term.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Naturally, the longer a Current cycle had been in existence, the more firmly it would have had a chance to set. For many of us, it is considerably easier to remember items learned as youngsters than other items learned last year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So there is evidence in the very structure of the brain that the longer certain information reaches the brain, the deeper the brain circuits are set. Eventually they become part of that person. What he has fed his brain is what he becomes.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Intake Leads to Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some persons think they can take anything into the brain and will not be affected by it. But everything taken in makes an impression. The more a certain type of information is fed into the brain, the deeper the impression. If it is negative, bad, immoral information, then in time the brain circuits may be so firmly routed in this direction that a person will begin engaging in bad actions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That this process of taking in wrong information, dwelling upon it, and feeding more and more of it into the brain is &quot;the basis of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">wrong actions is also noted in the </span><span class="font2">Bible, At James, chapter 1, verses 14 and 15, we read: “Each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That a person’s attitudes and actions can be changed by what he feeds his brain was also noted in a Columbia Broadcasting System program entitled “Building the Brain.” A scientist stated: “The effects of learning and experience don’t just pass over without leaving a trace. The brain is actually transformed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Once the brain is transformed by wrong feeding, and bad habits are established, a person does not just throw off the brain cells in the bad pattern and start fresh with new cells, for the neurons are not replaced. So when bad mental habits are established and maintained, they become more indelibly imprinted. Only by changing one’s intake of information can a person undo the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">damage and in time form </span><span class="font2">new, healthier patterns that lead to good habits. Yes, you can “be transformed by making your mind over.”—Rom. 12:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But if one persists in feeding his brain mental rubbish, it will in time be transformed into a rubbish heap. His expressions, his way of life, his personality, will reflect this. And when such information is fed into young minds, the effect can be devastating. Of this the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Psychology</span><span class="font2"> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mental Health</span><span class="font2"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Fredric Wertham, psychiatrist and men-tai hygienist, as well as consultant in medico-legal cases, published the result of his sevhn-year investigation of the influence of crime comics on the child under the title. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Seduction of the Innocent.</span><span class="font2"> Noting that 90,-000,000 comic strips and books are read each month by children, this investigator views their present scope as stimulating unwholesome fantasies, suggesting criminal or abnormal ideas, giving models for criminal or delinquent behavior, and in general as creating an atmosphere of cruelty, sadism, sexual perversion, and deceit.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Science News Letter</span><span class="font2"> of January 18, 1964, said: “Seeing aggressive episodes on TV arouses aggressive feelings in children, who carry out the same action if faced with similar conditions later.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Watch What You Feed Your Brain</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cannot escape the troth of this</span><span class="font2"> matter. We will become what we feed our brains. Hence, the need to guard carefully the kind of information we allow our minds to dwell upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While we cannot escape negative influences altogether, since the world is so filled with them, still we do not have to seek out harmful information deliberately and regularly absorb it. If a person dwells on wrong information, he allows himself to become susceptible to the full impact of its influence, however warped it may be. For example, a person may know that fornication and adultery are wrong, but if he </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">willingly feeds his mind immoral </span><span class="font2">thoughts, reading immoral literature, attending those types of movies, watching such programs on television, or loitering around immoral people, he will eventually get involved in immoral acts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Likewise, no matter how good one’s parents are, if a child deliberately seeks out the association of others who downgrade their own parents, who encourage disobedience, who question parental motives, then this child will soon become suspicious of his parents and think ill of them. Because he welcomes the ideas of such persons he will continue to dwell on them, and in that way his own outlook will be </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the other hand, if a youth simply has necessary contact with wayward persons, that is, when attending school, but does not seek out their association, then he will not be deeply influenced by their bad attitudes. He will not become suspicious or rebellious toward his- parents because of what other youths have to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The same principle operates in connection with a person’s contacts at his secular employment. He should be polite, tactful and cooperative with workmates, but he does not have to seek out their negative ideas. He does not have to allow himself to dwell upon them or absorb them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Likewise, a person may be fully convinced that the Bible is God’s Word. But if he deliberately chooses to keep company with individuals who belittle the Bible and who falsely impugn the motives of God, then this person too will gradually begin to share that outlook. But this is not necessarily true simply because at secular work one is required to be in the company of faithless persons. If he rejects their ideas instead of showing curiosity and dwelling on them, his mental pattern will not be adversely affected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do not delude yourself about this. You should not think yourself above being affected by poisonous thinking. Even the grossest falsehood can be accepted if a person allows his mind to dwell upon it long enough. That is why Nazism became acceptable to millions of persons, why even ‘decent' citizens ended up committing the most heinous crimes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">On the other hand, when wholesome information is fed to the brain through the senses, then circuits or patterns will be built up that will enable an individual to do what is right. The more he takes in right knowledge and dwells upon it, the more his behavior will reflect this. And the earlier in life this right kind of training begins, the more likely it is that the child will grow up to be a decent, Godfearing adult. The Bible says: “Train up a boy according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it.”—Prov. 22: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is evidence that the building of good mental patterns even improves the brain structure! In dozens of experiments with animals it was discovered that good training involving the use of their brains significantly altered their brain structure and chemistry for the good. The cortex was found to be expanded, deeper and heavier. The neurons increased in size, as did the diameters of the blood vessels supplying the cortex. There was also an increase of glial cells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, those animals deliberately denied proper training had brains that were relatively deteriorated, with a thin and light cortex, lowered blood supply and diminished chemical activity. Their neurons were smaller and they had fewer glial cells. Of this the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Review </span><span class="font2">of January 20, 1968, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“A lack of adequate educational fare for the young animal—no matter how large the food supply or how good the family —and a lack of adequate psychological enrichment results in palpable, measurable, deteriorative changes in the brain chemistry and anatomy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While these experiments were not conducted on humans, there is reason to believe that a similar process takes place in the human brain. That is why author E. Hunter said in his book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Brainwashing: </span><span class="font2">&quot;Insofar as a human being allowed the divine traits in him to be overcome and his reasoning power—his judgment and free will—to be atrophied, he could be made into a demon, a puppet, a sick man psychologically, just as sick as an athlete who has allowed his body to be run down by dissipation until he easily contracts some crippling disease.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yes, the human brain is a marvelous instrument. But you will get out of it only what you put into it. So be careful what you feed it Remember, you are what you feed your brain.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">many hundreds of different home remedies that people have found helpful. But, whatever remedy you may use, it is not likely that your hiccups will last for very long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, there have been cases in which hiccuping has continued for several months and even years. In some instances the spasms were so rapid that eating and sleeping were impossible, and the patients died from exhaustion. Uninterrupted hiccuping took the life of J. McCormick Beeten within the space of only four and a half days. Another man, Edward O’Connor, died after hiccuping for six months. Fortunately, hiccuping does not usually become such a serious problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hiccuping often begins when the stomach is distended suddenly from overeating or overdrinking of liquids, causing the stomach to disturb the action of the diaphragm. This is a broad, flat muscle that stretches like a sheet between your chest and abdomen and is the principal muscle for breathing. Any irritation of this muscle or the nerve that operates it can cause it to contract involuntarily. This results in an abrupt intake of air into the lungs, but there is also an involuntary closing of the opening in the larynx, called the glottis, which cuts off the flow of air. The result is the audible “hie.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Overeating and overdrinking are only two of many possible causes for hiccuping. It can be started by gulping hot or cold liquids, by fatigue, by postoperative shock as well as by various diseases. Even emotional stress, nervous strain and drugs can cause it. One man became afflicted with chronic hiccups whenever he was given sulfonamide drugs for a bladder infection. When they were discontinued, the hiccups improved immediately and stopped entirely a few days later. Thus, with so many possible causes, it is often difficult to locate the reason for a chronic case of hiccups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When hiccups begin during an operation or after an operation they can be especially troublesome. Imagine how dif-flcult they could make the work of a surgeon during a delicate operation. And if they come after the operation they might rip open the incision.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Remedies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are a great number of simple remedies that people have found effective in stopping hiccups. Taking several deep, regular breaths works for some persons. Others stop them by merely holding their breath for a bit and perhaps drinking some water while doing so.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19681222_files/g_E_19681222-12.png" alt="" style="width:209pt;height:149pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Breathing into a paper bag often works because it causes a person to rebreathe the carbon dioxide expelled, from his lungs. Cutting down on the amount of oxygen in the bloodstream by breathing carbon dioxide tends to relax the nerves and muscles. There is a danger, however, of fainting from lack of oxygen. Under the supervision of a physician a mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen is usually used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The juice of an orange is claimed by some to be a good remedy, and in bad cases of hiccups teaspoonful doses of onion juice ate supposed to be a good remedy. Other home remedies are coughing, sneezing, swallowing crushed ice, taking vinegar, pulling the tongue, pressing the upper lip with the finger, and so forth. There are about 300 basic “cures.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A new technique that has proved very successful for doctors to use on patients, whether they are conscious or unconscious, is stimulation of that part of the throat called the pharynx. This is done by inserting a catheter through the nose or through the mouth. This is a tubular instrument that is designed to pass along mucous canals in the body. When the technique was used on 150 anesthetized and conscious patients over a space of two years, it stopped hiccups in 148 of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In severe cases that refuse to respond to the usual forms of treatment a drug can be used to block the phrenic nerve that is being irritated. This stops the hic-cuping, and when the nerve recovers from the effects of the drug and begins functioning again several hours later, there is a good chance that the hiccups will not return. If they do, a doctor may recommend crushing the nerve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This drastic step finally brought relief to a woman who had tried numerous home remedies and had visited 100 doctors, all for about two years. During that time she sometimes hiccuped at the rate of ninety times a minute. As might be expected, she lost weight—forty pounds. When the nerve was crushed, the hiccuping immediately stopped. Crushing the nerve caused her to lose 25 percent of her breathing capacity, but her doctor expected the nerve to regenerate in eight to twelve months and to begin functioning again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For some people hiccuping may become very trying, but for the majority it lasts for only five or ten minutes. If your customary remedy should fail, there are many others you can try. One will very likely stop that annoying hiccup.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">OW deadly winter cold can be was demonstrated in 1966 when the worst blizzard in many years lashed a 1,500-mile by 500-mile area in the central United States. In some places wind velocity reached 98 miles per hour and the temperature dropped to 31° F. below zero. Among the 210 deaths from the storm was a six-year-old girl who got lost between the chicken coop on her family’s farm and the bam. Being unable to find the shelter so near at hand, she froze to death. What happened to her is a warning to anyone who might be caught in a blizzard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A hunter, for example, who tries to hike back to his cabin during a blizzard is very likely to lose his life as she did. The same might be said for a stalled motorist who tries to walk through a blizzard to the nearest town or farmhouse. Such persons need' to realize that it is practically impossible to walk in a straight line for even fifty feet in a blizzard, much less to endure for long the full force of the heatsapping wind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A few years ago three hunters were caught in a canyon by an unexpected mountain snowstorm. Unwisely two of them tried to hike out of the mountains despite the blinding snow and freezing wind. They soon lost their way and were found frozen to death by a search party several days later. But the third hunter, who stayed where he was in a sheltered spot, was found the next day in good condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another hunter caught out in a different storm crawled under the low-hanging limbs of a fir tree and reinforced his shelter by cutting some branches and putting them on the windward side. A small fire that he carefully banked with earth so it would not ignite the tree helped to keep him warm. Realizing that there was almost no chance of making it back to camp through the storm, he waited until it abated the next day. Seeking shelter in this manner during a storm and waiting until it stops is usually the best way to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This was w'hat three mountain climbers who were</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">snow packed on top. Although the storm raged for five days with winds reaching sixty miles per hour, they survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the 1966 blizzard several stranded motorists survived satisfactorily by staying with their cars. A family of three was stalled only two miles from their South Dakota ranch, but</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font2">they wisely stayed in their car for sixty hours until the storm</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">let up enough for them finally to make their way home.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Shelters</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In an emergency situation finding shelter from the cold wind is of the utmost importance. It can quickly draw off a person’s body heat and exhaust him in a short while. To illustrate the difference that wind can make, suppose you are outdoors when the temperature is 34° F., but the wind is blowing at the rate of twenty miles per hour. The effect on your exposed flesh would be the same as if the temperature </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">were</span><span class="font2"> 38° F. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">below</span><span class="font2"> zero with no wind. Having this in mind, you can better understand why it is dangerous to try to walk very far in the fierce wind of a blizzard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A good shelter, in such a situation, is a snow hole. This can be dug around the trunk of a tree or out in the open. Branches or any other available material can be put over the hole to support an insulating layer of snow. In some instances a cave might be dug into a snowbank or into a mound of snow that covers some bushes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Because snow has an insulating quality due to the many air spaces in it, a person in a snow hole can keep his body heat from escaping too rapidly. It is possible for the temperature in the hole to become 18° F. higher than outside the hole. While there, he is protected from the killing wind of the blizzard. Some leafy branches on the bottom can provide a comfortable place to recline. Here he can survive the storm in comparative comfort, just like a rabbit that burrows into snow-covered bushes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In certain circumstances it might be best to make an igloo out of blocks of snow. Ice will not do, as it conducts heat. An igloo can be warmer than a snow hole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A small opening at the top is necessary for ventilation, especially if a small fire is built in the shelter; otherwise there is the danger of carbon-monoxide poisoning. This is an exceptionally fine shelter for warmth and wind protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Building a shelter is one of the first things a person will want to do when he realizes that he is in a dangerous situation because of winter cold. If he is stranded in an automobile by a blizzard he may find a snow hole or an igloo warmer to stay in than his automobile because the car’s metal body can conduct heat away instead of keeping it in. It is for the same reason that the fuselage of a downed airplane is not as warm as a shelter dug in the snow. Preserving body heat in winter cold is the principal objective whether a person is stranded by a blizzard, is a survivor of a plane accident in a snow-covered wilderness or is just out of doors near his home.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Clothing</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In cold winters suitable clothing is essential, and if a person plans an automobile trip at that time of year, he will show good judgment if he takes along extra clothing and boots in case of emergency. They could save his life if he happens to be stranded in a storm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is not necessary to have clothing that is heavy in order to be warm. Not weight but the dead air that clothing is able to hold is what makes it warm. Being a poor conductor of heat, dead air acts as an insulator and helps to prevent a person’s body heat from being lost. For this reason several layers of lightweight clothing made of material that is good for keeping body heat in are better than a single garment of heavy weight. Warmth comes from trapping dead air between the layers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A goad </span><span class="font2">start for winter is warm underwear. A fine type is that which is designed to capture dead air in the deep depressions of a waffle knit. Manufacturers usually call this “thermal” underwear. Another type is made of Brynje mesh, which traps dead air next to the skin. It has a fishnet design and resembles the mesh fabric used in certain net hosiery. Because dead air is trapped by it between a person’s skin and the next layer of clothing, some persons regard it as being superior in warmth to waffle knits. Additional insulation comes from the dead air trapped between the layers of clothing put on top of the underwear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An inactive person requires more layers of clothing to keep warm than does a person who is active. If, for example, the thermometer is at zero degrees F., an inactive man could require more than seven layers of clothes, whereas an active man who is walking briskly and carrying a load would be comfortable with two layers. In fact, a person who is walking briskly can produce four times as much heat by the exercise as a person who is inactive. From this can be seen the importance of exercise in helping a person to keep warm, but care must necessarily be taken to avoid becoming overheated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When a person begins to engage in vigorous activity he can remove a few layers of clothing so he will not perspire, and when he is finished he can put them on again. The danger from becoming overheated is due to perspiration. Moisture is a good heat conductor, and it spoils the insulating ability of clothing. Evaporation of the perspiration after a person has ceased to be active and the dampness of the clothing draw away his body heat, chilling him and making him subject to cold injury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A good policy to follow is to keep yourself a little on the cool side whether you are active or inactive. That will avoid the problems created by overheating. This can be done by adjusting your layers of clothing. It may be that just loosening them will be sufficient or some may have to be removed temporarily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some type of head covering is also very necessary in cold weather, as the head is the chief source of heat loss in the body. There can be no reduction of the blood supply to the brain when the body is cold as in the case of the skin, feet and hands. At a temperature of minus 40° F. all the heat an inactive person produces can be lost through his head if it is not covered. So keeping your head covered is an important factor in preserving body heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is not easy to remain warm if the dead air between your layers of clothing is being squeezed out through various openings as you walk. Trouser legs as well as the sleeves, waist and neck of a jacket can allow a lot to escape and let cold air in. By tying the trouser legs closed and closing the waist, sleeves and neck of a jacket there will be a marked improvement in warmth. Cuffs can be sewn on the sleeves to close them around the wrist if there are none, and a warm scarf will help to keep your neck warm and close that part of your jacket. If you become too warm you can loosen the waist of the jacket and open the neck so as to allow air to pass under the jacket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When selecting winter clothing it is better to avoid tight-fitting garments that may reduce blood circulation and be lacking in space for a layer of dead air. There is more warmth in loose-fitting garments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What about your outer coat? It needs to be a good windbreaker. A fabric with a tight weave is better for this than one with a loose weave. It also should be water resistant. When such a fabric is used in a coat that has a lining of acrylic pile or plastic foam, both of which have insulating air spaces, you have a very warm coat.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Keeping Hands and Feet Warm</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Due to the great amount of surface area on your fingers and toes in relation to their size, they can readily lose heat. By keeping them warm and the blood circulating well in them, serious damage to the tissues from cold injuries can be avoided. Tight-fitting gloves and shoes can make them subject to injury by cutting down the blood supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In very cold weather, mittens are better for the hands than gloves. They combine the fingers into a larger space, making the insulating property of the mittens more effective than gloves. They also expose less surface area to the cold than do gloves and therefore lose less heat. Their length should be sufficient sb that no part of your arm between the mittens and your coat sleeve is left exposed to the cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Keeping your feet warm is just as important as maintaining warm hands and just as difficult. More than one layer of socks is helpful, but the number you use will depend upon the roominess of your shoes. If they make the shoes too tight, fewer socks will have to be used so you will have room foi- moving your toes. Winter shoes and boots should fit loosely for good circulation and warm feet. But you cannot keep your feet warm if they get wet. If that happens, your shoes and socks must be dried out as soon as possible to prevent cold injury.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Frostbite</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The parts of your body that are the most susceptible to frostbite are your feet, hands, ears, nose and cheeks. Usually the first symptoms of it are rather mild, perhaps just a prickly feeling, and then numbness sets in, with the affected parts turning white or gray. In very cold weather companions must watch each other for signs of frostbite, because it can creep up on a person without his knowing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Unless the affected parts are warmed up soon, serious damage can be done. Frostbitten feet, for example, can swell into painful, shapeless lumps of flesh. In very severe cases the tissues may rot away and gangrene set in because of the blood supply being cut off, and that usually requires amputation. Persons with less severe cases may find after their recovery that the affected parts will be, thereafter, very sensitive to cold and to frostbite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Exercising a frostbitten limb or massaging it is a grave mistake. The same can be said of rubbing it with snow or ice water. Such treatment can damage the frozen tissues. The time to massage or exercise a cold portion of your body to increase circulation is before it is injured by the cold, not afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What needs to be done in case of frostbite is to treat the injured part with gentleness, warming it in lukewarm water at body temperature or with warm, wet towels. If warm water is not available, warm blankets may be used. In an emergency the affected part can be put in a warm armpit, either one’s own or that of a companion. At the first opportunity it should be examined by a physician.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every year in the United States approximately 200 people lose their lives because of cold weather and thousands of others suffer from various degrees of frostbite. This is usually avoidable. By knowing how to cope with winter cold a person can live with it comfortably under all kinds of situations and at the same time avoid becoming one of its many casualties.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Catuufa</span></h6>
<p><span class="font3">I</span><span class="font2">T WOULD have been impossible twenty years ago. Yet this year a twelveman Catholic School Commission unanimously approved the application of Jehovah’s witnesses to hold a religious convention in a Catholic school. Whereas fifteen years ago it would have been rare, today Jehovah’s witnesses in Quebec call on the homes of people and speak of the Bible without police interference, threat of imprisonment or priest-inspired mob action. Yesterday it would have been unheard of. Yet now Catholic priests speak out freely and critically of their church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Perhaps nowhere in the world can the loss of prestige and influence of the Roman Catholic Church be felt more than in Canada’s Quebec province, a stronghold of Catholicism for more than 200 years. No group is more aware of the change than Jehovah’s witnesses, who for many years endured the combined assault of Church and State.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Yesterday: Bigotry and Ignorance</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you had accompanied one of Jehovah’s witnesses in his door-to-door ministry in Quebec twenty years ago, even fifteen years ago, how many doors do you think would have been opened to you? What do you think the response was in places where the local cure (priest) unceasingly condemned Jehovah’s witnesses from the pulpit?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Typical was the experience of one missionary in Quebec city in 1953. As he approached each door he could hear the latch being set behind it. After three hours of work only two doors had been opened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In one city, Saint Hyacinthe, Quebec, four conscientious missionaries worked for a whole year without being able to conduct one Bible study. As they would walk down the street, people would actually stop, point and stare at them as if they were strange apparitions from another planet. Eventually a few listened, studied the Bible and began to associate with the missionaries, and a small congregation was formed. However, so strong was religious opposition that many lost their jobs and had to .move to Ontario to support their families. Later, in the same area, a small religious convention was interrupted by mob action and had to be discontinued and moved to Montreal for peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every false accusation made against Jehovah's witnesses in those days was believed by the people. What the priest said was law. People generally did not think for themselves. That was the way of Quebec province. There is no argument with the facts; the church kept the people in ignorance and the province from progress for decades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As in other Catholic lands, birth control was prohibited and large families were the rule. Children thus were forced to leave school before completing their education in order to help support their brothers and sisters. In 1940 one woman, now one of Jehovah's witnesses, told her priest that she thought nine children were enough. She was refused absolution and was told that she would go into hellfire, so she had twelve children.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Today: A Disturbed People</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But that was yesterday, when Quebec was asleep. Now she is awakening, stretching, catching up with the rest of the country, the rest of the world. Television, education, travel, modern communications and high-paying jobs have produced a more affluent society in Quebec. Today many of Zes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Quebecois</span><span class="font2"> think for themselves, an estimated 15 percent even wanting to separate from the rest of the country and govern themselves. No longer are there so many religious bigots; in fact, today many are openly disturbed about their religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If you were to accompany a minister of Jehovah’s witnesses in his door-to-door ministry in Quebec today you would frequently hear complaints against the church. To the question, “How do you feel about changes taking place in the Catholic church in Quebec?&quot; one concerned older woman replied: “I don’t know. Maybe you can tell me. What are they going to do with all those people sent to hell for eating meat on Friday?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another woman gave the common reply: “Nothing is the same; they have taken down the statues; even the Virgin Mary had to go from our church. The only thing we have left is the confessional, and now they put you through so fast you hardly know you have been confessed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many Catholics in Quebec are disturbed as their former sacred relics leave their niches and places of veneration in the church. One enterprising individual in the province has made a good business out of buying up the obsolete objects and reselling them as antiques. Concerning his activities one newspaper reported: “Recommendations were made that churches were to do away with all ‘visible’ signs of wealth which have become objects of worship as well as objects of protest by the poor. Directives have been sent to all dioceses to encourage the cures to take out of their churches all these charms, knights, sanctuary lamps, chandeliers, lamp stands, images, statues, chalices, etc., in short, all that can be found in the church that glitters such as gold.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The use these relics are put to was explained by the businessman who originated the idea of selling them as antiques: “Rich people pay us a good price for chalices in which they drink wine. They have also bought from us the gobletshaped vessels which contained the eucharistic bread. These make nice candy dishes or glasses of quality. They haven’t as yet found a common use for the crucifixes, altars or tabernacles. However, candlesticks, lamp stands, etc., are easily converted into lamps. ...&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are other reasons why sincere Catholic people in the Pvovmee o£ Quebec are disturbed. Some are grieved by the modernization of church buildings. Others are disillusioned and perplexed by the current teaching of evolution by some priests. But perhaps what is even more disturbing are statements such as the one by a priest in Duvernay, near Montreal, who said to his parishioners: “No longer will I teach purgatory or hell-fire, because neither of them exist, they have never existed, it has always been a lie.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Current </span><span class="font2">efforts by some priests to interest young people in the church, through </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Go-Go </span><span class="font2">bands and guitars instead of organs, stimulate a brief interest but not a lasting one. Older persons are unimpressed by these gimmicks; many have even ceased attending church because of them.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Church Loses Influence</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It used to be that in most communities the chief of police, the mayor or the town council would not make a move without the priest’s blessing. No facet of a Catholic’s life was private from the church, from the marriage bed to one's financial means. The church in Quebec even had its own bank, known as ‘La Caisse Populaire.’ Whether a family worshiped, worked or played, the church controlled their lives. Some prominent French firms in Montreal even went so far as to place signs in their personnel offices, ‘Only French Catholics need apply.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But this has all changed. No longer does the Catholic church speak ^and the masses listen. No longer can she permeate the lives and activity of her people. No longer is she obeyed without question. More people are leaving the church in Quebec today than ever before; many of the churches are nearly empty for mass. One woman who went to her priest to find out what could be done about her husband who was studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses was told: “The trouble is that no one is attending mass anymore. They are all leaving the church and becoming atheists or Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Even the leaders of the Catholic church in Quebec are becoming disillusioned or discouraged. In November of 1967, Paul-Emile Cardinal Leger, the Archbishop of Montreal for seventeen years, resigned his position. In a published statement on his resignation he said: “The collapse of faith among young people, the indifference of a great number of Christians towards the church, the disenchantment and disaffection, not to mention the aggressiveness of certain classes of society when presented with the religious problem, are all aspects of our Christianity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then, comparing his religion with a ship in a storm, he said: “Some may ask, and with reason, why I am leaving the ship ’ at the moment when the storm is breaking. Yet in the final analysis, it is just this religious crisis which has led me to give up the position of command to become a simple missionary priest.” Observers might say: ‘He is wise to give up command of the ship before it sinks.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Also noteworthy is the inability of priests to influence politicians as they once did. Thus, a priest in Montreal recently abandoned his ‘collar’ to enter federal politics for the district of Laurier, explaining: “If I’m elected to Parliament then perhaps I’ll be heard and be able to prod the government into action.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The field of education in Quebec has always felt the heavy influence of the Catholic church, but here, too, she is losing her hold. This year, foi’ the first time, youths have freedom to choose whether to take religious instruction that was formerly compulsory. It is felt that the lower grades will soon follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Priests themselves are contributing to the church’s loss of influence by graphically describing the divided, impoverished condition of Catholicism. This was done in the book by three priests </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">L’Eglise S'en Va Chez Le Diable {The Church Is Going to the Devil),</span><span class="font2"> which was recently published in the French language in Quebec. The priests’ advice to Catholics and highlights of their book appeared as frontpage headlines. According to the Frenchlanguage newspaper, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Patrie,</span><span class="font2"> issue of April 7, 1968, the priests said: “ ‘If the •mass a. Ywrfien iCTrft go.’ ‘Beware oi. the worship of Saints.’ ‘The Clerical Empire Leads to the Ghetto.’ ‘The Priest Has No Right to Meddle in Matters of Love (Marriage Bed).’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How apparent it is that the Catholic church today no longer exercises the influence it once did! Her power has rapidly diminished. What effect has this had?</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Liberty for Minorities Realized</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1959 the premier of the province, Paul Sauve, “praised the centuries-old collaboration between Church and State in Quebec and termed it a symbol of liberty.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Montreal Star,</span><span class="font2"> October 8, 1959) But liberty for whom? Certainly it was not liberty for religious minorities such as Jehovah’s witnesses!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For years Maurice Duplessis ruled the religio-political province of Quebec with an iron hand. With the backing of the Catholic clergy, he sought to end the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses, even it this meant the sacrifice of everyone’s personal liberty. When endeavoring to push through legislation to stop the preaching of Jehovah’s witnesses, Duplessis said: “Those who try to' develop and thrive, thanks to the tolerance of the existing laws, will have to learn that these laws will be amended, the Government cooperating with all other authorities, to put an end to their activities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In his hook, The , YjeAte W’shette of Montreal, a famous Canadian journalist, called the premier’s activities against Jehovah’s witnesses “a continuing war,” a war without mercy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While Duplessis ruled the province as a religio-political state it was not uncommon to hear of the arrest of scores of Witnesses, charged with illegally distributing pamphlets, or, more seriously, seditious conspiracy. Following the example of their premier and attorney general, other credulous officials attacked the Witnesses. Often they were egged on by the Catholic clergy. In fact, misrepresentation by the clergy was the principal reason why Jehovah’s witnesses suffered persecution. At one point in 1946 some 1,000 Witnesses were awaiting trial in Quebec!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But now the political climate in Quebec has changed. The influence of the church on politics, while still existing in rural districts, is absent in the urban centers of the. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sesws. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vrn'u u’yrrani-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ic politicians are aloof from servitude to the church. No longer are they dependent on the church for votes. Therefore, what was common in the courts and on the streets of yesterday would not happen today. An observer talking to one of Jehovah’s witnesses said: “What has happened to you people? Aren’t you in trouble anymore?”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>A Marvelous Change</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of Jehovah’s witnesses who came to Quebec in 1946 from the neighboring Province of Ontario to join about 350 active Witnesses in the City of Montreal tells of her first experience: “The day I arrived in Quebec I decided to stand on the street corner and offer the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> magazine to passersby for the first time in my life. After a few minutes a man came along. ‘How much?’ he asked. A contribution of five cents, I replied. ‘Were Vs -my ’oadge. i'm a polled officer. You are under arrest.’ I cannot remember how many times I was arrested after that, but it seems I was spending more time going to and from police stations and appearing before judges than I was in my ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Today, in describing her ministry, which she still engages in full time, she said: “We have no trouble with the police now. They stand right beside us on the street corner. We talk to them and they ask us how our work is going. We even place magazines with them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At Chateauguay Basin, across the river from Montreal, in 1945, a large mob, held partially in check by police, harassed and chased one Witness and his young son from the area. Today in this same suburb there are two large congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses, enjoying peace and excellent results in their ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1935 there were only ten of Jehovah’s witnesses meeting together for Bible study in the French language in Montreal, and a few others scattered throughout .the province. A presiding overseer of one of the thirty-five congregations in the city today recalls that they met in an upstairs room where they studied the French issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> together. Today, thirty-three years later, there are more than 2,000 active ministers in the Montreal area and about 3,500 in the province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In recent years the people of the province have come to know, respect and admire Jehovah’s witnesses. For their conventions they have used both Protestant and Catholic schools, stadiums, arenas, Montreal’s famed Forum and even a city hall. The clergy today seldom speak against Jehovah’s witnesses as they once did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Recently a woman subscribed for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Awake.'</span><span class="font2"> magazines from one of Jehovah’s witnesses who called at her door. A discerning neighbor from across the street paid her a visit immediately afterwards and, upon finding out what she had done, said: “We Catholics aren’t allowed to read those magazines. We shouldn’t even talk to those people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Oh, I don’t think that is the case now,” the woman replied. Together they agreed to phone the bishop and ask him about the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He replied: “Why, of course you can read those magazines; in fact, you should. Some of our Bible discussions are based on their magazines. If you read their magazines you will know how they think and what they believe and next time they call around you will be able to have a discussion with them.” On the next visit of the Witness, the woman asked for a, Bible study to be conducted with her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yesterday the populace was uninformed and unquestioning. Today, through continual preaching despite opposition, the people know and have long since accepted the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses are here to stay. As one modern put it: “They are a part of the scene.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Recently sixty-eight young, full-time ministers of Jehovah’s witnesses have been trained in the French language at specially prepared classes in Montreal and are now busy in the preaching work in smaller cities throughout the province. \ From all parts of Canada families are pulling up roots and moving to Quebec, learning the French language and sharing with the people of Quebec the sure hope for the future of which the Bible speaks. The tremendous change in Quebec makes this activity possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">THE LARGEST STAR</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In our galaxy Antares is the largest known star, being 330 times bigger in diameter than our sun.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>THOSE TROUBLESOME BARNACLES</span></h6>
<p><span class="font2">(HERE is a small creature that is only [about a half inch in diameter while swim-I ming as a larva but it costs ship and boat owners hundreds of millions of dollars every year. That is the unpleasant record of the lowly barnacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In a period of from six to eight months these tiny creatures can increase the weight of a ship by more than one hundred tons and cause it to use 50 percent more fuel. How do they do it? By sheer numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The barnacle larva swims about the ocean until it reaches the preadult stage, at which time it seeks a firm surface to which it can fasten itself. When it locates the hull of a ship, a rock, a wharf pile, a turtle or even a whale, it will fasten itself to that surface with a gluelike substance that fixes the barnacle permanently in place. It now goes through a metamorphosis into adulthood and forms a hard shell that also becomes securely fastened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The shell is like a small box with a lid that can be closed for protection. When it is open the barnacle extends feathery appendages with which it sweeps in minute sea creatures for food. If it happens to be on a rock that is exposed when the tide goes out, it will close the lid of its box and await the return of the tide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A British zoologist made an estimate that barnacles on the Isle of Man produce 1,000,000,000,000 young every year tor every half mile of coastline. But not all of them live to become mature barnacles. Only about 1 to 10 percent of the eggs released into the water and that hatch into larvae produce adult barnacles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What makes them such a nuisance for a ship is that they collect on the hull in a continually growing mass as new barnacles fasten themselves on top of older ones. In the space of six to eight months a ship can acquire a coating of them that is from two to three inches thick. Because they prevent the water from sliding smoothly along the hull of the vessel, more power is needed to move the ship, and that means greater fuel consumption, A large ship gulps down huge quantities of fuel in normal operation, but barnacles can greatly increase its operating expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Once they have become attached to the hull of a ship it is no simple matter to scrape them off. In some instances they are so firmly attached that a jackhanjmer has to be used. Since this cannot be done while the ship is in the water, it has to be put in drydock. After the scraping of its hull is completed it must be repainted. This process plus the money the ship loses from being out of service would cost the giant ocean liner the United States more than $75,000. Commercial shippers spend about $100 million every year to free their ships of this tenacious creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The only known way to protect ships from barnacles is to use copper on the hulls. It is highly poisonous to them. By sheathing a wooden vessel’s hull with copper permanent protection from barnacles is achieved, bwt that is not possible with vessels made from-iron. A chemical reaction between the copper and iron causes the hull to eat away. So a less effective method is used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By painting the hull with paint containing copper oxide a measure of protection is possible. It keeps barnacles </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">off</span><span class="font2"> the ship for about two years, but by then the copper will have been leached out of the paint and the little crustaceans will begin fastening themselves on the hull. Continued protection requires repainting of the hull at regular intervals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus a small creature that is only about a half inch in diameter when a swimming larva can become a costly problem to ship and boat owners. Perhaps from the research that is being done to find better ways of protecting ships from their tenacious grip the secret of their adhesive cement will be found. That could mean a new super-strong cement for man’s use. If so, the barnacle will be able to compensate man in a small way for being such a troublesome stowaway.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"><img src="g_E_19681222_files/g_E_19681222-17.png" alt="" style="width:201pt;height:119pt;">
<p><span class="font3">R</span><span class="font2">AGE is usually associated with what is bad. All too often wrath is injurious to the one giving vent to it and to the one against whom it is expressed. Appropriately, therefore, the disciple James Wrote: “Man’s wrath does not work out God’s righteousness.’’ (Jas. 1:20) Hence the thought that man’s rage could actually praise Jehovah may seem somewhat strange. Yet this is exactly what the psalmist stated: “For the very rage of man will laud you; the remainder of raging you will gird upon yourself,” (Ps. 76: 10) But how can something that is frequently very harmful result in praise to Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An examination of the historical record about God’s dealings with his ancient people Israel illustrates the answer to this question. While enslaved </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font2"> Egypt, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font2">Israelites suffered much oppression. (Ex. 3:9) Then, when Moses and Aaron, in the name of Jehovah, requested the release of Israel, this only intensified the anger of Egypt’s Pharaoh. His reply: “Why is it, Moses and Aaron, that you cause the people to leave off from their works? Go bearing your burdens'”—Ex. 5:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pharaoh then commanded that the Israelites no longer be supplied with straw for making bricks. Being therefore unable to account for the fixed amount of bricks, Israelite officers in charge of the work were beaten. Their cry of complaint before Pharaoh was countered with the angry retort: “You are relaxing, you are relaxing! That is why you are saying, ‘We want to go, we want to sacrifice to Jehovah.’ And now go, serve! Though no straw will be given to you, yet you are to give the fixed amount of bricks.”—Ex. 5:17, IS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Did the rage of Pharaoh laud Jehovah? Rather, wag not </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">his rage expressed in</span><span class="font2"> defiance of the true God ? Further, the Egyptians generally, like Pharaoh, did not regard Jehovah as a God who had to be obeyed, let alone praised.—Ex. 5:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pharaoh’s rage also had a bad effect on the Israelites and gave rise to expressions of dissatisfaction with Moses, Jehovah's appointed representative. (Ex. 5:21) Moses himself voiced concern: “Jehovah, why have you caused evil to this people? Why is it that you have sent me? For from the time that I went in before Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done evil to this people, and you have by no means delivered your people.”—Ex. 5: 22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah, though, was working out matters so that Pharaoh’s rage would bring praise to Him. In time, testimony to God’s greatness and power mounted as each plague came and ended at the word of his servant Moses. Each time that Pharaoh resumed his raging by hardening fits heart after a certain plague had ended, his very rage lauded Jehovah. How so? Because Jehovah used this as an opportunity to demonstrate his great power still further. As a result, some of the Egyptians came to realize that Jehovah was no mere God of slaves, but a God who had to be obeyed. For example, when the seventh plague was announced, even some of Pharaoh’s servants acted on that announcement and saw to it that their own servants and livestock were safely sheltered before the destructive hailstorm began. (Ex. 9:20, 21) Whereas Jehovah was making a glorious name for himself, Egypt’s false gods were shown as unable to aid their worshipers in time of need.—Ex, 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Finally, after the death of Egypt’s firstborn, Pharaoh released the Israelites. His rage, however, had not come to its finish. He and his servants soon came to regret that they had permitted Israel to leave, saying: “What is this that we have done, in that we have sent Israel away from slaving for us?&quot; (Ex. 14:5) Immediately Pharaoh mustered his military forces, not just to bring the Israelites back into a yoke of slavery, but to wreak vengeance upon them, to kill and to take spoil. (Ex. 15:9) Therefore fearful Israelites exclaimed to Moses: “Is it because there are no burial places at all in Egypt that you have taken us here to die in the wilderness? What is this that you have done to us in leading us out of Egypt?&quot;—Ex. 14: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But the rage of Pharaoh and the other Egyptians had, in effect, brought them into a position whereby Jehovah could glorify himself by delivering his people from their fury. So God ‘girded the remainder of raging upon himself’ and destroyed Egypt’s army in the Red Sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This grand deliverance made a deep impression on the Israelites and also on other peoples, moving them to laud Jehovah. (Josh. 2:10, 11) Note, for instance, the expression of Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law: &quot;Blessed be Jehovah, who has delivered you from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of Pharaoh, and who has delivered the people from under the hand of Egypt. Now I do know that Jehovah is greater than all the other gods by reason of this affair in which they acted presumptuously against them.” (Ex. 18:10, 11) Jehovah had indeed received glory by means of a raging Pharaoh and his military forces.—Ex. 14:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Also in this twentieth century there have been numerous instances where man’s rage lauded Jehovah. Consider, for example, the extreme rage expressed against Jehovah’s witnesses in the concentration camps of Nazi Germany. Despite severe abuse, torture and threat of death, they continued faithfully serving Jehovah. Their courageous stand and devotion to righteousness, made possible even under these trying circumstances because of their having the help of Gad's spirit, moved many other prisoners to become praisers of Jehovah. Even some SS guards turned from Nazism, dedicated their lives to God and thereafter shared in the sufferings of their former victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Consequently, when suffering tribulation at the hands of others—perhaps opposed family members, enraged mobs, ungodly governments and the like—Jehovah’s people can draw comfort from the fact that man’s rage may work out to Jehovah’S praise. Yes, their example of faithfulness, maintained with Jehovah’s help, may move even opposers to laud the heavenly Father. Then, too, we have the assurance that soon Jehovah, by means of his Son and the heavenly angels, will ‘gird the remainder of raging upon himself* and destroy those whose wrath is directed against his people. Wrote the apostle Paul: &quot;This takes into account that it is righteous on God’s part to repay tribulation to those who make tribulation for you, but, to you who suffer tribulation, relief along with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his powerful angels in a flaming fire, as he brings vengeance upon those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus.” —2 Thess. 1:6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So, although man’s wrath will never work out God’s righteousness, yet man’s rage does laud Jehovah whew it brings about circumstances that motivate expressions of praise to his holy name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">&amp; The International Narcotics Control Board said, on November 8, that traffic in psychotropic drugs, ranging from LSD to sedatives, has reached “epidemic proportions.&quot; Sir Harry Greenwood, chairman of the board, said the problem requires urgent international legislation “if it is to be adequately dealt with.” He named the United States, Sweden, Britain and Holland among those most affected, but added: &quot;We do not know of any developed country which does not have the problem.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Serious Crime Rise</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Out of every 100 pet sons living in the United States, chances are that two will be murdered, raped, robbed, or beaten in the coming year. And if the assailant uses </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">weapon, it probably will be a gun. Those are the key facts in the annual Uniform Crime Reports issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington. One of the most startling statistics was the figure on crime for this decade, showing an 89-pereent increase in serious crime in the nation since 1960, with a rise in crimes of violence of 73 percent. Of more than 3,800,-000 serious crimes reported during 1967, 494,000 were of a violent nature, said the FBI director. The crime rate has increased nine times as fast as the population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“White Collar” Thieves</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&lt;§&gt; According to Norman Jas-pan, president of Norman Jaspan Associates, Inc., (management engineers) and the firm’s fact-finding division, &quot;white collar” workers steal more than $5,000,000 in cash and merchandise each working day. This has caused an estimated 30 percent of all business failures and a hike in some consumer goods prices. He says many of these thieves are college-educated members of the middle or upper classes who hold supervisory or executive positions. In the past decade, he says, they have become America’s most resourceful and successful crooks. There is, he said, more than a 50-percent chance of sizable dishonesty in any firm and a 75-percent chance of harmful malpractice, &quot;And we’re not talking about stealing paper clips,” declared Jaspan.</span></p>

The surgical technique is held forth as a potential substitute for heart transplants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Pesticide Use Rises</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The U.S. Agriculture Department disclosed that more than half of the nation's acreage of several major food crops is treated with pestcontrol chemicals. A survey made in 1966, the most comprehensive study to date on the use of chemicals in agriculture, said that the total acres of corn treated with chemical weed killers rose from 10 percent in 1952 to almost 60 percent in 1966. The acreage of corn treated with insecticides rose from 1 percent in 1952 to 33 percent in 1966. The report added that 81 percent of fruit and nut acreage received insecticide treatment in 1966, along with 89 percent of potatoes, 56 percent of other vegetables, 54 percent of cotton and 81 percent of tobacco. The Agriculture Department’s study followed wide public concern in 1964 about possible residue dangers, but the use of pesticides has increased greatly since then. Federal controls were designed to keep foods free of unsafe, high-level chemical residues, but authorities are wondering if the controls are working.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">&lt;$&gt; The Greek military government has decreed that officers and noncommissioned officers in the Greek armed forces can no longer marry for love alone. They must have a private income to support their wives. And the extra income must be equal to at least half their pay.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Whose Money?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&lt;$&gt; The late archbishop Dionysius Diachenko of the Russian Orthodox Church in California left a $53,000 estate, which the State of California claimed, much to the chagrin of the Russian Orthodox Church. California law provides that when a person dies without a will and has no known relatives, the estate goes to the state. Diachenko left no will. The Russian Orthodox Church has sued the State of California in an effort to obtain the $53,000 estate. The church said &quot;tradition and canon law&quot; require the bishop to leave all his property to the church. The suit said that under canon law a man “takes vows of poverty and what he has above his own needs belongs to the church.” This is one of many ways some churches become powerfully rich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Heart Disease and Sleeping</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">•$&gt; The death rate from strokes and heart ailments is considerably higher among those who usually sleep nine or ten hours a night, than among those who usually sleep seven hours, said Dr. E. Cuyier Hammond, an epidemiologist. A study of hundreds of thousands of Americans has produced statistics for such a conclusion. Dr. Hammond says that the long sleep could perhaps cause disease by reducing the amount of time a person is active. So the individual is depositing fat in his body more of the time, rather than burning it up. For coronary disease below the age of 60, Dr. Hammond states, cigarette smoking seems to be the most important factor. Obesity is next. Over 60, a lack of exercise seems to be the main factor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Grim U.S. Crime Record</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Up to 90 percent of the total American population may have committed acts for which they could have received prison sentences, said Dr. E. M. Nelson, a professor at the University of Southern California. Researchers have also estimated that some 40 percent of all male American children will be arrested for a non-traffic offense during their lives. Another noteworthy statistic reported to the United States government was that 74 percent of neighborhood business establishments had not reported thefts committed by their own employees. About 75 percent of serious offenses are committed by males under 25 years old.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Like a Service Club</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&lt;$&gt; Jim McKibbon, former minister of an Anglican church in Canada, said that the church has become something like a service club. “I don’t enjoy myself particularly in church,” said the minister. “The church doesn’t really matter—it’s become a sort of Kiwanis or Rotary club, and if you’re the sort of person who likes it as a social club, it’s fine.” He went on to say: “And I don’t think the church can be reformed—it either will not or cannot be.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">&lt;§&gt; John F. Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald, Med gar Evers, Malcolm X, George Lincoln Rockwell, Martin Luther King, Robert F. Kennedy—all murdered. Does violence breed violence, assassination breed assassination? Said New York psychiatrist Dr. Fredric Wer-tham after John F. Kennedy was assassinated: &quot;Murder is as contagious as measles. More enormous acts will follow.” And so they did. Reports </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Weekend Magazine:</span><span class="font2"> “More than 6,500 U.S. citizens were murdered last year. This compares with 99 in Canada, 30 in England, 68 in West Germany and 37 in Japan. On a per capita basis, the country leads the so-called civilized world by a huge margin. The total number of violent crimes in the U.S. increased by 72 percent in six years while the population rose only 10 percent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Church®# Occupied</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&amp; Hundreds of former municipal government workers of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and their families took possession of six Roman Catholic churches. They demanded payment of three months’ salary owed to the workers by the city government. The demonstrators threatened to retain possession of the churches until the apostolic administrator, Mon-seftor Hugo Edwardo Polanco Brito, mediated a satisfactory settlement of the issue between the government and the striking workers. To enforce their demands, hundreds of people literally moved Into the churches, using the church benches for beds. Portable charcoal stoves were set up in the courtyard for cooking. Since toilet facilities in the churches were inadequate, there were complaints because of the filth and the stench caused by the “occupation.” After twelve days of unsuccessful efforts to obtain their desires, the workers declared they would go on a hunger strike until their demands were met. Also they warned that this would be their last effort by peaceful means to obtain what was due them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Heart Recipient Dies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">•$&gt; After living four months and twelve days with a transplanted heart, Maria Elena Pefialoza died in the Naval Hospital in Valparaiso, Chile, on November 6. She was the only woman who had survived such a transplant. Death came as a result of a cerebral complication, which her organism was unable to resist because of having been weakened by the many drugs given her to try to offset the body’s natural tendency to reject the transplanted organ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Hepatitis Cases Linked to Blood </span><span class="font2">&lt;&amp;&nbsp;A study at the National Institute of Health has shown that half of a group of surgery patients who received blood that came from commercially paid donors developed hepatitis, probably </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">as a </span><span class="font2">result of the transfusions. Another study at a large Los Angeles hospital has revealed that 19 percent of all patients who received a blood transfusion subsequently </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">developed </span><span class="font2">hepatitis. The risk is even higher at some hospitals. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font2">study at one large Chicago hospital showed a hepatitis rate of 30 percent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Many persons ask that question. Yet these same persons are vainly trying to find the answers to such questions as: “Why do we grow old and die?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>FIELD MINISTRY</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Those who have dedicated their lives to Jehovah God desire to magnify his name and aid their fellowmen to love and serve him. As the Bible shows, the “God of peace” equips his people as an organization “with every good thing” so they might perform his will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:20-58:13:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 13:20, 21</a>) So equipped, they pattern their ministry after that of Jesus and his apostles, calling from house to house to find persons interested in the Word of God. During August, they will be offering, in their house-to-house ministry, such Bible-study aids as the books <em>“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” </em>and <em>Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God, </em>on a contribution of 50c each, or either of these in combination with the book <em>Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? </em>for 75c.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>THE BIBLE, A BENEFICIAL BOOK</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Is the Bible just a fine book, only of literary value? Or perhaps a book to be read just for comfort or consolation when one is discouraged or depressed? Certainly it has proved its worth in these regards, but the Bible is of far more benefit. One of its own writers claimed for it: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16</a>) Are you deriving these benefits? Learn more about this Book of books. Send for and read <em>“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” </em>It will acquaint you with all sixty-six books of the Bible, their writers and contents and why each book is beneficial for our day. Send only $1.</p>

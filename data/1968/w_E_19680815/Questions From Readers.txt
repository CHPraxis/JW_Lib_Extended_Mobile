● Why did the apostle Paul say, as recorded at 1 Corinthians 1:17, that Christ dispatched him “not to go baptizing”? He did baptize believers, did he not?—G.Q., U.S.A.
In the midst of his comments about a problem with divisions existing in the Corinthian congregation, the apostle Paul wrote: “For Christ dispatched me, not to go baptizing, but to go declaring the good news, not with wisdom of speech, that the torture stake of the Christ should not be made useless.”—1 Cor. 1:17.
We can be certain that Paul was well aware of Jesus’ command to make disciples and to baptize them. (Matt. 28:19, 20) And Paul traveled widely, making disciples and teaching people to observe all the things Jesus commanded. He did not minimize the importance of baptism, but recommended it.—Acts 19:1-5.
The statement in 1 Corinthians 1:17 must be understood in context. In the verses before, Paul mentioned that he baptized Crispus, Gaius and the household of Stephanas. (1 Cor. 1:14-16) He was not doing that without Christ’s permission, but, rather, with the authorization recorded at Matthew 28:19.
The point the apostle was making was that he did not consider the baptizing of individuals his exclusive or primary assignment. Christ specifically told Paul that he was to preach, to be “a witness” to the nations. (Acts 26:16; 9:15) While Paul could and did baptize individuals, there are reasons why he may not have baptized great numbers. The context shows that divisions could spring up. If the apostles themselves specialized in baptizing, it might have contributed to the formation of parties or cliques of Christians baptized by certain men.
So when Paul stayed in Corinth, some years before writing his first letter to the congregation there, he did baptize some persons. But baptism was not a special rite to be performed just by the apostles, nor was it more meaningful when performed by an apostle than when done by another male member of the Christian congregation.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The date for observing the Lord’s evening meal in 1968 is Friday, April 12, after 6 p.m. Standard Time. Each congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses is making arrangements so that all who are regularly associated with the congregation and other interested persons can gather together for this occasion. In harmony with Jesus’ instructions to his disciples while he was still on earth, those who are heirs of the heavenly kingdom will partake of the emblematic bread and wine on that occasion. In addition, all who look forward to life under that kingdom are urged to be present to observe this Scriptural commemoration.</p>

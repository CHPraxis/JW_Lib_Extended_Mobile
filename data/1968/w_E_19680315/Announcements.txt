LORD’S EVENING MEAL
The date for observing the Lord’s evening meal in 1968 is Friday, April 12, after 6 p.m. Standard Time. Each congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses is making arrangements so that all who are regularly associated with the congregation and other interested persons can gather together for this occasion. In harmony with Jesus’ instructions to his disciples while he was still on earth, those who are heirs of the heavenly kingdom will partake of the emblematic bread and wine on that occasion. In addition, all who look forward to life under that kingdom are urged to be present to observe this Scriptural commemoration.
FIELD MINISTRY
As “fishers of men,” Jehovah’s witnesses obey the Lord Jesus Christ, so during March they will continue to ‘let down their nets for a catch’ by sharing in the ministry. (Matt. 4:19; Luke 5:4) As they do so, they will offer to all persons a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, along with three booklets, for $1; or a year’s subscription for both The Watchtower and Awake!, along with six booklets, for $2.
MEETING GOD’S REQUIREMENTS
Jesus commanded those whom he had instructed: “Go therefore and make disciples . . . teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) That means all Christians must be ministers. Are you? Regular instruction is conducted free by all congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses. Along with the Bible, one of the current textbooks used at the Kingdom Hall is Qualified to Be Ministers.

<p><span class="font17">something—that the country has gone over the edge and there’s nothing I or anyone can do about it,” said a doctor in Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Society is coming apart at the seams,” stated an office worker in Chicago. “It’s a murder epidemic,” declared a Negro student in Atlanta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">No doubt you, like most people, have been horrified by the increased crime, violence and assassinations in the United States. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Wall Street Journal</span><span class="font17"> of June 6, 1968, observed: “Many converged on the appalling and dark conclusion: American society is sick and frighteningly violent.” </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Combat</span><span class="font17"> of Paris said: “America is mad.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">However, the problem of growing troubles is not confined to just one country! In every nation on earth, including your own, serious difficulties are growing. If you live in a large city, do you not find that violence and crime are spreading? Do you not fear to walk down certain streets after dark? And when there is a knock at your door, do you not sometimes hesitate to open it until you find out if it is someone you know?</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">events, if not by the larger problems of their country, then by such things as the exploding immorality in their own neighborhood, or by the disruption of family life on a scale never before experienced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is a fact that everywhere the political, economic, religious and moral situations are deteriorating. That is why people all over the world, and likely you too, ask: “What’s this world coming to?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">An answer to this question was noted in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">U.S. News &amp;&nbsp;World Report</span><span class="font17"> of June 3, 1968, when it said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“A climax of some kind seems to be approaching the world over . . . It’s not the U.S. alone that's hit. Uprisings have erupted in France, in West Germany, in Spain, in ■Britain. Communist Eastern Europe is af</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">fected. So is Red China.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Commenting on the fact that the problem is world wide, an editorial reprinted in the New York </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font17"> of June 10, 1968, stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;The American people will misread the meaning of Robert Kennedy’s death if they view it solely as a self-contained American tragedy. The tragedy is the result of the spillover of violence and volatile tensions from one part of the world to another. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;We are at the end of the age of. purely national or even regional problems. Combustibles for setting the globe afire exist everywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Showing how rapidly world conditions now are building up to some sort of climax, this same editorial added:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Throughout the entire world people are caught up in convulsive change. . . . Issues that formerly took a century or more to come to a boil are in constant eruption. Everything is being bunched up—-time, space, nations, peoples, issues. And everything has a fuse attached to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;The habits of nations, always variable, have become starkly irrational.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The noted columnist Walter Lippmann also observes that a climax of some sort is approaching, saying in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek</span><span class="font17"> of October 9, 1967:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;For us all the world is disorderly and dangerous, ungoverned and apparently ungovernable. Everywhere there is great anxiety and bewilderment. . ..</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;This . . . marks, I believe, the historical fact that we are living through the closing chapters of the established and traditional way of life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">World leaders sec these critical problems mounting. But they cannot find answers to them. As was said about United States President Johnson recently: “He has consulted the wisest men he knows and cannot figure out what else to do.” These leaders are much like the engineer on a runaway train speeding downhill. At the end of the hill there is a yawning canyon the bridge over which has been washed out. But the engineer cannot stop the train, for the brakes have failed! Disaster is certain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What, then, does all of this world trouble mean? What is this world coming to?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Where can you find the answers to such questions? There is only one proven source, a source that this world’s leaders are ignoring. That source of answers is the Bible. In it God has had recorded for our benefit all the information we need to answer these questions. “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for . . . setting things straight.”—2 Tim. 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What does the Bible show as to the meaning of all these world events? It shows that for this unrighteous world time is running out fast! It shows that within a few years at most there will take place a climax in human affairs so gigantic that it will affect every person on earth, every man, woman and child. It will, without fail, affect you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What is this climax? God himself will take a direct hand in world affairs. He will use his overwhelming power to crush wickedness and wicked people. (Rev. 11: 18) This act of God is called “Armageddon” in some Bible versions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This climactic act of God will bring to a sudden end all the trouble and troublemakers in the world today. It will pave the way for an entirely new system of things where people who love righteousness will find true freedom and relief from the horrifying conditions of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">So what is this world coming to? The Bible answers: “The world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.” (1 John 2:17) Yes, this violent, crime-ridden, war-torn world is coming to its end! Time is fast running out for it! It is much later for this world than you may think! Indeed, it has only a few more years of existence left!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Actually, we have been living in a transition period since the year 1914. In that year, this system of things began its downward plunge. It became like that runaway train speeding toward a chasm where certain destruction awaits it.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">“The last completely 'normal' year in history was 1913, the year before World War I began,”—Washington, D.C., Times-Herald, March 13, 1949.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Security and quiet have disappeared from the lives of men since 1914. And peace? Since 1914, the Germans have not known real peace nor has much of mankind.”—Konrad Adenauer, chancellor, West Germany, January 20, 1964. “in the year 1914 the world, as it was known and accepted then, came to an end. Far more than any year before or since was this the punctuation-mark of the twentieth century.&quot; —British author James Cameron in the book entitled “1914.” “If . . . the human race survives, some historian in the next century may well conclude that the day the world went mad was August 4, 1914.”—London Star, August 4, 1960.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The first [world] war marked a far greater change in history. It closed a long era of general peace and began a new age of violence in which the second [world] war is simply an episode. Since 1914 the world has had a new character; a character of international anarchy. . . . Thus the first World War marks a turning point in modern history.&quot;—H. R, Trevor-Roper, British historian, August 1, 1954.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“It is indeed the year 1914 rather than that of Hiroshima which marks the turning point in our time, ... it was the first world war that ushered in the era of confused transition in the midst of which we are floundering.&quot;—Scientific Monthly, July 1951.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font17">In addition to anarchy and confusion, 1914 brought the era of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">total</span><span class="font17"> war and of unprecedented insecurity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Has the half century since 1914 seen any return to normalcy? Or has the plunge downward picked up speed? Consider the facts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">“The world os man knew if . . . wot forever ending, and from July 28 to August 4, 1914, the leaders and the led joined in pronouncing the death sentence. . , . World War I was the end of the Golden Age, the beginning of Total War.'' —Hanson W. Baldwin, American military analyst, July 26, 1964.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“If ever there was a year that marked the end of an era and the beginning of another, it was 1914. That year brought to an end the old world with its sense of security and began the modern age, characteristic of which is the insecurity that is our daily portion.”—A. L. Rowse, Oxford historian and biographer, June 28, 1959.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;A deterioration has been going on since the first World War.&quot;—Dwight D. Eisenhower, former president of the United States, September 13, 1965.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Since 1914 civilization has constantly deteriorated.

<p><span class="font1">“We seem to leap from incident to incident. Suddenly there is a new emergency and men die. Since 1914, great empires have collapsed and nations hardly known then are now world problems. . . . We have tried war, appeasement, charity, diplomacy, the League of Nations, the United Nations. These efforts have failed. . . . Obviously something happened [in 1914] which altered the course of . . . life. That alteration has not been </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font1">the better.”—New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Journal-American, </span><span class="font1">January 24, 1952.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But just because the year 1914 is recognized as a turning point, does that in itself make it the start of the “last days”? What confirms this conclusion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Both in Bible chronology and in the events that were foretold to take place from 1914 onward we find confirmed beyond doubt that 1914 was the beginning of the end for this present system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Briefly stated, in the Bible there is a remarkable prophecy concerning the number of years that God would allow the political nations uninterrupted rule over earth’s affairs. The time allotted by God would be 2,520 years altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">When did this period of 2,520 years begin? It began when God permitted the nation of ancient Israel to be overthrown by Babylon. That was in the year 607 B.C.E. Thus, the “appointed times of the nations,” as Jesus Christ later called them, began.—Luke 21:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">When did these 2,520 years end? Counting from 607 B.C.E. to 1 B.C.E. would be 606 full years; from 1 B.C.E. to 1 C.E. is one year; and from C.E. 1 to C.E. 1914 is 1,913 years. Thus, 606 plus 1 plus 1,913 gives us 2,520 years, ending in 1914.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark2">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">However, is this prophecy relating to chronology the only proof that 1914 marked the beginning of the “last days”? No. There is far more to the matter than that. Consider what came with that date 1914.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>HDUJ DO U/E fflJDlU </span><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;">we are in the</span></h1><img src="g_E_19681008_files/g_E_19681008-7.png" alt="" style="width:203pt;height:179pt;">
<p><span class="font20">H</span><span class="font17">OW can we be sure we are living in the period of time called the “last days”? Aside from chronology, what definite proof is there that this era began in the year 1914? How long a time is covered by it? When will it end?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The phrase “last days” comes from Bible prophecy such as that recorded at 2 Timothy chapter 3, verse 1, where the apostle Paul states: &quot;In the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">last days </span><span class="font17">critical times hard to deal with will be here.” It is the same time period that Jesus Christ referred to when his disciples asked him what the sign “of the conclusion of the system of things” would be. —Matt. 24:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This time period has a definite beginning and a definite end. It is similar to the last day of a week, which has a definite beginning at midnight and a definite end twenty-four hours later. During the time period of the &quot;last days” certain events would take place, after which God would bring the period to an end by crushing out of existence this present wicked world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The events that Jesus, the apostle Paul and other Bible writers bring to our attention were all to take place </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">within the same generation.</span><span class="font17"> (Matt. 24:34) These events would identify which generation’s lifetime would embrace the “last days,” much as your fingerprint identifies you. Your fingerprint contains a pattern of marks, or lines, different from what any other person has. Likewise, the &quot;last days” contain their own pattern of marks, or events, that all come together to form a &quot;fingerprint” that cannot possibly belong to any other generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Remember, however, that it is not just one of these events by itself that is crucial, although each is highly significant. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">All of them must come together in the same generation,</span><span class="font17"> like the different lines that come together on one of your fingers to form your fingerprint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Before describing these identifying events, Jesus cautioned: &quot;You are going to hear of wars and reports of wars; see that you are not terrified. For these things must take place, but the end is not yet.” (Matt. 24:6) True to his words, such things did happen for centuries after the time when Jesus was on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Then, Jesus began listing the worldshaking events that would constitute a &quot;sign” marking the beginning and duration of the &quot;last days.” (Matt. 24:3) Let us now examine some of these events, and others foretold in the Bible, that make up this sign. Observe how they have been undergoing fulfillment since 1914.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">There are many other features of the sign marking the “last days.&quot; But the ones listed above are sufficient to show how Bible prophecy has been fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">However, some persons may here state: ‘Well, wars, famines, pestilences, earthquakes, crime—these are all features of human living in every age. It would not be difficult for anyone to predict that they would occur again. And, such a prophecy could apply to many periods.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Is this true? No, it is not, as thoughtful reasoning will show. It is one thing to foretell such events or conditions, it is another thing to foretell them on the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">scale </span><span class="font17">indicated, as affecting the entire globe; to foretell that they would occur </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">concurrently</span><span class="font17"> in only one generation; to foretell that they would come at the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">time indicated</span><span class="font17"> in Bible prophecy. That is why the publishers of this magazine called attention to the year 1914 as far back as 1879, pointing out that disastrous conditions would begin then. Indeed, fifty-four years ago, the New York </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font17"> of August 30, 1914, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;The terrific war outbreak in Europe has fulfilled an extraordinary prophecy. For a quarter of a century past, through preachers and through press, the ‘International Bible Students’ . . . have been proclaiming to the world that the Day of Wrath prophesied in the Bible would dawn in 1914. ’Look out for 19141’ has been the cry ... of the evangelists.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Yet, while these witnesses of Jehovah were proclaiming that 1914 would bring the worst time of trouble in history, what were others saying? In the book </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">1913: America Between Two Worlds</span><span class="font17"> [1962J author A. Valentine notes: “Secretary of State Bryan said [in 1913] that ‘conditions promising world peace were never more favorable than now,' and Andrew Carnegie said war with Germany had never ‘even been imagined? ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Thus, right up to the very brink of World War I, prominent world leaders were forecasting an age of social unity and enlightenment. If the conditions that have come since 1914 were easily predictable, then why did not such men foresee them and sound the warning?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Still, some object and say: ‘Oh, it’s only the population increase and better reporting methods that make things seem so much worse today? An answer to this comes from the following news report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Washington, May 31 (AP)-—FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover assailed today those who attempt to minimize the nation’s crime problem by blaming it on the large increase in the youthful population and fuller tabulations by police. . . . He said those who try to ‘explain away the shocking truth behind crime statistics’ are doomed to failure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">So do not misread the evidence. It is all there, and it is positively overwhelming, particularly so because </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the evidence has continued in force for more than half a century now’</span><span class="font17"> And if ail this is not the fulfillment of Bible prophecy concerning the &quot;last days,” then what does it require? What more could be expected in the way of fulfillment?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">For your own welfare, you should face the fact that all the many lines of the &quot;fingerprint” for the “last days” stand out sharply, crystal clear. They allow for only one meaning: that we have been in the &quot;last days” since 1914!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Crucial questions now arise: Is there any indication in God’s timetable as to how much time there is left before this system of things comes to its end? Can we know how many more years remain for this violent system of things?</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font17">HE fact that fifty-four years of the period called the &quot;last days” have already gone by is highly significant. It means that only a few years, at most, remain before the corrupt system of things dominating the earth is destroyed by God. How can we be so certain of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">One way is by noting what Jesus said when he gave his great prophecy about the “last days.” After he listed the many events that would mark this period, he also stated: “Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things occur.”—Matt, 24:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Jesus was obviously speaking about those who were old enough to witness </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">with understanding</span><span class="font17"> what took place when the “last days” began. Jesus was saying that some of those persons who were alive at the appearance of the 'sign of the last days’ would still be alive when God brought this system to its end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Even if we presume that youngsters 15 years of age would be perceptive enough to realize the import of what happened in 1914, it would still make the youngest of ■‘this generation” nearly 70 years old today. So the great majority of the generation to which Jesus was referring has already passed away in death. The remaining ones are approaching old age. And remember, Jesus said that the end of this wicked world would come </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font17"> that generation passed away in death. This, of itself, tells us that the years left before the foretold end comes cannot be many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">6,000 Years Nearing Completion</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">There is another way that helps confirm the fact that we are living in the final few years of this “time of the end.” (Dan. 12:9) The Bible shows that we are nearing the end of a full 6,000 years of human history. What significance does this have?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">When God gave his laws to ancient Israel, one of those laws involved keeping the sabbath day holy. On the seventh day of the week there was to be no labor. The people were to rest from all their toil. (Ex. 20:8-11) The Bible states that “the Law has </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">a shadow of the good things to come.&quot; </span><span class="font17">—Heb. 10:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Revelation chapter 20, verse 6, shows that God’s heavenly kingdom will rule over the earth for one thousand years after the end of this system of things. That millennium will bring a sabbathlike rest to the earth and all those then inhabiting it. Hence, the first six thousand years since man’s creation could be likened to the first six days of the week in ancient Israel. The seventh one-thousandyear period could be likened to the seventh day, the sabbath, of that week.—2 Pet. 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">How fitting it would be for God, following this pattern, to end man’s misery after six thousand years of human rule and follow it with His glorious Kingdom rule for a thousand years! This Kingdom Christians have prayed for during many centuries.—Matt 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When Do 6,000 Years End?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">How can it be determined when 6,000 years of human history will end?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">According to reliable Bible chronology, Adam and Eve were created in 4026 B.C.E.<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark27">2</a></sup> From the autumn of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4026 B.C.E. to 1 B.C.E.....4,025 years</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1 B.C.E. to 1 C.E.....................1 year</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1 C.E. to 1968 C.E........... 1,967 years</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Total to autumn 1968 .... 5,993 years </span><span class="font17">This would leave only seven more years from the autumn of 1968 to complete 6,000 full years of human history. That seven-year period will evidently finish in the autumn of the year 1975.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Does this mean that the above evidence positively points to 1975 as the time for the complete end of this system of things? Since the Bible does not specifically state this, no man can say. However, of this we can be sure: The 1970’s will certainly see the most critical times mankind has yet known. The deterioration in human relations—within families, communities, cities and nations, and between nations —will worsen, not improve. (2 Tim. 3:13) If the 1970’s should see intervention by Jehovah God to bring an end to a corrupt world drifting toward ultimate disintegration, that should surely not surprise us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If you feel that this is painting the picture too darkly, consider what warnings the hard facts have forced even men of this world to express. They sense that disaster is approaching, but, lacking the Bible’s guidance, they do not know what to do about it. That is why </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">U.S. News &lt;£ World Report</span><span class="font17"> of June 10, 1968 said:</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Concerning political instability, former U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson said in 1960: “I know enough of what is going on to assure you that, in 15 years from today [or, by 1975], this world is going to be too dangerous to live in.” And of the struggle between communism and capitalism, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Intelligence Digest</span><span class="font17"> of August 1967 said: “The facts . . . show that the forces in the world struggle are grouping themselves for a decisive show-down.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Everywhere national currencies are in trouble. Alfred Shaefer, chairman of Switzerland’s Union Bank, said in 1968: “Everywhere you see a shakiness. Time is running out. Something disagreeable could happen at any time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Large cities are in such a state of affairs that efforts to patch them up have proved hopelessly insufficient. The air, water and land are becoming polluted to the point of saturation. Transportation in many nations is a major killer, and the crush of traffic often paralyzes major cities for hours. Schools and colleges are in a dilemma as to maintaining order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Drug addiction and immorality have reached unimagined extremes. Law enforcement becomes increasingly difficult, with the public often apathetic toward corruption and even showing violent animosity toward the police. In the United States, firemen are frequently attacked when answering fire calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Nor can the religious systems of Christendom stem the tide, for they too are in a state of growing chaos. An Associated Press dispatch on November 24, 1967, reported:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">‘‘Christian theology . . . today is in a state of chaos, many of its experts admit. Today, we are at the end of a theological era, with the old theological systems a shambles,’ says the Rev. James I. McCord, president of Princeton Theological Seminary.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">One of the greatest problems, beyond man's solving, is the coming food shortage due to the population explosion. In the book </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Famine—1975!</span><span class="font17"> food experts W. and P. Paddock state:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“By 1975 a disaster of unprecedented magnitude will face the world. Famines, greater than any in history, will ravage the undeveloped nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“I forecast a specific date, 1975, when the new crisis will be upon us in aM its awesome importance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;By 1975 civil disorder, anarchy, military dictatorships, runaway inflation, transportation breakdowns and chaotic unrest will be the order of the day in many of the hungry nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">And the Arizona </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Republic</span><span class="font17"> said on June 2, 1968, that Professor R. Heilbroner of New York &quot;predicted that in the early 1970’s, ‘the greatest catastrophe the world has ever known’ will occur when population far outstrips the available food supply.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Just a ‘Passing Phase’?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Some will object and say that these distressing conditions are just a ‘passing phase’ in world affairs. Things will straighten out and the present systems will gradually improve,’ they may say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But on what basis can you believe this? Have men successfully coped with these conditions, or, to the contrary, has history and your own personal experience proved that these conditions have worsened?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Ask yourself: What is the trend? Are men becoming less selfish and more loving? Are they becoming less ambitious and proud? Are they tending toward greater humility, greater love for their neighbor and concern for his welfare? Is there less violence, less hatred in the world? Is it more peaceful, less dangerous?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The facts answer, No! He is not solving his problems. Instead, his management of earth is producing crises of ever greater proportions. So why believe that conditions under man’s rule will improve? Why not face the facts as stated in the Bible that this present system is headed for a crash, but that before it goes to pieces completely from its own badness, Almighty God is going to step in and execute his judgment upon it?—Jer. 25:31-33; Rev. 18:1-8; 19:11-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Change Ahead in World Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is very appropriate for God to bring an end to man’s rule. On their own, independent from God, men and nations have brought ever greater disaster to the human family. Unable to get what they want by legitimate and just means, they have drenched the earth with the blood of innocent people.—Isa. 26:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Editor David Lawrence acknowledged on September 25, 1967: “Unhappiness on earth is man-made. Our key weakness is that we have not solved the problem of self-government.” And the editor of </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Intelligence Digest</span><span class="font17"> admitted in August of 1967: “Only God can settle world affairs. The materialistic concept that, by his own</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">unaided efforts, man can establish lasting peace is directly contrary to Christian teaching.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">However, since the majority of humans and their leaders do not really want God as their ruler, they will have to be taken out of the way. That is why Bible prophecy says of our time: “In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin. And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite.&quot; (Dan. 2:44) What a relief this will bring to those who are sick of all the bloodshed, strife and corruption!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Those who submit to God’s requirements will be protected by him through the coming Armageddon destruction of this system of things. He promises: “Seek Jehovah, all you meek ones of the earth, who have practiced His own judicial decision. Seek righteousness, seek meekness. Probably you may be concealed in the day of Jehovah’s anger.”—Zeph. 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">After the end of this system of things, then what? A new day will dawn for the human family! Armageddon survivors will begin to enjoy all the benefits of a righteous new order. Just what will conditions be like on earth then? What blessings will flow to the human family during this 1,000-year rule of God’s kingdom? For your own encouragement, examine these conditions and benefits in the light of God’s promises.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Surely you want to live in such a wonderful new order as God’s Word describes. Think of it—no more war, crime, violence, poverty, hunger, poor housing or sickness!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What a blessing these conditions will be for those who sincerely love righteousness! And under God’s loving administration by his appointed King, Christ Jesus, all mankind will become one united, happy family. From heaven, this righteous rulership will guide, assist and prosper the activities of those who make up the new earthly arrangement of things. Fulfilled will be the Bible prophecy: “There are new heavens [God’s kingdom] and a new earth [righteous human society] that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.” —2 Pet. 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The new system will certainly fulfill the promise given through the psalmist, who said of the loving Creator: “You are opening your hand and satisfying the desire of every Jiving thing.” (Ps. 145:16) AU the proper desires of God-fearing persons will be completely realized under the rule of the Kingdom government. Not only peace, prosperity and health, but also the enjoyment of living among people who are honest, decent, loving and helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Nor will this enjoyment be temporary. It will not be cut short by death after seventy or eighty years of life. For God's Word guarantees the elimination of death, saying: “He will actually swallow up death forever, and the Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces.” (Isa. 25:8) “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">forever</span><span class="font17"> upon it.&quot;—Ps. 37:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Even those in the graves will have an opportunity for life in God’s new order, for “there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.” (Acts 24:15) In this way the resurrected dead will be in position to prove their loyalty to God and be found worthy of living forever in that restored paradise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But will not this planet become too crowded with so many millions coming back in the resurrection? No, that will not be the case. Keep in mind that the Creator of the universe regulates the thousands of millions of heavenly bodies with a precision that inspires awe in man. Surely God is capable of determining and regulating a far smaller number of people to live comfortably on earth. There will be no problem of overcrowding to mar the happiness of that new order. Jehovah will solve any problem that, could arise. Hence, we can confidently say; “O Jehovah of armies, happy is the man that is trusting in you.”—Ps. 84:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Living then will be true living, in the way the Creator purposed, free from the frustration, irritation, disagreeableness and anxiety that characterizes the lives of millions today. That is why the Bible describes the condition of persons then in this way: “The meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">exquisite delight</span><span class="font17"> in the abundance of peace.” (Ps. 37:11) Yes, those living in that new order will experience such deep peace and contentment that every day will be an “exquisite delight” to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Do you not agree that God’s purpose for earth and man in the near future is inspiring? Certainly nothing that any man, organization or government on earth today has done or ever could do remotely compares with what God will do for man in His new order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Surely no one today can deny the urgent need for a change in the direction in which men and nations are moving. Many, in fact, long for such a change. Yet they hesitate to believe in the prospect of seeing a global change take place in the near future by God’s power. Why? Does their doubting have a sound basis?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A TIME TO</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font17">HE evidence that we are far along in the “last days” can be either good news or bad news to you, depending on the position you take. If you long to be free from a rule that has proved both unsatisfactory and unrighteous and that is torn more and more by discord and confusion; if you really love what is right and have a sincere desire to do the will of your Creator, then this evidence should make you rejoice. Why? Because, as Jesus Christ said; “As these things start to occur, raise yourselves erect and lift your heads up, because </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">your deliverance is getting near.”—</span><span class="font17">Luke 21; 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A perfect government, heaven-based and with heaven’s blessing and heaven’s power backing it up, will soon take complete control of this earth. In this way God will answer the prayer; “Let your kingdom come.” What better news could there be?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Still some persons may say: “How can you be sure? Maybe it is later than many people think. But maybe it is not as late as some persons claim. People have been mistaken about these prophecies before.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Difference</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">True, there have been those in times past who predicted an “end to the world,” even announcing a specific date. Some have gathered groups of people with them and fled to the hills or withdrawn into their houses waiting for the end. Yet, nothing happened. The “end” did not come. They were guilty of false prophesying. Why? What was missing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Missing was the full measure of evidence required in fulfillment of Bible prophecy. Missing from such people were God’s truths and the evidence that he was guiding and using them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But what about today? Today we have the evidence required, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all of it.</span><span class="font17"> And it is overwhelming! All the many, many parts of the great sign of the “last days” are here, together with verifying Bible chronology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Take a simple illustration: Suppose on a hot day at the beginning of summer, someone told you that winter was coming within a week because he had seen some trees without leaves, But th6se trees could have died from disease or age. So, by itself that would not be enough evidence that winter was approaching. Especially so when none of the other trees had shed their leaves, when the heat continued day after day, and when the calendar told you it was just the beginning of summer. You could rightly dismiss the claim of winter’s nearness as unfounded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What, though, if months later you went outside each day in the afternoon and found the temperature approaching the freezing point, with dull gray clouds scudding across the sky? What if you saw that </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font17"> the trees that were not evergreens had shed their leaves? And what if you, upon inquiring, found that the autumn harvest of crops had taken place weeks ago, and that the migrating birds and animals had already taken leave for warmer climates? What if your calendar showed that the autumn months were at their close?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Would you still doubt if someone told you that winter was coming very soon? Would you say he was just guessing or merely expressing his own idea? Or would you acknowledge, on the basis of solid evidence, that he knew the facts and was telling you the truth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">After expressing the many parts that make up the sign of the “last days,” Jesus used a similar illustration with regard to another season, summer, saying: “Note the fig tree and all the other trees: When they are already in the bud, by observing it you know for yourselves that now the summer is near.” (Luke 21:29, 30) Then, as recorded at Matthew 24:33, 34, he added: “Likewise also you, when yop see </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all these things,</span><span class="font17"> know that he is near at the doors. Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things occur.” We today have </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font17"> the many parts of that sign, nearly forty of them, being fulfilled within the same generation, and we have God’s timetable, his “calendar,” showing that the time has nearly run out for the present unrighteous system of things. This is very different indeed from the situation with those who proclaimed an “end to the world” in earlier generations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Majority’s Opinion</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Not a Sound Guide</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We need to realize that the majority of persons will not be moved by the evidence that God’s kingdom has drawn near. Why? They are not really interested in God’s new system taking over control of earth. They do not want to submit to God’s rule, preferring to pursue their own selfish desires. These people will look for ways to reject or ridicule the evidence. But they merely add to the evidence of the ‘‘last days,” for the Bible foretold: “In the last days there will come ridiculers with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires and saying: ’Where is this promised presence of his? Why, from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death, all things are continuing exactly as from creation’s beginning.’2 Pet. 3:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Many people today are like persons on a runaway train who pay no attention when someone sincerely tries to warn them that the train is heading for disaster. They keep on with their club-car conversations, discussing matters such as wages, prices or social injustices. Or they keep on arguing over the merits of political leaders, the latest sports events; or reading, drinking, or playing cards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Do not such persons fit the description Jesus gave, saying: “For as they were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, men marrying and women being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark; and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">they took no note</span><span class="font17"> until the flood came and swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of man will be’’?—Matt 24:38, 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Notice that Jesus said “they took no note.” But despite this and despite the scoffing of the majority, “the world of that time suffered destruction when it was deluged with water.” (2 Pet. 3:6) But note please that Noah and his family had the happy experience of living through that destruction. Why? “Noah proceeded to do according to all that God had commanded him. He did just so.’’ —Gen. 6:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Parallel Situation in Jesus’ Day</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The attitude of the majority when Jesus was on earth was no different from today. They placed no confidence in his warnings nor the hope he announced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Jesus told the Jewish leaders that God had abandoned their religious system because of their willful disobedience and religious hypocrisy, saying: “Look! Your house is abandoned to you.” (Matt. 23:38) He warned the people: “When you see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies, then know that the desolating of her has drawn near. Then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains, and let those in the midst of her withdraw, and let those in the country places not enter into her; because these arc days for meting out justice.”—Luke 21:20-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In that same generation, in the year 66 C.E., Roman armies did come against Jerusalem, besieging it as Jesus foretold. But then, those armies withdrew, as ancient Jewish historian Josephus said: “without any reason in the world.” (Wars </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">of the Jews,</span><span class="font17"> Book II, Chapter XIX, sec. 7) Here was the sign Jesus had mentioned and now the opportunity to act upon it! Christians, confidently believing the truth of what Jesus said, rapidly abandoned Jerusalem and all the surrounding area. They crossed the Jordan River to the east, getting out of Judean territory altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Those who did not believe Jesus, or at least doubted him, ignored the sign. Thinking the Romans would not be back, they resumed their routine of life. In fact, four years later, in 70 C.E., during a religious holiday the Jews flocked </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">into</span><span class="font17"> Jerusalem by the hundreds of thousands. They did the very opposite of what Jesus said to do!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Just at that time, the Roman armies came back in force! They quickly surrounded Jerusalem, trapping more than a million Jews inside the city. After a siege, those powerful armies of Rome broke through the city’s defenses. More than a million Jews died due to famine and disease or were slaughtered, and tens of thousands were taken captive. Their city and its religious temple were put to the torch. By the year 73 C.E. all Judea had been desolated. Those who ignored Jesus’ warning, viewing it as mere “calamity howling,” paid with their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Yet, during this very time of horrible destruction, the Christians who had obeyed Jesus lived in blessed security in the mountains across the Jordan River.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">No Real Excuse for Doubting</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Despite all the evidence surrounding them in proof that God’s kingdom will soon come against the present wicked system, some still call for added proof. They would like some obviously supernatural phenomena to take place so as to convince them that it is truly later than they had thought. But, when a group of religious leaders wanted Jesus to produce some heavenly display to cause them to believe in him, Jesus said in reproof: “When evening falls you are accustomed to say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is fire-red’; and at morning, 'It will be wintry, rainy weather today, for the sky is fire-red, but gloomy-looking.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the signs of the times you cannot interpret.”—</span><span class="font17">Matt. 16:1-3; Luke 12: 54-56.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The Bible shows the true meaning of the “signs of the times” in which we are living. If we believe God’s Word we will rejoice. Do you believe it? Or arc you perhaps influenced by persons who attempt to discredit and downgrade the Bible’s reliability? If so, you should not make the mistake of thinking that such criticism has true scientific basis. Note, for example, what Professor R. D. Wilson said in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">A Scientific Investigation of the Old Testament:</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Whenever there is sufficient documentary evidence to make an investigation, the statements of the Bible in the original text have stood the test... .</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;The chronological and geographical statements are more accurate and reliable than those afforded by any other ancient documents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The famous scientist Sir Isaac Newton, a critic of ancient writings, said after examining the Scriptures: “I find more sure marks of authenticity in the New Testament than in any profane history whatever.” And modern archaeologist W. F. Albright said in his book </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Archaeology and Israel:</span><span class="font17"> “No major contention of Scripture has proved unhistorical.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">So, while you may choose to doubt the Bible’s authenticity, if you have never made a thorough study of it, then you should be honest enough to admit either to ignorance of its contents or perhaps even prejudice against them. But ignorance or prejudice on such a vital subject, and in a time such as we are now experiencing is dangerous indeed. Now, if ever, men and women everywhere need to reexamine their outlook on life, the basis for their hopes and their present course of action, and their reason for their beliefs and convictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">We sincerely hope that you are one who will open-mindedly consider the facts, and that your faith in God’s justice and love and in the truth of his Word continues unaffected by the doubts and scofflngs of a world that blindly rushes on in a disastrous course. (2 Cor. 4:4; Matt. 15:14) This system of things is picking up speed in its downward plunge. Will you stay with it and take the consequences, or will you listen to the counsel of God’s Word and abandon it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The time remaining for a decision is short. The opportunity is still before you, like the open door of the ark built by Noah before the Flood, and like the open gates of Jerusalem when Rome’s armies temporarily withdrew. But that door of opportunity will soon close for all time. Prompt action is vital if you would be among the happy survivors of this present system’s destruction. What can you do and what will it require of you?</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">L</span><span class="font17">IKE a train about to plunge into an abyss, this system of things is about to plunge into destruction. Time is fast running out for it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If you had the right opportunity to jump from a train that was heading for certain destruction, would you not do so? True, it might cost you a severe bruising; you might leave behind some of your possessions and the people on the train, but you would save your life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What will it cost you to have the hope of living through the end of this wicked system of things? What will you have to pay to gain life in God’s new order?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The cost to you cannot be measured in money. The apostle Peter once said to a person offering him money for benefits that God gives: “May your silver perish with you, because you thought through money to get possession of the free </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">gift </span><span class="font17">of God.”—Acts 8:18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Eternal Life a Gift</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Similarly, eternal life in God’s new order will be a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">gift:</span><span class="font17"> “The </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">gift</span><span class="font17"> God gives is everlasting life.” (Rom. 6:23) You cannot buy that with all the money in the world. And no human agency can give</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">So it is futile to look to money or human means for life. Only God can, and will, give eternal life to deserving ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Deserving ones? Does this mean that the gift of life will not come to everyone automatically? This is just what it means. While the gift of eternal life is available , to everybody, it wall be given only to those who meet the conditions God lays down.—John 3:35, 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What the Cost Is</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">God’s Word states: “The world is passing away and so is its desire, but </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">he that does the will of God remains forever” </span><span class="font17">—1 John 2:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">That is the key to eternal life, the doing of God’s will. All the conditions that must be met are included in that framework. So then, if you want to survive the end of this wicked world and be given the gift of eternal life in God’s new system, you need to do God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It is only logical that if you want to live in God’s new system you must do his will. What would happen if God allowed people to do whatever they wanted in. his new system? Crime, violence, bloodshed, hatred, prejudice and injustice would begin all over again. However, this will not be the case, for God will not again allow such conditions to prevail.—Isa. 11:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Therefore, there must be law and order. And the highest law that results in the best order comes from God. That is why there has to be an obeying of God’s righteous requirements. These requirements work to the good of everyone, including the one keeping them. Nor are they burdensome: “This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments; and yet his commandments are not burdensome.”—1 John 5:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Jesus Christ said: “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you. Take my yoke upon you and become my disciples, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for your souls. For my yoke is kindly and my load is light.” —Matt. 11:28-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A loving God will certainly not put burdens upon you that, you cannot carry. Keeping God’s commandments, doing his will, is not a heavy, depressing burden. Instead, it is refreshing, uplifting, light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Spend Time and Effort</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">To do God’s will, you must first know what it is. To find that out, you need to spend time and effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Is that too high a price to pay for learning about eternal life? Surely not. The first-century Christians willingly spent time and effort, as have hundreds of thousands of sincere Christians today, to learn God’s will. They eagerly looked into God’s Word to determine the truth: “They received the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily as to whether these things were so.”—Acts 17:11,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">There is no substitute for this taking in of Bible knowledge. Your hope to gain eternal life depends upon it: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (John 17:3) Yes, the only way to survive the end of this wicked world and to gain life in God’s new order is by doing God’s will. And the only way to find out God’s will is to look into his Word, the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">True, this may take some tinje and effort from other pursuits. But consider this: you now probably work about forty hours a week to make your living. Or, if you are a housewife, you work hard all week caring for the needs of the family. Yet, this investment of time and effort does not lead toward eternal life because even ungodly persons do as much. However, with far less time and effort, you can take in the knowledge that will start you on the way to eternal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Do Not Be Diverted by Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">You need to understand that not all persons have respect for God or for his Word. Some oppose. Others openly ridicule. (2 Pet. 3:3, 4) Do not be surprised, therefore, to have opposition arise from some of your friends, or even from close relatives, when you begin to study the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Jesus himself said that this might happen. (Matt. 10:36) If this does happen, and others oppose your learning God’s will, then what? Should you abandon your study of God’s Word? Remember, the Bible says of men: “Not one of them can by any means redeem even a brother, nor give to God a ransom for him . . . that he should still live forever and not see the pit.”—Ps. 49:7, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The gift of eternal life will not come from any human, only from God. So do not let anyone divert you from taking in knowledge of God. Indeed, although some may oppose you, in time, with patience and tact on your part, and with evidence that your life has been changed for the better by your knowledge of God, it may influence such opposers to accept God and his Word.—1 Pet. 3:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Also, what good would you do for opposers by going along with them to certain disaster? If you were on a train headed for a crash, could you do anyone on it any good by staying with the train just because others refuse to leave? All you would do is lose your own life. So staying with this system as it heads toward its end will not benefit anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">No Time to Lose</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The end of this wicked system is approaching rapidly. It is much later than most people realize. Hence, there is no time to lose in working for survival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Do not be misled into thinking you can ignore the matter and that God will somehow favor you when the end comes. No, you cannot gain eternal life without God’s approval, and you cannot get God's approval without meeting his conditions: “Jehovah is with you as long as you prove to be with him; and if you search for him, he will let himself be found by you, but if you leave him he will leave you.”—2 Chron. 15:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Those who refuse to listen to God will not survive the end of this system. The Great Judge of all mankind now causes his wisdom to cry out and give warning: “Because I have called out but you keep refusing, . . . and you keep neglecting all my counsel, and my reproof you have not accepted, I also, for my part, shall laugh at your own disaster, I shall mock when what you dread comes, . . . and your own disaster gets here just like a stormwind, when distress and hard times come upon you. At that time they will keep calling me, but I shall not answer; they will keep looking for me, but they will not find me, for the reason that they hated knowledge, and the fear of Jehovah they did not choose. They did not consent to my counsel; they disrespected all my reproof. So they will eat from the fruitage of their way.”—Prov. 1:24-31.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Credit Cards—Convenient and Dangerous,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">But this will not be so for those who do take in knowledge of God, who listen to his counsel and reproof, and who then apply themselves to the doing of his will: “As for the one listening to me, he will reside in security and be undisturbed from dread of calamity.” (Prov. 1:33) Of this kind of person the Bible says: “The upright are the ones that will reside in the earth, and the blameless are the ones that will be left over in it.”—Prov. 2:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Do you want to be “left over” in the earth when this wicked system is annihilated soon at Armageddon? (Dan. 2: 44) Then begin taking in knowledge of God right away. How? By a systematic study of the Bible with those who love God’s Word and who live by it. Write to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font17"> magazine and request such a Bible study in the privacy of your own home. A qualified minister, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, will be sent to show you the most practical and beneficial way of understanding your Bible. There will be no cost of money to you. But it will cost some of your time, about one hour a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">You have no time to lose in making friends with God, because time is rapidly running out for this wicked system of things. It is very close to plunging into the chasm of Armageddon. Therefore, take steps quickly to work for survival and for eternal life in God’s new order.</span></p>

Over one hundred villages were said to have been destroyed or damaged and 100,000 persons left homeless. The mud-brick homes of peasants were crumbled easily by the earthquake, which was said to be as strong as the one six years ago that killed 12,000 people in Iran, These earthquakes remind us of Jesus’ words about what we might expect to see in the last days of this system of things. —Matt. 24:7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Orthodox Religion Dying</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;§&gt; At no time in history has the future of religion in Christendom been so uncertain. A profound revolution in religious thought is sweeping the churches. These were the conclusions of two noted Berkeley sociologists, Rodney Stark and Charles Gock. The authors pointed out that religious ferment and skepticism are not new, but the difference this time is that the challenge comes from Christian theologians. As for churchgoers, &quot;a near majority reject such traditional articles of faith as Christ's miracles, life after death, the promise of the Second Coming, the Virgin Birth, and an overwhelming majority reject the existence of the Devil.” These men add, “Sooner or later the churches will have to face the fact that orthodoxy is dead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Moral Standards Repudiated</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&quot;There has always been a widespread violation of moral standards. Today’s crisis is no different,” many persons assert. But there is a difference, as the distinguished Jewish philosopher Will Herberg observes: “The moral crisis of our time consists primarily not in the widespread violation of accepted moral standards —when has any age been free of that?—but in the repudia</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">tion of these very moral stan</span><span class="font15">dards themselves.*’ Explains Herberg: &quot;It is here that we find a breakdown in morality in a radical sense, in a sense almost without precedent in our western history.” It is the present unprecedented moral breakdown that the Bible pointed to as an identifying mark of “the last days.”—2 Tim. 3:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">World Diseases</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; According to the World Health Organization, the following is a table of various diseases in the world today and the number of persons afflicted by them: Schistosomiasis—200 million; fllariasis —190 million; hookworm—450 million ; onchocerciasis-50 million; Chagas’ disease —7 million; leprosy—11 million; trachoma—400 million.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Blood and Money</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; During World War II the United States reported 292,131 dead in battle and 115,185 dead from other causes, six times as many as were killed in action in World War I. The money costs of World War II are said to be $1,154,000,000,000 —with property damage, exclusive of that in China, coming to $230,900,000,000. There have been 39 wars fought since World War II. What a grand relief mankind will experience when God makes wars to cease from the earth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Alive for 4,000 Years</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;*&gt; The bristlecone pines </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">(Pinus aristatai</span><span class="font15"> that cling to the 11,000-foot arid peaks of the White Mountains of eastern California furnish remarkable proof that life can continue for thousands of years. A careful count of their growth rings reveal them to be older than the 3,500-year-old sequoias. So far, more than 1,000 trees have been found that exceed 4,000 years of age, indicating that some of these may have begun growing soon </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">after the great Noachian flood </span><span class="font15">of 2370 B.C.E. The bristlecone pines serve to strengthen one’s faith in the Bible’s promise of everlasting life in God's rapidly approaching new order of things. We are assured, &quot;like the days of a tree will the days of my [God’s] people be.” —Isa. 65:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Flood Verified</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">•$&gt; Alaska is the scene of discoveries that are of keen interest to Bible students and scientists alike. According to an editorial in the East Liverpool </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Review</span><span class="font15"> on July 26, &quot;scientists say vast herds of mastodons and other animals in the Arctic were killed without visible sign of violence, some of them before they could swallow a mouthful of food. And'they were frozen so quickly that every cell of their bodies was perfectly preserved. Some of the scientists believe </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">that a flood, as related in the Bible, caused the quick deaths. </span><span class="font15">They contend that a vast quantity of moisture suspended high above the earth created a ‘greenhouse effect’ which explains grass found in the stomachs of the frozen animals in the polar regions. When the water blanket suddenly crashed to the earth, it created the flood according to the theory. Then, with the insulating vapor removed, the polar regions suddenly were plunged into a ’deep freeze’ and millions of animals were quick-frozen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-talking Priests</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; Popes, as a rule, are not used to tongue-lashings at the hands of priests. When Pope Paul VI recently spoke out against too rapid changes in the Roman Catholic Church, the Catholic liberals did not hesitate to lash back at him verbally, while the conservatives looked on in horror. “The pope is afraid his position is being nibbled away at. He wants to stop anything he can. But he can't stop us anymore. We just don’t pay attention when he talks,” said a teaching priest. He went on to say that liberal priests want &quot;complete honesty” in the church, and added, &quot;but that’s something you just can’t have in this church.” Speaking for himself and other liberals, he went on to say: “The more the pope says, the more we have to disregard him. It’s exactly like the fabled credibility gap between the U.S. government and the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Criminal Society</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$■ There was an all-time high of 12,093 murders in the United States last year. Also, almost three times as many of America’s cars are stolen each year as are produced in the Soviet Union.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">The Bible need not be a mysterious book to you. Remember, it was not written for just a few men to read or to understand. God’s prophets, and the other men he moved by his spirit, were sent to speak to nations, to cities, to people in all walks of life. And what they spoke or saw in visions was written down for everyone and proclaimed far and wide so that all would know what God’s will for them was. Jesus did not speak in secret either. Nor did he confine his commission to teach to a few select men. He told them to go make disciples and teach them to do all the things he had given them to do. So, knowledge of the Bible, its moaning and its instruction, is available to anyone who is willing to study it with an open mind and to accept the principles and guides for living that it lays down. You can be one of such. Now free home Bible studies are being conducted with the aid of the book </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life.</span><span class="font17"> It is a book designed to make the Bible an open book to you.

It helps you to open your own Bible in your own home and locate the Bible texts that answer the perplexing questions raised by the problems of life in a world of violence, hatred and fear. It points you to Bible texts that explain God’s purpose for this earth, why he has permitted wickedness and how relief is certain to come in our own generation.

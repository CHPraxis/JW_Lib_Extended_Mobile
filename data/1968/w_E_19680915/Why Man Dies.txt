Why Man Dies
◆ The science editor for the New York Times, Walter Sullivan, observed: “The cells of our bodies (with a few exceptions, such as brain cells) are constantly replenishing themselves. It would seem that, barring accident or disease, this should continue indefinitely, but because of some subtle influence the replacement process is imperfect. This, the essence of aging, is now under intensive study. It is not inconceivable that it can be controlled.” What is that influence that results in death? The Bible shows that it is sin. (Rom. 5:12) Only God can relieve obedient ones of its effects.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Although the Bible is universally recognized as the best seller of all times, still it is a closed book to many. Language that is outdated and stiff, along with obscure translation, has discouraged most persons from Bible reading. That is all changed now with the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. Send for your copy today and receive free the timely booklet When All Nations Unite Under God’s Kingdom. Send only $1.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Happiness! Perfect health! Justice! Peace! To those who understand Bible prophecy these words have real meaning. They describe the millennial reign of Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:6-66:20:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rev. 20:6</a>) Jehovah’s Witnesses have made this hope their own and thus may be said to be on a joyful march to mankind’s millennium. They want to help others to join in this joyful march to mankind’s millennium. To that end, they urge everyone to read the Bible. During the month of June they will be calling at the homes of as many persons as possible to offer them a fine, modern-English Bible, the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>along with a Bible-study aid booklet, for just $1.</p>

“1969 YEAR BOOK” AND CALENDAR
The most encouraging report of the preaching of the good news ever released is to be found in the 1969 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. From the opening words of the Society’s president, through the detailed report of service activity in all lands where the preaching is carried on, down to the Bible texts and Watchtower comments for each day of 1969, this report is the best yet! And, of course, you will want the beautiful 1969 calendar illustrating the new year’s theme. The Yearbook is 50c. The calendar is 25c. Order after November 27.
FIELD MINISTRY
Bible prophecy and current events indicate that little time remains for this wicked system of things. How vital, then, for people to remember their Creator now, while there is opportunity! (Eccl. 12:1) Jehovah’s witnesses are wisely using their time in order to help others remember their Creator. An outstanding way they do this is by conducting home Bible studies. During the month of November they will be offering help to interested people by means of a free home Bible study. Additionally, as an aid in these Bible discussions, they will offer the fine new book that presents Bible truths so clearly—The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life—on a contribution of 25c.

A Drummer Becomes a Happy Witness
● In the Central African Republic a minister of Jehovah’s witnesses regularly passed by the home of a drummer. The drummer had been told by his priest to ignore Jehovah’s witnesses.
After some time, the drummer was reduced to extreme poverty. He even lost his shoes in a gambling game. But there was this same Witness passing by his home with a smile on his face and with shoes on his feet. The drummer began to do some serious thinking. “Why is it that I, a good Catholic, have nothing but problems, and this witness of Jehovah is always so happy?” A few days later he waited for the Witness on the road and asked him, “Why is there such a difference between us?” The minister gladly explained how Bible principles protect one. Now the drummer is a changed man, for he is one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He has cleaned up his life, legalized his marriage and, oh, yes, he is wearing shoes again.

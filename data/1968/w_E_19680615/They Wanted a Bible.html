<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In a certain section in Uganda, Africa, it is difficult to get persons who are studying the Bible to obtain their own personal copy of God’s Word due to the lack of money. One man who was invited to attend a group Bible study noticed that everyone there had his own copy of the Bible. This encouraged him to break his costly smoking habit and use the money he saved to obtain his own copy. In the same section there was a lady who was studying for many months without her own copy of the Bible. She wanted one very much, and finally she decided to cut meat out of her diet in order to save enough to get a Bible. After obtaining it she said: “Meat is not going to show me the way to everlasting life but this Bible is.” Truly such a person appreciates that man does not live on bread alone.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 4:4</a>.</p>

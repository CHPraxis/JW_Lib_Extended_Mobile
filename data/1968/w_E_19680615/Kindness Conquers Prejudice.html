<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● The apostle Paul advised Christians: “Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:21-45:12:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 12:21</a>) The practicalness of this counsel is seen in the experience had by one of Jehovah’s witnesses in Ghana, Africa, who did not let evil embitter and harden him. He applied the Bible’s instructions, and this is what happened:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">While going from door to door, he met a woman who heaped insults upon him, claiming that Jehovah’s witnesses are nothing but book sellers. She refused to listen to any explanation that he attempted to offer her and gruffly drove him off. The Witness left peacefully without any attempt to retaliate or answer her sharply. Later he happened to meet a little boy who was crying because his little friends did not share some of their sweets with him. Touched to the heart, the minister lovingly bought some sweets for him. Unknown to the Witness, this little lad was the son of the woman who had just insulted him so strongly at her door.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When the boy arrived home, he showed the sweets to his mother and explained that one of Jehovah’s witnesses had kindly given them to him. This caused the woman to feel very ashamed of her antagonistic and rude attitude so that she immediately went in search of the minister and apologized for her past rudeness. The minister took advantage of this opportunity to explain the Bible’s message, and a Bible study was arranged and conducted in her home regularly. Today this woman is a dedicated servant of Jehovah God. Kindness triumphed over prejudice.</p>

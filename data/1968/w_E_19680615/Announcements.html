<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Happiness! Perfect health! Justice! Peace! Those words seem to have little meaning in a world frayed with tension, sickness, injustice and war. But to those who understand Bible prophecy these words have real meaning. They describe conditions that will soon fill the earth under the millennial reign of Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:6-66:20:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rev. 20:6</a>) Jehovah’s witnesses have made this hope their own and thus may be said to be on a joyful march to mankind’s millennium. They want to help others to learn about the prophecies that will encourage them to join in this joyful march to mankind’s millennium. To that end, they urge everyone to read the Bible. During the month of June they will be calling at the homes of as many persons as possible to offer them a fine, modern-English Bible, the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>along with a Bible-study aid booklet, for just $1.</p>

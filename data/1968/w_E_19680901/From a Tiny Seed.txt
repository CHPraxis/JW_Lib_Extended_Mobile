From a Tiny Seed
‚óè A seed of a giant sequoia tree of California weighs only 1/3,000th of an ounce. But from such tiny seeds grow trees well over 200 feet high. One such tree is 272 feet tall and it has a base circumference of over a hundred feet, meaning that it would take about seventeen men with outstretched arms to encircle it. It is just one example of the handiwork of God.

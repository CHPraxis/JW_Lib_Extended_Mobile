<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Mankind today is imperiled. How so? Because of the destruction that Almighty God will soon bring upon this system of things and upon all who share in its bloodguilt. To escape being destroyed and to find security, one needs to put one’s trust in Christ’s ransom sacrifice and then to follow closely in the footsteps of Jesus Christ. Only then can one say with the psalmist: “You yourself alone, O Jehovah, make me dwell in security.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:4:8-19:4:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 4:8</a>) Jehovah’s witnesses want to show imperiled mankind God’s provision for security, and during September they will do this in their ministry by offering one of their latest books for Bible study, and then arranging to provide free home Bible instruction for anyone who wants to understand God’s Word.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>CAN YOU TRUST ANYONE?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Would you respect someone who always kept a promise? who never violated his word and who was always seeking your welfare? Would you come to depend on someone who never lied to you, never misrepresented the facts, one who respected his own name and whose integrity could not be successfully challenged? Only the Almighty God could completely fulfill these high standards, though some people today question even his existence. Prove for yourself that God cannot lie and that your life depends upon your reliance upon him. Read <em>“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” </em>and <em>Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God. </em>Send only $1.

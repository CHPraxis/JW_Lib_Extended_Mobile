Wallet Recovered
◆ When members of the cleaning department first entered the Memorial Auditorium in Utica, New York, to prepare for the “Disciple-making” District Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses this past year, they discovered a wallet containing $62.
It was turned over to the assembly Lost and Found Department, and when no one claimed it by the conclusion of the assembly, it was turned over to the convention overseer, who went through it and found some identification and a phone number.
Upon calling the individual, it was discovered that he had lost the wallet on July 1, 1966, while attending a graduation a year before. The first thing he asked was: “Is there any money in it?”
He was asked: “How much did you have in it?”
He replied: “Sixty dollars.”
When he was told there was $62 in it now, he was speechless. He was greatly impressed by the honesty of Jehovah’s witnesses.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Youthful witnesses of Jehovah sometimes have their fine Christian conduct advertised in a most unusual and amusing manner. Consider the following report of an incident that took place in a Michigan junior high school:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Deborah and Betsy are both seventh graders. Today their regular teacher for their English class was absent. In desperation, the school had a Catholic priest with his collar turned backward fill in for the day. As usual with any substitute teacher, the students really gave him a difficult time by their misbehaving and disorderliness. However, Deborah and Betsy, who are Jehovah’s witnesses, were a sharp contrast by their fine behavior.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“In desperation, the Catholic priest, noticing these two students, turned to the class and cried out, ‘Why can’t you act like these two young ladies? They are so well behaved that they must be Catholics!’</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“One boy spoke up in reply, saying, ‘They are about as far as you can get from Catholics!’ When the priest was told that they were Jehovah’s witnesses he nearly died on the spot.”</p>

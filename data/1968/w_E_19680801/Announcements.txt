WOULD YOU CHANGE YOUR HEART?
Centuries ago King David prayed to God: “Create in me a clean heart.” (AV) What did he mean? He was certainly not requesting one of the heart transplants that have currently become so popular. The change he prayed for was expected to effect a far more lasting cure. He knew that he had been ‘born in sin’ and needed to be reconciled to God. That meant a complete changeover in thinking and in motives or desires—a change of heart. David was willing to fulfill God’s requirements. Are you? What does it take? Read Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God. This 416-page book is only 50c. Send now and receive free a timely booklet on a Bible subject.
FIELD MINISTRY
Those who have dedicated their lives to Jehovah God desire to magnify his name and aid their fellowmen to love and serve him. As the Bible shows, the “God of peace” equips his people as an organization “with every good thing” so they might perform his will. (Heb. 13:20, 21) So equipped, they pattern their ministry after that of Jesus and his apostles, calling from house to house to find persons interested in the Word of God. During August, they will be offering, in their house-to-house ministry, such Bible-study aids as the books “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” and Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God, on a contribution of 50c each, or either of these in combination with the book Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? for 75c.

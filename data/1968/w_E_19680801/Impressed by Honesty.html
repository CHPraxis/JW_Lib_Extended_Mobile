<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● While at the “Disciple-making” District Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Pomona, California, a delegate lost $1,000 worth of camera equipment. He reported the loss to the police department, but then found that it had been turned in to the assembly Lost and Found Department. He notified the police of this.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, the police department sent an officer out to the assembly Lost and Found Department to verify that the equipment had actually been returned. Upon learning that this expensive equipment had been turned in, he said: “If I hadn’t seen this, I wouldn’t believe it.” At that very moment a young child turned in some money that he had found. The officer was obviously impressed as he said: “If people everywhere were like this, I wouldn’t have a job very long.”</p>

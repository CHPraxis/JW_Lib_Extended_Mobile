<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In the United States a woman benefited from the wise use of Bible tracts. One of her workmates in her place of employment in Maryland was a witness of Jehovah. One day she asked the Witness questions about the various religions. Could they all be right? Since time was limited at her place of employment, the Witness gave her the Bible tracts <em>Which Is the Right Religion? </em>and <em>What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe?, </em>encouraging her to read them. After reading them, she wanted more information; and a home Bible study was started. Four months after first receiving the Bible tracts, this woman was attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall and sharing in the Kingdom ministry.</p>

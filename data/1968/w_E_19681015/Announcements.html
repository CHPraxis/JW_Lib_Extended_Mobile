<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>WHAT IS YOUR VIEW OF EVOLUTION?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What view do you take of the origin of life and the beginning of man’s existence? Do you hold to the commonly accepted teachings of evolution? What do you personally know of the evidence for the belief? In recent months hundreds, yes, thousands of persons have been amazed to learn that there is actually another side to this subject, an opposing one, yet one that has factual evidence to support it as well as reason and scientific argument. Obtain and examine carefully the book <em>Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? </em>It is only 25c. Your life and future are involved.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>FIELD MINISTRY</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Millions of persons are in bondage to superstition and false religion. Shackled by doctrines that are contrary to the Bible, they are in fear of mortal men and religious systems. But the truth that Jesus Christ taught can free them. All who would be free today and who would stay free spiritually need to follow that Fine Shepherd and walk in the paths of divine truth. First, however, people must wake up to their bondage to religious superstition and falsehood. To help people wake up and break free and stay free by means of God’s truth, Jehovah’s witnesses are offering in their ministry during the month of October a year’s subscription for the <em>Awake! </em>magazine, with three Bible-study-aid booklets, on a contribution of $1.</p>

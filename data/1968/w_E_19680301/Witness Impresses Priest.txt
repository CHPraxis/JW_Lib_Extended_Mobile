Witness Impresses Priest
In the U.S. Catholic magazine of December 1966 a Catholic priest wrote what he thought of one of Jehovah’s witnesses who called at his door. He said: “If only I and others in the Church had the missionary zeal of this Jehovah[’s] Witness! His courage and fervor were reminiscent of John the Baptist (Gospel). The witness, also named John . . . , is only eighteen years old. He finished high school and left home in another state to come here and do missionary work. He attends five meetings a week, gives one hundred hours a month to home visiting and he supports himself. For a living he scrubs floors for stores, taking this evening work so he can visit homes during the day. He is living a life of dedication and self-sacrifice.” Not only this young man but thousands like him, young and old, are living a life of dedication and sacrifice, doing this out of love for God and their neighbors. In view of the times, they are putting forth strenuous efforts to help men escape the impending destruction of this wicked system of things. Listen to the Bible message they bring to you.

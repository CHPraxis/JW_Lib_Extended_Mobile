Letting Down Our Nets for the Catch
CHRISTIANS are to be “fishers of men,” even as Jesus told Peter and Andrew when he invited them to follow him. That a great ‘fishing’ work would be done Jesus indicated in his parable of the dragnet. Jesus’ instruction to his early disciples may therefore well be applied to his followers today, namely, “You men, let down your nets for a catch.”—Matt. 4:18-22; 13:47-50; Luke 5:4.a
How is this ‘fishing’ work done? By discipling people of all nations in obedience to Jesus’ instructions found at Matthew 28:19, 20.
In view of the nearness of the end of this system of things it is more urgent than ever before to do all the discipling that can possibly be done. True, some Christian “fishers of men” find that it takes more work to catch ‘fish’ due to their having long ‘fished’ in the same waters. Because of this not a few, such as missionaries, pioneer ministers and even entire families, have moved to places where the need is greater.
Christian ‘fishermen’ unable to transfer to more productive waters will do well to remember that, while they need to keep ‘fishing’ in the same waters, they need not keep fishing in the same manner. They can seek ways of improving their effectiveness by making their presentations more interesting, more appealing. Important also is showing a fine spirit of friendliness, making householders feel at ease. Perseverance is also required, if one would have success.
So, those who share in this fishing work and who are able to move to more fruitful waters are urged to do so. If not, then they can persevere with friendliness, tact and resourcefulness, letting down their nets for the catch right where they are!

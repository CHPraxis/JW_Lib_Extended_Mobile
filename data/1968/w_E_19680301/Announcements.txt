FIELD MINISTRY
As “fishers of men,” Jehovah’s witnesses obey the Lord Jesus Christ, so during March they will continue to ‘let down their nets for a catch’ by sharing in the ministry. (Matt. 4:19; Luke 5:4) As they do so, they will offer to all persons a year’s subscription for The Watchtower, along with three booklets, for $1; or a year’s subscription for both The Watchtower and Awake!, along with six booklets, for $2.
THEIR BENEFITS PROVIDE THE ANSWER
Ten million fifty thousand copies each issue! That is the combined circulation of The Watchtower and Awake! each printing! What accounts for the consistent interest in these two internationally known magazines? Why has this circulation increased over 65 percent in the last ten years? The magazines themselves provide the answer. Read them regularly and share in the advantages and benefits they offer. Send only $2. Both will be sent for one year. Write now and receive free the booklets When God Is King over All the Earth, “Peace Among Men of Good Will” or Armageddon—Which?, World Government on the Shoulder of the Prince of Peace, What Has God’s Kingdom Been Doing Since 1914?, When All Nations Unite Under God’s Kingdom and “This Good News of the Kingdom.”

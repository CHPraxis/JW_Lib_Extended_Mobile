<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Having benefited by faith in God’s provision for the salvation of mankind by means of Christ’s blood, Jehovah’s witnesses have the privilege to advocate this means of salvation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:14-58:9:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 9:14</a>) In fact, they consider it their duty to advocate Christ’s blood for mankind’s salvation to all to whom they have the opportunity to witness, either in their regular field ministry or incidentally at other times. As an aid toward doing this during the month of May, they will offer in their house-to-house ministry the two Bible-study aids <em>“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” </em>and <em>Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation?, </em>both for 75c.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>LIFE’S ORIGIN, ENIGMA OF AGES</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The origin of life has been debated for centuries, and to many it still remains a mystery. Is your mind at ease on the subject? Perhaps you have accepted the popular concept of evolution without even realizing that there can be and is a concrete case of factual argument in favor of direct creation as the origin of man. The book <em>Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? </em>presents the arguments of both concepts and answers the questions solely on the basis of available facts, not simply opinion. To read this book is to receive an entirely new perspective on the origin of life. Send today and receive also the book <em>Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God </em>and the booklet <em>“Look! I Am Making All Things New.” </em>Send only 75c.</p>

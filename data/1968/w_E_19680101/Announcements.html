<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What is success? Certainly it cannot be measured in money. It is a succeeding in any worthwhile effort. So the good results of a minister’s work indicate success in his preaching. The number of converts alone is not the answer. Though increase world wide in numbers baptized by Jehovah’s witnesses during 1967 is close to an all-time peak, the report of faithful service in the face of increasing opposition will also stand as a part of the permanent record of the successful ministry of these modern-day servants of Jehovah God. Get your copy of the <em>1968 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </em>Send only 50c. Send also for the 1968 calendar, only 25c.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>FIELD MINISTRY</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The faithful men of old times, such as Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the other prophets, endured many trials in proving their faith and love for God. Was it because they were powerful physically? No, but, rather, it was mainly their powerful spiritual condition, their faith, that enabled them to serve and please God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:32-58:11:34" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 11:32-34</a>) The same is true with Jehovah’s Christian witnesses today. Though having physical limitations, it is powerful spirituality that enables them to endure successfully the tests of faith in these critical times. Thousands of persons have been aided by them to gain such spirituality through the faith-strengthening magazine <em>The Watchtower</em>. Throughout January, Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering to all interested persons a year’s subscription for this Bible magazine, along with three Bible booklets, for $1.</p>

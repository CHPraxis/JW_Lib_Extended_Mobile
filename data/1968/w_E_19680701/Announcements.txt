FIELD MINISTRY
Jehovah’s people have long rejoiced in the victories of their God Jehovah. In harmony with the prophecy at Psalm 68:24 they want men everywhere to see Jehovah’s victory processions. All the preaching that Jehovah’s people do throughout the earth today is really a part of the foretold victory processions. In carrying on their preaching work during July, Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering Bible study-aid publications from house to house. The offer will be the book Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God, with a booklet, on a contribution of 50c.
WHY THE CRY FOR FREEDOM?
Why do men want to be free? Is it just a revolt against subjection to authority? Is it a chafing under restrictions? In many instances it is, prompted by a selfish ambition to be under no restraints from anyone. But such a condition is not possible. Those with such desires only enslave themselves to their own sinful tendencies and the bad results that follow. However, true freedom is indeed a release, with prospects of unending blessings. How will it be realized? Read Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God and “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.” Send now and receive free two timely booklets. Only $1.

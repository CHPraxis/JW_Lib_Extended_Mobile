<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah’s people have long rejoiced in the victories of their God Jehovah. In harmony with the prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:68:24-19:68:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 68:24</a> they want men everywhere to see Jehovah’s victory processions. All the preaching that Jehovah’s people do throughout the earth today is really a part of the foretold victory processions. In carrying on their preaching work during July, Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering Bible study-aid publications from house to house. The offer will be the book <em>Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God, </em>with a booklet, on a contribution of 50c.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>WHY THE CRY FOR FREEDOM?</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Why do men want to be free? Is it just a revolt against subjection to authority? Is it a chafing under restrictions? In many instances it is, prompted by a selfish ambition to be under no restraints from anyone. But such a condition is not possible. Those with such desires only enslave themselves to their own sinful tendencies and the bad results that follow. However, true freedom is indeed a release, with prospects of unending blessings. How will it be realized? Read <em>Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God </em>and <em>“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.” </em>Send now and receive free two timely booklets. Only $1.</p>

He Made the Bones Too
● In commenting on his own marvelous creations, Jehovah called Job’s attention to the hippopotamus, saying that its bones are like “wrought-iron rods” and “tubes of copper.” (Job 40:18) Just as marvelous is the miniature stapes or stirrup bone in the human ear. It measures only 2.6 to 3.4 millimeters (0.10 to 0.17 of an inch) in length, and it weighs only 2.0 to 4.3 milligrams (0.03 to 0.065 of a grain). The God who made the massive leg bones of the hippopotamus made the tiny stapes too.

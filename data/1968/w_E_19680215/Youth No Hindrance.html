<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● While the Bible is recognized as the greatest storehouse of wisdom and the embodiment of correct religious doctrine, it does not necessarily require old age and much experience to grasp some of its fundamental truths. As the young man Elihu once said: “It is not those merely abundant in days that prove wise, nor those just old that understand judgment.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:32:9-18:32:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 32:9</a>) This was exemplified by the experience related at a recent circuit assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. A young eleven-year-old girl said:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I have always wanted at least a small part in making disciples of people of all nations. But since my baptism I wanted more—I wanted to conduct a Bible study with someone. Last summer the time came. I had placed a Bible and <em>‘This Good News of the Kingdom’ </em>booklet with a lady just three blocks from home. So Kathy, my younger sister, and I could go all by ourselves to make the return call.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“We prepared well before we left to make the call. The lady agreed to let us study with her. Because of her work our studies were sometimes cut short. But all summer long we stopped our playing, cleaned up and went regularly on this study. After going through several booklets we took up the <em>‘Impossible to Lie’ </em>book. By this time her interest had increased so much that the questions she asked were too much for me to answer, so my mother came along to help out. The result? The lady now comes to the Kingdom Hall regularly and witnesses to relatives.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“The part I like best is that she was puzzled as to why I insisted on her getting her lessons studied. Now she realizes that this is what she has searched for all her life, and I had a part in helping her.”</p>

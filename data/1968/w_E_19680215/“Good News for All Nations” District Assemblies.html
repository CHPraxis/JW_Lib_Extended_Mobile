<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“IN ALL the nations the good news has to be preached first,” declared the great Prophet, Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:10-41:13:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 13:10</a>) Jehovah’s witnesses, who are keenly interested in bringing the Kingdom good news to all nations, as well as other interested persons will be glad to know that the Watch Tower Society has now completed most of the arrangements for the 1968 assemblies, the “Good News for All Nations” District Assemblies.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This will be a four-day assembly, the program getting under way early Thursday afternoon. You will want to be there in time for the chairman’s address, which will be of special interest. In fact, the whole program Thursday afternoon is going to be one with exceptional features that none of you will want to miss; and we are sure that any of you who have attended a convention in recent years will know what we mean. So if you are not there the first day, you will learn later that you have missed out on a most delightful portion of the spiritual feast being provided.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Of course, not all that is of special interest will take place on Thursday. On Friday something is planned that will not only delight you but also no doubt surprise you, for it will have considerable influence on the work that we will be doing during the years to come. And with the weekend, things will not slow down, for there will be more fine features that none of you will want to miss.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">So plan now; seek Jehovah’s blessing on your arrangements that you may be able to attend all four days of this grand spiritual feast. Unless otherwise indicated, the programs for the assemblies will be in English, but, as you will note, some of the assemblies will provide a program in Spanish or another language. Assemblies for all of the United States, Canada, Bermuda and the British Isles are listed below.</p>

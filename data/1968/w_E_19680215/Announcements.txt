FIELD MINISTRY
Many persons today express a desire to have contentment, but very few really have it. Why? Because real contentment comes from knowing and serving the true God, Jehovah. Jehovah’s witnesses enjoy this contentment and are happy to aid others to possess it. During February, as they share in their Christian ministry, they will offer to all persons the outstanding aid to godly contentment, The Watchtower, with three booklets on a $1 contribution.

Have you considered all the evidences on both sides? Read this thought-provoking book. Send only 25c.

<p><span class="font4">of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The great proclaimer of the kingdom of God, Jesus Christ, had been preaching this message for nearly three and one-half years and now it was only three days before he would be dying on the torture stake on Calvary. Four of his disciples, Peter, Andrew, James and John, all of whom were fishermen by trade but who had been made fishers of men, were with him on the Mount of Olives. But they did not appreciate that Jesus would be killed. Jesus had done well in his preaching and teaching work in this short period of time, for there were many who were faithfully following him. This is proved by the fact that at Pentecost, forty days after Jesus’ resurrection from the dead, one hundred and twenty disciples were awaiting instructions in Jerusalem when the holy spirit descended upon them. Then on that very same day when the apostle Peter spoke to a great crowd of Jews, there were 3,000 more that put faith in Christ Jesus and were begotten by holy spirit. These were baptized in water. Jesus’ ministry proved to be a great witness for the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Would these four particular disciples, who were keenly interested in when Jesus’ kingdom would be in operation, give a good witness in their lifetime? Jesus had just been telling them that not one stone would be left upon another as far as the temple in Jerusalem was concerned, for destruction was due to come to that system of</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">things. “When will these things be,” asked the disciples, “and what will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?”—Matt. 24:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What Jesus told those four disciples is recorded in the 24th and 25th chapters of Matthew, Mark the 13th chapter and Luke the 21st chapter. Read these chapters, please. It will certainly cause you to think! We feel that you will be able to comprehend that what Jesus was telling his disciples 1,935 years ago has had fulfillment in at least part of your lifetime. The complete fulfillment was not in the year 70 C.E. In fact, if you will think back to the year 1914, or read the history of that year when World War I started, you will see that what Jesus said in prophecy is what has come to pass in our day. His words are: “For nation will make war upon nation, kingdom upon kingdom; there will be famines and earthquakes in many places. With all these things the birthpangs of the new age begin.” (Matt. 24:7, 8, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New English Bible)</span><span class="font12"> Surely you can see that things have changed since 1914. Historians can!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After describing other terrible things that would occur in the days in which we now live, Jesus emphasized a very important feature by saying: “And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the earth as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come.” (Matt. 24:14, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">NEB) It</span><span class="font12"> is interesting to note that Jesus told his disciples that after the “birth-pangs of the new age” begin it would also be the time for the gospel of the Kingdom to be proclaimed throughout all the earth as a testimony to all the nations. But how great a witness would it prove to be before the new age begins?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As far as Jesus’ own proclamation of the good news of the Kingdom was concerned, it was confined to Palestine. But three and one-half years after Jesus’ death Peter, one of the four disciples present at the Mount of Olives, was directed to go to Cornelius in Caesarea. Ever since that time people of all nations, Gentiles and Jews, have been invited to accept the kingdom of the heavens as the only hope for everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many persons since Cornelius’ conversion have believed in Christ Jesus, and have accepted him as their Redeemer and have walked in his footsteps. When we read the Acts of the Apostles we see what those early Christians did as compared with what so-called Christians are doing today, and what a contrast there is! Christendom today has lost the message of God’s kingdom. The majority of people do not believe what the Holy Scriptures say. Even though little children are taught to pray: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth,” they really do not get the full meaning of these words; and when grown up and becoming adults, they believe evolution or agree that God is dead. Why do they attend church services? They do not want to talk to anyone about the Bible or listen to a person that does. And most certainly they do not believe the good news of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So this matter of belief in God’s kingdom, or His government to be established to rule the earth in the same way that heaven is ruled by God, seems farfetched to most people. Still, over nineteen hundred years ago, Jesus said to four of his disciples on the Mount of Olives: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached . . . and then the end will come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When have you heard someone, your minister, your priest or your neighbor, talk to you about God’s kingdom? When was the last time that you discussed the Bible with someone really interested in this good news of God’s kingdom? If you profess to be a Christian, do you talk about the Kingdom, so as to share in preaching about it, thus giving a witness concerning that Kingdom to all nations? Or, perhaps you are asking yourself, ‘What is this Kingdom? What will it do?’ Let us take a moment to see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The kingdom of God is certainly not any of the governments of this present system of things. In fact, Jesus in speaking to Pontius Pilate said: “My kingdom is no part of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought that I should not be delivered up to the Jews. But, as it is, my kingdom is not from this source.” (John 18:36) So the Kingdom cannot be an earthly government. Years before Jesus ever came to earth the prophet Daniel wrote about this kingdom of God and said: “In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin. And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite.” (Dan. 2:44) That is good news! “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin.” The kingdom that Jesus was speaking about was this kingdom that the God of heaven would set up. “The kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people,” but the inhabitants of the earth would come under its rule and be blessed by it. The apostle Peter appreciated and understood this, because he wrote: “There are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.”—2 Pet. 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Do you not see that this generation in which we are living is experiencing what Jesus said about wars, famine, earthquakes and other troubles, and that “with all these things the birthpangs of the new age begin”? Revelation 21:1-4 records what this new order of things will do: “I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away ... I heard a loud voice from the throne say: ‘Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more. The former things have passed away.’ ” A kingdom that will do that for mankind is worth proclaiming to all the inhabited earth! But this kingdom will do more than that. When the King Jesus Christ speaks to those in their graves, the scripture tells us, “all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.” (John 5:28, 29) God’s kingdom will bring everlasting life to all those who love him. Remember, “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) The question is, Do you believe? Remember what the wise man wrote, in Proverbs 12:28: “In the path of righteousness there is life, and the journey in its pathway means no death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">EXAMINING THE FACTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We would like to review with you a bit of history to see how great a witness to all the nations about God’s kingdom has been given, and who is giving such witness. As far back as December of 1888 the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font12"> magazine stated: “Notwithstanding the fact that sectarianism has blinded the hearts of the vast majority of those who own Christ’s name, so that they cannot appreciate the real good tidings of the coming Kingdom of God and the blessed work it is to accomplish, yet God has so arranged that the gospel itself is being preached (declared), as a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">‘witness,’</span><span class="font12"> for use in the coming age.” Even then, in 1888, the Watch Tower Society saw the need for declaring the good news of God’s kingdom. Its first president, Charles T. Russell, after visiting many foreign missions of the Protestant religions, said, however, that his “observations have led to a careful reconsideration of the entire subject of gospel missionary work.” In discussing Matthew 24:14 he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The word </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">gospel,</span><span class="font11"> here, is emphatic in the Greek, and so is the word </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">kingdom.</span><span class="font11"> It is not any and every good message, but a special one—This </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">good</span><span class="font11"> message of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font11"> Kingdom—which must first be preached before the end of this age. We ask whether this has yet been done, and reply, No. That which is generally preached under the name </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">gospel</span><span class="font11"> has little in it that is really good tidings, and nothing whatever in it about the kingdom that our Lord promised should be ‘set up’ in the end of the Gospel age, to bless all the families of the earth during the Millennial age. Catholics and Protestants, although they use our Lord’s prayer, saying, ‘Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven,’ do not expect such a kingdom, and hence are not preaching it in all or in any of the nations of the world. . . . Thus this work is still open to be done and can be done by no others than those who know something of these good tidings of the kingdom.”—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font11"> January 1, 1892, page 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Russell saw the real need of getting this good news of the Kingdom preached because it was not being done. But how great a witness in all nations must be given concerning this kingdom? To get the good news of the Kingdom preached Pastor Russell encouraged colporteur work. In November 1891 the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font12"> magazine emphasized the colporteur work in an article that encouraged Christians to enter full-time service, preaching the good news of the Kingdom. It said: “This preaching of the Kingdom from house to house, which seems to be the work now most favored of the Lord and most productive of good results, much resembles that done by those sent out during the harvest at the first advent; only that here it is not the natural eyes that are opened, but the eyes of men’s understanding. . . . For information as to Colporteur supplies, suitable territory, etc., address Tower Tract Society, ‘Bible House,’ Allegheny, Pa.”—</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font12"> November 1891, inside last page.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Today this colporteur work, called pioneer service, is. still in operation and the Society has about 50,000 Christian witnesses of Jehovah in all parts of the earth devoting their full time to preaching the Kingdom good news. Missionaries are sent to all parts of the world to declare the good news of the Kingdom. The witness work in these “last days” has greatly expanded over that done in the days when Pastor Russell and those associated with him began such activity, but he felt the urgency for this good news of the Kingdom to be preached first to all the nations, after which the end would come.—Mark 13:10; Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A campaign for stepping up public speaking world wide was organized in those early days of the Society, and all the publicity that accompanied it directed the attention of the people to this good news of the Kingdom and that it must be preached. In the year 1912 motion pictures were becoming popular and it was recognized that they were a good medium through which to reach the masses of the people. Pastor Russell began preparation of the Photo-Drama of Creation, using slides and films, and it was shown around the world in many languages. Even in those early days Pastor Russell did something that was unique. He not only showed the motion pictures, but simultaneously ran speech phonograph records to tell the story as the slides and some motion pictures were being shown. He had sound with film. Millions saw the Photo-Drama of Creation, and it directed the attention of the people to the good news of the kingdom of God as the only hope for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A CHANGE IN OVERSEEKS</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On October 31, 1916, Pastor Russell died, and on January 6, 1917, J. F. Rutherford was elected to the presidency of the Watch Tower Society. The preaching of this good news of the Kingdom was uppermost in J. F. Rutherford’s mind and in the minds of all those who had to do with the Society’s work. By 1917 Jehovah’s witnesses had clearly seen that Matthew 24:7, 8 was having fulfillment. Nation had risen against nation. The war was world wide, involving all the kingdoms of this earth. Surely these things were the birth pangs of the “new age.” Due to the energetic efforts of the Society in declaring the good news of God’s kingdom, false religionists in America conspired, and charges were brought against the officers of the Society to the effect that they were against the government. On June 21, 1918, J. F. Rutherford and seven other members of the Watch Tower Society were sentenced to eighty years’ imprisonment on the charge of sedition. An executive committee was appointed and the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font12"> magazine continued to be published during these troublesome years, and not one issue of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font12"> magazine failed to appear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The conviction against J. F. Rutherford and others was appealed and finally heard on April 14, 1919. On May 14, 1919, the erroneous convictions of the preceding summer were reversed. In remanding the case for retrial, Judge Ward stated in the opinion: “The defendants in this case did not have the temperate and impartial trial to which they were entitled, and for that reason the judgment is reversed.” </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">( Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose,</span><span class="font12"> page 86, column 2) The case was never retried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By the summer of 1918, though, the once firm and strong voice of the witnesses for Jehovah and his kingdom was pretty well silenced. Their organized work around the world was figuratively killed and deathlike inactivity came over this once energetic band of Christians. (See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose,</span><span class="font12"> pages 61, 80, 83.) According to the best records available, there were in 1918 only 3,868 persons reporting to the Society as going from house to house and preaching with bound books the good news of the Kingdom in some fourteen countries of the world. It was not long, however, before things changed. Jesus’ prophecy was due to come true, that “also, in all the nations the good news has to be preached first,” before the end of this system of things will come.—Mark 13:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To get things going again a grand convention of Jehovah’s witnesses was held September 1-8, 1919, at Cedar Point, Ohio, and, as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font12"> reported, the cry of God’s servants was: “What more is there that we can do?” At this convention there was an announcement made that a new magazine under the title “The Golden Age” was to be published. It was pointed out that the magazine would carry current events together with the Scriptural explanation of the same. Jehovah’s people were told that never before was there such distress and perplexity in the earth. The panacea for these human ills was to be found only in the message of the Kingdom and it was shown how the Lord’s ambassadors were granted the privilege and opportunity of delivering this message of consolation. To all those attending the assembly it was pointed out: “You are an ambassador of the King of kings and Lord of lords, announcing to the people in this dignified manner the incoming of the Golden Age, the glorious kingdom of our Lord and Master, for which true Christians have hoped and prayed for many centuries.” </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Watch Tower,</span><span class="font12"> September 15, 1919, page 281) Then the July 1, 1920, issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font12"> page 200, in its first article, entitled “Gospel of the Kingdom,” emphasized this point: “The gospel means good news. The good news here is concerning the end of the old order of things and the establishment of Messiah’s kingdom. ... It means that Satan’s empire is falling, never to rise again. ... A modern translation of this text illuminates it: ‘And this good news of the kingdom shall be proclaimed throughout the whole world to set the evidence before the Gentiles, and then the end shall come’. Plainly this would seem to indicate that now the church must engage in the proclamation of this good news as a witness to the nations of earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The zeal of these witnesses of Jehovah did not slacken, but, rather, they saw a great work ahead and they put their hands and hearts to it. In the year 1921 a very fine publication was released, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font12"> which reached, in a few short years, a circulation of 5,819,037 copies in twenty-two languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From September 5-13, 1922, a second convention was held in Cedar Point, Ohio, with an average attendance each day of 10,000. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font12"> of November 1, 1922, page 325, reported that a resolution was adopted on Sunday, September 10, part of which read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“But we hold and declare that Messiah’s kingdom is the complete panacea for all the ills of humankind and will bring peace on earth and good will to men, the desire of all nations; that those who yield themselves willingly to his righteous reign now begun will be blessed with lasting peace, life, liberty and endless happiness. Therefore we bring to the peoples of earth God’s message of good tidings contained in the Bible, his Word of truth. . . . the old world, under the control of Satan, has ended and is being rapidly broken in pieces, to make way for the everlasting kingdom of righteousness now being set up, and that millions of people now living on earth, if obedient to the laws of that righteous kingdom, will continue to live and never die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A few days prior to the passing of that resolution telling the nations to “make way for the everlasting kingdom,” J. F. Rutherford delivered a discourse on the subject “The Kingdom.” But even before this discourse, throughout the convention grounds in Cedar Point, Ohio, there were on display three large letters, “ADV.” Many con-ventioners were venturing guesses as to what the “ADV” meant. They found out when the lecture “The Kingdom” was delivered. As Judge Rutherford came to the climax of his talk and he was finishing, with the words, “Advertise, advertise, advertise, the King and his kingdom,” a large banner unfolded over the platform with the words “Advertise the King and Kingdom.” Of course, everyone immediately connected the “ADV” with “Advertise,” but it was the thing that they were to advertise that was all-important. The Kingdom! This truly was the keynote of the convention, and every dedicated person there felt the force of the message. The most important thing in life for each one to do was to declare this good news of the Kingdom. Every dedicated Christian was to be a publicity agent for the King and the Kingdom. What enthusiasm ran through the crowd! One could feel the spirit of God directing his people to push ahead with this Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The spirit of this convention had a telling effect. Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere felt the urgency of declaring the good news of God’s kingdom first before the end of the system of things. Certainly the birth pangs of this “new age” had begun with World War I and its aftermath of famine, pestilence and earthquakes, along with persecution of true Christians and the loss of faith on the part of Christendom. The greater number of so-called Christians were no longer looking at God’s Word as truth. It was becoming more evident that man’s love for his fellowman was growing cold. Look how much man’s love for one another has cooled off since 1914 and down to 1968. This, however, could not be allowed to affect the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, for they know that those who have endured to the end are the ones that will be saved.—Matt. 24:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To advertise the King and Kingdom was the work Jehovah’s witnesses had to do. Every method should be used to do so. One method was the radio. So the Society built a radio station. On February 24, 1924, the Watch Tower Society began broadcasting over its own radio station, WBBR, located on Staten Island, New York city. In this area ten million people could be reached with the Kingdom message. During the years that followed, other radio stations were built throughout the United States, some were purchased and great networks of radio stations were arranged for and used to broadcast ‘the good news of God’s kingdom.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By the year 1928 as a result of the use of numerous methods to advertise the kingdom of God many people had listened and were fleeing from Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion. Throughout the world there were now, on an average, 23,988 Christian witnesses of Jehovah engaging in the preaching work from house to house every month in 32 countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PREACHING NOT DONE WITHOUT OPPOSITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During all the years following the closing down of the work in 1918 and now its revival in 1919, there was strong opposition to the ministry of Jehovah’s witnesses. Persecution continued after World War I. As late as 1929 there were 1,660 legal proceedings taken against the witnesses of Jehovah in Germany. In Hungary, Jehovah’s witnesses were not even permitted to assemble for public meetings or to have private meetings. In Italy there was no preaching activity reported at all because it was almost impossible to do the work in that Roman Catholic country under dictatorship. In Spain the clergy pressed very hard against the few Witnesses who had penetrated into the mountainous regions of that country to declare the good news. One bishop in Spain, according to the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">1929 Yearbook,</span><span class="font12"> “lamented the fact that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font12"> not only is being distributed but will surely continue to be so, unless the authorities take the matter in hand.” Despite these troubles and many more in other countries, Jehovah’s Christian witnesses stuck to their Kingdom preaching activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Again in 1931 at a convention in Columbus, Ohio, July 24-30, Jehovah’s witnesses went on record as ‘unhesitatingly declaring their entire allegiance and devotion to Jehovah God and his kingdom.’ In that same year, on July 28, a booklet was published entitled “The Kingdom, the Hope of the World” and, during the month of October, a personal visit was made on every clergyman, politician and big business man that could be reached in the territories where Jehovah’s witnesses resided and a copy of this booklet was delivered to each one free. Within a few years after the release of this booklet in 1931 its circulation had reached 10,203,752 copies in thirty-eight languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the years that followed, a tremendous program of broadcasting the message of God’s kingdom by radio was undertaken. In the one year of 1934 there was a total of 23,783 lectures broadcast on radio stations, and during that year the Society introduced the portable phonograph, which was used by Jehovah’s witnesses when going from house to house. The Kingdom message was reproduced on four-and-a-half-minute records and Jehovah’s witnesses played these for the people in their homes. Large electrical transcription machines with power amplifiers were also used to reproduce these speech recordings so that thousands of people could hear in towns and villages. With all this intensive work to advertise the King and Kingdom, opposition grew in many countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">1931^ Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span><span class="font12"> reported how the police of Germany occupied the Society’s property in Magdeburg. In June of 1933 the Society’s large printing plant in Germany was closed by order of the government. The government had forbidden any meetings by Jehovah’s witnesses throughout Germany. They confiscated all the literature that they could lay their hands on and tried to stop the distribution of the Kingdom message in any form. Would this drastic move again trigger people to deliver the Christian witnesses of Jehovah up to tribulation and would they kill them and make them objects of hatred by all the nations? (Matt. 24: 9) Read for yourself how world opposition rose against Jehovah’s witnesses again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Publishers preaching the good news of the Kingdom were brought into the courts world wide and were charged with selling without a license, disturbing the peace, peddling without a permit, violating the Sunday sabbath law, and so forth. They were classed as solicitors rather than ministers of the gospel. But Jehovah’s witnesses did not slacken in their zeal and determination to advertise the King and the Kingdom. In fact, the persecution against Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany became so intense as the build-up for World War II gathered momentum that the Christian witnesses of Jehovah in fifty countries sent cables of protest addressed to Hitler and his government concerning the persecution of their fellow workers in Germany. It caused a terrifying impact on the Hitler government. We would like to quote from the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose,</span><span class="font12"> page 142, regarding a sworn account of what actually did take place in Hitler’s presence October 7, 1934, as a result of this flood of protests. Karl R. A. Wittig said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“On October 7, 1934, having been previously summoned, I visited Dr. Wilhelm Frick, at that time Minister of the Interior of the Reich and Prussia, in his home office of the Reich, located in Berlin, 6 am Koenigsplatz, since I was a plenipotentiary of General Ludendorff. I was to accept communications, contents of which were an attempt to persuade General Ludendorff to discontinuance of his objection to the Nazi regime. During my discussion with Dr. Frick, Hitler suddenly appeared and began taking part in the conversation. When our discussion obligatorily dealt with the action against the International Bible Students Association [Jehovah’s witnesses] in Germany up until now, Dr. Frick showed Hitler a number of telegrams protesting against the Third Reich’s persecution of the Bible Students, saying: ‘If the Bible Students do not immediately get in line we will act against them using the strongest means.’ After which Hitler jumped to his feet and with clenched fists hysterically screamed: ‘This brood will be exterminated in Germany!’ Four years after this discussion I was able, by my own observations, to convince myself, during my seven years in protective custody in the hell of the Nazi’s concentration-camps at Sachsenhausen, Flossenburg and Mauthausen—I was in prison until released by the Allies—that Hitler’s outburst of anger was not just an idle threat. No other group of prisoners of the named concentration-camps was exposed to the sadism of the SS-soldiery in such a fashion as the Bible Students were. It was a sadism marked by an unending chain of physical and mental tortures, the likes of which no language in the world can express.”—Quoted from sworn statement made by Karl R. A. Wittig, November 13, 1947.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Why was Hitler so enraged against Jehovah’s witnesses? It was because they were uncompromisingly preaching the good news of God’s kingdom and would not heil Hitler nor look to Germany as the savior of mankind. Jehovah’s witnesses knew from God’s Word that Hitler, the Catholic, would not reestablish the Holy Roman Empire to reign for a thousand years, which was his aim. Jehovah’s witnesses were confident that soon the conclusion of this system of things would come and Jehovah’s kingdom through his Son, Christ Jesus, would reign for a thousand years. This they kept preaching to peoples of all nations for a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Even in the United States during the year 1934, 340 of Jehovah’s faithful Kingdom proclaimers had been arrested because they dared to preach from house to house. Many were imprisoned for the violation of some law that took away the freedom of speech, press and religion. By 1939 the number of Jehovah’s witnesses detained in prisons of the German Gestapo and concentration camps of Germany had grown to 6,000. With war hysteria world wide, in 1940 Canada banned Jehovah’s witnesses and tried to stop the preaching of the Kingdom. The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">19^1 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses,</span><span class="font12"> page 160, says: “Immediately following the arrival of the new Governor General into this country [Canada] from England, the Minister of Justice caused to be passed an order in council by the Governor General, which declared illegal the ‘Jehovah’s Witness Organization.’ ” That was on July 4, 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On June 3, 1940, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that school boards may require children in public schools to salute the flag or be excluded from school. This brought about another wave of persecution in the United States upon the Witnesses. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the American Legion, through mobs, took the law into their own hands and violently worked indescribable havoc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font12"> for 1941 on page 97 describes the persecution these groups caused in the United States:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Jehovah’s witnesses have been assaulted, beaten, kidnaped, driven out of towns, counties and states, tarred and feathered, forced to drink castor oil, tied together and chased like dumb beasts through the streets, castrated and maimed, taunted and insulted by demonized crowds, jailed by the hundreds without charge and held incommunicado and denied the privilege of conferring with relatives, friends or lawyers. Many other hundreds have been jailed and held in so-called ‘protective custody’; some have been shot in the nighttime; some threatened with hanging and beaten into unconsciousness. Numerous varieties of mob violence have occurred. Many have had their clothes torn from them, their Bibles and other literature seized and publicly burned; their automobiles, trailers, homes and assembly places wrecked and fired, resulting in damages totaling very many thousands of dollars.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And what was the reason for this ungodly treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses by so-called Christians in the United States of America? It was because Jehovah’s witnesses were preaching the good news of God’s kingdom the same as their fellow Witnesses were doing in all other parts of the world for a witness to all nations. It was another evidence that what Jesus said was true: “Then people will deliver you up to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be objects of hatred by all the nations on account of my name.” —Matt. 24:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Even in the neutral country of Switzerland, surrounded on every hand by the totalitarian rulers, the officials were forced by reason of fear to swoop down on the Bethel home in Berne and seize all the literature, driving away most of the members of the Bethel family.—See </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">191/.1 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses,</span><span class="font12"> page 168.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The small country of Estonia was taken over by the Russian government, and furthering Kingdom preaching in that country was difficult. Pressure was brought against the Watch Tower Society in Finland and every effort was made to stop the work there. A review could be made of the years 1939 to 1944 including countries of Europe, North America and Africa and many islands of the sea, South America and Asia, and it would be seen that heavy pressure was brought against Jehovah’s witnesses. They were made “objects of hatred by all the nations” on account of the name of Christ Jesus during the second world war. However, these faithful Christian witnesses of Jehovah continued to preach the good news of God’s kingdom everywhere they could in the inhabited earth, “for a witness to all the nations.” —Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To show you how some rightly viewed this preaching work of Jehovah’s witnesses away back in 1940, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Michigan Christian Advocate</span><span class="font12"> of August 8, 1940, said: “Here is a group that, in this year of our Lord 1940, is not ashamed to witness for Christ in an unmistakable manner. It believes in Jesus and makes it known. In a day when religion has taken on a kind of compromising sophistication, when some church members think membership an end instead of a beginning of witnessing for Christ, when all too many of us hesitate to speak a testimony for fear of embarrassment, these witnesses come on the contemporary scene as a challenge to our pagan complacency.” </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Yearbook</span><span class="font12"> of 1941, page 43) These are not our words, but they are true. Jehovah’s witnesses were not and are not “ashamed to witness for Christ.” Are you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To show the spirit of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses, listen to the account about a woman in Canada, well along in years, who was brought before the law courts of that land: “One elderly sister, too ill to attend her trial when first called, was eventually tried and found guilty. The magistrate, hypocritically pretending to extend mercy, said: ‘I find you guilty. I am going to suspend sentence on the understanding that you attend no more meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses, and distribute no more subversive literature.’ Her reply was published in the newspapers across Canada: ‘I will not deny Jehovah, nor will I agree not to do His will. So you may as well impose the sentence.’ She received a month in prison.” Would you be like her and the early Christians who said: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men”?—Acts 5:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Through all this period Jehovah’s witnesses raised their voices in spite of violent persecution. Even though the work openly in Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Yugoslavia and the vast British Empire was practically stopped, you can be sure that the individuals, true Christians, were still proclaiming God’s kingdom. As the years pass you will see how great a witness was given and continues to be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">THE EXPANSION OF THE KINGDOM WITNESS CONTINUES</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many people thought that when J. F. Rutherford, president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, died on January 8, 1942, at the height of World War II and worldwide persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, the work of the Society would die out. However, those who thought that did not appreciate that the kingdom of the heavens was already established. Christ Jesus was enthroned as King in the heavens and had cast Satan the Devil out of heaven. What was happening in the earth among all the nations was due to the Devil, as Revelation 12:10-12 prophesied: “I heard a loud voice in heaven say: ‘Now have come to pass the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ, because the accuser of our brothers has been hurled down, who accuses them day and night before our God! . . . Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.” Jehovah’s witnesses know that the work of God goes on regardless of men and that when Jesus said the good news of the Kingdom would be preached first and then the end would come, that is what would take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There was still work to be done. Jehovah’s witnesses got to doing it with no hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The February 15, 1942, issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> page 61, showed how the Lord’s organization felt. It said: “The Lord’s work never stands still; it is always progressing. It is always on scheduled time. The Lord often changes the personnel of his visible earthly organization, but the work of witnessing to his Theocracy by Christ Jesus goes grandly on.” Even during that war year of 1942 a large convention was arranged at Cleveland, Ohio, and in the public talk “Peace— Can It Last?” the new president of the Society, N. H. Knorr, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“They [the nations and false religionists] will continue to take action against Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions who announced Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ and who refuse to get on the ‘peace beast’ and to ride along with religion. Incensed at the persistent proclamation of God’s kingdom, and because it shows up the false, hypocritical position of the religious ‘New World order’, the beast with all its heads and horns, and with the ‘woman’ Babylon spurring it on, will make a desperate try at goring and trampling to death the Kingdom proclamation. By force it will succeed in stopping the preaching thereof. But Christ Jesus warned that when this witness work is finished, and when Almighty God permits it to be stopped by the ‘woman’ and the beast, ‘then shall the end come’ for them.”—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was announced at the assembly that special overseers would visit each congregation to assist Jehovah’s witnesses in their house-to-house work. This was the start of the present activity of circuit and district servants now carried on world wide to help the witnesses of Jehovah in advancing the interests of the Kingdom in the most effective way possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Theocratic Ministry School was started in the Bethel home and then introduced throughout the world into all congregations in 1943. The Watchtower Bible School of Gilead was opened February 1, 1943. The School was designed to prepare men and women for missionary service to be sent to all parts of the world as preachers and teachers of the Word of God. They would help people to obtain an accurate knowledge of God’s Word. In his opening address to the first class of students the president of the Society said: “There are many places where the witness concerning the Kingdom has not been given to a great extent. . . . Your principal work is that of preaching the gospel of the Kingdom from house to house as did Jesus and the apostles.” </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">—Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Divine Purpose, </span><span class="font12">pages 203, 204.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Since that memorable year of 1943 thousands of ordained ministers have graduated from this school and have gone to all parts of the world, and with wonderful success they have preached the “good news of the kingdom . . . for a witness to all the nations.” When hearing ears were found in these countries, then arrangements were made to call again and start Bible studies, and finally to organize congregations. Were these missionaries successful? In 1943 there were 6,310 congregations throughout the world in 54 lands. Twenty years later, in 1963, with thousands of active congregation publishers along with the missionaries, now in many countries, the congregations had grown to 22,761 in 194 lands. That gives one an idea of how great a witness was being given till 1963 in all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">With no letup in the preaching work, the years of World War II passed quickly. The ban against Jehovah’s witnesses was lifted in Australia in June 1943; and in Canada in June 1944. By 1945 the missionary work opened up on a wide scale in Central and South America and the witness work reopened in Europe. In 1945 there was great rejoicing because thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses who had been in the German concentration camps were released. These started in the house-to-house witnessing work again in Germany, preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. What faith! What love for Jehovah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Nations of the British Commonwealth of Nations that had placed bans on Jehovah’s witnesses were gradually lifting the bans, and the work of preaching began again. One thing was evident after these years of difficulty and it was aptly stated in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">191fi Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses,</span><span class="font12"> page 13: “The nations have not broken up and, by the Lord’s grace, will not break up the internal order and peace of Jehovah’s earthly organization, despite the wicked persecution to smash the unity of purpose and action of God’s people, which is to preach ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand!’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW GREAT WAS THE WITNESS?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Reviewing the work of Jehovah’s witnesses from 1918, when the clergy of Christendom thought they had killed these international Bible Students, on through the period of the second world war shows that a great testimony to the Kingdom was given by these stalwart witnesses. In that difficult period of 1918-1919, when Jehovah’s witnesses actually were in a captive state to Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion, great Babylon fell by God’s judgment on her. A release resulted to the captive Christians, and thousands upon thousands are still fleeing from her. They are still hearing the call: “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.” (Rev. 18:4) Why are they leaving Christendom and all false religions? Because Jehovah’s witnesses who are preaching in all the inhabited earth are making “disciples of people of all the nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What have been the results? Starting with the year 1918 and considering activity after each ten-year period, namely, 1928, 1938 and 1948, you can see that Jehovah’s witnesses have been zealous publishers or proclaimers and that they believe “in all the nations the good news has to be preached first.” (Mark 13:10) Would you like to study God’s Word and share in the preaching work too?</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">We would like to mention here that Jehovah’s witnesses came through the oppressive years of harsh persecution during the World War II period strong and determined to press on. In 1945, when the war ended, there were 127,478 publishers in 68 lands, and by 1948 there were 230,532 ministers preaching the good news of the Kingdom in 96 countries and islands of the sea. From the report above you can see what success Jehovah’s witnesses have had since they were freed from Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion. That was in 1919. Just look at how many people fled from Babylon, heeding the call to get out of her! And the call is still being sounded loud and clear today. Do you have the courage to break free and declare yourself on the side of God’s kingdom? Do you believe that the end of this system of things is near? Do you want to find out? There is a congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses somewhere near you. Have one of these Christians call on you or write the Watch Tower Society in your country making such a request, and we will arrange for someone to call and talk to you about God’s Word of truth and the blessings of His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But our story on the success of “how great a witness” has been given only takes us up to the year 1945. Jehovah’s witnesses certainly have been busy since then. Some people have said it is the fastest-growing religious organization in the world. That may not be so, but we know we can say that Jehovah’s witnesses are the only people truly dedicated, heart, mind, soul and strength, to the belief that “this good news of God’s kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” (Matt. 24:14) They have proved their sincerity in this by continually moving forward even to the ends of the earth promoting Bible study, encouraging people to take up the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom. They have helped thousands of Christians to become good teachers and these, in turn, have made disciples of people of all nations. (Matt. 28:19) It is good, too, for those who study with these teachers to keep in mind what Paul said: “Remember those who are taking the lead among you, who have spoken the word of God to you, and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out imitate their faith.” (Heb. 13:7) This teaching work has taken on great proportions since 1948 when Jehovah’s witnesses were conducting only 130,281 home Bible studies weekly, on the average. But now they are conducting well over 940,000 Bible studies weekly in the homes of the people throughout the world. Bible studies take time, but what a joy it is for a Christian to show love for his neighbor in this way!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many important things have happened since 1948. New printing establishments have been built by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in Brooklyn, Germany, Switzerland, England, Canada, Sweden, Finland, South Africa and elsewhere. During the last twenty years new branch offices have been built in most of the principal countries, and today there are 96 branch offices scattered around the world and Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching the good news of God’s kingdom in 197 lands and islands of the sea. Their printed Bible literature now appears in 165 languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Printing Bible-study aids that will help persons to understand God’s Word is now one of Jehovah’s witnesses’ principal ways to help people understand the Kingdom message. For example, the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font12"> reached a circulation of 19,246,710 copies in 54 languages in twenty years. The 416-page hard-covered bound book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,” </span><span class="font12">first printed in 1965, has already passed 8,300,000 printed copies in 22 languages, with translations on hand in 21 more languages. By the end of 1968 the Society hopes to have all these translations printed. Very likely in its first four years of distribution this publication will pass the ten-million mark!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The facts are that the demand for Bible literature about God’s kingdom on the part of people throughout the earth has been so great in the last twenty years that it has been necessary for the Watch Tower Society to print more than 100 million (100,000,000) bound books and more than 325 million booklets. Furthermore, in the last twenty years the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> magazine and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> magazine have reached a most remarkable distribution. Jehovah’s witnesses have placed with the people through subscriptions and house-to-house visits more than 1,300,000,000 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font12">magazines and more than 1,100,000,000 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font12">magazines. The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> magazine is published in 74 different languages and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> in 26 languages. Handbills advertising the public lectures, and tracts on Bible subjects printed in many languages, have been distributed free up to the total of at least 5,000,000,000 copies. Jehovah’s witnesses have made it their business to talk to people about God’s kingdom and to leave with them something to read. In fact, in many parts of the world Jehovah’s witnesses have even taught persons to read and write so that these learners could read the Holy Bible and Bible literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One of the outstanding achievements of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society was the printing of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span><span class="font12"> By 1950 the New World Bible Translation Committee, who furnished the Society with the English text translated from the original tongues, finished the Greek Scripture portion of this excellent work. At the 1950 Theocracy’s Increase Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses, July 30 to August 6, 125,000 copies of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> were released to an audience of 82,075 on Wednesday, August 2. On Sunday, August 6, the Yankee Stadium was packed to overflowing, with 123,707 persons in attendance to hear the public lecture “Can You Live Forever in Happiness on Earth?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another great assembly was the New World Society Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses at Yankee Stadium, July 19 to 26, 1953. By this time the first volume of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> was ready and it was released to a vast throng of 132,829 in attendance. On Sunday the president of the Society, N. H. Knorr, delivered the talk “After Armageddon God’s New World,” to 165,829 persons. Of course, not all these persons could be in attendance at the Yankee Stadium itself. There were 49,027 at a trailer city in the State of New Jersey, forty miles from Yankee Stadium, who were anxious to hear, and these did hear by direct wire and loudspeaking equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By this time Jehovah’s witnesses had the reputation for arranging large assemblies. But the greatest assembly was yet to come! The Watch Tower Society was able to obtain the use of the Polo Grounds and the Yankee Stadium in New York city, July 27 to August 3, 1958. Delegates arrived in New York from 123 lands and islands of the sea. By this time Volume IV of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> was released, along with other new publications of the Society, all of which directed the attention of the readers to the kingdom of God. It occurred that at this assembly 7,136 persons were baptized in water, symbolizing their dedication to do the will of God and to proclaim the good news of God’s kingdom. The organization was growing at at a rapid pace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By this time the Kingdom proclaimers, Jehovah’s witnesses, had increased by nearly one-half million since 1948. Now, in 1958, there were 717,088 regular publishers preaching the good news. The people of all nations were cognizant of this fact too. The outstanding event of the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses, simultaneously held at the Yankee Stadium and Polo Grounds in New York city, was the day of the public meeting, Sunday, August 3, 1958, when 253,922 persons assembled to pack out both stadiums—even the playing fields. Surrounding parking lot areas were equipped with loudspeakers, and crowds of people in tents also heard the talk “God’s Kingdom Rules—Is the World’s End Near?” The speaker began with these words: “Only the best government in the universe is good enough for this earth. That is the way that the earth’s Creator feels about it.” Throughout his discourse the speaker proved what the best government would be for mankind and finally concluded with these words: “Oh, therefore, let all men of good will turn now to God for earth’s government! All hail to God’s kingdom that now rules! May it bring the old world’s end in his</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">own appointed time soon. May his kingdom usher in the everlasting new world to man’s eternal salvation and to God’s unfading glory by Jesus Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So you see, Jehovah’s witnesses had not changed their message about God’s kingdom after so many years. This they would still declare world wide, showing full faith in Jehovah’s kingdom. They did not slow down either in the years to follow!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In 1963 there was the “Everlasting Good News” Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses, arranged for around the world. How was that done? Well, the first of a series of conventions began in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, June 30 to July 7. It moved on to New York, then to Stockholm, Munich, Milan, Athens, Beirut, Jerusalem, New Delhi, Rangoon, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Singapore, Manila, Bandung, Melbourne, Suva, Kyoto, Auckland, Seoul, Honolulu and finally Pasadena, California, September 1-8. In just a little over two months more than 450,000 of Jehovah’s witnesses attended this assembly, and the total attendance at the public meetings around the world was 580,509. There were delegates at this Around-the-World Assembly from 161 lands. Jehovah’s witnesses are determined to make the Kingdom message known just as far and wide as they possibly can until the end of this wicked system comes. Will you join them in this grand work while there is yet time?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By 1961 the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font12"> was completed and published in one volume, and this Bible, being offered on a contribution of only one dollar a copy, has had a phenomenal distribution. Since 1950 Jehovah’s witnesses have been distributing the Greek Scriptures of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font12"> and individual volumes of the Hebrew Scriptures as they were completed. But long before that Jehovah’s witnesses were urging people to read the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">King James Version,</span><span class="font12"> the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version, </span><span class="font12">or any other translation of the Bible, because God’s words of truth are contained in any Bible. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society has been a printer of Bibles and particularly a distributor of Bibles in all languages world wide. The facts show that in the past twenty years the Society has printed 14,993,000 Bibles, including the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font12"> which can now be had in seven languages. These include Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, Dutch, German, as well as English, and the translation into these languages has been handled by scholars who are Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the last four years, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, Jehovah’s witnesses have been very busy and are planning to the future. The Watchtower Society has just finished a ten-story 200,000-square-foot building, a new addition to their already large printing establishment. They are still sending out missionaries to all parts of the earth to enlarge their printing staff. Probably the best way to sum up the past twenty years of Jehovah’s witnesses’ preaching activity is to give you a comparative report, with the 1948 report, showing you the year’s activity for 1958 and 1967.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Maybe your question is answered now, namely, “How great a witness?” But the end is not yet. Jehovah’s witnesses are very happy that they can take the Holy Bible into the homes of the people and in many cases arrange to study it with them. They have other publications, too, that will aid persons to appreciate the good news of God’s established kingdom. The history of Jehovah’s witnesses, particularly since 1919 and right down through 1967, has been that of faithfully doing the work that Christ Jesus prophesied would be done, namely, preaching the good news of God’s established kingdom first, before the destruction of this wicked system of things comes at Armageddon. Satan knows he has but a short time to remain the god of this world and to rule it in his wicked way. However, Jehovah’s witnesses are not fearful of what the Devil may do to them. They have a work to do and are still doing it, as the report of Jehovah’s witnesses for the service year 1967 shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1967 WORLDWIDE REPORT OF KINGDOM PREACHING ACTIVITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jehovah’s witnesses have had their finest year in declaring the good news of God’s kingdom! This is easily ascertained when one checks the hours Jehovah’s witnesses spent, namely, 183,995,180, preaching from house to house and publicly, as compared with the previous year’s total of 170,664,897 hours. During these millions of hours a lot of things happened. Jehovah’s witnesses conducted 943,108 Bible studies in the homes of interested people. During each week of the year there were at least that many persons studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses for an hour or more and very often whole families would sit in on such Bible studies. Can you imagine that there are people, Christian people today, who are willing to leave their own comfortable homes and go out in all kinds of weather, at any time it suits the interested person and without pay, just to study the Bible with that person? Happy persons have come from all nations, peoples and tongues willingly, and they rejoice that they have the opportunity of teaching the Bible truth to others who want to know what God’s Word says.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Do you want to know what the Bible teaches? These Christian witnesses of Jehovah are quite willing to come to your home too if you let them know where you live. All you need to do is write to one of the offices of the Society and they will forward your name and address to the nearest congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses and someone will call on you to discuss the Bible with you and answer your Bible questions. Why not make the inquiry? It will not cost you anything. Or, you may know of the location of the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses in your vicinity. Visit it and listen to what Jehovah’s witnesses are talking about. There are 25,206 congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses located in all parts of the earth where Jehovah’s witnesses carry on their ministry. Make yourself known to the presiding minister and tell him you would like to have a Bible study. It will be arranged for immediately. There is no need for you to be timid about this matter. Jehovah’s witnesses want to help you. There is only one way that a person can gain everlasting life and that is by taking in knowledge of Jehovah God and his Son, Jesus Christ. (John 17:3) Please inquire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jesus admonished that Christians should be fishers of men. This Jehovah’s witnesses have been, because 74,981 individuals from all over the world have dedicated their lives to serve Jehovah and were baptized in water during the year 1967. This is the second-highest number of persons ever baptized in one year by Jehovah’s witnesses. Back in 1959, 86,345 symbolized by water baptism their dedication to Jehovah God, and during the past seven years the average was about 65,000 baptized each year. People are listening to the truth and making a decision! Have you? If you have not listened much to God’s Word, then why not give the truth a chance to be heard by your ears and consider it in your heart and mind?</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Another highlight of the year was the Memorial celebration. On Saturday evening, March 25,1967, around the world there were 2,195,612 persons in attendance at the Kingdom Halls of Jehovah’s witnesses, or other meeting places, to celebrate the death of the Lord Jesus. Of this large number, only 10,981 partook of the emblems indicating that they were members of the body of Christ, anointed of God, looking forward to being joint heirs with Christ Jesus in heavenly glory. All the others indicated that they desired to be of the great crowd of people, seeking everlasting life on this earth, who are now before Jehovah’s throne, having washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb. Many of these sincere people will in time make their decision to serve God and become faithful followers of Christ Jesus. They, too, will be baptized after dedicating their lives</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">to do Jehovah’s will. They will want to share in preaching this good news of the Kingdom, as Jehovah’s witnesses have been doing. You are invited by Christ Jesus to do the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the year 1967 there were, on the average, 1,094,280 Christian witnesses of Jehovah declaring the good news of the Kingdom every month. That was 35,605 more than last year. But sometime during 1967 there were as many as 1,160,604 different persons sharing in the preaching work. What did these people do? They talked the Kingdom message, conducted Bible studies, distributed 5,223,560 bound books and 11,744,210 booklets explaining Jehovah’s purposes. They also distributed 143,557,479 individual copies of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> magazines. (See the chart on pages 36-43.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In addition to this tremendous distribution of printed literature, Jehovah’s witnesses obtained 1,809,065 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> This made it necessary for the Watch Tower Society to print in all its printing branches throughout the world a total of 251,405,632 magazines. How fine it is to leave something with people to read when they are interested!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All this activity makes Jehovah’s witnesses very joyful. They see that they are truly sharing in obeying the command of Christ Jesus. They fully believe that “this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” (Matt. 24:14) In answer to the question, How great a witness? they can say: 1967 has been another grand year of witnessing added to those already past. But will Jehovah’s witnesses slacken the pace now with so much done? No! Because “in all the nations the good news has to be preached first.” (Mark 13:10) Then the end comes! Will you listen to the good news of God’s kingdom the next time it is presented to you at your door? Will you study the Word of God with Jehovah’s witnesses? This is a decision for you to make before the end comes. “The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard, is: Fear the true God and keep his commandments. For this is the whole obligation of man. For the true God himself will bring every sort of work into the judgment in relation to every hidden thing, as to whether it is good or bad.”—Eccl. 12:13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES’ ASSEMBLIES IN 1967</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So as to accentuate the preaching of the good news of the kingdom of God in Central and South America and in the islands of the Caribbean Sea the Watch Tower Society arranged for a series of conventions in that area. It all began in Mexico City, December 2, 1966. Many people from North America, in fact, from all parts of the world, made the tour so as to visit their brothers in these Latin countries and associate with more than 600 missionaries who have been working diligently in the tropics and southern hemisphere for many years. All the conventioners were anticipating great things to happen in the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This series of conventions was called “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly, and it was anticipated that 23,000 delegates would gather at the Mexico arena in Mexico City. But not so! It was 36,556 persons that packed out the Arena on the third day of the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This was only the beginning! Every five days there was another assembly, and in some countries two conventions were going on at the same time in different places, one in English and the other in Spanish. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The same convention program (excepting the public address) that had been given in English during the preceding summer throughout the United States, Canada and elsewhere was now being repeated in Spanish and Portuguese. This included the thrilling dramas. It must be stated here that the spirit and acting that was put into these dramas by our Latin brothers was in every way equal to that accomplished by performers in other parts of the world. The programs were most upbuilding and appreciated so much by all in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The traveling representatives, most of whom spoke English, had a special treat in that they could meet with just the missionaries in the different countries during two mornings while in each country. At these morning sessions the missionaries related experiences about the work in their country and told how the message of God’s kingdom was being preached in that land and how it reached out into all corners of the country, towns, villages and even into the high Andes mountains. It was thrilling to associate with these missionaries and to get acquainted with men and women, all ministers, who had been in the foreign field for ten, fifteen or twenty years. What delightful association the travelers had, not only with missionaries, but with the native people of the country who came from the cities, the rurals, the farms and elsewhere! Many were native Indians. The travelers met Aztec Indians, people who had now dedicated their lives to God, Mayas, Incas and many other people from all parts of the world whose tongue was German, or Italian, or some other language. These persons had made Central or South America their home and were now learning Spanish or Portuguese. So from all nations, peoples and tongues a great crowd came to praise their God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Talking about crowds, the greatest crowd was assembled in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in the great stadium there. At the public meeting 46,151 were in attendance. Marvelous indeed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The publishers of God’s kingdom were delighted to receive the new book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God</span><span class="font11"> in the Spanish and Portuguese languages. They were told, too, at all the Spanish-speaking conventions that the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font11"> would be translated and printed in the Spanish language in about five months. This was true, because early in the year 1967 this book went to press at the Society’s printing plant in Brooklyn and it has been shipped to all the Spanish-speaking countries. A tremendous distribution has already been reported for 1967.</span></p>

Let the following table do the speaking. Here you can see what has been accomplished by Jehovah’s witnesses in the past twenty</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">years. You can judge for yourself as to how great a witness has been given up to this time. Surely the work is not yet done, because there are many more publishers of the Kingdom now in this same territory than in January 1967. Please note, too, that in these 21 assembly places there were 6,131 individuals who declared themselves as disciples of Jesus Christ and were baptized at such assemblies. They have heeded the Kingdom message and have now joined themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses in declaring this good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Just look at the public meeting attendance! Observe, if you will, what happened in Brazil in twenty years. From 648 publishers in 1947 to 38,109 in January of 1967.

And this </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> will show you what increases have been made since January 1967.

<p><span class="font11">But, then, this was not the only part of the world in which assemblies were held during the year 1967. Beginning in June, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society arranged for the “Disciple-making” District Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The four-day program proved to be most upbuilding spiritually, and clearly brought to the minds of all of Jehovah’s witnesses that it is still very essential to declare this good news of the Kingdom everywhere, and while Jehovah’s witnesses are doing it they can make disciples of those sincere people who have ears to hear and eyes that see, and who want to learn about and serve their God, Jehovah. One can feel the power of this “Disciplemaking” District Assembly when one considers that 400,995 people came to the district assemblies in the United States this year. At the 45 assemblies in the United States there were 5,996 individuals baptized. People are making decisions to serve God! Have you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One discourse of the “Disciple-making” District Assembly showed the urgency of times in which we live: “Keep Close in Mind the ‘Conclusion of the System of Things.’ ” Do you not think we should ? Another powerful speech was “Let God Arise, Let His Enemies Be Scattered.” There was a ring of triumph in that talk. Very heart-searching was the discourse entitled “Let Down Your Nets for a Catch.” Everyone will remember that just as the apostles twice enjoyed big catches of fish when they obeyed Jesus’ command to let down their nets for a catch, so Jehovah’s witnesses today, by continuing their fishing; work and letting down their nets at every opportunity will be assured of a catch. How many more people will be gathered together into these nets and made to be disciples of Christ and then will take up God’s work of declaring the good news of the Kingdom, we do not know. But we can find out if we keep fishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Everyone attending these assemblies will remember the dramas. They were presented so well, and through them we learned how necessary it is to conform ourselves to God’s eternal principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Saturday afternoon proved to be a very exciting day, one long to be remembered. The drama concerned “Leaving the City of Refuge Means Loss of Life.” It was impressive and was followed by the outstanding discourse “Saving the World of Mankind by Blood.” That took a full hour of concentration for everyone, and undoubtedly all who heard it want to read it too, to get the full force of the information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then there were talks like “Building Disciples with Enduring Qualities” and “Is the World Puzzled at Your Course? It Should Be!” as well as “Do You Have ‘Faith to the Preserving Alive of the Soul’?” Really, the entire theme of the convention was “disciple-making.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The first release of a Bible-study aid was on Thursday. It was the revised edition of the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers.</span><span class="font11"> Those attending the conventions were delighted to have this book with its revisions and additions. A book that caught everyone’s eye was entitled “Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation?” It was released on Friday afternoon and it seems that every assembly ran out of their supplies of it on the day of its release. We believe that this publication will help catch alive some who have been studying this evolution theory and who will find out that evolution is not based on fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On Saturday afternoon the third bound book was released, entitled “Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot.” This thrilled everyone. It seems to be something that we really need to help those who are going to become disciples to see just what a Christian must believe and then do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The entire four days of the conventions were climaxed with the heartwarming public talk “Rescuing a Great Crowd of Mankind Out of Armageddon.” What a work! And what an honor to have a part in it! A free copy of this fine talk was given to everyone attending the assemblies. Since that date this delightful discussion on how this great crowd of mankind will be rescued was published in the October 15, 1967, issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> in English. It is very important for every individual to learn how to live according to God’s principles, and it is the responsibility of Jehovah’s witnesses to get this very fine message of God’s kingdom to all people possible so that the people can make their decision as to what they will do before Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This series of conventions again shows to what effort Jehovah’s people will go to let people know what God’s kingdom can mean to them. One interested man at the Columbus, Ohio, convention put it this way: “I came here Wednesday and I haven’t missed a session. Being in here is like being in the light and being outside in religion is like being in the dark. I have been an army man for twenty-one years. Now it looks like I am going to join another<sup>-</sup> army.” Another person, who attended the Pomona, California, assembly wrote: “Outside that park the world was in turmoil with men tearing at each other in war and in racial strife. For those few days in the Pomona Fairgrounds Jehovah’s witnesses lived and worked together in harmony and love without regard for race, color or social status and without a big to-do about who had or didn’t have authority. Everyone shared the same goal; to serve the Father and do well his work.” This individual got the full spirit of the assembly and its message, for in his closing remarks he said: “For complete happiness, get involved in Jehovah’s work to the fullest possible extent! Study God’s Word of life privately and in group meetings; publish the Good News—as a pioneer, if possible. Parents, direct your teen-agers to the full-time service with Gilead and Bethel as worthwhile goals. And for the real joy of an assembly, be there—as a volunteer worker—before, during and after!” Assemblies do something for people. Is that the way you felt too?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This spirit did not exist just in the United States, but at all the conventions. The Swedish branch office said: “Our six ‘Disciple-making’ assemblies were spread out through the whole length of the country, from 120 miles north of the Arctic circle down to the 56th latitude. The total attendance at the public meetings was 13,283, and 216 were immersed.” After attending one of the assemblies one young couple in Sweden stated: “We are not yet Witnesses, but they are studying with us. We came here in order to see how the organization looked when viewed ‘from the inside,’ and we have found that you really live as you teach.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In Belgium where there are two predominant languages, Flemish and French, there were also meetings in Italian, Greek and Spanish in order to accommodate the people attending the conventions. On Sunday afternoon the overall total for the public meeting was 12,043; and 394 persons were baptized. Since the assembly it has been learned that in Belgium more persons are attending the local congregation meetings than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">People are listening to what Jehovah’s witnesses have to say and they are interested. Finland writes: “There were thirty persons from a town called Kuhmo at one of the assemblies, but there are only 15 publishers in that town. All of these persons had to travel over 800 kilometers to get to the convention and back.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In England there were 15 assemblies, with 63,835 attending and 925 baptized. One individual looking through the new book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation?</span><span class="font11"> said that, “even if one could not read, the pictorial argument against evolution is so clear from these marvelous illustrations that it could leave no doubt in one’s mind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In Austria they had a grand total of 9,661 that attended the Sunday public meetings. What brought great joy to the assembly in Klagenfurt was the fact that 889 persons were in attendance for the Slovenian sessions of the convention and a great number of these had come from Yugoslavia. Switzerland and Italy had marvelous assemblies, and in the small country of Denmark the total attendance at all the public meetings was 17,203, with 269 immersed. One of the outstanding experiences was the reaction to the assembly held in Ronne on the island of Bornholm. There the clergy of the different denominations on the island got together to do everything they could to work against the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. But, as usual, their opposition boomeranged and the witness given was the finest yet in that island. Many people are now interested in hearing what Jehovah’s witnesses have to say, because the church alliance made such a big fuss about the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in that place. Many Copenhagen newspapers had good articles on what occurred. One newspaper carried the headline: “Ecclesiastical Controversy on Bornholm.” Another headline read: “8 Against 1: Church Alliance Offended, Goes to War Against Jehovah’s Witnesses.” So the entire land of Denmark learned about the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses held in the little island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Netherlands, with a peak of 15,013 witnesses of Jehovah in April 1967, received a grand surprise when the peak attendance at their assemblies was 24,535, with 442 baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As reports come in from Germany, France, Norway, Canada and all other countries of the earth we see that Jehovah’s witnesses enjoyed these delightful assemblies and they appreciate that the discipling work they are doing will continue for some years yet. They know that in all the nations the good news of the Kingdom is to be preached first, before the end comes. Will you share with them and see how great a witness can still be given?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY DO ALL OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES PREACH?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The apostle Paul, a faithful follower of Christ Jesus, said to the young man Timothy: “Preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season. . . . keep your senses in all things, suffer evil, do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.” (2 Tim. 4:2, 5) From this instruction in God’s Word it is clear that a Christian must preach the word. Of course, one who preaches the word is a minister of God, and when one is a minister he renders service to others. That is why Paul also said: “We sent Timothy, our brother and God’s minister in the good news about the Christ, in order to make you firm and comfort you in behalf of your faith.” (1 Thess. 3:2) There must be a watching of how we are building Christians. Are we doing it on the only foundation, Christ Jesus, and with fire-resistant materials?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Any individual who is taught the Scriptures and keeps studying the Word of God sincerely will in time have the mental attitude that was in Christ Jesus. The apostle Paul stressed this: “Keep this mental attitude in you that was also in Christ Jesus, who, although he was existing in God’s form, gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.” (Phil. 2:5, 6) Certainly a Christian should never get an exalted opinion of himself because he is doing what Christ Jesus did when he was upon the earth, declaring God’s kingdom. It is an honor to represent God and his kingdom, and Jehovah’s witnesses do this because of their love for mankind and their brothers. It is essential that all Christians preach, that they give a public declaration of what they believe to anyone. Jesus was never hesitant in giving a witness, even though he stood before a mighty ruler. Paul tells us that ‘Jesus Christ as a witness made the fine public declaration before Pontius Pilate.’—1 Tim. 6:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What is clearly lacking in Christendom today is the preaching of God’s kingdom. The leaders of the false religious organizations of Christendom have failed completely to produce ministers of God. Their parishioners are like weeds ready to be destroyed. Do you remember what Jesus said about real wheat and weeds? It is recorded in Matthew 13:30: “Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the harvest season I will tell the reapers, First collect the weeds and bind them in bundles to burn them up, then go to gathering the wheat into my storehouse.” Why not be like the disciples of Jesus and preach? Of them it was said: “Every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.” (Acts 5:42) If this good news of the Kingdom is going to be declared world wide, Jehovah’s witnesses have to be diligent now in their work and continue going from house to house. Paul felt the urgency of preaching, and Jehovah’s witnesses today feel the same way. Said Paul: “Woe is me if I did not declare the good news!”—1 Cor. 9:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On the other hand, maybe you are one of those persons who claims to be a Christian but is afraid to declare the good news of the Kingdom. Many people today are afraid to be witnesses for Jehovah. Why should you let fear keep you in an unhappy state of mind? True, you might have to face up to some persecution. Jesus said you would. You can read about it in Matthew 10:16-31. But, “if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy.” (1 Pet. 3:14) Are you happy because you are preaching along with Jehovah’s witnesses, or are you afraid to talk about the kingdom of God to others? Make your decision to be like wheat or like a weed. Regardless of what you do, this good news of the Kingdom will be preached first to all nations, whether you share in it or not, and then the end will come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">THE WATCH TOWER SOCIETY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ASSISTS THE PREACHING WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses are well organized to do the preaching of the Kingdom world wide and they go about it systematically. They look to the governing body within the Watch Tower Society to give them direction and assignments of territory in which to preach. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania is a religious society organized in 1884 in the State of Pennsylvania, and having offices in Brooklyn, New York. The Watch Tower Society publishes the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> magazine, which contains spiritual food for all of Jehovah’s witnesses, and for people interested in Bible study all around the world. Associated with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania is the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., and the International Bible Students Association, established in England. There are a number of other societies, religious organizations, that work very closely with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. Jehovah’s witnesses enjoy and have confidence in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> magazine because everything that it brings to the attention of its readers is based on God’s Word the Holy Bible. This magazine Jehovah’s witnesses around the world study regularly. It is published in seventy-four different languages. Every one of Jehovah’s witnesses studies the same information. That is why they see eye to eye in their preaching of the good news of the kingdom of God everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In addition to publishing the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> magazine the Society prints the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazine, along with Bibles, various books and booklets in many languages for worldwide distribution. All the Society’s many different publications direct the minds of the people to God’s established kingdom, which will vindicate Jehovah’s name and word, and which kingdom will bring blessings of everlasting life to all obedient mankind. Jehovah’s witnesses’ chief interest is preaching and teaching and they all want to improve their abilities to preach and teach and be better qualified ministers. That is why, in every congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses around the world, they have the Theocratic Ministry School. This school is conducted weekly by mature, ordained ministers in each congregation, and its sole purpose is to aid those associated with the congregation to be better-qualified ministers. In this school Jehovah’s witnesses are trained to speak and to give Bible sermons at the doors of the people, answer their questions and carry on discussions on various subjects. It can truly be said that Jehovah’s witnesses are baptized, ordained Christian ministers who are really interested in people and qualified to preach the good news of God’s kingdom world wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Every one of Jehovah’s witnesses has dedicated his life to the doing of Jehovah’s will and he tries to live by Bible principles twenty-four hours a day. So whatever Jehovah’s witnesses speak, whatever they do, however they act, they must prove to God that they are devoted to him and are his ministers, walking in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. When you have people of faith like that, how great a witness for God’s kingdom can you expect to be given?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">KINGDOM MINISTRY SCHOOL</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There are many of Jehovah’s witnesses who desire to be overseers, as this is a “fine work.” (1 Tim. 3:1) By being an overseer a person can devote more of his time to helping his brothers and sisters in the congregation. The Society conducts a Kingdom Ministry School, where overseers of congregations and their assistants can receive a fine two weeks’ training and where they can devote their time to intensive study of the Bible, which better qualifies them to help others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This Kingdom Ministry School is in operation in most countries of the world and functions under the direction of the branch servants in the various countries. Recently the Watchtower Society in the United States moved its Kingdom Ministry School from its farm in South Lansing, New York, to the headquarters, located in Brooklyn, New York. This transfer proved to be very beneficial, because now the congregation servants, assistant congregation servants and Bible study servants in the United States can associate with the Bethel family in Brooklyn as the students in Toronto, Canada; London, England; Wiesbaden, Germany; and elsewhere throughout the world associate with the Bethel families in their respective countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There were twenty-six two-week programs of classes conducted during the fifty-two weeks of the year. This was accomplished even though we moved the school from one location to another. Since the Kingdom Ministry School has been in operation in the United States there have been 7,823 students that have gone through the training offered. During the 1967 service year the total number of students who completed the Kingdom Ministry School Course was 1,342. Of these, 540 were congregation overseers, 778 assistant congregation servants and 24 Bible study servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are many advantages in having the Kingdom Ministry School located in New York city at the headquarters of the Society. Many of the overseers travel by air and it is much easier to come into New York city, the hub of all transportation lines, than to get to South Lansing, New York. It also gives the many members of the Bethel family the opportunity to associate with these overseers. Every two weeks we have a different brother in the service office handle the school’s service meeting and other meetings that are arranged for the students. It gives these brothers in the school the opportunity to get acquainted with and talk to individuals who are in our field service department. It also allows the brothers in the Society’s office to check on territory assignments, needs for the special pioneer work, circuit work and other things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On the second Friday of their stay at Bethel, as these students in the Kingdom Ministry School are finishing up their two-week course, they have the opportunity to make a morning tour for one hour so as to see the entire Bethel home and how it operates. In the afternoon of that same day they also tour the factory, where they see how the publications of the Society are printed, bound and shipped throughout the world. By going through the factory, the offices and the home, they have a better appreciation of the fine operation that is carried on here at headquarters. Furthermore, during the two weeks that they are in the school they are temporary members of the Bethel family, which enables them to get a fine idea of what Bethel life is like, because they live as members of the Bethel family. On their return to the congregation they are in an excellent position to help young brothers and sisters who are thinking about Bethel service to learn what Bethel is like, and thus they can encourage them all the more to come to Bethel. The Kingdom Ministry School is doing a marvelous work in all the countries of the world, and it is helping servants to do better shepherding work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WATCHTOWER BIBLE SCHOOL OF GILEAD</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Only ordained ministers are invited to attend the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, and when they enroll they know that they will be going into the missionary field. When this school was first begun on February 1, 1943, the good news of the Kingdom was being preached in fifty-four lands throughout the world. The Watchtower Bible School of Gilead has played a big part in getting this good news of the Kingdom preached in many other parts of the earth, because today we have missionaries and other ministers preaching the good news of the Kingdom in 197 countries, colonies and islands of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Let down your nets for a catch” are Jesus’ words to his disciples, which words constitute a command to make more disciples who, in turn, can let down their nets. Thus the discipling of the people of the nations has increased in almost geometrical progression, especially since thousands of zealous, progressive-minded men and women have made themselves available as missionaries to the ends of the earth. They have recognized the farsightedness of the “faithful and discreet slave” under Jehovah’s direction. They have, by faith, been unafraid and not hesitant to &quot;pull out to where it is deep,” so to speak, to fish in new ‘waters’ where the need is great and where the “fish” are plentiful. Not that they were tired of fishing in their home ‘waters’ nor that the fishing was finished there, but they have seen that the organization is strong at home. Persons interested in seeking the Kingdom are well taken care of by publishers who are unable to leave their homes for foreign ‘waters.’ And, clearly, the call for help in other ‘fishing waters’ was never so strong and urgent as now.—Luke 5:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The 1967 service year saw the forty-second and forty-third classes complete the school courses. The number completing the forty-second and forty-third classes was 106 and 103 respectively, bringing the total who have graduated from the school to date to 4,464.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Since changes in the curriculum come about from time to time as the truth becomes progressively brighter and new publications are released by the Society, it seems appropriate to give a brief description of the twenty-week course as it is now conducted. The course is divided into four quarters of five weeks each. Two instructors alternate each day teaching Bible courses, and language instructors teach classes every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The student body is divided into four groups of about twenty-five each. At eight o’clock two groups go to school; the other two report to training assignments in the Bethel home, the various offices and the Society’s printing plant. One group attends the language class while the other receives instruction in one of the Bible courses; at the morning’s halfway point they alternate. After dinner the entire student body assembles in the Lecture Room for a one-hour lecture; then two groups, composing half the student body, go to classes while those who went to school in the morning report for their training assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The eight Bible courses, two of them taught each quarter, are: Five courses giving chapter-by-chapter consideration of the Bible from the viewpoint of understanding and interpretation, namely, Hebrew Scriptures I, II, III and Greek Scriptures I and II; also Doctrines, Foundations of Bible History, and Ministerial Activity. The languages taught vary according to the need. Spanish, French, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Portuguese and many others have been taught since the school’s establishment in 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the evenings at least three hours are devoted to study. Friday evening the students attend the Theocratic Ministry School and service meeting with congregations in New York city to which they are assigned. Saturday afternoons and Sundays are spent in meetings and field service with these congregations, and in study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On April 9,1967, the Kingdom Ministry School moved from South Lansing, New York, to Brooklyn. Space is being shared in the Gilead School facilities to accommodate the Kingdom Ministry School for congregation overseers, assistants and Bible study servants until it can be located in its own quarters in the Society’s proposed new building on Columbia Heights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Having the Kingdom Ministry School at headquarters along with the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead has proved to be a real blessing for both student bodies. The Gilead students, who are, for the most part, younger persons, have benefited greatly from the association with the overseers and their mature viewpoint, while the freshness and enthusiasm of the Gilead students have been invigorating to the overseers. The field experiences that the Kingdom Ministry School students relate noontimes at the dinner table have shown that the discipling work is by no means finished and have also whetted the appetites of the Gilead students for the almost limitless field of discipling work awaiting them in foreign assignments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Graduation of the forty-second class was held September 11, 1966, in the Assembly Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses in New York city. The Society had invited the congregation overseers outside New York city within a radius of sixty miles. Highlights of the morning program were the talk by the Society’s vice-president, F. W. Franz, pointing out the missionaries’ privilege in being able to bring people “something to believe in,” since that is the world’s need, as shown by the cry of students in religious seminaries, and even in Communist Russia; and Brother Knorr’s address on “You Received Free, Give Free,” with counsel as to how, as Jehovah’s representatives to people in other lands, they should freely feed the truth-hungry ones with diligence, empathy and kindness, not forgetting their own need to continue taking in the life-giving truth themselves.—Matt. 10:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The 2,023 attending the graduation assembled again after lunch to enjoy a slide-illustrated talk by Brother</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Knorr on the expansion taking place in many lands. Music, particularly a fine chorus assembled from the student body, gave the program added color. The final feature was a drama of Bible times entitled “Let Us Conform Ourselves to God’s Eternal Principles.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A happy time for the forty-second class was the Baltimore convention. Chartered buses were arranged, and the rooming committee found lodgings free or at a very reasonable rate, so that all could stay for the entire assembly. The students contributed their share by taking part in the convention program, presenting the drama “Look to the Bible as Our Guide in Life” and participating in the experience sessions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The forty-third class began school on Monday, October 24, 1966, after registering, as is usual, on the previous Wednesday and receiving a tour of the Bethel home and printing plant. Being at Brooklyn a few days early helps the students to get acquainted with the routine and also with their training assignments and the overseers who will have charge of their training during the twenty weeks of school. The primary languages to be studied were French and Spanish, but a few were surprised yet delighted to be assigned to Portuguese and Korean classes. A sister who is a member of the Bethel family and who served as a missionary in Brazil was the Portuguese teacher, and another sister, a native Korean who herself was a Gilead graduate, taught Korean, commuting several times a week from hei’ present home in Long Island, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For the graduation of the forty-third class, the Society had sent two tickets to each overseer and assistant in the New York city congregation’s 183 units. With about 950 members of the Bethel family and Gilead School, more than 2,000 attended. Appreciation for life and the proper use of it to God’s praise was the theme of the program. Brother Knorr’s talk in the morning stressed the importance of making the most of the life God has given us by taking in knowledge of Him and by using our life to the full in making others happy. Brother Franz, basing his remarks on Daniel 12:12, emphasized the happiness that was the students’, of having roved through the Bible, getting understanding. Further, he said, their happiness would be even greater as they shared this understanding with others in the missionary field. A resolution presented by the student body expressed appreciation for the school, noting the benefits of association with the Bethel family and the confident feeling of having the full backing of Jehovah’s organization as they said, ‘Here we are! Send us!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the afternoon the students repeated a short drama that they had put on in class, outlining the beneficial aspect of the apostle Paul’s letter to the Philippians. A touching scene in a Communist prison camp drove home the need to maintain integrity under test and graphically illustrated the protection and comfort that God gives, contrasted with the danger of compromise and its retribution of death. Interludes of music and a series of vignettes visualizing the use of their newly learned languages in foreign fields were followed by a Bible drama, in costume. This feature, “Leaving the City of Refuge Means Loss of Life” brought to living action the arrangements of the ancient Israelite cities of refuge. It fittingly concluded the graduation program on the theme of appreciation of life and the need of using it properly as Jehovah directs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It has indeed been a happy year for the school. Not only has the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God</span><span class="font11"> been a real aid in the school curriculum, but it is peculiarly fitted to those preparing for missionary service, since it deals so clearly with baptism, the congregation of God, relative subjection, neutrality, husband-wife and family relationships and moral living —appreciation for which they will inculcate in disciples as ‘noncombustible material’ (1 Cor. 3:12-15) Now the publications received at the 1967 assemblies, particularly the books </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot”</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation f</span><span class="font11"> will also lend their force in training more efficient builders of strong disciples of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">With the marvelous expansion now taking place in foreign lands and the crying need for more disciplemakers, every one of Jehovah’s witnesses with health and the freedom to take up missionary work should give the most serious consideration to saying, “Here I am! Send me.” The highest profession one can follow is to serve Jehovah full time. The missionary service in particular is a privilege, which, if engaged in zealously between now and Armageddon, will ensure immeasurable happiness in the ages to come. Consider the joy of experiencing, in the new order, the happy companionship of those you now help to escape the destruction of this system of things.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED STATES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 192,818,00©</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 328,648 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 587</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jehovah’s witnesses in this land had a very happy and prosperous year. The preaching of the good news of the Kingdom was given the utmost of attention and the annual field service report for the United States shows that it has been the finest year of activity for Jehovah’s witnesses in reaching people. On the average, there were 311,378 ministers going from house to house and sharing in the preaching work, and during the twelve months of the 1967 service year they devoted 51,507,265 hours to that service. Truly the people of this country have had the opportunity to hear the good news, and there is no question that many have shown interest. Whether these will take a definite stand for God’s kingdom because of our preaching we cannot say. Some will, we know, because there were 18,582 persons who were baptized in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The interest in the message that Jehovah’s witnesses have has been shown in other ways. For example, the number of Bibles, books, booklets and magazines distributed shows that many want to know more about the teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses. It was the first time that the publishers of God’s kingdom in the United States obtained more than one million subscriptions. In fact, the total came to 1,061,110 new subscriptions for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazines. Additionally, they distributed 59,999,928 individual copies of these magazines in 1967. So Jehovah’s witnesses in this land have many things over which to rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What is bringing real pleasure to the Lord’s people is that so many persons have hearing ears and not all want to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">paste</span><span class="font11"> their eyes and ears shut to hearing and knowing the truth. Some are understanding what they are being told and they are actually turning back from their wrong course and are getting healing for themselves. However, in this land, as elsewhere in the earth, the majority of the people do as Jehovah through Isaiah said they would.—See Isaiah 6:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The conducting of home Bible studies has moved ahead very well during the year, the average being 247,957 Bible studies conducted weekly. Last year the number was 233,588. So there is cause for rejoicing. Here are some things that actually happened in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A single tract often is enough to kindle the desire for this fellowship. A brother witnessing in a small village was observed and approached by a man with the question ‘What kind of work are you doing here?’ After the brother explained, the man told him that he had been very active in the Presbyterian church but had just about stopped “because the church did not accept the Bible as the Word of God.” The man was at work, so the brother talked briefly and gave him the tract </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe? </span><span class="font11">and an invitation to come to the Kingdom Hall. He came and was warmly welcomed. Later he exclaimed: “I have seen more fellowship here at your Kingdom Hall in one afternoon than I have seen in a whole year at the Presbyterian church.” He went home and informed his family that he was going to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and the following Tuesday at the meeting he asked the brothers: “Must I have a letter showing my resignation from the Presbyterian church?” A home Bible study is being conducted, and he has not yet missed one meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This experience just goes to prove that there really has been an increase in attendance at the meetings of the congregation. In fact, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study attendance has increased from 79.8 percent of the persons who are publishers of the Kingdom to 84.7. In all the congregations in the United States approximately 75.4 attend the service meeting, and 76.1 the Theocratic Ministry School. The congregation book studies are very well attended, with about 82.8 percent of the brothers and sisters in attendance. As you observe what is being done in some other countries you will see that attendance averages there are even higher. In the United States, though, there has been an increase in meeting attendance of about 5 percent above last year. We hope that all will keep up this good habit in the 1968 service year and feed upon the spiritual food provided at such meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One person writes us: “ ‘If you want answers to your Bible questions, go see that man over there. He’s one of Jehovah’s witnesses.’ This has been the essence of what has been heard all over a large plant in Dayton, Ohio, where approximately fifty-three brothers work. The outstanding part of this is that most of the fifty-three have learned the truth by means of incidental witnessing at the plant. Each day during their one-hour lunch break some of the brothers get together in small groups to discuss the truth. This, in turn, attracts other men working there. As interest develops, ‘lunch-hour’ Bible studies are conducted right at the plant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another wrote: “In a family of active Witnesses an aged mother needed much care because of being almost blind and in bed most of the time. It was necessary for someone to be with her much of the time. Should they take turns missing service and meetings, or hire someone to come in? The decision: To hire a nurse-companion. This could not be a Witness as it would only cause her to miss meetings, so a lady was hired, but with the stipulation that she be willing and able to read to the aged sister. The material: The Bible, and to her surprise, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Awake!,</span><span class="font11"> etc. She agreed, began her job and the reading —but soon stopped with many questions. Within one week she said: ‘I want to go to the Kingdom Hall sometime.’ She went within two weeks’ time. Soon she asked for subscriptions for herself and her mother, a copy of the New World Translation Bible and on her day off she has been explaining to friends that people are to live on earth forever. But now the family has another problem: They have to find a sitter to stay with the mother while they take the sitter to the Kingdom Hall with them!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Even if my legs won’t let me take the message to the people, my hands will,” wrote an invalid sister who spent five months as a vacation pioneer. With this spirit she wrote over 700 letters and received over 300 replies of thanks and appreciation. She writes to different state institutions asking for names of people who might like to receive mail. These are quickly supplied. Is interest found? One woman wrote that she was seventy-four years old and never had owned a Bible. The sister mailed one and a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Look!”</span><span class="font11"> booklet and instructions on how to study with others. This woman began to study with five others, and, because she was in a wheelchair, these came to her. One young man, nineteen years old, suffering with multiple sclerosis, wrote her in his first letter about his college studies, etc. When introduced to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> his very next letter asked for all the extra copies she could supply. Later he told her he never had enough faith in God to pray, but that now he prays to Jehovah God and (he said) because of people like the sister who takes the time to write to the sick and despondent he is well on the road to recovery and has a different outlook on life. This sister said it would take hours to relate all the marvelous experiences the work of her fingers has brought to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many fine experiences have resulted from sending gift subscriptions. An overseer writes the following regarding sending his fleshly sister a gift subscription: &quot;Due to a misunderstanding my sister hadn’t written to me for over two years. I decided to send her a gift subscription for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> After a few weeks I received a very nice letter from her, saying how much she enjoys reading them. This inspired her to get out the bound books she had studied in over twenty years ago and start reading them again. She also said in her letter that she is going to ask the next Witness who calls at her door for a home Bible study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A GROWING FAMILY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The headquarters of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is located in Brooklyn, New York. There are some fine buildings on Columbia Heights that house the members of the Bethel family. This family has been growing over the years. Going back ten years, the records show there were 492 as members of the Bethel family. Now it has grown to 790. All of these witnesses of Jehovah have come from different parts of the United States, Canada and Central America, and the islands of the Caribbean. They have decided to make Bethel their home. They are all volunteers and they have filed applications requesting the privilege of working at the headquarters of the Society. We still have many applications on hand, but those between the ages of seventeen and thirty-five who are in good health, dedicated and baptized for at least a year and anxious to serve willingly in Jehovah’s organization may file an application. The work to be done, however, is mainly performed by brothers. We have a lot of printing machinery to handle and millions upon millions of books, booklets and magazines to ship. So preference is given to young single brothers, most of whom have served first as pioneers for some time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In addition to this large Bethel family that is housed in Brooklyn there were 102 students living in the Bethel home preparing themselves for missionary service. Usually there are fifty overseers or assistant congregation servants who are here too going through the Kingdom Ministry School. Thus, living in the buildings of the Watch Tower Society on Columbia Heights we generally have between 900 and 950 persons. If you have ever observed the activity around a beehive, then you can imagine what Bethel is like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To care for a family this large requires a large force of people working in the kitchen, dining room, the laundry and other departments. Many in the family also work in the offices, corresponding with those having problems, and keeping in touch with those in the pioneer and special pioneer work. Last year there were well over 16,000 pioneers reporting activity in the full-time preaching service. We also have many departments in the factory where persons are required every day, such as the proofreading department, the typesetting and plate-making departments, the pressroom, the bindery, the ink and paste departments, the machine shop and the carpenter shop. All of these departments are necessary in order to accomplish the work of making magazines and books used in preaching the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Society has obtained a number of farms, whicli are also operated by ordained ministers. There are usually forty-five persons working at Kingdom Farm, nineteen at our Watchtower Farm and about five at Mountain Farm. All of these farms provide the Bethel family with many necessary food products. Usually Mountain Farm provides us with fruit and some vegetables. Kingdom Farm provides us with a great amount of vegetables and large crops of potatoes, wheat, peas and corn. They also make our butter and cheese and supply us with quite a bit of beef, pork, chicken, turkey, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Watchtower Farm is a new location that we purchased recently. It is being developed into a vegetable farm, and right now we are raising quite a few beef cattle, as well as milk cows. Everything we raise at all these farms is used as food for the Bethel family, or for the cattle that are being raised on the farms, which eventually the Bethel family eats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Only when one lives in the Bethel home can he appreciate the magnitude of the organization, and what it takes to handle all the departments, farming, housing and production of literature containing the good news of the Kingdom. To do all we have to do requires the services of well over a thousand dedicated men and women, and still it is a wonderful place in which to live and to have a share in the production of publications that are distributed world wide. At the same time the Bethel family feasts on the fine spiritual food that is provided for all of the Lord’s people. We have wonderful personal association at meals and at our own meetings, such as the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study and Theocratic Ministry School that are conducted for the benefit of the Bethel family itself. All members of the Bethel family are associated with one of the numerous congregations in New York city, of which there are 185. During the evenings and on weekends the Bethel family shares in the house-to-house ministry and the conducting of home Bible studies, the same as Jehovah’s witnesses do around the world. So with this great crowd of persons in the area of New York city you can see that this city gets a fine witness. But even so, there are many who are living in towering apartments that have guards at the door so that the good news of the Kingdom cannot reach their ears unless such ones are met on the street somewhere with magazines or they themselves write and make inquiry. But we keep trying to declare this good news to all people of all nations, for we know this must be done first before this system of things comes to its end. To get it done more speedily the Society has in operation throughout the world a number of printing plants, the largest of which is located in Brooklyn, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">PRINTING IN THE BROOKLYN PLANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You have already read of the four new publications in English that were produced at the Brooklyn printing plant and that were released at the “Disciplemaking” District Assembly this past summer. We are already having excellent distribution of these publications. To keep 5,317 congregations in the United States supplied with their demands, as well as the special pioneers and pioneers, is quite a task. Then to print literature in addition for all parts of the world requires good organization. Not only do we take care of the new subscriptions sent in by the Kingdom publishers in the United States, but thousands of subscriptions are received from many other countries, such as South and Central America, where Spanish subscriptions are obtained, and a number of other countries. Thus, during the 1967 service year in the Brooklyn printing plant we had to work on 1,461,273 new subscriptions. This does not take into consideration the work involved in renewals for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazines. What a joy it was to all those who had a share in handling these subscriptions to put them through as quickly and accurately as possible! Because of this tremendous distribution of magazines it has been necessary for the Brooklyn printing plant to print well over 150,000,000 copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> during the 1967 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The bookbinding section of the Brooklyn plant was under constant pressure to produce Bibles and bound books. They exceeded the production of the previous year by 640,000, reaching a grand total of 8,252,860 bound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The table that follows gives you some idea of the production of the Brooklyn printing plant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Even in view of this fine production, the Brooklyn plant is far behind the demand for the printed litera-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ture from the congregations throughout the world. Unfortunately, we constantly have had to show current items of literature out of stock. How thankful we are that Jehovah is always directing matters and is now providing us with a new and spacious factory addition! The new factory building is in its final stages of completion. The first machines are scheduled to</span></p><img src="yb1968_E_files/yb1968_E-2.png" alt="" style="width:241pt;height:172pt;">
<p><span class="font8">Watchtower Society’s Brooklyn printing plant, with new addition at the front left</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">begin moving into the new factory about October 1, 1967. This new ten-story factory will provide an additional 206,000 square feet of floor space, raising our total factory floor space to 642,000 square feet. This area is contained in four factory buildings, all connected by bridges spanning across the streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The entire bookbindery in our present building will be moved into the new factory and two more new bindery lines are being added to our present three lines. This should give us a capacity of 50,000 bound books per day, if needed. The Society also has four new high-speed rotary printing presses on order that are being built in Germany and are due for delivery to the new Brooklyn factory in the summer of 1968.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To accomplish all the above printing and to keep all our presses humming, 10,628 tons of paper were used during the year. This was a new peak of paper usage for any one year by the Society. In addition to the above printing paper, we used 701,722 square yards of material to cover the books. The flow of ink into these presses totaled 139 tons, which was all manufactured in the Brooklyn plant. Furthermore, adhesives are </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> vital part of the binding and wrapping of literature. Supplying these needs required our manufacturing 190,066 pounds during the year, all of which was performed in the Brooklyn printing plant. Now the 790 members of the Brooklyn Bethel family eagerly look forward to the coming service year, which will be highlighted by our moving into the new factory addition. For the privilege and facilities to provide better service to our dear workers active in the “disciple-making” work throughout the field of the world, we thank our heavenly Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORTS FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As you read on through this book there will be brief reports of what has been happening in all parts of the world where Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. The countries, islands or territories that will be listed are not necessarily alphabetically arranged. For the alphabetical arrangement of countries, please see the Index on page three. Under the branch office reports you will find islands or territories listed over which the branch office has jurisdiction. For example, you have just finished reading the report for the United States. Under the jurisdiction of the Brooklyn branch office in the United States are Bermuda, Guam, Ponape, Saipan and Truk. Therefore, reports on these places follow the United States report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">BERMUDA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;47,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The highlight of the year was the “Disciple-making&quot; District Assembly held in Bermuda August 3-6. There were approximately 150 brothers in attendance from the United States, and one group from Long Island, New York, was assigned to put on one of the Scriptural dramas, much to the enjoyment of the brothers present for the assembly. It is quite an undertaking for one congregation, which averaged 90 publishers during the service year, to put on an entire district assembly program, so the brothers in Bermuda were glad to have some qualified visitors from the States assigned to give some of the talks on the convention program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The convention opened with an attendance of 287. On Friday there were 318 present, 280 on Saturday and 357 for the public talk on Sunday. So </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> fine witness was given. There were ten baptized, five of whom were from Bermuda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">GUAM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53,744</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The publishers here appreciated the arrangement the Society made for the visit of the zone servant from Taiwan. He also served as district servant at our circuit assembly. We greatly appreciated the shepherding work and encouragement given through the talks and fellowship together. Later in the service year the Society arranged for us to be served by a circuit servant from Laos. We enjoyed sharing experiences and listening to the spiritually upbuilding talks during the week. We appreciate the loving care provided by the Society for the &quot;sheep” here in the western Pacific.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We had five vacation pioneers this year, the largest number to date. A father of five children had this to say after two months of vacation pioneering: “Vacation pioneering helped me to have a deeper appreciation for certain scriptures, such as John 13:34, 35; John 17:16 and Matthew 24:9. I used these scriptures to show that Jehovah’s witnesses are the real Christians on the earth today. Vacation pioneering also strengthened and encouraged me greatly. Now I am looking forward to the time when I can be a regular pioneer.” A mother of four children said this: “The Bible’s assurance that Jehovah cares for his servants gave me peace of mind in vacation pioneering for a short period of time. (Ps. 55:22) My husband appreciated my privilege, saying it would build up our spirituality, so he encouraged me to do what I had resolved in my mind. I had to get up early to get three children ready for school and my husband to work. As early as I could with my boy who is not in school yet, we called on the homes. Housework had to be done early in the morning, and my children helped me when they came home from school. One of the older children would baby-sit while one of the other children went with me on calls later in the afternoon. It was a lasting joy to share the hope I have with the neighbors. Now I have a regular home Bible study with one of them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">PONARE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19, 111</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 20 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 956</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We were privileged to have the visit of one of the Society’s zone servants in December, and his visit marked the first time our new Kingdom Hall was used. Shortly after that it became obvious that our new hall was already too small, and it was a glad day when we received approval of our application to enlarge our hall. Now we are pleased to report that the new addition, which doubles the original size, is nearing completion, and a dedication program is being planned for the early part of the new service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The native custom in killing and preparing animals for food is not in agreement with God’s law, so the families in the congregation either slaughter their own animals or accept meat only if it comes from the brothers. The fleshly brother of one of the sisters tried tempting her five-year-old daughter to eat some pig he had brought from a local feast. But this little youngster steadfastly refused, saying: “I will not eat what my father and mother say is not good, and that pig has blood!” This sister’s mother, who was visiting her, then remarked to her son: “You see, you cannot convince her to eat, because they trained her in God’s law.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The practice of spiritism is prevalent, a large percentage of the “Christian” population actively engaging in it. During one of the public talks on protecting oneself from wicked spirits stress was laid on disposing of any books or articles connected with witchcraft. The next night a brother came to the missionary home and explained that his wife had quite a large assortment of such articles. Her father reportedly had such power that by just pointing his finger at a flying bird it would fall dead. The missionaries, taking some gasoline, along with their Bibles, accompanied this brother. They discussed the matter with his wife and highlighted the apostle’s example recorded at Acts 19: 19. She then brought out her assortment of books filled with incantations and various magic rocks and leaves and bottles filled with liquids. We smashed these first and doused them with gasoline and lit the pile, and very soon they were reduced to a powerless nothing. Quite a number of outsiders were present and they received a good oral and visual lesson as to what true worship involves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Much talk is heard concerning the political future of these islands, which the United States administers under a United Nations trusteeship arrangement. But we are happy that those associated in the hope of God’s new order have adopted the same neutral spirit of God’s people elsewhere. A few days before one interested person was to be baptized he received a letter from the district’s administrator appointing him to the election board of this district. Without any hesitation, though, he wrote a letter back to the administrator thanking him for the appointment but he then tactfully declined, calling attention to his Christian neutrality in regard to anything political. The group here has dropped the fierce interdistrict pride, which is particularly apparent during such celebrations as the United Nations day interdistrict athletic events. They think now of themselves as being “Jehovah’s people,” that &quot;His day is here” and that soon the land will no more be divided into rival districts but, rather, will be united as one land under the rule of Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">SAIPAN, MARIANA ISLANDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8,751</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,188</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the past year the preaching work was centered in the more densely populated areas of the island. In previous years these villages have been the ones showing the most resistance to the Kingdom work. Have there been any results from this concentrated effort? We believe that there have, for many do not manifest prejudice to the extent previously noted. While deeply involved in their religious way of life, more persons are beginning to inquire as to the real nature of our work. We hear less, &quot;You are wasting your time,” and more, “You are doing a good work; you will get through to the younger people.” Thus we see the power of truth at work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At times we have to adjust our manner of spreading the truth to the requirements of the territory or householder and not be discouraged if immediate results are not achieved. It was observed in this territory that if frequent calls were made on some persons who showed interest they would become fearful, perhaps not answering the door, or manifesting uneasiness at the presence of the publisher. However, if time was permitted to pass and then another call was made, the householder would again manifest interest. Gradually, as tiny seeds of truth were planted on successive calls, the time between calls could be cut down from three weeks to a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This was demonstrated in the case of one lady whose first manifestation of interest was actually an act of kindness to a sister who was being harassed by neighborhood children. It took six months of occasional calling to build up her interest so that regular help could be given her in understanding the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">With continued patience and Jehovah’s blessing we are confident that some will take a firm hold on the truth and, as a result, will receive a blessing from its power of preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">TRUK ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26,602</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,660</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The local brothers appreciate and are receiving much benefit from the Theocratic Ministry School. One new sister acted as a householder for her first part in the school. In the introduction she said that she had been invited to a party but that it was on a meeting night and she did not know what to do. So the publisher explained the value of spiritual food over material food as she went into her student talk. The following Saturday the new sister was asked by her family to attend a party on another island the following day. Since this conflicted with her plans to attend the meeting and share in the field service, she took the opportunity to show her husband and the other members of her family the value of spiritual food at the meetings over material food at parties, as she had learned in her ministry school part the preceding Thursday. So the instruction she received in the school enabled her easily to handle this otherwise difficult situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Recently a brother accompanied the field trip ship in order to visit some of the islands lying 100 to 200 miles outside the Truk lagoon (but still in the Truk District) that had never before had the good news declared to them. During the trip seven different islands were visited in the Hall, Nomunwito, and Western Island groups. On most of the islands the people had never before seen a Bible, though they all profess to be Catholics or Protestants. Most people were eager to hear the good news of Jehovah, his organization of witnesses and the new earth. Much literature was placed in Trukese, Japanese and English. When the brother left each island, he was repeatedly asked, “When are you coming back?” This is a difficult question, since there are many islands in this district that have not as yet been visited with Jehovah’s message of peace. So there is much work yet to be done in these islands and the call still goes forth, ‘Step over into Truk and help us.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ALASKA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;269,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 623 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 432</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This has been another fine year of progress in Alaska. It has been particularly characterized by brothers’ reaching out for the pioneer service and to serve where the need is greater. During the year we had five new peaks in regular pioneers and a new peak in vacation pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Pioneering involves a certain amount of self-sacrifice. What effect will it have on growing children if parents take up this special service? This was the concern of a couple who began pioneering just about the time their two sons entered grade school. They explain: “We did not want them to feel that pioneering meant one lived in an upset household, mother out in service when the children returned home from school, and no time together as a family.” So they arranged to do their pioneering while the boys were in school or could be with them in the service, and to have time to do things together as a family. Now both sons have graduated from high school and entered the pioneer service of their own accord. Say the parents: “We feel that family study together, Bible reading, going to the meetings, in the field service, and having a family night of recreation together have contributed to a strong family bond and kept to a minimum the teenyears’ tribulations many others have been forced to cope with.&quot; Even though the boys are out of school, the family still do things together, and they all look forward to their family night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As the service year comes to a close, we are eagerly awaiting reports from brothers who are spending a month special pioneering in some of the larger isolated native villages in Alaska. This is the first time in some years that we have been able to give a concerted witness to these places. Initial reports are very encouraging. One tells of placing the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book with a middle-aged couple who speak very little English. With their children acting as translators, they were overjoyed to hear the account of creation. They remembered having heard of it many years ago, but were told by Christendom’s missionaries that they did not need the Hebrew Scriptures translated into Eskimo, and they were told no more about it. They sang a song in Eskimo: “Jehovah, to Your House We Come.” They know and love Jehovah’s name. The brothers plan to study with this family every day while they are in the village, and we would like to provide permanent help for these people. What a fine opportunity this would be for families who are very strong spiritually, who would like to do real missionary work and are willing to put up with some hardships, but who are unable to leave the United States! We welcome you to come and help us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ARGENTINA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 23,031,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 13,317 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,729</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This has been a most joyous year of theocratic activity, as can be seen from the following experiences. Time and words are not enough to tell them all. Before this new year started we were working on our two “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assemblies. There was greater attendance than anticipated, and, of course, the joy of having the Society’s directors and you, Brother Knorr, living with us at Bethel, and having hundreds of other brothers here from other countries with whom our brothers were able to have Christian companionship, will not be forgotten. These two assemblies have given impetus to the work in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A circuit servant tells us of good results from visiting the inactive publishers in his circuit. In this circuit there are 14 congregations, with 565 publishers. Of these persons, fifteen have been reactivated in the service in the last six months. We hope to have yet more because others have been visited and have responded favorably with the help of the stronger ones in the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Society has placed great stress upon meeting attendance and the need of helping all associated with the organization to be in Jehovah’s house for instruction. Stress was put upon the need to help the weaker ones. We suggested in the circuit assemblies and also in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> that the overseers and servants take an active part in organizing family studies for preparation for coming meetings. One week the servant could go to the home of the family he was helping, and the next week the family could come to his home. In this way they would have an interchange of places. One congregation reports that twelve such studies have been organized. The average attendance was sixty-two at the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study, but now this has increased to eighty in a congregation of seventy-seven publishers. Some of the congregations are reporting more than 100 percent attendance at the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> in Spanish was received with great joy. Many have been the fine comments on the translation, the understandable language, the scripture index and also the fine appendix. Our first shipment of 25,000 Bibles just simply disappeared. We have shipped out from the Branch over 35,000. We are very proud of this and we are glad to have this excellent work provided by Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This report would not be complete without mentioning the pioneer service. It is good to see a greater number of our brothers put forth special efforts so as to be able to meet the pioneer requirements. Two sisters who live in the country on farms are 105 kilometers from their territory. All the family is in the truth, so these sisters are able to arrange their affairs to take care of their household duties and also meet the requirements as regular pioneers. The husbands and others in the family do their share of the work so that these two sisters can be pioneers. Diligent in their service, they make the trip of 105 kilometers to work where there is a small congregation during the week, and on weekends they attend the local meetings. As soon as they reach their pioneer goal they return to take care of their household duties. While they are away from the farm, the men, who are brothers, prepare the meals and take care of the work in the field, and they are very happy to do it. One of the brothers, who is an overseer, says: “Since we are not able to pioneer, we are very willing to help our wives to take part in this privilege of service.” It can be appreciated that, when all the family work together, arrangements can be made for some to be pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The pioneer service can be enjoyed by young and old. A brother who is now eighty-seven years old learned the truth when he was eighty. He even learned to read and write. Although he has ailments, he is very active in Jehovah’s service, preaching and making back-calls in his territory. Sometimes he walks as far as three or four kilometers a day. In April this brother decided to be a two-week vacation pioneer. He made the goal of hours, placed three books, one subscription, 236 magazines and made 25 back-calls. This brother said that the joys he has now, serving in Jehovah’s organization and telling the truth to other people, are very great. The only thing he regrets is not having known the truth while young.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another sister arranged to take part in the vacation pioneer activity for two weeks, and for the first time since being a publisher she had to work territory that is very much worked, but this did not slow her down. As a vacation pioneer she placed 10 books, 41 booklets and 240 magazines, obtained 3 subscriptions, and made 49 back-calls. This sister cannot read and write. The success she had was due to her being positive in her presentation. If you are young or old, whether you can read or write, the pioneer service is for you too. We are very pleased to have had 2,642 brothers taking part in the vacation pioneer service during this year, and many more will do it during this coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRALIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 11,651,34©</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 17,989 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 648</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Because all ports throughout the country are assigned to various congregations, the ships coming to Australian ports get constant attention. One brother approached a Greek ship and was told by the captain that it was not permitted for any of Jehovah’s witnesses to speak to the men. He was told by the captain: “It is forbidden by the Greek government.” The publisher then suggested that if he left some literature in the crew’s common room he would not be speaking to the men and hence not violating the government’s direction. The captain smilingly replied in the affirmative and, to the delight of the brother, he was able to leave literature for these men to read. So the planting of the seed of truth goes on regardless of government restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We should never overlook studying God’s Word with our little ones, because the benefits can be felt and seen at a very tender age. A brother’s little daughter, six years of age, was settling in for her second year at school. One morning the teacher announced that the entire class would be taught to pray to God and that every morning they would have a prayer session. The children were told to clasp their hands in front of themselves and bow their heads and repeat the prayer after the teacher. Everything was going according to plan until the teacher noticed that our young six-year-old publisher did not have her hands clasped in front of her and did not have her head bowed, not even repeating the prayer. The teacher was very angry and asked the little one why she did not obey. The youngster explained that she did not believe in what they were praying for and did not think it was right to pray like that. The teacher was furious and threatened the child; however, the child held to what she had been taught by her parents. The parents were able to explain later to the schoolteacher the reason for their daughter’s stand. How glad they were to see their young child actually practising the things they had been inculcating from a very early age!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Once again the value of training a child while young is demonstrated in the following experience. The brother was away from home, and his wife and young sons went to visit some relatives. They were invited to stay for a meal and the meal consisted of black sausage. The children in their studies had been taught that black sausages are associated with sausages made from blood. The youngest son, four and a half years old, refused to accept his lunch. Dad had told him that black sausages have blood in them. His mother tried to reason with him and pointed out that these particular ones were made entirely of vegetables and meat but no blood. This wasn’t good enough, however, because father had said black means blood. His mother and aunt tried to persuade him, telling him it was silly and unreasonable, but he replied: “I wouldn’t take it if you killed me for it.” His auntie retaliated: “O yes you would if you were going to be killed.” “No,” he replied, “even if the heavens fell on me and killed me, I wouldn’t eat any blood.” He did not eat his sausage. Although there was no blood involved, as far as he was concerned there was, and this young child was prepared to stand firm for his convictions, undoubtedly acquired as a result of the home Bible study with his father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A sister was talking to a young woman in house-to-house work when a priest stepped in, apparently the householder’s parish priest. Mockingly, the young woman said to the priest: “Look, this lady is one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” The sister just smiled a greeting at the priest and said: “Certainly as God’s minister you would love the Bible too, and here I have a marvelous magazine to help people understand it more.” He calmly replied: “Well, if it’s the latest number, I’ll have it, because all the others I’ve already read. They help me a lot in my sermons.” The householder was dumbfounded. The need for being courageous and strong under all circumstances and relying on Jehovah’s spirit is certainly demonstrated in this experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Conducting studies with a purpose really pays dividends. A brother had been conducting a study for nearly two years with a family, but during this time they seldom came to meetings and never went witnessing. The study was then handed over to another publisher who immediately started out with a purpose in view; he picked the family up each Sunday for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study. This started to help all of them overcome the language problem, and their study began to move along at a faster rate. After three months of this, his next purpose was to get the family into the field service regularly. So during the next three months the family was regularly called on to be taken out in the field service Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning. Back-calls were specifically made on people of their own nationality to enable them to use what knowledge they had gained and thus help others. This program with a purpose proved very successful. The three younger members, aged nineteen, sixteen and ten years, are now all speaking English well and enjoy the magazine work. The parents, too, now witness quite well in English. Three of the family are now baptized and the other two are desirous of baptism a little later on. This family is now conducting six separate studies with other families and are no doubt going about it with a purpose. When asked what really started them witnessing, they all replied that it was due to being picked up for meetings and witnessing. With this loving attention and happy association with the brothers, how could they do anything else but advance in Kingdom service?</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Having “quit being fashioned after this system of things,” Jehovah’s people are truly different. (Rom. 12:2) For example, they take a different attitude toward their secular work than do worldly persons. An assistant congregation servant, the father of three children, optimistically responded to the encouragement to try to find secular work that would enable him to attend meetings regularly. He went to his employer and said: “You know that I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses and that I believe the Bible. But my conscience is bothering me because I cannot serve Jehovah as I would like to.” His employer replied: “Well, what can I do about it?” The brother then requested to be put on the morning shift, whatever his work assignment might be, so that he could attend congregation meetings regularly. His employer said: “Right now I cannot see any possibility. You are a good worker, and putting you on in the morning would mean a loss of 900 shillings for you.” To this the brother told him that he was happy to hear the commendation, but if things would not work out, he would have to look for new employment, even though he liked his present place of work. The employer thought things over and the next day made the suggestion that the brother stick to his present working time but be allowed to go home from work four hours earlier on meeting days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If he later found the opportunity, he was willing to put the brother on the morning shift. By putting God’s kingdom ahead of secular work, our brother not only continues to provide adequate material things for his family but is able to attend meetings with them regularly too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses are also recognized as a “different” kind of people by their willing compliance with all of Caesar’s laws that are in harmony with the principles contained in God’s Word. A special pioneer was on her way to make a return call. A short distance before she came to the house, she saw a sign forbidding bicycle riding, so she immediately got off her bicycle and started walking, pushing her bicycle alongside. A stranger asked her why she was not riding, at which our sister mentioned the sign she had seen. The lady retorted: “Who will care about that? My neighbor always rides through here! Of course, if a policeman comes along, she will have to pay a fine.” The special pioneer explained: “In my instance it is not the fine but my conscience that matters.” Astonished, the woman exclaimed: “You must be one of Jehovah’s witnesses! I am not one; I am Catholic. What impresses me is that, whereas you have the same Bible, you follow it; but we, unfortunately, do not.” The special pioneer was rewarded for her being “different” by being able to arrange for a back-call.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Several of the out islands that had not been visited for several years were visited, and a great deal of literature was left in the hands of the inhabitants to read and to study. For example, a circuit servant and his wife visited most of the people on the Exuma islands, and in twelve days they placed 116 books plus other literature and showed the Society’s film six times to a combined attendance of 436, two of these showings being in Baptist churches. Two days were spent on Green Turtle Cay, where 26 books were left with the 326 inhabitants. A good share of the population of Cat Island received a witness, 77 bound books being placed, and much real interest was found. One elderly man brought out a worn copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font11"> that he had received twelve years before and said he had read it many times. Some of this interest is being taken care of through letter writing. Several publishers from Florida vacation pioneered in one of the settlements on Abaco island and were very enthusiastic with the results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Should we pass over people who may be aged, or blind or sick, thinking that they would not be of much aid in the ministry? A sister had just such a situation, but what was the outcome for her? She said: “During the year I met and started studying with a lady eighty years old and completely blind. She manifested so much interest that I studied with her regularly. We went through the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font11"> booklet, and she was thrilled with the truth. In June she agreed to an eye operation and has since regained the use of both eyes. She said she felt that God had allowed her to go blind so she would sit and listen to learn the truth. How glad I am that, when I thought I could have spent the time more profitably with someone younger and able to do more, I took the advice of a brother who said: ‘Such persons need life as much as younger persons and if she appreciates the study and is progressing well, continue to study with her.’ ” This lady is a great-grandmother and witnesses to her many friends and relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Good progress has been made working among the Haitians who have come to the Bahamas due to the difficult conditions in Haiti. There are now two </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> studies being conducted in French for their benefit, and several of them share in the ministry each month. One Haitian family had been studying for about two years, and during this time the father and daughter began taking part in the service. While the mother studied, it did not appear that she was making much progress. She had been raised among some nuns when she was a child and she constantly made mention of them and what they taught her. One night the circuit servant gave a talk to the group on progress. On the way home after the talk the sister who studied with her made arrangements for service with another publisher. When they arrived at her home, she asked the sister when she could go out in the service. Arrangements were made and the first morning out in the service she gave the sermon, speaking up well and using good illustrations. She put in well over the goal of hours the first month, placing many magazines and some books. Both she and her husband are now thinking of being baptized soon. The sister who studies with them says: “One outstanding thing about this family is how they have become closer together because of the truth. They do more things together, reading the Bible and studying </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> as a family.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The Caribbean island of Barbados is the location of the Society’s branch office that has oversight of the work in that island as well as Bequia, Carriacou, Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent. Much fine work has been done in these islands during the past year. In Barbados the Society is planning to provide a new branch office building and home for those who are giving oversight to the work in the above-mentioned islands. All the brothers are anxious to begin work on the headquarters property because it will give real identity to God’s organization in the community and will create greater respect for the work that his organized people are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">An experience that began more than six years ago continues to have good effects on the brothers here. We will let the brother tell it to you, though. “For the last seven years, my wife and I have had added responsibilities in our lives in the way of a young child. We determined from the start that we would do everything possible to stay in the full-time ministry and still properly care for our new charge. Carefully watching expenses and living within our means have been key factors in fulfilling our desire to remain in full-time service. (All this time the brother was serving as circuit servant, and his wife accompanied him as a pioneer.) Our boy now goes to school and we have received a change in assignment to the special pioneer work. Of course, this means more time spent in service; however, we find that a good schedule that is adhered to has allowed us to care well for our family responsibilities, our personal study and the congregation’s ministry.” Of what example and value has their experience been? Do others appreciate their work? Not long ago the brother started a study with an inactive sister and her seven children in an endeavour to aid them spiritually and to pass on the benefits of their experience. The association proved upbuilding, for not only has the sister been reactivated but her seven children now share with her regularly in the ministry as new publishers. In fact, over the past six months this couple have been able to assist at least ten inactive ones to revive their service efforts and share regularly in the house-to-house ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The friends experienced a setback at the beginning of the 1966 service year, but by enduring it they learned a valuable lesson that will be of great aid for the future—that adversity has a refining power. The special pioneer overseer explains what happened: “We experienced a great setback when about half the publishers violated their neutrality by getting involved in recent elections. A time of tension ensued, but firmness for right principle brought a blessing and had a strengthening effect on all of us. Up to now only one of the violators has not shown repentance and asked for Jehovah’s mercy and forgiveness. Jehovah has rewarded our faith and he has blessed us with four new publishers, giving us a grand peak of twentyeight by August. All the meetings have increased in attendance, and we now have an average of thirtyseven at the public meeting and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CARRIACOU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The brothers are working hard to bring about an increase in praise and the number of praisers of Jehovah. They are making disciples; however, a number of publishers have migrated again this year. The friends are not discouraged by this because they know they have produced fellow praisers and that their work has not been in vain. There is still much interest to cultivate, as was evidenced by the ninety-five in attendance at the Memorial. Clergy influence is great but has not unduly interfered with finding and feeding the “sheep.” On recommendation from the circuit servant the brothers changed times and place of meetings so that more persons could benefit from them. The results have been gratifying, as there has been an excellent 100-percent increase in attendance at all meetings. The service year closed with a 4-percent increase, on an average, in publishers, and all are happy with the growth God gave.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The Bible exerts power and is able to influence persons to pursue a course of godly service as opposed to a life of worldly enjoyment, which leaves little time for spiritual matters. This truth is well illustrated by an interested man who was a member of a dance group. Right from the beginning he placed a higher value on spiritual matters than worldly advancement and would not neglect his Bible study even when the dance group had important meetings or rehearsals. When an opportunity came up for the group to travel, he declined to go. Again he had a chance to go to Expo 67 in Canada as a performer, but again his decision was in favour of spiritual interests. Finally, he resigned from the group because it was apparent that his association with it would be constantly creating problems and affecting him spiritually. The righteous truths of the Bible are now influencing him to put other personal matters into good order so that he can share in Kingdom service and be in condition to make an acceptable dedication to Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A sister was giving a doorstep sermon, but the householder changed the subject to a personal matter that was troubling her. She was concerned about an operation she was soon to undergo, and the sister listened kindly to her problem. The subject of blood came up, and the sister found it necessary to emphasize God’s law on the use of blood. The householder expressed appreciation for the information. Several days later the lady went in for her operation and was informed she would need blood by transfusion. On the basis of that short sermon several days earlier, she refused to have a share in a violation of God’s law. Her wishes were respected and the operation was satisfactorily performed without blood. When the sister called back, the lady thanked her again for the information on blood and said that she had a clean conscience for having done what was right. Calls are being made on this lady to assist her to show even greater love and devotion for the Bible’s laws and principles.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">During the year the Society was successful in having two missionaries admitted to the country, and a new missionary home was established in Kingstown. It does not take years to experience a blessing either, as one of the missionaries writes: &quot;On arriving I immediately began looking for good progressive Bible students. I soon found three excellent prospects, one with a large family of interested people. All are making rapid progress. When the circuit servant visited our congregation, all three came to the public talk. In fact, one brought with her eight other people, including the family maid. All three are beginning to attend more meetings now too. The growing season has been a short five months, but it has been a pleasure to watch Jehovah make the small plants grow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another missionary writes: “I called on a woman who showed interest but declined to take any literature, since she was then involved in a correspondence Bible course. I was able to leave the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font11"> booklet with her, however, and a Bible study was started in it. As the studies progressed, the truths presented seemed to have a disturbing effect on her. Then one day I went for the study and she showed me a letter from a local minister who wrote to her in reply to a letter she had written to him in which she asked his opinion on many of the things she had learned in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font11"> booklet. A vain attempt was made in the letter to prove as valid Scriptural teachings such pagan ideas as the immortality of the soul, trinity, and so forth, and the letter concluded by saying that Jehovah’s witnesses are false teachers and she should not spend time studying with them. This attack on God’s people did not achieve the intended result, rather it created more interest. Now at our studies she is full of questions, whereas before the letter she would accept what was said and did not question things too much. I feel she is one of the Lord’s ‘sheep’ and is searching for the truth.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A service year richly blessed by Jehovah has now ended and the brothers here in Belgium are very happy. Never before in theocratic history in this land has so much been accomplished for Jehovah and his kingdom and that by so many publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At the district assembly the Italian brothers, for the first time, prepared their own dramas and narration, including their own costumes. The Greek brothers prepared their own Greek narration for “Jehovah’s Name to Be Declared in All the Earth,” and the Spanish brothers, by a system of synchronization, were able to follow the French-speaking dramas while listening to the tape recordings in Spanish. Our three district assemblies were held in five languages—French, Dutch, Italian, Greek and Spanish. Here are the attendance figures for Sunday afternoon: French, 5,619; Dutch, 5,111; Italian, 1,025; Greek, 148; Spanish, 140. Total: 12,043. This was 2,852 more (30-percent increase) than in 1966, and 394 were baptized. Press reports were the best obtained up to now. The principal papers, which previously had ignored Jehovah’s witnesses, sent reporters to the assemblies and gave excellent writeups. Interesting comments accompanied photographs of the dramas. Twenty-two papers published a total of 2,244 inches of material. For the first time and on the nationwide wavelength, the radio broadcast an interview on the theme “Women Ministers.” Wives of two circuit servants were interviewed. The speaker concluded with these words: “As you can see, these women ministers, Jehovah’s witnesses, have a very special viewpoint on life and their religion is truly a way of life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Little things can bring big results. A circuit servant received his accommodation address and was surprised to see that he was to stay with a sister and her husband, a husband who apparently had been opposed to the truth. Wondering what the situation would be, the brother and his wife were agreeably surprised to find themselves received by a united, harmonious and theocratic family. What had caused the change, so remarkable and so rapid? It all revolved around a button! Yes, a button, and this is how the brother (he is now baptized and a servant in the congregation) told his story. Coming to the circuit assembly hall to pick up his wife, he found that the session had not yet finished, but his curiosity caused him to look around the entrance hall. The brother continues: “I must say that nothing specially interested me until I saw a placard on the Lost and Found table. On this placard was a button, just one button. It was a beautiful button and the one who had lost it would now have to replace all the others if she did not find it. All this passed through my mind in a flash. I said to myself, So these people go to all the trouble of first picking up the button, taking it to the Lost and Found, where someone sewed it onto the placard and then placed it in a conspicuous place on the table—all that so that its owner could have the chance of finding it and so avoid replacing all the others. That there existed people who were ready to do all that just to give pleasure to their neighbor . . . well, it overwhelmed me! That was something absolutely new for me and I just had to look into it. And that’s what I did!” So here is another disciple of Jesus Christ; by means of a button Jehovah permitted this person to see that his people are not like others, and to us it shows that faithfulness in little things can sometimes bring big results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Incidental witnessing produces results in many strange ways. A brother who is a university professor was able to show to about eighteen students that a small book that purported to be a book of Chinese proverbs contained, in fact, modified extracts from the proverbs in the Bible. A discussion followed about different religions. Among the students was a married man, young in years, who worked periodically in a gas station. One day a client came with a car that apparently looked the worse for wear, and the student said: “You will soon have to buy a new car.” The client replied: “I hope it will last until Armageddon:” The garage attendant asked the client (who, of course, was a brother) what the word meant, and he naturally received the explanation without difficulty. The young man then recalled the conversation he had had with the brother-professor and wanted to know more. Today he is also one of us, rejoicing in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">BOLIVIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,293,496</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Last November the Society began building a new branch and missionary home building in La Paz to provide better service to the congregations, and now, just short of completion, the beautiful structure brings comments from everyone who passes by. It is a handsome building of three floors, with plenty of glass to let in the warmth of the sun. The Kingdom Hall is very spacious and beautifully decorated, with room for over 150 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A further grand blessing came in July with the arrival of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font11"> in Spanish. The first shipment of 1,500 copies was immediately sent out to the congregations, and the Bolivian brothers are rejoicing in the very clear rendering of difficult Hebrew Scripture passages. Their ministry is greatly enhanced by this marvelous new translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the year efforts have been made to extend the Kingdom message to the Aymara- and Quechuaspeaking populations, with good success. Isolated groups speaking these dialects have received better attention from the office and the circuit servants. We are happy to report two new congregations on the Altiplano to serve the Aymara-speaking people, and it appears that once we can find enough Aymara- and Quechuaspeaking special pioneers to send to the extensive rural population of Bolivia, hundreds of these humble people will flow to Jehovah’s pure worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One experience from a special pioneer on the Altiplano shows how eager the Indian population can be to accept the truth. The special pioneer visited an isolated territory among the Aymara-speaking population and was invited to talk to an Evangelist church group of eighty persons. One truth-hungry family of ten showed a keen interest in studying, and arrangements were made for back-calls^ Great changes took place in the small community. The local church was on the property of this family, and suddenly the pastor found himself without their support. The spirit of the Christmas festivities was dampened by the family, who quite staunchly refused to take part. They were free and open in expressing their feelings about the pagan origin of Christmas customs. The pastor was filled with rage, not only toward the family, but toward the special pioneer. When it was known he would be coming for the study, opposers would lie in wait along the road with guns to try to frighten him, but without success. When displays of anger would not dissuade the determination of the family, false accusations were brought against Jehovah’s witnesses, denouncing them as Communists and as false prophets. Mobs were organized by the church leaders to heckle the family, and the pastor even threathened them with death for causing divisions in &quot;his” church. But nothing could change the truth in the hearts of the members of the family, and for a year they continued making excellent progress. At </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> recent circuit assembly in La Paz three of the family were baptized, and now the whole family of ten are publishing and finding many hearing ears among the humble people in their neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">An interesting way to bring an opposing husband around to see the truth has been found by the brothers in one congregation. A housewife began a study with Jehovah’s witnesses, but when her husband heard of the study he began to oppose strongly. She continued the study during the day while he was at work. One day she invited the overseer and his wife over for a surprise visit on her husband. He remained cold and unfriendly, but did agree to let his wife continue studying. The brothers made persistent calls on him from time to time with no apparent change. Time passed and it appeared ripe to invite the wife in field service. The husband absolutely refused, saying: “If you go from door to door I will break every bone in your body.” Another time he threatened: “The first door you go to will see my pistol ready.” The housewife explained his attitude to the overseer and even showed him the box of bullets. It seemed advisable to continue trying to improve the attitude of the husband, so the friendly calls were continued until he did begin attending the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study with his wife. However, his attitude remained cold and unfriendly. The brothers began assigning the wife parts in demonstrations and talks on the Theocratic Ministry School program and encouraged her to seek the help of her husband. She followed the advice of the brothers and asked her husband to help her with sermons and demonstrations. Little by little, without his really knowing it, he was being prepared for field service through the help of his wife. Six months passed and the brothers could discern the man’s attitude changing. He became friendlier at the meetings. He finally agreed to let his wife share openly in field service. After a time the wife saw the need of dedication and made it known that she wished to be baptized at the national assembly in La Paz. Her husband agreed to accompany her and, to the great surprise of everyone, since that assembly he has progressed in knowledge and has begun to share in the service seriously. Now he is the Bible study servant in the congregation. It appears that all the time he was opposing his wife he was analyzing the truth, and the sincere and earnest efforts of the brothers were convincing him of the rightness of the truth and the need to serve God zealously.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">This has been a year of prosperity for Jehovah’s people in Brazil. At the close of the service year the construction of a new Bethel home, office and factory was well under way, and many new Kingdom Halls have been built by the congregations. The new publication </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God</span><span class="font11"> has already received a wide distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The one thing that stands out most in the minds of the publishers and that contributed greatly to all these blessings was the “God’s Sons of Liberty” assembly in January. It was truly an international gathering, with more than 600 delegates from 19 countries outside Brazil, and a total of more than 46,000 in attendance for the public talk. The program built up the brothers spiritually, and the presence of several members of the governing body of Jehovah’s organization was deeply appreciated. The good effects from the assembly will continue for many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Not all come into the truth through a direct witness. A sister was returning from conducting a home Bible study one night when a youth grabbed her book bag, jumped into a waiting car and fled. Three weeks later a man came to the door asking for the sister. His son had brought home a Bible, saying he had found it, and the Witness’s name and address was in it. The father did not believe the story, and finally the son confessed that, when he found no money, he threw everything else away but could not bring himself to throw away the Bible. The publisher asked why the father had waited three weeks to return the Bible, and he answered: “I didn’t bring it before, for I was studying the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines</span><span class="font11"> that you have in the back of your Bible. Now I understand many things that I didn’t before and I have learned that the things spoken against Jehovah’s witnesses in my church are not true. Could you get me a copy of the booklet?” A study was started, with the entire family participating, including the youth that had taken the bag. The family is making good progress, and the father is preparing for baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A Witness who is a schoolteacher was named director of a school group. In the time set aside for religious instruction she planned a study of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font11">book, but since only four children were from families of Jehovah’s witnesses, she expected the rest to ask to be excused. But first she called a meeting of the mothers and explained that she would conduct a Bible study with the help of one of the publications of Jehovah’s witnesses. She was pleasantly surprised when at the first class sixteen children were sent by their parents to receive instruction, and now that the study is in progress others have joined in. Another Witness who is a teacher also conducts a class for religious instruction from the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book and loans out the book at night for those who want to read more. One student always asked for the book each weekend, so the teacher visited the home to see just how much interest there was in the Bible. She found the young girl using the book to study with her parents, and the Witness was able to give them further help. The family later moved to another city but the study continued, and now father, mother and daughter have dedicated their lives to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Not only teachers but also children of Jehovah’s witnesses teach in school. A mother told of sending her small son to kindergarten, but first explained in detail some of the things that might come up that are not approved in God’s Word. She also visited the teacher and explained the Scriptural view of these things. One day when she went to get the little boy, the teacher called to her and told her she admired the child very much, for he stood up for his beliefs. One of the children brought a cake to school to celebrate his birthday, and the teacher had been given the Bible reasons why Jehovah’s witnesses do not celebrate birthdays, so she wondered what the child would do. When the other children sang the birthday song, the little boy sat silent. When the cake was cut and he was offered a piece he politely refused and ate the lunch he had with him. The mother was especially proud of her son’s understanding, for she said: “He likes cake very much.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In building their Kingdom Halls the brothers do most or all of the construction work themselves, working nights and weekends. When one congregation started to build they found they had a Catholic neighbor on one side and a Protestant on the other, both opposed to Jehovah’s witnesses. The first Sunday the two neighbors went to a city official and told him that Jehovah’s witnesses were putting up an enormous building without permission and were working on Sunday so they would not be caught. They wanted the official to go immediately and stop the work. He refused but said he would look into it on Monday. He contacted the brothers the following day and found they did have a permit to build, and they explained that they were working on Sunday because all were volunteer workers. He was very favorably impressed and took a personal interest in the work and helped the brothers in a number of ways. A nice Kingdom Hall was built in just ten weeks, and over five hundred attended the dedication.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">It has been a pleasure for Jehovah’s witnesses in British Honduras to declare the good news of God’s kingdom during the past twelve months. Much good has been done in behalf of the people. The “God’s Sons of Liberty” assembly in December of 1966 proved to be a spiritual feast for all. The program aided those in attendance to further appreciate their Godgiven privilege of being ministers of the Kingdom good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of special concern to Jehovah’s people in British Honduras is the interest in the Bible that is found in the field service. We well realize the need of helping persons come to a knowledge of the truth. A pioneer relates an experience that shows the concern of God’s servants in spreading the truth: “I was conducting a Bible study with a woman and was using the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font11"> booklet. As we finished the booklet I introduced one of the Society’s other publications. However, I noted a rather timid attitude about continuing the study. Upon making several more calls to encourage the woman to study, I finally found the reason why she did not want to continue. She felt that she was not well enough advanced in her ability to read. Therefore I suggested that we study together in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book. From that time on, she took much interest in the study and prepared her lessons well in advance. She attended a public lecture given by the circuit servant and now has expressed her desire to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses as soon as she can straighten out her personal affairs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the year we have not neglected the isolated territory in British Honduras. A family that came from the United States bought a farm near the Guatemalan border. This family has had good success with the people of that locality. The people living in the villages where the brother and his family work mainly speak the Indian dialect and Spanish, while a few speak some English. The brother has this to say concerning the work there: “In this district of British Honduras very few people have ever heard of the good news of God’s kingdom, and it is a great joy to teach those who have a desire to learn the truth. Being very eager and teachable, they readily agree to study the Bible. It is nothing unusual to start a study on the first visit and have people help us by interpreting our discussion into the local language so that others in attendance may learn.” The circuit servant just visited this family and reports that there is much interest in the area. The brother just ordered ten reading and writing aids in the Spanish language so as to aid the people further in learning to read and write.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH ISLES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 53,424,700</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 53,047 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,007</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This has been an exceptionally joyful and thrilling year for Jehovah’s witnesses in the British field. After two or three years with very little numerical increase to show for a lot of hard work, some had concluded that all the “sheep” were already found. But this last year, in addition to being the finest we have ever had in respect to volume of work done in the field, has also seen a very encouraging increase. Much of the experience gained in the past two years visiting and helping the weak and inactive ones has borne fruitage, and many “prodigals” have been recovered, to our great joy. Our report includes a summary of activity, not only in the British Isles, but also in Aden and Malta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Much good work was done by the fine article “Were You Once a Kingdom Publisher?” in the March 1, 1967, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> A sister was visiting her own natural sister who is not a Witness. She learned that a couple who had recently moved in next door were Witnesses, though apparently they never went to meetings. She learned their name and, when she got home, sent them a copy of this </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> pointing out the article. Imagine her joy at receiving the following letter from this couple, whom she had not yet met: “Dear Margaret, Although at the moment neither Michael nor I can call you to mind, we, nevertheless, thank you sincerely for sending us </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">and wonder what prompted you to do so. Michael has been on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and the articles in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> were so fitting and so helpful to us both. We have not attended meetings or taken an active part as Jehovah’s witnesses for several years now, and although we had everything materially neither of us had any real happiness. I work in a hospital for mentally handicapped children, perhaps even putting this before my home and family. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> arrived when things had all come to a head and both Michael and I were in despair. Deep down in our hearts we both know the truth is really the answer. We attended the Memorial for the first time in four years, and enjoyed meeting the brothers and sisters. Michael would like to start a Bible study again. We hope to go to the meeting on Sunday, God willing. We would like to hear from you again.” What a wonderful reward for being alert to help even those we have never met!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In these days when young people come in for much criticism, we have many reasons to be proud of the young ones in the New World society. We would like to share the following letter from a sixteen-year-old girl with you. “Two years ago my mother died, a faithful witness of Jehovah. After her death my father began to fall away from the truth to the point of opposing us, even encouraging my two younger brothers and me to go the way of the world. The three of us had been taught the truth from infancy, so I went on encouraging them to attend meetings and share in field service. We continued our Bible study without our father’s lead. Sometime later another family came to live with us, a former brother and sister with their two children. They had fallen away from the truth but still felt their children should attend meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In order to help them I arranged a study in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book and drew the two children into our study, preparing them for meetings. In the two years that have elapsed we have had many ups and downs, and now my father is disfellowshipped. But the effort has all proved worth while. John now answers at the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study, Ian gave his first student talk a few weeks ago, and Sue gives hers in two weeks. Keith was baptized at the Cardiff assembly, has a study of his own and vacation pioneered in April; and I now have the privilege of being enrolled as a pioneer.” This faithful sixteen-year-old girl looks after the home, has a part-time job, cares for the spiritual welfare of four younger ones and is a pioneer, all in the face of adult indifference and opposition. One’s heart just overflows with love and gratitude for such line young people, of whom we have many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How true it is that we are ministers twenty-four hours a day! Our conduct is certainly noticed everywhere. A brother who is a male nurse in a hospital was suddenly asked one day by a patient: “Why don’t you swear all day long like the others?” The brother paraphrased Ephesians 5:4, explaining that he was a minister of Jehovah’s witnesses and that foolish talk and obscene jesting were not fitting for Christians. The patient then asked where this could be found in the Bible, pulling out a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span><span class="font11"> The brother was pleased to help him find it and left him a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font11"> booklet. The patient was discharged shortly after that, and the brother and his wife made a call on him at home. The interest planted in the hospital has been maintained, and a regular study is now progressing well with both the man and his wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We ought to tell you, Brother Knorr, how much we have all enjoyed the magazines this year, particularly the special issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> on evolution and on why God permits wickedness. They have done a tremendous work. Our brothers were really enthusiastic about the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> campaign and we had the great joy of almost doubling the number of subscriptions obtained the previous year. Many pioneers had great success in obtaining subscriptions on their magazine routes. One pioneer obtained twenty-two subscriptions in two days from route calls, and an elderly pioneer who has been in the truth forty-five years obtained sixty-nine subscriptions during the campaign. We all look forward to doing a further fine work with the magazines in the coming year and seeing Jehovah’s rich blessing upon our efforts again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ADEN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;285,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">For the first nine months of the year the few British sisters in Aden continued to give a witness as best they were able under difficult conditions. Then, in June, the gradual British withdrawal from Aden resulted in the last publisher’s having to leave. We hope that in the months ahead the political situation will stabilize sufficiently to revive the possibility of brothers’ entering Aden for secular work, so that the witness work may be resumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">MAETA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;318,100</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">There are probably very few countries in what is known as Christendom where </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> person cannot obtain a Bible in his own tongue. Yet that is true of Malta. This tiny rocky isle in the middle of the Mediterranean that showed such hospitality to the shipwrecked apostle Paul has for many centuries been a Roman Catholic stronghold, and even today the church there exercises almost mediaeval power. But times are changing. The younger generation especially, while outwardly conforming, are in many cases inwardly becoming agnostic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One such sincere person heard talk in her large village about a family that were studying the Bible and had left the church and, despite the efforts of the archpriest to recover them, insisted that they had at last found the truth. This truth-hungry soul determined to search them out. She thought up an excuse for calling on them; but when she saw the sister she forgot all about her excuse for calling, and her questions came tumbling out: “Who is teaching you the Bible? Where are you learning it? Will you teach me the Bible?” A study was arranged and this person showed herself a keen and devoted student in learning the “pure language” spiritually as she valiantly grappled with a new language linguistically; and her continual progress in both shows Jehovah’s blessing. This student early began to associate and ever since has ‘not forsaken the assembling together,’ with a sister beside her to whisper a Maltese translation occasionally as necessary.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Do you work your territory “thoroughly,” as Paul did? (Acts 20:20, 21) This experience shows how important it is. Two special pioneers, after finishing the day’s house-to-house ministry, realized that they had missed a home. So they went back to the territory just to witness to the family in that house. To their surprise, they found a lady who was overjoyed to get </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> for she had read a copy about three years ago, but she had never met the Witnesses. When she heard of the free Bible studies, she readily agreed to have one in her home. Her uncle, who is a Baptist pastor, came to visit her. She asked him some Bible questions and, when he could not answer her questions, he told her that giving her an answer would be like casting pearls before swine. His rude attitude exposed him as a false shepherd. This helped her to appreciate the truth all the more. In six months’ time she progressed so rapidly that she symbolized her dedication by water baptism during a recent circuit assembly. A “sheep” was found because the pioneers were “thorough” in covering their territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Do not be discouraged when people fail to respond to the message at once, but show endurance, for Ecclesiastes 11:1 says: “Send out your bread upon the surface of the waters, for in the course of many days you will find it again.” During his house-to-house ministry a special pioneer met one of the prominent leaders of Christendom. This person was well known in his locality for his drunkenness and gambling habits. The pioneer placed some books with him and had regular discussions but saw no response, because his church position prevented him from appreciating the truth. However, “in the course of many days” he read the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon the Great.”</span><span class="font11"> The enlightenment he gained impressed him so much that he found himself repeating the words “Babylon the Great” even when he was not reading the book. He decided to come out of Great Babylon, and so he asked the pioneer to study with him. Due to the regular study his habits began to change. As the circuit assembly approached, the pioneer explained the meaning of dedication and baptism. The man attended the assembly with the brothers and, in harmony with his request to God for a clean conscience, he was immersed in water along with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Young publishers, do you hesitate to witness to the aged? There is no reason why you should, for the following letter from an educated aged person, who learned the truth with the help of a young uneducated publisher, shows that worldly adults do not know the scriptures even as much as our youths: “One rainy day two young men came to my house. Thinking they had come to take shelter from the rains, I invited them in. But they introduced themselves as ministers and gave a sermon. After hearing it I was surprised to know that these young men knew more about the future of the earth than I did, I am now seventy-four years old and have been a Baptist since the age of fourteen and have been looked upon as an elder and committee member of the woman’s group in my town, but my knowledge of the Bible seemed nothing in comparison to that of these youths. They left me some magazines and tracts and I became engrossed in reading them. What I read made me think seriously, and I wanted to meet them again to ask some questions. To my surprise and joy, they came back to see me. One of them started a Bible study with me. Since that day I have been very happy to know the true God and his purposes. With God’s help I have now gained a better understanding of his Word. My only regret is that I did not get the truth sooner. I could then have done more for our Creator. Still, I am very thankful that during the remaining short period of my life-span I can yet serve Jehovah God. Some of my old friends and associates have mocked and reviled me for becoming one of Jehovah’s witnesses. With contempt, they would say: ‘Better if you had gone back to Buddhism.’ But I am happy to be counted among those that are hated for Jesus’ name’s sake!” Today she is a dedicated Witness. So, youths, do not hesitate to witness to the aged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CAMEROUN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;4,087,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">This has been a very busy year for Jehovah’s witnesses in Cameroun, Fernando Poo, Rio Muni and Tchad. On the average, in Cameroun we had 706 more publishers taking part in field service than last year. This increase has meant forming nineteen new congregations and another circuit. To meet the challenge of educating all these new ones and teaching them the high standard of living contained in God’s Word the Bible, more qualified brothers must be trained to care for the flock of God. This has been done in a large measure by the special training received at the Kingdom Ministry School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Young children can be taught to act in harmony with what is right and to reject what is disapproved by Jehovah. A young sister of not quite eleven years was returning home from collecting firewood in the forest. Two young worldly boys met her on the path and began inviting her to indulge in immorality with them. She refused and even reproved them, citing Revelation 21:8, concerning everlasting destruction for those practicing such things. One boy took note that she was one of Jehovah’s witnesses and told his friend: &quot;Let us stop here, since we will not succeed with one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” The friend would not listen but tried to take the girl by force. The bundle of firewood on her head fell to the ground as they struggled. She managed to get ahold of the machete that she used to cut the wood and gave the young boy a severe blow with it. When they saw that she was ready to strike again, the two boys took to their heels and fled. Later, the matter became known in the town and the authorities applauded the girl’s courageous action. They ordered the parents of the wayward boys to go and apologize to the parents of the sister for their children’s bad conduct. As a result of this, the father of the young sister, who was not one of Jehovah’s witnesses but had for the previous eight years opposed his wife because of becoming a Witness, was so impressed by his daughter’s good conduct that he asked the brothers to conduct a personal Bible study with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses consider it very important to attend meetings regularly. This habit does not go unobserved by others. Recently, a riot occurred in a town between two tribal groups just after the brothers had entered the Kingdom Hall for their weekly service meeting. Soldiers were called to stop the fighting, in which several persons were killed. Two brothers were late in coming to the meeting and came upon the fighting in town. They returned to their homes, and one brother, fearing that the fighting might reach even to his house, stood at his door with a spear in his hand for protection. When the soldiers came upon him, they mistook him for one of those engaged in the fighting and arrested him. The other brother was kidnaped and killed by troublemakers. When the brothers heard that one of their brothers had been arrested, they went to try to have him released. However, they were told by the soldiers: “He is not one of Jehovah’s witnesses; all of Jehovah’s witnesses were at their meeting studying the Bible, but he was not there.” They refused to release him. When the fighting stopped, the soldiers rounded up all the men in town in order to determine who took part in the fighting. The wives of men killed in the fighting began to identify their killers as all the men were asked to pass in front of them. Whenever a Witness passed, the women said: “These men were at their Kingdom Hall studying their Bibles, they did not take part in the fighting.” After two or three such comments, the soldiers ordered all the Witnesses to go to their homes, while they continued to have all the townspeople stand in the hot sun during the searching. As a result of the rioting, the churches were closed for some time and no one except Jehovah’s witnesses was allowed to meet in groups. One military commander said: “If all churches were like Jehovah’s witnesses, these troubles would not have occurred.” He further said to the brothers: “Continue with your fine work to calm the minds of the people.” Truly, Jehovah’s protection has proved to be upon his associated people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Two more missionaries will be arriving in Cameroun within a few days. We have just received word that their visas have been approved. We are very grateful for this help and look forward to their early arrival. With the help of such publications as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Word Is a Lamp to My Foot,&quot;</span><span class="font11"> more newly interested persons will be helped to baptism with a fuller understanding of what dedication and baptism mean.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">There appears to be a greater degree of religious freedom on the island this year. There were no interferences or difficulties reported on the part of the local authorities. The brothers are taking advantage of every opportunity to expand the witness. Several workers from the plantations returned to Nigeria at the close of their work contracts, but this did not reduce the number of publishers. At least one more native islander has started publishing the good news. The work is getting more firmly rooted locally. The native population is very friendly and has a great respect for the Bible. Many have never seen one. Imagine their joy when one of Jehovah’s witnesses begins opening up to them numerous Biblical passages containing the only lasting hope of peace and security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A representative from the branch office visited Santa Isabel and two other nearby congregations in July. He writes: “What a warm welcome I enjoyed from the brothers and what joy we had in fellowship together for these few days! I have been able to preach freely and to give talks in the Kingdom Halls. The brothers need more literature and magazines to take care of the growing interest. Several brothers have expressed their desire to be baptized. The field is ready for harvesting.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">During the year several Nigerian brothers working in plantations on the mainland of what is called Spanish Guinea returned to their country. Up to the present time all the Witnesses are from other lands and do not stay very long because of their contract conditions. There are now only seven publishers left in Rio Muni and they are located in three different towns and villages. These remaining ones have done very well in keeping the preaching work going. One publisher was able to be a vacation pioneer in August and thoroughly enjoyed this privilege.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 150,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The zealous group of publishers in the congregation at Fort Lamy has remained strong in the service. Although few in number, they spend upward of twenty-four hours a month each in the work of malting disciples just as Jesus did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A great help to the congregation during the year was the arrival of two special pioneers from Cameroun. They were happily met at the airport by the brothers, and a few days later one brother took them to a store and purchased two bicycles to help them get around their vast territory. They have been able to start many Bible studies with the Christian population of Fort Lamy. Up to now all the preaching and witnessing has been confined to the largest city, Fort Lamy, which is the capital and which also has the greatest non-Moslem population. Arrangements are now being made to send pioneers into other cities of the interior to spread the good news there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The first circuit assembly held in the north of Cameroun was attended by five brothers and sisters from Fort Lamy. The attendance of around a hundred each day gave a wonderful opportunity for the brothers from Tchad to enjoy a rich portion of spiritual food and to have Christian fellowship with their brothers from other congregations. They were encouraged to greater faithfulness and perseverance in carrying out their dedication vows to Jehovah. Following the assembly a representative from the branch office in Douala visited the brothers in Fort Lamy for three days, giving talks, working with the brothers in the field service and making arrangements for further expansion of the work. The prospects for accomplishing this are very good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CANADA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 19,819,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 41,611 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 476</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the past service year an earnest endeavor has been made to help our brothers and sisters in Canada to build on a right foundation with fireresistant materials. Good results have been forthcoming, as many formerly inactive and irregular ones have been assisted to strengthen their association and service with God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses in Canada are very happy to have the new songbook </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Singing and Accompanying Yourselves with Music in Your Hearts”</span><span class="font11"> as well as the Society’s records for this music. Two sisters decided to take a copy of the new songbook to a music teacher who was on their magazine route, a woman with whom they had never had the opportunity to discuss the truth at any length, although she did take the magazines regularly. They showed the music teacher the new songbook; right then and there she played some of the songs and was impressed with their beauty and pleasantness. She surprised these sisters by saying: “Would you mind explaining these words to me? I don’t understand them.” The sisters knew that here at last was their opportunity to give a good witness. Immediately they took out their Bibles and began to explain the meaning of the words of the song. Since then a regular study is being conducted with the music teacher. How? Every Wednesday afternoon these two sisters go to the music teacher’s home, all three sit at the piano and sing one or two of the Kingdom songs, with the music teacher playing the piano, and then with the aid of the Bible the two sisters explain the meaning of the songs. The music teacher is making fine progress, and as one of the sisters comments: “We all learn—we learn how to sing the new songs —she learns the wonderful truths of Jehovah’s Word.” Yes, even the new songbook can be a means of teaching the truth to someone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> subscription campaign during the past service year was 35 percent better than the year before. Here is an experience that we heard from northern Ontario. A Bible study servant, upon encouragement by the circuit servant, went through all the discontinued Bible Study Record slips in his file to see if any could be revived to a regular study again and if subscriptions could be obtained from some of them. Where possible, he encouraged the publishers formerly conducting the study to make these calls, but he had quite a number that he had to call on himself. He prepared well in advance for each call with the individual circumstances in mind, had a positive attitude and determined to offer the double subscription. During the four-month campaign, the Bible study servant personally obtained eighty-one subscriptions by this means alone, simply calling on those who had studied in years gone by. He is now making regular calls on many of these persons and some are being assisted to study on a regular basis once again. Thus we should not overlook any opportunity and positively offer the two subscriptions to those who formerly studied with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many congregations have had good results from arranging a listing for Jehovah’s witnesses in their local telephone directory. An overseer reports that one day a man phoned his home and asked the question: “Do you study the Bible with people in their homes?” He had had some contact with the truth from his grandmother but had only recently come to realize the importance of seriously studying God’s Word. The overseer and his wife made arrangements to call the following evening and found the caller and his wife eagerly waiting. A study was started immediately, with good response on the part of the householder. The man of the house mentioned that his own parents were prejudiced, so the publisher fortified him with some scriptures concerning opposition. This was timely, because by the time of the next call his parents had already shown some opposition, but the newly interested couple stuck up for the truth. They are continuing to make encouraging progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CENTRAL, AFRICAN REPUBLIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,008 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,800,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,786</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To the question: “Who will go for us?”, Jehovah’s witnesses in the Central African Republic have answered: “Here I am! Send me.” Over a thousand different individuals have gone out to witness for Jehovah God and his Son Jesus Christ and have thus helped many others to hear the happy message of God’s kingdom. They have conducted over a thousand Bible studies in the homes of the people hungering for a knowledge of the Bible. There are many hearing ears in this land, and a tremendous work must yet be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For some time an illiterate sister tried to encourage her teen-age daughter to take an interest in the Bible, but her daughter always had some excuse: she was too busy preparing a meal; she was just on her way to the river to wash clothes, or she had to go to the market to buy food. Once when the girl made such an excuse, the mother wept and prayed to Jehovah that her daughter might open her eyes to the wonderful promises that God has made for a righteous new order. Suddenly the girl was not too busy anymore. When her mother called, she came and read the portions of the Bible requested. From that time on, the girl showed a real desire to learn more from the Bible and Bible publications. It was not long after this that she was helping others who at first were not interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Most of the villagers were in the fields, so the minister of Jehovah’s witnesses went there to talk about the Bible. A very religious man listened for a while and then grew so angry he almost struck the brother with his hoe. The brother left immediately to look for others having a hearing ear. At noon, when he was returning, he passed the garden of the man who had shown such hostility earlier in the day. There he was resting in the shade of a tree. The brother picked up the man’s hoe and worked the garden while the old man watched him for some time, neither of them saying a word. At last the man got up and worked along with the brother. When it was time to return to the village, the man asked why it was that man has to work so hard for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> living. The brother took out his </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book and showed him the picture of Adam in the garden of Eden. This led into a discussion of how this paradise was lost, and how now Jehovah will bring back paradise conditions to the earth. By the time they had reached the village, the man asked the brother to come to his hut to study the Bible regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CEYLON &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 11,875,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 276 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 43,025</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In view of the fact that we are in the “last days,” the past twelve months in Ceylon must be viewed as having been very tranquil, allowing for full participation in all features of our ministry, and meetings and assemblies have been held without any obstruction. This has resulted in a small increase in most aspects of our work but good progress toward maturity of the brothers and in improving congregation organization. The Kingdom Ministry School held in May did much in this regard, and the benefits of it will continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Much study is required to convince some that the worship of many gods is wrong and that the worship of the only true God is right. Several studies a week will speed this up, as this brother’s experience shows: “About two years ago I started a study with a lad on a nearby coconut estate who had been brought up in the Hindu faith. As he learned and accepted Bible truths he quit practicing many religious rituals. This brought disapproval and opposition from his parents, but he did not compromise. His enthusiasm grew as we studied two and even three times a week. He soon saw the need of preaching to others. To learn still faster he started coming with me to other homes where I have Bible studies. This meant a study almost every day and often traveling late at night on village roads. Progress was rapid and now he is a regular publisher, spending about forty hours a month in the Christian ministry as well as working faithfully at his job on the estate. At our recent Tamil circuit assembly he was immersed, and now he looks forward to the time when he can become a full-time preacher of the good news. Two months ago he was given a promotion on the estate, but others, jealous of him, brought many allegations against him. At the hearing the superintendent told the accusers: ‘This is an honest employee and his word is greater to me than that of ninety of your witnesses.’ He was exonerated and a fine witness has resulted to the praise of the true God, Jehovah, whom he now worships.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another brother writes: “Upon being invited to speak to ones studying to become priests at an Anglican divinity school I looked to Jehovah for wisdom and guidance and accepted. Having ‘Aims and Purposes of Jehovah’s Witnesses and Why They Differ’ as my subject, I prepared well and relied on Jehovah’s spirit. At the fixed time I was given the opportunity of speaking for two hours without interruption, while all, including the instructor and registrar, took notes. The next hour was spent answering their many questions, most of which took the form of reading a verse, such as Hebrews 1:8, that they look to for support for their teaching and asking for an explanation. Only because of the abundant instruction given in the aids to Bible study that we have, a diligent study of these and the holy spirit to aid the memory was I able to give fitting answers to these questions and to quick ones propounded by the registrar, such as, ‘How can you say that scripture is revealed progressively when the Scriptures say that everything that is to take place has already been established in heaven?’ and, ‘Would you say that Jesus has the power to forgive sins without recourse to Jehovah?’ Mealtime came, and my wife, two children and I were kindly invited to eat</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">with them. But the discussion kept right on, dealing with ‘holy communion,’ life everlasting on earth and ‘only 144,000 being saved.’ ‘Jehovah’s witnesses go only to “Christian” homes’ was a charge brought up that was disproved when a priest stated that he knows that they call on Buddhist homes and all others in his hometown. After another hour it was noticed that I had hardly started to eat, at which all had a good laugh and agreed to keep quiet for a time so I could eat. But when such opportunities to clarify the truth with the hope that some will have receptive minds present themselves, zeal to explain makes it hard to eat. It makes me think about how Paul must have felt while speaking on Mars Hill. Certainly he was prepared. Regular and diligent study over the years gives one a background knowledge to draw from when these occasions arise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another zealous publisher of the Kingdom writes: “Determination to present the offer at every opportunity is rewarding. During the month of special activity, April, I resolved to do this. To everyone I met, whether workmate, clients, businessmen, visitors, vendors, friends, relations, Bible students or persons met in the regular house-to-house work, I offered the subscription. I encouraged others to do the same. Another pioneer was helped to do this when following up some expiration slips. We had to go to other houses to inquire where the persons whose names we had on the slips lived. Each time we explained why we wanted to find these people and then offered the ones we inquired from the subscription. Four were obtained that way. I was happy to report 116 new subscriptions for April. Why not try offering subscriptions at every opportunity? It works!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CHILE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4,530 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,987</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">With so many wonderful things happening this year, time has really flown! Jehovah’s witnesses in Chile have felt the impact of the words recorded at Psalm 65:4, which reads: “Happy is the one you choose . . . He will certainly be satisfied with the goodness of your house.” Nowhere was this more manifest than in our never-to-be-forgotten “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly held in January, when 7,693 persons assembled ‘at Jehovah’s house’ for worship. The effect of the assembly on outsiders was reflected in what happened in the case of the previously opposed husband of one of the 441 persons baptized, as told by a missionary: “Her husband, a typical worldly man, is in the army. He refused to allow the children to go to the assembly, but he himself would go to see what it was all about. On the trip to the assembly in the chartered bus he was very stiff, hardly speaking. At the assembly he was fascinated by what he saw and heard, including the dramas, and was soon caught up by the spirit of the assembly. On the return trip he was a changed man, ‘like a wound-up victrola,’ and was full of questions. The following week, for the first time, he gave his ready permission for his daughter to share in field service. And the next assembly? ‘That is the last time the children stay at home,’ he said. ‘The next time we all go.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Even individual magazines play a big part in spreading the message of life, as shown by the following experience of a young publisher. For several years prior to learning the truth she had visited different religions looking for the answers to her questions on “hell” and the condition of the dead. The answers were always the same. One day in a store she picked up a sheet of paper torn from a magazine, and there she found her answer. She asked the storekeeper where he got it. It was the article “Your Word Is Truth” from an old </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazine, and he advised her that one of Jehovah’s witnesses brought him the magazine regularly. “The next time he calls, ask him to call at my house,” was her answer. The visit was made soon afterward and a study started immediately, not only with the young lady but also with other members of her family and neighbors, for she was already talking about what she learned from that first sheet of paper. Now, sometime later, she is a special pioneer, and five members of the family are Kingdom publishers. Certainly Jehovah’s ‘Word is truth’ and it is powerful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s Word is powerful enough even to free some of the principal ones of Babylon’s flock. A leader in a Pentecostal group was loaned a copy of the Society’s </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines</span><span class="font11"> booklet, and for the first time he began to learn that many things he was teaching were not according to the Bible. Later on, when a Witness visited his home, he obtained the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font11">book and some booklets. At his next meeting in church he started to teach what he had learned from his private Bible study about “hell.” The result was that he was thrown out of the church. So he began to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall as well as to study regularly with the Kingdom publisher. Soon he was telling his friends and neighbors, including his successor in the Pentecostal church, what he was learning. The latter, too, is beginning to see the need to “get out of her” if he wants to ‘be satisfied with the goodness of Jehovah’s house.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One can share in this goodness even when isolated from the local congregation if a sincere effort is made to do so. A new publisher found this to be true when he was assigned by his company to work in an isolated part in the northern </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">pampa</span><span class="font11"> or desert. At first he felt distressed when meeting nights came around and he was unable to attend. Then one night he sat down with his books and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> and started to prepare each part of the meeting by himself, with talks and demonstrations. Little by little he found that he was growing in knowledge and ability even though isolated. He ordered thirty magazines a month to be sent to him; then he started to work on Sunday mornings from room to room among his fellow workers, placing much literature. A magazine route was started, then a regular Bible study, and reports were sent regularly to his congregation. What a joy it was to see him stand at the last circuit assembly to indicate his desire to symbolize his dedication to Jehovah! When the circuit servant visits his congregation, he asks for special permission to leave the camp so that he can better equip himself as a minister by taking part in the special ministerial activity arranged during the visit. Certainly he testifies, “Happy is the one you choose, . . . He will certainly be satisfied with the goodness of your house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This report would be incomplete without expressing the appreciation of the brothers in Chile for the wonderful provision of the Spanish edition of the New World Translation of the whole Bible, which arrived at the end of the year. As one overseer wrote: “Thanks to Jehovah and his organization for this marvelous aid. What a joy it is to be able to use the new Bible with its excellent concordance and appendix of texts and information on the Bible books!” We have never seen any release received with such heartfelt appreciation. Certainly it is the crowning touch of Jehovah’s goodness to us all!</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Truly 1967 has been an interesting and exciting year in Colombia. For the first time more than one million hours were spent in the preaching work in one year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A publisher writes: “Dear Brothers: This is just to tell you about an experience Jimmy had. He was playing on the balcony out front while a man was cleaning the front yard of the house next door. Jimmy started telling him how he was going to take cows, dogs, cats and lambs into the new system of things, all except goats, because goats could not get in. The man asked him if he could be taken there. Jimmy said he could not get in either if he was not one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Then he ran into the house to get a couple of magazines to show to the man. He explained that they discussed the Bible and were 75 centavos each. The man apparently gave the magazines to his son, because the young man came the following day to ask for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font11"> book, which he saw mentioned in the magazines. That same evening he came for his first Bible study. During the brief study in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font11"> booklet he said that at the university a group of students had asked a priest how Mary could possibly be the mother of God, since He is without beginning and without end. They also asked him about Mary’s other children that the Bible mentions. Naturally the priest was unable to give them satisfactory answers. Apparently the young man was waiting and searching for the truth when Jimmy placed the magazines with his father. The day after his first study he came back to get the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font11"> and promised to study hard for the second study in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font11"> booklet. We are waiting to see the progress of this interested man found by a four-year-old boy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A brother writes: “At our congregation book study we have thirty attending each week and there are always new persons, so I followed through on the idea that our book study servant leaves each week with those attending, that there is an opportunity for each person to have a Bible study in his home if he so desires. Three men attended twice, so I arranged for a study with them. One of them said emphatically that he was Roman Catholic and intended to stay one, but still he wanted to study the Bible. After two weeks one of the men wanted to have his whole family study, and on the first study four of his sons in their twenties sat in, besides some of the girls. They asked many questions. Arrangements were made to answer more of their questions the following week. Now, after almost two months, the three men have not missed a Tuesday night meeting, and six are regularly attending the public talk and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study, preparing beforehand so they can take part. Although there has been some opposition from their families, three have begun to withdraw from Babylon the Great and there are at least ten persons studying the lifegiving waters of truth, all because of the Witnesses’ being friendly with interested persons at the congregation book study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGO REPUBLIC (Brazzaville)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,190 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;860,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 723</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The branch office in Brazzaville in the Congo Republic has been looking after the work of the Congo and also Gabon. It is interesting to note that the Congo Republic had a 9-percent increase in publishers and Gabon a 14-percent increase. There are six graduates of Gilead working in each of these countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The third class of the Kingdom Ministry School wrote to the Branch expressing their appreciation for the arrangement made by Jehovah through his earthly organization for the excellent theocratic schooling. It has been a real asset in aiding the brothers here to grow to maturity and has contributed to the 9-percent increase for the’ past service year in the Congo. Another contributing factor to the progress here is the fine pioneer spirit being cultivated more and more in the hearts of our brothers. Also the circuit servants have done excellent work during the service year in aiding inactive and irregular publishers to recover their spirituality and to appreciate once again their privilege of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Frequently, in this part of the world sisters, after giving birth to a baby, take one, two or sometimes three months to recuperate before attending congregation meetings and sharing in Kingdom service again. The following experience will certainly prove to us that a rest from theocratic service is not absolutely necessary. A sister was able to vacation pioneer during the month she gave birth to her sixth child. She related: “I am a mother of five children. April 1st I began to vacation pioneer. April 7th I gave birth to our sixth child. Simultaneously, I took sick. While I was in bed, brothers asked me if I would be able to fulfill my promise. My answer was always in the affirmative. I explained to them that Jehovah would surely grant me a measure of his holy spirit so that I might reach my desired goal. On regaining normal health I made up a program. My seven-year-old girl was able to help me with the baby. While she was in school from 7 a.m. to 12 noon, I did all my housework and cared for my newborn baby as well as the other children. In the afternoon while my daughter was home from school I went out in field service. Thanks to Jehovah in aiding me to have the strength, I succeeded in attaining 110 hours in the ministry during that month.” This experience has been a stimulus to other Congolese sisters giving birth to a child to be regular publishers and to attend meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One Sunday a Protestant pastor made this observation in his sermon to his church members: “You Protestant Christians, you are Christians in name only. You do not observe God’s commandments that the pastor teaches you. The church warns against fetishism and sorcery as a means of healing yourselves, but still you practice these things. In my opinion, God has abandoned us and does not answer our prayers. In fact, he is turning toward Jehovah’s witnesses. They are faithful to the divine precepts, even at the cost of their lives. I would like to relate to you the proof: A witness of Jehovah brought his gravely ill son to the hospital. The doctor told him: ‘This child is ill due to lack of blood. We must give him a blood transfusion.’ The Witness replied: ‘It is wrong for us to accept this form of treatment as it is contrary to God’s law.’ The doctor dismissed the Witness without providing any other medical treatment for the suffering child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Several days later, to my surprise, I saw the Witness with his son, now with regained health, preaching the Word of God from house to house in a section of the city. I truly believe God is turning his attention toward Jehovah’s witnesses.” This experience makes us think of Malachi’s prophecy that says: “You people will again certainly see the distinction . . . between one serving God and one who has not served him.”—Mal. 3:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One circuit servant told us how he was successful in aiding two inactive publishers to become regular praisers of Jehovah. Formerly all four members of this family were active publishers, but at the time of the visit two of them had drifted off into inactivity, the mother and one daughter. The mother gave the excuse that she was often sick and none of the brothers or sisters in the congregation came to help her or even to visit her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Quoting Mark 10:29, 30, the circuit servant replied: “It is true that Jehovah has promised to give us brothers and sisters, but an even greater reward he promised us is to use us in his service, with everlasting life in the ‘new system of things’ in view.” Further the brother cited James 1:2, 3: “Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you meet with various trials, knowing as you do that this tested quality of your faith works out endurance.” “Even the thoughtlessness of others could be a test by which Satan is trying to insult Jehovah’s name by causing us to stumble,” added the brother. Upon his encouraging her to share once again in Jehovah’s service, she replied: “I have often considered it and I would like to, but I feel incapable now to start witnessing.” He read Revelation 2:4, 5 to her: “I hold this against you, that you have left the love you had at first . . . repent and do the former deeds.” She answered: “That’s true, brother, I must make an effort to recover myself. I am surely not the only one to have fallen into inactivity, as the Bible foretold it.” She accepted an invitation to share in the field ministry with the circuit servant during his visit, arranging&quot; her affairs to go out twice with him during the week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When the circuit servant returned to the congregation four months later, this family invited him to eat with them. What a joyous occasion it was for the brother to observe this family’s theocratic service and progress! The mother exclaimed: “To think that I once contemplated withdrawing from Jehovah’s blessings without a real motive.” The family experienced further joy when one of the daughters was immersed at the last circuit assembly. Now all members continue zealously to sing Jehovah’s praises and keep their place in the Lord’s flock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF GABON Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;600,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">It is important to give aid to interested ones who are isolated from the congregation, as the following report from a missionary shows: “A schoolteacher who had heard of the truth and privately studied the publications traveled some five hundred miles over jungle roads to reach the capital. He had heard that missionaries for Jehovah’s witnesses had arrived and he wanted to talk to them. He met us at the Kingdom Hall and asked for a Bible study. Since he would be with us only during his vacation, we arranged to spend some time with him every day. He quit smoking cigarettes right away and asked how he should go about preaching. We demonstrated the three- to eightminute sermons and explained that it was not necessary to tell everything on the first call. Soon his vacation ended and he left to teach school in a town far away. He continued corresponding by letter and preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Soon a real test came to this new sheeplike one. He was told by his school supervisor to quit preaching this new religion or he would be sent farther into the jungle to a village school where food is scarce. He wrote immediately asking what he should do. We answered him, explaining such texts as Matthew 24: 9, Acts 5:28, 29, and Luke 12:8. Despite the threats, he continued preaching and was sent off to the little village. There he continued preaching and has had many blessings because of it. He has a Bible study at present with a group of his school students. Recently another brother moved to this same locality, making it possible to have an isolated group arrangement. When the circuit servant visited the isolated group, this interested one was baptized and he has undertaken vacation pioneer service during his school vacation.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The Congo is a vast territory without the convenient transportation that is available in many countries. This has created some problems in organizing the work in the interior of the country, but in spite of these difficulties the preaching work is being done here too in fulfillment of Jesus’ words in Matthew 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Among the highlights of the 1967 service year were the two district assemblies, the first to be held in this country. These were a source of great joy to the brothers and gave a fine witness to those on the outside, and especially to many in responsible positions, enabling them to see the difference between God’s servants and those worshiping in Babylon’s false religions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Since legal recognition about one and a half years ago, the work has gone on freely and the authorities are very favorable toward the peaceful work of Jehovah’s witnesses, consisting of preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. Only in the case of false accusations from opposers or mistaken identity were any brothers arrested, and when it was established that they were Jehovah’s witnesses and that ours is a peaceful work, they were immediately released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the latter part of the service year troubles in some parts of the country made it very difficult for the brothers to attend the circuit assemblies and for the district and circuit servants to be present, but in most cases we were able to hold the assemblies. Even though it was not possible for some of the brothers to use public transportation, many of them walked as much as two hundred miles and even more in order to be able to partake of the spiritual food presented at the assemblies. Especially appreciated by the brothers was the showing of the Society’s film “God Cannot Lie.” In Kinshasa, the capital, a total of over 7,000 attended the showing of the film at two circuit assemblies, and here, for the first time, many thousands of interested persons saw the peace existing among Jehovah’s servants as they were assembled together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The station master in one area attended the district assembly. He heard the thanks that were expressed in the remarks by the branch servant to the railway for what they had done for our brothers coming to the assembly. This impressed him very much. The next day when the brothers were returning to their homes the station master let any of Jehovah’s witnesses wearing an assembly badge pass without being searched, because he said they were good people. He even supplied an extra coach for Jehovah’s witnesses. At the time of the same assembly many people in the area said that Jehovah’s witnesses are the only true congregation in the world. They noticed that meals at the assembly were being served at a very reasonable price and that we were not interested in making a lot of money. They remarked on the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses do not steal from their brothers. In the many years that these people had been in their church, they had not heard the things they heard at the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. They say these people really know the Bible and that is why their church does not want them to listen to Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One special pioneer wrote to the Society to explain why he had not reached the objective in hours for two months. One month he spent eight days walking to join some other brothers going to the circuit assembly. After that, all walked to the assembly and back, a total distance of 315 miles! The special pioneer had spent 180 hours to get to the assembly and back to his territory. The brothers here really appreciate the assemblies and go to great extents to be able to attend.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">“Supply to your faith endurance” was the theme of all the traveling representatives as well as the local overseers in Costa Rica during the past service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In this Catholic-dominated country, there are many opposers. Should we continue to preach even to opposers? This was the question in the minds of many publishers. Would you accept an invitation to visit and preach to a person who comes from a prominent family, some of whom are priests, some nuns and others very active members in the Catholic church? Would you do so if you knew that the person who invited you to visit him had at one time beaten up a brother for witnessing to him? A circuit servant accepted this invitation and later wrote: “After discussing many things, but mainly Jehovah’s organization today, the man said: ‘You are always welcome. You, Jehovah’s servants, bring his spirit to my house.’ During my visit that week he attended all the meetings and, when he heard me mention appointments for my future visit, he approached me and said: ‘Please put me down to work with you in the ministry.’ I suggested that he work with the special pioneer in the meantime, which he did, and when I visited the congregation four months later I found him to be a regular meeting attender and a publisher. He kept his appointment with me. What a joy it was for me to see him symbolize his dedication at a recent circuit assembly, less than one year after I first called on him!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A sister combined patience, tact and strategy in order to win over her opposed husband to the truth. Every day she left an open Bible on the bed with a scripture underlined, and as her husband changed clothes after work his curiosity would not allow him to leave the room without first reading the text. With a scripture a day, a long sermon was given about the blessings of God’s kingdom and the New Order. With all the blessings outlined, the sister proceeded to underline texts that showed what awaited the wicked and even those who ignored God’s Word. The husband could not resist any longer, so he asked for a study. He progressed rapidly and soon symbolized his dedication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CUBA</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The brothers in Cuba have had reason to remember the words of the apostle Paul at 1 Corinthians 4:12: “When being persecuted, we bear up.” This past year has brought continued opposition to the preaching of the good news in Cuba and yet the brothers continue to be of good courage and bear up under it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Efforts have been made through legal channels to defend the good news, with some results, but new attacks on the brothers and on their ministry are constantly being made. One report received from the brothers in Cuba tells that on the day of the Memorial of Jesus’ death </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> mob attacked one of the Kingdom Halls that was still open, throwing bricks, stones and pieces of iron to try to get the brothers to leave. Everyone stood his ground, however, and finally more than two hundred went to the police station, waiting until one o’clock in the morning for the police to consider the case and accuse their assailants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One report given by a Cuban refugee to a government subcommittee in Washington, D.C., gave an eyewitness account about a hundred and fifty of Jehovah’s witnesses imprisoned in a camp called Mangas Largas (Long Sleeves) in Camaguey Province. The New Haven </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Register</span><span class="font11"> reported: “The camp gained its name from the mosquitoes in the area. ‘They were so bad, long-sleeved shirts were required to be worn at all times, but Castro let the members of the religious sect live there half-naked. By the time I got there, the prisoners had been there for two months and were being eaten alive. Their skins were red and puffy and all of them had wounds that had become infected. Their only food was sugar stalks and a little water. . . . Their crime? They preached the Bible. ... As I left, I saw the Jehovah’s Witnesses huddled together, praying, and I cried.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Despite all this opposition, the brothers arranged to present much of the information from the previous district assembly program, including several of the dramas, to small groups of Jehovah’s witnesses. Imagine the look on the faces of the friends as the brothers, prepared to put on the program, came unannounced to the meeting place! Every eye was wet as they saw the modern application of Bible events. These demonstrations were given at various Kingdom Halls during December and the first part of January. As the brothers said: “Surely the angels were protecting us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">So the brothers continue to bear up under much opposition to the Kingdom work in Cuba. And while the opposition makes it appear to be an “unfavorable season,” still hundreds have come to a knowledge of the truth and have been baptized, and many find it possible to share in some feature of the full-time ministry as Jehovah keeps the door open for the preaching of the good news in this island territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CYPRUS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;610,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 479 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,273</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">An all-out effort in April saw 479 publishers reporting service, which was our 20-percent increase for the service year. We had a setback as regards magazine distribution because of the closing of the printing plant in Greece, but now we are receiving </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> from Brooklyn. I take this opportunity to thank the brothers at Brooklyn for the loving care they showed us in this regard and for all the help the brothers have given us during this past service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are mainly three things that make the work rather difficult here. First is the grip that Babylon the Great still has on the people. The average Cypriot believes he is right on matters of religion, though he himself may admit that he knows nothing about the Bible. Then there is the extreme fear of man because of the smallness of the place. Each one knows the other, and they consider it a great humiliation to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses because the priests and the teachers at schools are preaching against us. Finally, Cypriots are well off materially; the ratio of car owners is one to every seven persons living on the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I am glad to send some experiences that our brothers had. “Quite often the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> magazine has showed that the work is directed by the angels of Jehovah, and we believe that is what happened last Sunday,” wrote a sister to the office. “We planned to go to one village for witnessing, but the driver lost his way and we found ourselves outside another village. Since we had not worked that village for a long time, we decided to give the witness. We found some good people to talk to, among them a lost ‘sheep.’ When I started to talk to him,” the sister continued, “he showed obvious signs of emotion. He asked us if we were Jehovah’s witnesses, and when we answered in the affirmative, he said to us that some years ago he was associated with a congregation and even joined the brothers in the magazine work, but owing to pressure from his family he had to leave the city where he was living and eventually he was lost in this system of things. We immediately arranged for a Bible study, and we travel from Nicosia to his village every Friday night to conduct it. He seems very happy and is determined this time to continue. During Brother Franz’ talk he was present with his wife and small children.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many false accusations are heaped against the witnesses of Jehovah in Cyprus, but deep down in their hearts many people realize that we are the only ones who know the Bible and can answer difficult questions that puzzle the people. Another sister writes: “As I was walking in the street the other day, a lady who was unknown to me started calling me. When I approached, she said to me: ‘I know that you are one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and I want to ask you a question, as I know that you Jehovah’s witnesses know the Holy Bible better than a lot of people. Tell me, please, how can I believe that God is a God of love when he brings so much sorrow to families? I was waiting for years for my uncle to come from America, and when he was ready to come he died. Why did God allow this thing to happen?’ She started to cry. I explained to her briefly who is responsible for death, and because I could not carry on the conversation in the street I tactfully got her address. I went to her house soon after that, placed the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie’</span><span class="font11"> and started a home Bible study. After a few studies her mother died, but because of the hope she now has in life, she looks forward to these Bible studies we have together.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">DAHOMEY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,050,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,425 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,439</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One of the outstanding events of the year for Jehovah’s witnesses was having their preaching work recognized by the government. This means that they may freely preach in all parts of the country and receive all their Bible literature free of duty. In May of 1965 application was made to the government for recognition. The application had to be approved by a number of departments including the Ministry of Education. Everyone then waited and wondered; would all these departments give their approval? Finally, after almost six months and a number of interviews, the answer was given. The present government was satisfied that our work was beneficial to the people, so there was no objection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">While the work of preaching is a pleasant work here, the brothers have many difficulties to overcome. Most of the people carry on their native fetish rites even though they belong to one of the Protestant churches or to the Catholic religion. The priest of the fetish religion is called a “Vodunno,” and he has much influence over the people of his village. He claims to be able to cast spells, even causing people to die. Many people are afraid to leave this religion even if they wish to. While they may also join a church and continue to practice their fetish religion, they know they must quit when they become Jehovah’s witnesses. So Jehovah’s witnesses are opposed by both, and they often work together to prevent one of their members from seeking the truth. Then, too, whole families of several generations live together in one compound, and it is not easy to break away from this influence. Yet with Jehovah’s help these difficulties can and are being overcome, as evidenced by one young woman who writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“I was fifteen years of age when a Witness first began to study with me. My father was both head of our compound and also the chief of the fetish religion of the town. He was also a Catholic. When I became interested in the truth, my father thought to stop me by sending me out of the compound. He reasoned, she will have no place to live or anything to eat, so she will quickly give up this religion. Instead, the brothers took me in, so I was able to study with them even more. When my father saw I was not left alone, he came and got me and took me to the Catholic priest in order to persuade me that the Witnesses were false teachers. The priest kept me imprisoned in his home for three weeks, talking to me every day, telling me I should not leave my father’s religion. After three weeks he asked me why I was determined to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. I told him that I wanted to know the Bible, which he had forbidden us to read. He then gave up and sent me back to my father, where for the next three years I was kept under constant watch. Now I am nineteen years of age and I have just become a pioneer. One year ago I was able to leave my father’s compound and so was able to dedicate my life to Jehovah, aiding others to get out of Babylon the Great.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Keeping Bible principles brings many joys, along with Jehovah’s blessing. The government has made provision for legalizing marriages, and they have been encouraging all to do so. To comply means to spend much time, as the birth date has to be established. Also, it costs money, so the people, for the most part, have not cared to take advantage of this provision. On the other hand, Jehovah’s witnesses follow the Bible and they view marriage as a serious matter. A few months ago one congregation, located in the middle of the great marshland where all houses are built high upon stilts out of the water, decided to get all their marriages registered at the same time. The overseer thought it would be less expensive to have the government official come to the town rather than have the twenty-five couples in the congregation travel to the city. Seeing there were so many, the official agreed. While arrangements were being made, the news spread through the town and the whole area. Many people of other religions came to the overseer to ask for his help, as their churches had taken no interest in legalizing marriages. When the day came for the official to arrive, instead of twenty-five couples, there were sixty on hand to have their marriages legalized. During this period of about four months, the congregation increased from sixty-nine to ninety publishers. It is evident that many appreciate Bible principles when they hear them, and it is becoming clear who are following them today.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses in Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland continued through another year to give the witness as commanded by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 24:14, and the results they have had give evidence of Jehovah’s blessing and direction. Denmark oversees the activity of these three countries, and the branch servant has set out some interesting points for our information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In contrast to the growing lack of faith and the materialism among the people in general, the Witnesses have demonstrated strong faith and zeal, willingly saying as did Isaiah: “Here I am! Send me.” This attitude was clearly expressed by the 765 who applied for vacation pioneer service during April, nearly seven percent of the total number of publishers and more than three times as many as our previous peak of 241 vacation pioneers. Without doubt the great upsurge in activity in the spring was largely contributed to by enthusiasm over the fine special </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> answering the question outstanding in the minds of all: “Why does God permit wickedness?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Every single tract can have its effect. A publisher placed a couple of magazines, but on the following visit there was no interest in taking additional magazines. However, the man did accept the small tract </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Hope for the Dead.</span><span class="font11"> “You can understand my surprise,” stated the publisher, “when on the following visit I was invited inside.” An arrangement was made for an additional visit, and soon a study was started. However, as the man lived in a strongly religious area, there soon came a lot of pressure from his friends with the Home Mission, and so the study was discontinued. The publisher wrote: “I realized much later that I had not begun soon enough to strengthen the family against opposition.” There was still some interest in the truth there, though, and later when two sisters worked the area as vacation pioneers they were invited in and had a long discussion, and a request was extended to have the previous publisher come again. The study was restarted, but now they were equipped to withstand opposition. When the priest visited them he was given much literature to take home and told to come again and point out any errors that he had found. Apart from when he returned the literature, they never saw him again. Instead, this couple experienced the truth of Matthew 19:29 as they gained many new friends in place of those who abandoned them. In a later letter they wrote: “We are grateful for Jehovah’s witnesses and the wonderful conventions we have been to . . . We hope and pray to Jehovah God in the name of Jesus to strengthen and preserve his true congregation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are many joys experienced in connection with helping to activity again those who have become inactive. A young publisher left the truth at the age of seventeen to seek what the world had to offer. When his sister got married, she and her husband, both of whom are pioneer ministers, tried to help him come back to the truth. Since he was out at sea and personal contact was not possible, they tried by letter. They emphasized especially that there was only a short time left and how important it is to seek the truth. Many scriptures showing the importance of trusting in Jehovah and not in one’s own understanding were quoted. The inactive brother read the letter again and again. He prayed to Jehovah for help and immediately sought contact with the nearest publishers in Iceland, who helped him greatly. He has now returned home to Denmark; a regular study is held with him, and he has attended many meetings—all this after five years. So even though personal contact is not always possible or convenient, remember, a letter is almost always possible and can do much good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">FAROE ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37,122</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A local Faroese sister sometime ago gave her fleshly brother a copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.”</span><span class="font11"> Being a fisherman, he took the book along on a trip and read in it at every opportunity. What resulted? Later when he was defending Jehovah’s witnesses in a discussion with other Faroese, this man proved to be, as one expressed it, ‘a living </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.”’</span><span class="font11"> His wife continued to oppose the truth, but after they attended a little assembly and after a few more back-calls she agreed to having </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> study conducted with both of them. Soon the man was to leave again on a fishing trip, and while the special pioneers were present he said to her: “Will you promise me in their presence that you will study the Bible with them each Monday?” She smiled and answered: “Yes.” “Thanks,” he replied. “It will make me very happy, and I will think of all of you with thankfulness when I am out at sea.” He took the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font11"> along with him and studied it thoroughly. Now he and his family are making good progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Though fear of man is often a hindrance in such rugged territory where people are so dependent upon one another, yet the special pioneers on one of the islands are glad to note that by their staying with one of their Bible students three days whenever they come to the isolated area, this fear has been broken down. They have five Bible studies and the hospitable family they stay with is growing both in understanding and in freeness of speech in defending the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">GREENLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39,615</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The language, the difficult problem of housing and the isolation that the work on Greenland presents make it difficult for publishers to continue in the territory without letup. This explains the swinging up and down in number of publishers, as some leave to spend some time in Denmark while others return to take up the work again, having gotten renewed spiritual strength through association with some of the larger congregations in Denmark. Since the population is spread along the coastline of an island of 2,176,000 square kilometers, with an area of about 341,700 square kilometers free of ice, it can be seen that much preaching must be carried on by correspondence, if all are to be reached with the message. That many persons are now moving in from the outpost villages to the larger villages and towns has helped some. The publishing in Greenlandic of the booklet </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Living in Hope of a Righteous New World</span><span class="font11"> was also a help to the publishers who now live in four different areas, two of which have small congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The new booklet aroused interest in a special way. A young Greenlandic girl who had been sent the booklet was so impressed that she decided to talk to her father about the fine Christian counsel on conduct that it contained. As she wrote the special pioneers: “I have begun to think just like you do.” The booklet also helped a father who realized that his conduct was not a good example for his children to begin to put away the old personality and walk in a right way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The evidence of Jehovah’s blessing on the brothers’ efforts manifests itself in the theocratic progress made in the country during the past service year. Truly, the interested persons have applied to themselves Galatians 6:6 and are sharing “in all good things with the one who gives such oral teaching.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The following shows the need to be adaptable in our house-to-house witnessing. A sister relates: “Visiting from house to house, I called on a lady who questioned me: ‘Are you going to talk to me about God?’ When I answered that I was, she quickly replied: ‘Oh, no! If you were from the Devil I would listen to you.’ To this I said: 'If that is what you desire, very well, I can speak to you about the Devil.’ With this she invited me in, and I showed her from the Bible when and how Satan came into existence. The last text I cited was 2 Corinthians 4:4 in order to prove that Satan is responsible for all the confusion on the earth. On offering her the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lief</span><span class="font11"> I turned to chapter six on how the demons came into existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The lady readily took the book and apologized for her attitude, which had been due to being molested by the children. On this initial call a study was started and she is progressing well in her study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At an assembly a missionary sister gave an experience that certainly encourages the full-time missionary work rather than full-time secular work. She stated: “My husband and I have completed thirty years in the pioneer work. We were very young when we started and had very few material goods. But we did have full confidence that Jehovah would provide the necessities of life, and now after thirty years I can say that never have we lacked for anything and we are enjoying many blessings from Jehovah. We were invited to Gilead in 1943, and in 1945 we commenced the missionary work in Cuba. We have served in Cuba, Puerto Rico and here for a total of twenty-two years as missionaries. We passed through bans on the work and were even deported from this country, but Jehovah has never failed us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&quot;During the time I have been a pioneer I have had the pleasure of seeing thirty-one persons with whom I studied make their dedication to Jehovah and symbolize it by water baptism. For me this represents more riches than the material goods we could have accumulated in these thirty years. Also, the pioneer work has helped me to maintain integrity to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It has isolated me from the world, because nearly all my associates are brothers and sisters. Also, there are not as many temptations as there are when one is working in the world. Certainly the pioneer work brings rich blessings and I would not change it for any other work in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A brother reveals how overcoming objections produces peaceable fruits. He relates: “One Saturday while working with the magazines we approached a military camp and presented the magazines to the guards. Some took the magazines, but one viewed them with suspicion and asked me: ‘Why were you persecuted by Trujillo’s government?’ I answered: ‘For being Witnesses.’ He objected: ‘No, this cannot be. I understand you were persecuted because you refused military service.’ Then I asked him: ‘Are women and old people required to do military service?’, to which he admitted they were not. This was the proof that we were persecuted for being Witnesses instead of the military issue, because many women and older brothers were imprisoned, including my wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“It was then that one of the group asked what one had to do to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. They were told that first they must study the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses and that I was ready to help them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">It has been possible for Jehovah’s witnesses to carry on their ministry, “leading a calm and quiet life with full godly devotion and seriousness.” (1 Tim. 2:2) As a result much has been done in sowing the seeds of righteousness, especially in territories where little or nothing had been done in times past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The first few months of the service year were busily spent preparing for the “God’s Sons of Liberty” assembly, without a doubt the most outstanding milestone in Ecuador’s theocratic history. What a thrill it was to have with us six of the Society’s directors and a group of visitors from other lands equal in number to one-quarter of all of Jehovah’s witnesses in Ecuador.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A factor that has given impetus to the work this year has been the arrival of a number of new missionaries. One small group was sent to a city that has for years been reckoned as a Catholic stronghold. But the missionaries found that the recent reforms instituted by the Roman Hierarchy had caused a change of atmosphere and awakened deep curiosity in the Bible. Typical of the reaction they found right from the beginning was that of a woman who was an evolutionist and a Catholic at the same time. She put up a strong argument in favor of evolution on the first visit, but immediately thereafter she went downtown and bought a Bible. The missionaries did not know of this until later, but on the next call they were met with the question: “Well, how are you going to help me understand this Bible and at what time can you arrange to come here?” She had learned all about our arrangement for Bible studies from her sister with whom a study had been started a short time earlier. The work of the missionaries in this city began in February. By March, forty-three persons attended a talk given by the circuit servant. At the end of April the brother in charge of the group reported that they were having to buy more chairs every two weeks. In June three of the new ones began to share to some extent in the witness work, and the end of the service year saw ten Kingdom publishers reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Not all isolated groups have the advantage of receiving help from Gilead-trained missionaries, but they do have Jehovah’s spirit to fire them with zeal. A circuit servant reports on the commendable example of one of these groups that shows deep appreciation for meetings. One newly baptized brother living in the heart of the “banana belt” of Ecuador began his work appropriately by teaching the truth to his father and three brothers, all living in the same area but separated by considerable distances. Soon they and other acquaintances they contacted began to appreciate the necessity of getting together for Bible study. The most central location was the home of the brother’s father, but even this meant that most of the group had to walk for one or two hours through snake-infested trails. At first only a book study was conducted, but later the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study and Theocratic Ministry School were added, all three meetings being held on the same day. On the circuit servant’s most recent visit, after a two-hour ride on horseback to the center of the territory, he found a new building under construction. Its purpose? Why, a Kingdom Hall, of course! The publishers, now four in number, and the interested persons had each contributed materials and labor so as to have a suitable place to meet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another territory opened up this year lies six hundred miles off the mainland out in the Pacific—the Galapagos islands. Three publishers have made a home on the island of Santa Cruz and are doing what they can to care for the interested persons there, in spite of transportation difficulties. During the year two special pioneers worked for six weeks on the two most heavily populated of the islands. It was on a visit to these islands that Charles Darwin conceived much of the information for his book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Origin of Species,</span><span class="font11"> and in 1959, the hundredth anniversary of the publication of this book, UNESCO established a scientific institution on the islands in Darwin’s name. It is a center of investigation visited regularly by scientists from all over the world. But few are the people who live on the islands who find anything to make them think as Darwin did. On the third day after the arrival of the pioneers a woman enthusiastically called and asked them to visit her home as soon as possible, as her husband wanted to speak with them. They found a man of Belgian nationality who had come to the islands to work with the Darwin Investigation Station, but he told them that the more he examined the insects and animals the more he was convinced, not of evolution, but of creation. He had read an article in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> on “Why Did God Create Man?” and found the reasoning perfectly satisfying. A Bible study was started immediately, and when he learned that the pioneers were to be on the island for only three weeks he canceled all other engagements, telling his friends that he would not be able to see them until Jehovah’s witnesses left. In this way he was free to study every evening. He was anxious to understand, among other things, the meaning of the “king of the north” and the “king of the south&quot; in the book of Daniel. After studying this in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Your Will Be Done on Earth,”</span><span class="font11"> he exclaimed: “How wonderful! What other organization on earth has been able to explain these things? This is the truth!&quot; When the pioneers were ready to leave, he wanted to know whether the Society might accept him as a student at Gilead if he could sell his house, his boat and other possessions. He also wrote a letter to the Society’s office in Brooklyn expressing his appreciation for the help received from the pioneers and inquiring as to the possibility for him and his wife to attend Gilead someday. The requirements have been explained to him and he is now, in his own words written later to the pioneers, 'impatient to sell his things so as to leave the islands and dedicate himself completely to serving Jehovah.’ But even on the islands themselves there is much to be done in helping others, for, since the return of the pioneers, a number of publishers on the mainland are conducting Bible studies with upward of fifteen islanders by correspondence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">EL SALVADOR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 8,094,481</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,048 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,953</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The highlight of the year was, of course, our international assembly, “God’s Sons of Liberty,” which permitted us to have with us the Society’s president as well as several of the board of directors, who were able to impart much encouragement. Many delegates from different parts of the world were also present and were moved to think seriously about moving where the need is greater. This fact was born out by the many letters received by the branch office asking for information on making such a move. At present one family has already made the move and several more will be arriving shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A circuit servant sends in this experience showing the need to be ready for unexpected opportunities to give a witness: “One of the leading radio stations in the country began a contest about two months before the Christmas holiday, asking the question: ‘What year, month, day and hour was Jesus born?’ To the shock of the directors of the radio station, a flood of letters was sent in giving a variety of answers. They had expected the answer to be December 25 at 12 midnight in the year 1 C.E. So the station directors, not knowing the answer themselves, decided to ask the prominent leaders of the Protestant and Catholic clergy to give a more reliable answer, but most of them either refused or gave a very feeble answer. Finally, a panel was formed consisting of a Catholic priest, the archbishop of El Salvador as well as a Protestant minister, and I had the privilege of representing Jehovah’s witnesses. The priest spoke first for about five minutes but did not use the Bible or cite it and what he did say was not in agreement with what the archbishop said. The Protestant minister talked for about thirty seconds and he also did not use the Bible. I was then given the opportunity to speak, and for the following thirty minutes I was able to show Biblically and historically that Jesus was born around October 1 in the year 2 B.C.E. So the radio program showed up the clergy of Christendom to be false guides that are not able to handle the</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Word of God, whereas Jehovah’s witnesses are able to use the Scriptures to support the truth. The program was broadcast several times and was heard in several of the nearby countries, and many letters were received from persons that were favorably impressed. As a result many studies were started and a Catholic priest even wrote asking for more information. So fine results can be had by being ready to give a witness when the opportunity presents itself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A special pioneer sends in this experience: “About four months ago I started to study the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font11"> book with a man who had been a member of the 'Central American Church’ all his life. When the preacher, who knew him since he was a boy, found out that he was studying with one of Jehovah’s witnesses, he said that he would like to talk with the Witness to prove that they teach lies, as, for example, that Jesus has been reigning since 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“We made arrangements to visit the pastor, and he received us courteously. He explained that he had known this man since he was a boy and that he was one of the most active church members but that now he was becoming one of Jehovah’s witnesses. I asked him what he thought of this. He said: ‘I know you teach various things that I am not in accord with; for example, you teach that Christ’s kingdom has been established. I believe as the Bible says that “every eye shall see him.”’ The interested man said: ‘No, we shall see him with eyes of understanding’ and cited John 14:19. I mentioned the signs of the times, but then the pastor said he wanted to know how we arrived at the date 1914 as the Bible does not mention it. He looked at the interested person as if to say: ‘Now we’ll see!’ Immediately I asked: ‘Do you know the meaning of the “times of the nations”?’ He said: ‘I’m not sure, but I would like to know.’ So we took a paper and pencil and figured out when the ‘appointed times of the nations’ began, how long they were to run and how it gave us the date 1914, proving it by Bible texts. The interested man asked him if he was satisfied, but he was not willing to accept it and said he would have to study it over and look for more information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“This has served to strengthen the faith of this interested person. Recently he showed me various religious books he had. I told him that in Ephesus those who became Christians burned their books of false religion. The next week he had burned his. This man has not missed a meeting since the first back-call. The church had not done anything about his living in common-law marriage, but since studying the truth he has legalized his marriage because it is his sincere desire to do Jehovah’s will.”</span></p>

Administration of Kingdom interests is as varied and interesting as are its races of people—Micronesian, Melanesian and Polynesian, plus a migrated mixture of other ethnical groups. Among these fascinating people and beautiful islands the brothers enjoyed a 9-percent increase during the year, averaging 625 publishers and reaching a peak of 704. Experiences from the above-named countries follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Through his witnesses, Jehovah is making his name known far and wide throughout the earth, as our “Disciple-making” assembly drama showed. What happened to one young man emphasized this. After long being a Catholic, he turned to another faith that showed promise of giving him Bible knowledge for which he felt a deep need. To his disappointment, however, the church services incorporated too many discomforting and unchristian attacks on other religions, but particularly against one called Jehovah’s witnesses. Thoroughly disillusioned, he quit going to the services, but not before he had learned to hate these Witnesses and the name Jehovah. One day on returning from tennis with a friend, his friend asked if this young man knew what God’s name was. Confidently, the young man replied: “Jesus.” His friend invited him to his home, got out his Bible and showed him Psalm 83:18 and Exodus 6:3. Feeling welled up in this young man’s breast as he stared, astounded, at this name, this very name that he had been taught to hate! To his further surprise, he was shown in the Bible book of Isaiah that Jehovah would have witnesses to declare him as their God! His former animus toward this name and those who bear it quickly dissipated and, in his eagerness to learn more of this God, he asked question after question when included in his friend’s Bible study and ended up progressing more rapidly than his friend! Love for this God, Jehovah, built up within him as he attended meetings, progressed and was baptized not long afterward in symbol of his dedication to serve this God, Jehovah, as one of his witnesses. As a now-zealous publisher, he is having fine results teaching others to 'call upon the name of Jehovah’ to be saved, rather than on Jesus Christ alone, through whom one approaches Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">AMERICAN SAMOA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population; 20,581</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">In the last </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> mention was made of the successful interisland assembly at American Samoa. How successful was it? Figures show that the local congregation’s meeting attendance was boosted 59 percent consistently over the following six months. Six new publishers from three families, one of whom had been studying upward of eight years, joined the congregation, contributing to the 19-percent increase for the year, whereas the previous year saw a 7-percent decrease. The enthusiasm generated by the assembly spurred the local publishers on to find a place suitable for holding meetings. As the service year closed, the walls of the first Kingdom Hall in American Samoa were erected, then the roof was added. As the new service year commenced, the hall was used for the first time, to the joy and delight of the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">COOK ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18,720</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Solomon once said: &quot;As cold water upon a tired soul, so is a good report from a distant land.” Though the Cook Islands are centrally situated in the branch territory, shipping and poor communication make these islands &quot;distant.” While the office received but one report, in March, it was refreshing as cold water to leant that the brothers are still faithfully preaching and conducting meetings. Encouraging, too, was their Memorial celebration, with twenty-five in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">GILBERT AND ELLICE ISLANDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">About the middle of the service year the family caring for the isolated group reluctantly returned to their country. With the last service report arriving at the branch office in February, the anxiety of the Society was like that of the apostle Paul in wanting to have someone “return and visit the brothers . . . to see how they are.” In the last month of the service year, a circuit servant was gratified to find the group still meeting and preaching regularly. The brother taking the lead, although limited in English, was using </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Make Sure”</span><span class="font11"> as a basis for meetings, as there are no Society publications in Gilbertese. Two other interested persons had joined the group too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One brother, however, was not satisfied with his own progress. Even while cutting across a lagoon, with sea spraying their outrigger, he wanted to make wise use of the one and a half hours’ traveling time, so he asked the circuit servant in broken English: “Can you please learn me the Bible every time? I am so slow in my brain.” So, as the sea swiftly flowed beneath them while they sat precariously balanced crosslegged on the narrow craft, he listened intently to the circuit servant. When some new thought was grasped, this brother momentarily interrupted to pass this on to a third man at the tiller, thereby etching it more deeply on his own mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW CALEDONIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84,480</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">To encourage his brothers to build Christian endurance, one of the first native brothers to be baptized related the following at a recent circuit assembly: “When I commenced studying with Jehovah’s witnesses a division immediately arose in my family. My cousin said: ‘You are too young. Bible study work is for mature men, not street ruffians like you. If you really want to become a minister, go and join the Protestant youth group.’ The rest of my family backed up these words with threats. That night I earnestly prayed to Jehovah for strength, because I recognized clearly that his witnesses alone were teaching the truth. As I continued studying in Jehovah’s strength, great anger was provoked in my family. Often, on my returning from meetings at night, I was locked out of the house and forced to sleep outside. My family mocked me and no longer called me by name, but pastor. Determined to continue, I left home and rented a room. As Jesus promised, I have been rewarded for sticking to the truth. Jehovah has given me a vast new family, not one of mockers, but one of members who love one another, not one that calls me pastor, but brother, a family that is all I could hope for, because Jehovah himself is its Father.” This brother is now a servant, serving his family of spiritual brothers, and has helped a fleshly brother to become part of his spiritual family, too, by water baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW HEBRIDES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76,500</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 7,650</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Since a family of four publishers serving where the need is great returned to their homeland during the previous service year, there has been no increase in new publishers. Nevertheless, the brothers have carried on faithfully and increased spirituality has been gained by them. During the visit of the circuit servant at the end of the service year, the first native publisher was baptized. A move is now being made to translate some publications into the local Pidgin-English, which differs from the Pidgin-English spoken in the islands under the Papua branch. With something printed in their own language and with the continued assistance of remaining overseas’ brothers, it is hoped that the new service year will see a further increase in the number actively serving Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">NIUE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,200</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">How steadfast is your faith in God, your love for the ministry, your loyalty to his organization? For a test, imagine'yourself in the position of your brothers in Niue. In August the overseer and his zealous family had to leave for New Zealand. A few months later the Bible study servant followed, and over the entire service year a total of nine responsible brothers left the island. Those left behind had little experience in congregational matters and, due to poor shipping and communication, the prospects looked dim for any circuit servant visit to strengthen them in their time of need. With each month the number preaching dropped, from twenty-five to ten, and the situation was discouraging indeed. The remaining brothers, however, continued to preach, meet and report regularly. They were richly rewarded when opportunity finally came for a circuit servant and his wife to obtain passage there and spend a month with them. A condensed Kingdom Ministry School was conducted with responsible servants on organizational arrangements for carrying on the work. On the last weekend of the visit a small assembly was held. Truly, those who “hope in Jehovah” are bound to be blessed in due course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">TAHITI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population; 84,550</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Joyful results can be had from vacation pioneering. While vacation pioneering, a publisher met two interested women who accepted </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> books, and the following week a study was started with them. They were sincerely interested in the study, which continued for some months until their husbands stepped in and forbade them to study after being incited by a neighboring couple. What was the proper thing for the publisher to do? The two women obviously wished the study to continue. So, following the principle that God's things must be paid back to God, and this matter involved the wives' worship of God, they continued the study. Arrangements were made to call on the husbands and the neighboring couple, and these calls met with good success. Studies were started with them all, one couple has already started preaching and the other two couples are arranging to legalize their marital positions so they, too, can qualify to preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">TONGA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77,429</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">With four attending the interisland assembly and one later attending the Kingdom Ministry School, the brothers were imbued with the spirit for activity and increase. They were very happy to begin their service year with their first Kingdom Hall. Disappearing are thoughts that they have to wait on an overseas’ brother to take the lead in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Over twenty hours have been averaged in the service a month on occasions, resulting in placement of 630 percent more literature this year. This has brought increased attendance at their new Kingdom Hall, which is already in need of extensions. The brother who translates, types and distributes </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> articles for Sunday studies has more copies to produce as a result. Though they lack experienced missionary leadership, with enthusiasm, the right viewpoint and Jehovah’s spirit they find that “all things are possible.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The brothers responded so well to the call by the Society for an increase in new subscriptions that they obtained 304 new subscriptions this last service year, to compare with 38 the previous year. The overseer, setting a good lead in this personally, obtained 123 new subscriptions. The reason for his success? He stated: “Whoever I meet I invite to subscribe, using tact, kindness and love.” The greater number of subscriptions he obtained were from those with whom he worked in secular employment and from business acquaintances.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The summer district assemblies were the highlights of the year, and this year the brothers showed great enthusiasm for them. Right from the start the number in attendance exceeded all our estimates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Although there was only a 1-percent increase in publishers, 421 new Witnesses were baptized. A lot of work has been done and many congregations have rejoiced over new ones coming into the truth. Young ones in school have shown great zeal, and their determined and firm example in keeping separate from Babylon the Great has helped other students and teachers to respect them. One young student wrote: “I have studied at a trade school for two years and during that time I have had many opportunities to witness to the students, teachers and the principal. When I first went to the school, I immediately applied for exemption from the school’s morning devotion, which was in accord with the Lutheran creed. I was able to talk with the principal for two and a half hours. I got exemption, although it seemed quite difficult, and I had to perform different duties for the school in place of it. The same thing happened to three sisters who attend the same school. Our stand aroused attention among the teachers and the students, and soon the results became apparent. We were able to start Bible studies with three students. After we had studied with them for a time they too went to the school principal and asked to be exempted from morning devotion. Exemption was not given, however, as they still belonged to the Lutheran Church. The teachers soon came to realize that the students were serious about the matter, though, as after a short time they again approached the principal and announced that they had left the Lutheran Church. They were given exemption, of course, and they were able to join with the brothers in doing other work during morning devotion. Finally there were eight of us who were away from the school’s morning devotion, and the principal had difficulty in arranging work for us. He asked me to come and see him and announced that we could arrange a morning devotion according to our own religion if we made application to the school board for it. We decided to make application for it, and we received permission. It was arranged for us to have our own classroom for the occasion and a brother from our congregation as our teacher. Every morning in school we deal with the day’s text and always arrange an interesting discussion on the subject. The text discussion takes place at the same time as the other students gather for their morning devotion. I am happy to say that four of the students who have studied with us and who have got exemption from the school’s regular morning devotion are dedicated to Jehovah and have symbolized it by water baptism, and they are zealously taking part in the activities of the local congregation. Several of the teachers have attended lectures and one of them is a regular subscriber for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another student writes: “I am a student at the local university. I found out that a Bible class met there, so one evening I went along to listen to the discussion to see if there were some there who were really interested in the Bible. Some seemed to be sincerely interested, although Babylon the Great had greatly misled them. I did not take part in the discussion nor in their religious service. After this I was able to have a talk with one of my classmates who belonged to the Bible class in question. He wondered why I did not take part in the singing of the hymns and in prayer with them and thought that I had </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font11">negative attitude toward the Bible. I immediately told him that I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, which also was the reason why I did not take part in their religious service. He wanted to continue the discussion and, to my amazement, he expressed his desire to study seriously what Jehovah’s witnesses teach. He said: ‘If it is the truth, then I will become one of Jehovah’s witnesses.’ During the next conversation break, I told him that I have a study with another student who is studying to be a doctor, and if it suited him he could come and study with us. He immediately agreed and took the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.’</span><span class="font11"> Our study has been successful and progress has been rapid. He has left the Bible class of false religion and he also engages in the witness work. The members of his family are very much opposed, but he has tried hard to witness to them too. Both of those with whom I study attended our circuit assembly and were overjoyed with the program. Now another one has joined with us in our study and all of them are making progress.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses in France have spent a very joyful and active year in Jehovah’s service. The branch office in Paris has not only given oversight to the work in France itself, but it has also supervised the activity of Jehovah’s people in Algeria and Tunisia, and reports on all three countries appear herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The deliverance of Jehovah’s “sheep” from the midst of Babylon the Great is going ahead smoothly in France, as is shown by the two following experiences: A man had been employed for five years as a hospital attendant in an establishment operated by monks. He was also the syndicate delegate for the hospital. One day a witness of Jehovah presented a copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! to</span><span class="font11"> him. A study was started, and this man was astonished to note that the teachings propagated by his religion were different from those taught in the Bible. The Witness cited texts for him to show that the true religion is recognized by its fruits. After several conversations that the man had with his fellow workers, he was summoned to appear before the theologian of the establishment and was told to cease all contacts with Jehovah’s witnesses because his soul was in danger. The man replied that Jehovah’s witnesses had created doubts in his mind and he wanted to clear them up. The theologian then took three Bibles written in Greek and said to him: “Can you make anything out of that? I have my degree in philosophy and in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">theology and I</span><span class="font11"> understand nothing of that jumble.” The attendant was dumbfounded by this declaration, and just then he recalled to mind the words of the witness of Jehovah: “By their fruits you will recognize those men.” The theologian counseled this man to continue to work for the syndicate and offered him an important job on the condition that he cease all contact with Jehovah’s witnesses. But that very day this man was convinced that the Catholic church does not possess the truth. He made rapid progress so that today he also is a witness of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The second experience concerns a woman catechist. In just two months of home Bible study, she learned so much about the true religion that she decided never to attend church again. In the meantime she got part of her family to accept the truth. A little while afterward, while preaching from house to house, she met the vicar of the parish, who said he now understood why he did not see her at mass. After having no success in the Bible discussion he had with the Witness who was accompanying the former catechist, the vicar paid a visit to this lady three weeks later. There, by slandering a former president of the organization, he tried to shake her faith. Not only did she remain firm, but she defended the truth of the Word of God, using only the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.”</span><span class="font11"> The clergyman was embarrassed and mocked the woman because of the confidence she had in the Bible. He went even as far as to deny the creation by God and to say that those who believe in it are simpleminded. After a discussion with her for three hours, he left very dissatisfied, not having done any harm whatsoever to Jehovah’s “sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The new instructions concerning the help that the servants are to give to the inactive and irregular publishers, and to new publishers, are greatly appreciated and are producing excellent results. Here is what several circuit servants have reported: “Let me express to you my appreciation for the new arrangement of the Society, asking the circuit servants to give more help to the brothers in the congregations and to the inactive ones. This week I called on three families that had become inactive, and Jehovah did not fail to bless these efforts. The three families came to the meetings that week. An inactive publisher did even better. He made a firm decision to attend all the meetings and to engage again in the field service. He did not waste time, for he was present at the Sunday morning service rendezvous and I had the joy of working with him after his inactivity of over a year. So it can be seen that these visits are greatly appreciated by the brothers and often bring good results. In a congregation where there are many inactive publishers and also a fairly high number of irregular publishers, I was able to visit at least eight families. Of these eight families, seven attended the meetings on the Saturday and Sunday of my visit.” Faithful application of the Society’s instructions brings results as is clearly shown by the fact that the number of inactive publishers in France is constantly decreasing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The following experience shows we should not hesitate to make several calls in order to contact persons who have shown interest in the truth. A young married woman became a subscriber. An appointment was made to visit this person, her husband, her sister and her brother-in-law. At the appointed time nobody was at home! Same the following week! The pioneer came again for the third time, and at last saw the</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">subscriber. A very unhappy event had taken place. The brother-in-law had been killed in an accident and was buried on the day fixed for the appointment with the pioneer. The widow, the subscriber’s sister, was terribly shocked and had contemplated suicide. Fortunately she had already recognized the truth. She had sent a young man of the family to try to find out where the pioneer lived. She also thought of making an announcement in the newspaper. For two months now, this person has attended all the meetings and has had an active share in them. Her sister, the subscriber, and also a young man are following the good example of the widow and all are making rapid progress in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">TUNISIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population; 4,565,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The preaching of “this good news of the kingdom” of God has been accomplished in this country during the past year without difficulty. The prospects are excellent, for the average home Bible studies conducted by each publisher is more than one. The intense activity of the brothers in one locality caused a Catholic priest to declare to a young Witness he had known from childhood: “What is going on in your faith these last few years? You are doing quite a lot of preaching. We have never had so many people come to us to talk about you people.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This activity, which is noted with bitterness by the religious leaders, is producing results. Proof of this can be seen in the progress of the local congregation and examples like that of a physical training instructor who had spent fifty years of his life with priests and who even had an audience with Pope John XXIII. This man decided to quit false religion after hearing a discussion between priests and Jehovah’s witnesses. Every effort was made to discourage him, by criticism and by other priests. But this man now knows who has the truth. He is happy to continue his studies with Jehovah’s witnesses and to attend their meetings, which he finds edifying and very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Incidental witnessing should never be neglected, as the following experience shows: A brother was taking a bath in a Moorish establishment. From his cabin he heard two men discussing the difficult times in which we are living and seized the occasion to join in the conversation. One of these men soon left, but the other, a Moor, wanted to know more about the truth. Arrangements were made for a home Bible study, and this person has begun to attend the meetings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany and West Berlin during the last service year have worked especially on strengthening the congregations internally, thereby working for maturity within the organization itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our increase was exactly 100 publishers. However, when we consider that 3,486 were baptized during the service year, we can clearly see how timely is the counsel in Jude 3, “to put up a hard fight for the faith.” Truly, some of our brothers in the past have not given appropriate attention to the serious warnings given through God’s Word and organization. They have not waited for Jehovah to provide material prosperity as Jesus did, but have rather fallen victim to materialism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Here is an experience reported during the year: “About twenty-five miles from the Kingdom Hall lived an old gentleman of about sixty-five years who had heard of Jehovah’s witnesses years ago. Because of the great distance, this territory was never worked as often as the others. This man searched for the truth, reading a great deal in the Bible. As a result of his everincreasing knowledge of the Bible, he recognized that the church taught many falsehoods and so he left it. As he read further in the Bible, because there were some things that he did not understand, he came to realize that he needed help. But who could help him? He remembered that he had spoken with Jehovah’s witnesses and read some of their literature many years ago. He thought that Jehovah’s witnesses perhaps could help him. They could have the truth. He waited, but no one came. He then went to the daily newspaper to place the following ad: ‘Looking for connections with Jehovah’s witnesses.’ However, the editor, a good Catholic, would not accept the ad. Efforts were made to keep him away from Jehovah’s witnesses by speaking prejudicially against them. Sometime later he remembered that there was another newspaper in the district. There he placed his ad and it was printed. The overseer and another brother immediately wrote to the code number of the newspaper and soon received a personal letter from the man, who asked that they visit him. A home Bible study was immediately started. That was about three months ago. Now he zealously studies the Society’s literature. Last Sunday, as the circuit servant visited the congregation, the man was at the Kingdom Hall early in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He engaged in field service, stayed for the talk, and lias now decided to attend all the meetings in the future. He took along a good supply of the Society’s books, which he will personally study. He has also decided to move into the city where the Kingdom Hall is located in order to be able to attend all the meetings. He was baptized at the district assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The following letter shows that there are still people in Germany who are hungering and thirsting for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Gentlemen. Today one of your religious brothers was here and left me a copy of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazine, in which I have read that a person could request a home Bible study. It is difficult to comprehend that there are still people in these days who are willing to offer their time, and that freely, to help other people to salvation. Certainly the time has arrived when there is no time to lose. Therefore, I would like to ask you with a sincere heart to help me and my wife understand the Bible. As a one-time philosophy student, I have countless questions and want to go right to the bottom of everything. I hope you will understand.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">One brother was asked what benefits he got out of daily Bible reading. He explained: “When my three children (six to fourteen years old) don’t understand a scripture, they ask about it and then the Scripture text is discussed. To find the answers, we use all the publications of the Society. Not only are the scriptures impressed upon our minds, but the children are also able to remember scriptures much better. For example, the children can now tell which book and chapter speaks about love, the resurrection, the higher powers, and so forth. Also, the number of Scripture texts that we can remember has really increased. Interest has even been awakened in our youngest, who is six years old and doesn’t attend school yet, to learn to read the Bible. She can now read out of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font11"> although, naturally, still a little slow. Besides the many blessings that come through daily reading of the Bible—especially seeing the growth to maturity of the family—we have found that reading the Bible every evening brings each day to a harmonious end.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A woman who was left by her husband and two small children prayed to God because of being so depressed. A little later that spring a married couple came to her door, and after a bit of prejudice was overcome a Bible study was started. Immediately opposition began from a religiously inclined acquaintance, but the woman recognized it for what it was, as she had been warned on the first study about such opposition. Four months later when the dates of the next circuit assembly were announced the young woman expressed the desire to be baptized. The publishers, however, were worried that she did not have enough knowledge. Then came the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> article “Are You Ready to Be Baptized?”, which she studied thoroughly. The booklet </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Living in Hope of a Righteous New World</span><span class="font11"> was also studied, and a further discussion showed that she really understood the requirements. Since November she had attended all the meetings, which aided her to make such rapid progress. In March at the circuit assembly she was baptized.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">It has been a busy year and a joyful one for Jehovah’s witnesses in Ghana and the Ivory Coast. Right from the outset, with more settled conditions in the land, they have been able to give closer attention to the inspired advice of the congregator: “In the morning sow your seed and until the evening do not let your hand rest; for you are not knowing where this will have success, either here or there, or whether both of them will alike be good.” (Eccl. 11:6) Jehovah has obviously blessed all the work done, and a wonderful year of increase has resulted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One of Jehovah’s witnesses had been married for over five years but his wife remained childless. In Ghanaian society this is considered a great reproach. The Witness’s elder brother, after using every persuasion, made a final attempt to cause him to compromise his integrity to Jehovah. The elder brother brought a young woman home one day, saying: “Look, you have been married to a barren woman for many years. I have married this young woman to you and paid the bride price from my own pocket. Take her and have children by her.” The Witness refused and explained Jehovah’s law concerning marriage and polygamy. At this the elder brother flew into a rage and drove the Witness out of his house. He added the young woman to his other two wives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Imagine the rejoicing in the Witness's home when shortly thereafter his wife became pregnant and gave birth to a male child. At this time, however, the elder brother began to experience serious difficulties. His senior wife became ill, then he himself fell victim to illness. Despite all kinds of treatment, sacrificing to idols and appeals to juju, there was no improvement. The elder brother began to realize that his trust in juju was valueless. So he said: “I want to be among Jehovah’s people. Come and burn my idols.” The time for burning arrived. Witnesses came from the nearby congregation, and the elder brother called his close friend to watch. While singing Kingdom songs, they poured kerosene on the idols and set them afire. To everyone’s surprise, the elder brother’s close friend said: “If you have burned my friend’s idols, then let us go and burn mine too and I will serve Jehovah together with my family.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Now the elder brother and his close friend regularly attend meetings, are straightening out their marriage affairs, and look forward to having a full share in true worship. What a fine blessing this Witness received by remaining steadfast to Jehovah’s high principles on marriage!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A full-time minister writes how he was able to aid an individual to be revived in true worship after twelve years of inactivity: “Two years ago I met a man in my territory who explained that he accepted the truth when we were known as ‘Bible Students.’ Even though he was then a polygamist, he attempted to dedicate his life to Jehovah and was baptized. Of course, the organization made much progress in revealed truth, but this man just could not keep pace with it. When it was clearly understood that all ministers of Jehovah should be monogamists, he left Jehovah’s organization and even became a subchief and practiced juju.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“I applied the antidote for his problem, a home Bible study. He progressed rapidly, regained spiritual strength, and was able to overcome his problem of polygamy. His understanding and appreciation of Jehovah and his Word of truth strengthened and deepened so that in January he rejoiced once again to participate in public preaching activity. After making a proper dedication, he was baptized at our recent circuit assembly and is very happy to be a zealous minister of Jehovah with a right standing before him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses have become well known for their peacefulness and neutrality. Brothers were returning from our convention at Kumasi just at the time that soldiers were throwing up roadblocks due to rising unrest in the country. Every passing vehicle was searched. When Jehovah’s witnesses identified themselves, they were allowed to pass on quickly. One group arrived at a checkpoint and were ordered: “Step down from the lorry to be searched.” The congregation overseer explained who they were, and an officer said: “If you are Christians, show us your Bibles and go unsearched.” However, another soldier remarked: “Anyone can buy and use the Bible. If you are </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">really </span><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses show us </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> You will never see one of the Witnesses without </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.”</span><span class="font11"> The brothers happily complied with his request and were allowed to continue their journey unsearched. It was a fine testimony to the conduct of Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">IVORY COAST &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,200,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The branch office in Ghana received a number of encouraging experiences from the brothers during the year. Here are some of them: Two dedicated Witnesses had a misunderstanding over business affairs and called in an unbeliever to mediate the problem. They soon learned that this was unwise, as the problem only grew bigger until they felt they must leave the house they were sharing in common. One of the publishers realized that this would not really settle the matter, so he talked to a pioneer minister. Matthew 18:15 was read: “If your brother commits a sin, go lay bare his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.” The publisher said he did this in the presence of a third person who was not one of Jehovah’s witnesses. It was pointed out that the Bible does not say this, but that he should talk to his brother </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">alone.</span><span class="font11"> Although difficult for him, he agreed to follow this Bible principle. By coincidence, the next day the other person came to talk to this same mature brother. He listened patiently, gave the second person the same advice, and encouraged him to follow through. This put both publishers in the right frame of mind. A few days later they met, worked out their problem, and now enjoy a proper Christian relationship. Obviously, following Bible principles always works best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">An interested person in Abidjan had an unusual privilege. He and a publisher were engaging in the house-to-house ministry. The publisher left the territory early, but the interested person enjoyed it so much that he continued alone. At one house the man listened for a time and then said: “Jehovah’s witnesses were forbidden to carry on their work in Ivory Coast, but now you have been granted authority to preach openly.” The new publisher knew of the ban and was surprised to hear this news. The householder told him he was one of the officials responsible to handle this matter and that the decision had been made two weeks previously. None of Jehovah’s witnesses knew anything about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">After the call the interested person hurried to the missionaries and told what he had learned. On the next day they visited the man at his office and received from him a copy of the official ordinance showing that Jehovah’s witnesses had indeed received legal recognition. The official received a copy of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font11"> book, and arrangements have been made to start a Bible study in his home.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Our expectations were for a good increase this year, according to the congregations’ reports up to the month of April. But quite suddenly the political situation in Greece changed on the night of April 21, and the country’s rulership was taken over by the Army. The Constitution’s articles relative to freedom of meetings and freedom of the press were suspended. Printing </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> could not be continued, owing to the censorship imj&gt;osed on the press. Our meetings now must be held in small groups not exceeding five persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">However, the reports coming in from the congregations show that meeting attendance has not been reduced, but, on the contrary, it has substantially improved. In spite of the existing dangers, the brothers willingly come to all meetings and alertly share in them. They are studying more now and answer more often than heretofore. When we do not have the more recent </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> issues, we study the older ones. Thus the Devil’s object is frustrated, and vigilant ministers overcome most of the hard conditions surrounding them. But a great lesson is derived from the difficulties. We appreciate the congregation meetings even more and the importance of attending them regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Here is an experience showing the power of the truth: A young lady who came to know the truth was always having opposition from her husband about attending meetings. She was allowed to attend only marriage sermons. Yet this interested lady always managed to attend the meetings at the appointed hours and also received the help of a Bible study. She went ahead well in understanding and when she learned that a circuit assembly would be held in a coastal location and that there would also be a baptism, she showed a keen desire to attend and be baptized. She finally obtained permission from her husband to go to attend a “wedding” sermon. A brother was willing to take her in his motorcar to the place of assembly. They arrived in time. Right afterward the talk on baptism began. Among those who got up to answer the questions asked was this young sister who symbolized her dedication with great joy. Now she is an active publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“An answer, when mild, turns away rage,” says the Lord’s Word. (Prov. 15:1) A brother met someone who got very angry on hearing the Kingdom message. He began insulting and threatening the brother, but the brother showed patience, handling the case wisely and in a very gentle way. As he left, the angry person called him back and said: “I am greatly impressed by your patience and deportment. Give me those magazines; I shall buy them'.” A Bible study was arranged, and now this person is progressing in the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">It has been a very happifying year for Jehovah’s witnesses in the French-speaking territories of the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique and in the South American country of French Guiana. All the brothers have responded willingly to the invitation to service and have individually said, “Here I am! Send me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In November of 1966 the work started in the tiny island of Marie Galante, about thirty miles from Guadeloupe, when two special pioneers were sent there. Just a few days after their arrival they met a lady and her seventeen-year-old son. They formerly had belonged to a sect of Babylon the Great but were dissatisfied with the teachings they received. They acknowledged that it was false even though it may have seemed Biblical. They were just waiting for the truth! For several days the special pioneers had to answer many of their questions about the various doctrines they had believed. Rapidly they came to see the great difference between the truth from the Word of God and the false teachings of Babylon the Great. They came to see the similarity in the doctrines taught by the various sects of Christendom working in the island. A Bible study was started. The appreciation of the woman and her son became deeper each day, especially toward the name of God, Jehovah. The true God was no more an anonymous God. The mother understood, too, that the work done by the pioneers was a full-time vocation for them, and she began to feel toward her son as the mother of the young man Samuel had felt. (1 Sam. 1:27, 28) She expressed a desire to see her son one day become a pioneer. To her great joy he is eager and willing to serve Jehovah. In fact, two weeks after the initial study he and his mother expressed a desire to go along with the pioneer in the field service. Since then both have been zealous publishers. The son now has a monthly average of over sixty hours in the field service. This has developed in him a strong desire to be a pioneer. During the “Disciple-making” District Assembly, we had the joy of seeing the young boy baptized. The first thing he did afterward was to fill out a vacation pioneer application, because, he said, “I want to share more fully in the privilege of service described in Revelation 14:6.” He is now doing well and is looking forward to the day when he will become a full-time pioneer. We can appreciate what a good example can do.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">In order to make disciples, oftentimes the fruits of the spirit such as love and patience must be shown for a long period of time. Five years ago the Kingdom message was given to a young lady. At first she showed keen interest in the truth. However, several return calls were made without success and it was not possible to get in touch with the young lady. This was because her mother was living with her and she and her other daughters were members of a sect of Christendom and she did not desire the Witnesses to come in touch with her daughter. Finally, however, a Bible study was established and the young lady, to the great dissatisfaction of her mother, began making progress in understanding the Bible. The mother became strongly opposed. Several times she tried to disturb the study by bringing other members of her sect into the house to trouble her daughter’s mind so as to cause her to discontinue the study. The Witness did not give up, but, rather, presented the truth in the right manner, and this had a good effect upon the daughter. She became able to answer her mother’s religious arguments effectively. The mother increased her pressure upon the daughter to stop the study. Once the sister came when the young lady was not yet home, so the mother took the opportunity to tell the sister: “You are wasting your time studying with my daughter. It is useless to continue.” The Witness did not get discouraged but went on with the Bible study. Shortly afterward it was shown that she was not wasting her time at all, because, in spite of strong opposition on the part of the mother, the young lady expressed a desire to go out in the field service and serve Jehovah, and she did so. But as she is the mother of six children who are cared for by her mother while she works, the opposition continued. Her mother again tried to prevent her from serving Jehovah, refusing to take care of the children. “This will stop you from spreading your blasphemy to people,” she said. This continued for a time, but the study continued. Shortly thereafter the mother left the daughter’s home to live on her own. By the sister’s loving encouragement and patience toward this lady she did not get discouraged, but, rather, in spite of having six children, she arranged her affairs and time in order to preach. Today, after five years of love and patience, she is a disciple in the full sense. Yes, she was baptized during the latest district assembly! Jehovah’s undeserved kindness has been her lot, too, as a result of showing the fruits of the spirit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Making disciples is a possibility not only when one goes from house to house. We ought to remember that we should speak whenever we have the opportunity, as one brother did at his place of employment. Each noon during mealtime, rather than speaking about politics or other things he directed the conversation with his co-workers to the Kingdom message. Among them some were evangelists and Seventh-day Adventists. After several discussions on their various beliefs they gave up conversing with the Witness. But still he could speak with some who were Catholics. He placed many magazines and obtained some subscriptions. After a while, to his great joy, he started two regular Bible studies! These Bible students after some time started to attend the congregation meetings regularly. Their appreciation for the truth became greater each day. “And,&quot; says the brother, “imagine my joy when the time approached for the district assembly and I heard the two I was studying with making arrangements with the manager of our place of employment so that they could stop their work that week on Wednesday evening in order to be able to attend all the “Disciple-making&quot; District Assembly in Fort-de-France. Since the assembly their appreciation of the truth is even greater and they are studying more than before. No doubt they will soon become disciples to Jehovah’s glory. It is indeed wise to keep in mind the admonition of the apostle Paul at 2 Timothy 4:2: “Preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">From the beginning of the service year the long-awaited “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly, to be held in December of 1966, filled the minds of the Guatemalan brothers. Over five hundred brothers came from fourteen different lands. Much time spent on preparations united the local brothers with a feeling of great happiness. The excellent talks, pointed demonstrations, new publications, such as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God,</span><span class="font11"> in Spanish, and the smiling faces of those from foreign lands who could speak little Spanish made the assembly a high point in the history of Jehovah’s witnesses in Guatemala. The arrival of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font11"> in Spanish during the month of June further enriched the spiritual provisions of Jehovah’s people. Now, from all parts of the country excellent meeting attendance is reported, with the number attending the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study averaging 118 percent of the total publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A missionary sister reports the following experience: She found a young woman at home crying. She had often thought, ‘There must be a religion like the one the apostles had.’ Then the doorbell rang. A magazine publisher called and in a few seconds she had the magazines in her hands and asked the publisher to step inside to answer a few questions. Said she: “My husband has taken me out of the Catholic church and I have visited other denominations but I find myself empty and without any religion. Now, is that a good thing?” The publisher quickly replied: “Of course not. The first man Adam was given a religion, which enabled him to worship his Creator. All details of the true religion are found in the Bible. Do you have any books on the Bible?” “Oh, yes, I read one that says that there is no hellfire. What do you say about that?” After the publisher gave the Bible explanation, the young householder, with arms uplifted, cried out: “I am free! I am free! I am free!” &quot;Well, Jesus said that the truth would make you free,” responded the missionary, following with the offer of a home Bible study, which was begun two days later. Immediately the atheist husband opposed her, as did her Catholic mother and the demons, who had her enslaved as a yoga teacher. “Yoga,” she said, “is not a religion”; but shortly thereafter a newspaper published a full-page picture of Christ, announcing that ‘all yogis must become Christians and all Christians must become yogis.’ Soon after she abandoned the yoga religion, she had to go to the United States, where she found Jehovah’s witnesses and attended meetings and her first assembly, at Baltimore. Her new Bible instructor advised her that the need for more publishers was greater in Guatemala than it was in the United States. After six months she returned to Guatemala and symbolized her dedication vow to Jehovah. Having heard the “Right Shepherd’s” voice and having found “a religion like the one the apostles had,” she said: “Here I am! Send me.” She has been vacation pioneering now for a few months and has made the regular pioneer work her goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During July and August three groups received training in the Kingdom Ministry School. One brother who was invited to the school lives in an isolated spot in the chicle-producing area in the north of Guatemala where airplanes are the only means of transport. Not having funds to pay his passage to the capital for attending the school, he arranged to sell his thatched-roof hut for sixty dollars, with the condition that his expectant wife and children could live there until he returned from school. A happier brother was hard to find among the students. Upon returning to his village he would gather new material from the surrounding jungle and construct a new home.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Two “Disciple-making” District Assemblies were held in Guyana in August, with a combined attendance of 1,631. Very impressive were the Bible dramas. Among many delightful discourses was the one, “Let Down Your Nets for a Catch.” We feel as if we have been doing that very thing here, finding ‘some suitable human fish of every kind’ and even recognizing some familiar faces in our year’s catch. Note these experiences of two former publishers recovered during the fishing operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A young dedicated sister was inactive for many years, attending meetings and assemblies occasionally. She writes: “At a circuit assembly in May I heard the district servant’s closing remarks stressing the importance of prayer, and that very night I asked Jehovah to show me the way. From then on I began to see Jehovah’s purposes more clearly. I began attending meetings regularly and became a publisher once more. Through incidental witnessing a Bible study was started with a fellow office worker. Others took literature. Then the man in charge of our department, a minister of the government and a Roman Catholic, began to ask several doctrinal questions, so a few lengthy back-calls were made on him, with my father (an overseer) helping me. One of our neighbors to whom I witnessed, also a Catholic and the wife of a university professor, came to most of our district assembly and is now enjoying a home Bible study. Truly Jehovah is a God of loving-kindness who hears those who sincerely call on him for help, reminding me of Malachi 3:7.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One of our special pioneers who feels like a ‘‘real pioneer” in his rugged northwest jungle territory does considerable traveling in a small boat. One day while he was in a larger boat reading </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font11"> an Amerindian girl asked him if she could read the magazine after he finished. Upon witnessing to her, he discovered that she was a subscriber and had read through the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon”</span><span class="font11"> book and was now reading it to her mother. He says: “I started a study right there in the boat, and she has continued studying diligently ever since. Soon she started out in service, crossing rivers in her boat to witness to other Amerindians.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The value of building with fire-resistant materials is illustrated in this experience related by an overseer: “A gentleman who had previously studied with other brothers showed keen interest in the truth. I started </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> study with him and observed how he gradually shed his old personality, making possible encouragement for him to begin serving Jehovah. During this time his financial position was not very good and he found that his salary was not adequate to support his family. Immediately after his baptism he was offered employment with a salary four times as high as his present one. He decided to accept this new position, although it would take him away from his family. After a few weeks his wife received a telephone call from him, asking her to try to get his old job back. Why the sudden change? He explained that he had been faced with dishonest dealings and his trained conscience would not permit him to be involved, so he was relinquishing this ‘better position.’ Now he is restored to his former job with a much smaller salary, but his conscience is clear and he is progressing toward being a servant.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">An event that arrested the attention of the brothers as well as that of the public who attended was the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly. This assembly has contributed in a great way to the awakening of the brothers and has already initiated some progress. The demonstrated scenes remain on the minds of the viewers as if engraved there with indelible ink, and even to the present time they are the subject of discussion among the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The truth may reach even schoolchildren, to the point of their holding to it firmly in spite of parental opposition. Here is an experience that bears this out as reported by a circuit servant: “A schoolgirl having interest in the truth began a Bible study with the help of Jehovah’s witnesses during her vacation. Her Catholic parents violently opposed this, telling her that the Catholic church was the only true one and there was no truth in any other. Defending the truth, the young student said their remarks were true as far as the other religions outside Christianity or the true religion were concerned. Then her parents said: ‘How can the true religion be identified, as all religions profess to be the true one?’ The young girl told them that the true religion can be identified by the moral conduct of its adherents, who live in harmony with principles presented in the Bible. They then asked her to prove that Jehovah’s witnesses had the truth and that their moral conduct was different from that of members of all other religions. She invited them to attend the discourse entitled ‘Is Religion a Guide in Your Life?’ so they could see for themselves. They promised to attend but with the sole purpose of finding fault, to criticize the Witnesses and to show that they are not the true Christians. They attended, but after closely following the account of the speaker as he gave counsel to the young, to married couples about their responsibilities toward their children, and so forth, they sat closemouthed, amazed at what they heard. After the talk the girl tactfully approached her parents and asked their opinion of the information presented, especially as to the counsel given to the youths. They confessed they had never heard such appropriate counsel for either young or old. In fact, they said to their child: ‘Daughter, your new religion is the good one, you are on the right path. This is a society of intelligent people who are worthy of our confidence. In our estimation all parents should encourage their children to follow this religion in the face of the mounting flood of immorality, as we certify this religion is the only one capable of helping the young to practice chastity.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“Further speaking to their daughter, they said: 'You can follow this religion from now on with no problems from us, because it is the true one.’ ” Can you imagine the joy of this student? She spent ten hours in the field service that week with the circuit servant and is able to attend all meetings with no difficulty. Thus even the very young can be convinced of the truth, provided it is preached to them and recommended to them by our good conduct. As for the young schoolgirl, she continues to make progress in the faith and plans to be baptized at the next assembly. She is one of our most zealous publishers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The past service year brings to our minds the words of the apostle Paul at 1 Corinthians 3:6, namely: “I planted, Apollos watered, but God kept making it grow.” The branch office in Honolulu looks after the work in the Hawaiian Islands and the Marshall Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A joyful stimulus to our work in April was the three-day zone visit of Brother Knorr, his showing of slides of the South American assemblies and a discourse one evening to a group of 2,143 just from the island of Oahu. The year ended with three fine district assemblies, which stimulated the brothers to move ahead zealously in the new service year in their disciple making. The Bible dramas, new releases and news of a series of assemblies in 1969 were especially appreciated. A fine pioneer spirit prevails among the brothers, and they are very conscious of their spiritual needs, rejoicing in their privileges of service. Appreciating the fine growth Jehovah has given us as we have shared in his field of cultivation this past year, we feel as the chief priest in Judah did as expressed at 2 Chronicles 31:10, namely: “Jehovah himself has blessed his people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">An arrangement to aid irregular and inactive ones </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">daily</span><span class="font11"> to take in spiritual food strengthens them to activity and spiritual growth as the following experience of the district servant shows: When he was visiting a congregation a discussion with the overseer centered around a large family where the father was not in the truth, and the majority of the family’s Publisher’s Record cards were in the inactive file. It was learned that the servant body had put forth many efforts to aid this family, and practically all the servant body had at one time or another been assigned in the assistance arrangement to aid the family, but with no results. Suggestions had been made for them to read the Bible daily and prepare for meetings, but to no avail. Gradually they drifted into inactivity and failed to respond even to invitations to attend special meetings during the visit of the circuit servant. Since none of these ideas had worked in aiding the family back to spiritual health, it was suggested as a final method that a special pioneer get permission from the family to stop by every day after school and discuss the day’s text and one experience from the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook with the family. Permission was</span><span class="font11"> granted, and the pioneer diligently followed through. On the next visit to this circuit the district servant inquired about the family and learned that there was little response thus far; many of the children and oftentimes even the mother were not at home when he called. Encouragement was given to the special pioneer to continue his efforts and endeavor to aid those who did attend. It was pointed out that even if he could aid just one of this large family his efforts were well worth while. Gradually the family began to awaken spiritually, started attending meetings and later shared actively in the field ministry. The daily discussions in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> were replaced with a family study in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font11"> book. What a joy it is now to see that, after loving positive assistance over a period of one and a half years, the family attends all the congregation meetings, seven children are active in the field service, the mother has recently enjoyed the vacation pioneer service and the son, who just graduated from high school, is now vacation pioneering and plans soon to become a regular pioneer! What blessings have resulted to this family from daily taking in spiritual food from the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> and other publications provided by Jehovah’s “faithful and discreet slave” class!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Due to materialism one family had drifted into inactivity for ten years and was usually seen only at the celebration of the Lord’s evening meal and an occasional public talk. The servants started a family study in numerous publications, including the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font11"> books, and then </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> In the meantime one of the daughters had entered college and used to reflect college philosophy during the family studies and seriously question the truth in contrast with what she was learning in college. She received her Bachelor’s degree and was studying for her Master’s degree. The servants continued their efforts in calling on the family and holding a family study. During the past year the daughter in college has begun to attend meetings and has been of great help and encouragement to her family spiritually. During the circuit servant's visit she was invited to go out in field service and received help and encouragement in the ministry. During that month she started five home Bible studies and was joyfully overwhelmed, fully realizing that she could not have done this on her own. She could see Jehovah’s blessing upon her work. Since then she has been a regular publisher and has enjoyed vacation pioneering several times. Years of personal attention and assistance to this family, with Jehovah’s blessings, has produced four active publishers, and others in the family are now making spiritual progress. The daughter who attended college plans to become a regular pioneer soon. This family daily reads the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font11"> the Bible and other publications, which aids them to maintain their spiritual balance and to continue to grow in knowledge and the undeserved kindness of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The servant body is so thankful that they had a positive attitude toward helping this inactive family and the patience to extend loving assistance to them for years.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The fine efforts of the missionaries and publishers in the Marshall Islands have certainly been blessed with growth this past year. At the start of the service year there were six publishers, and about fifteen to twenty showed enough interest to attend meetings regularly. When the circuit servant visited in June, meeting attendance was averaging 70 or more, and 92 were present for his public talk. Seven publishers reported field service time in May, eighteen reported service in June, and by the end of the service year twenty-three were sharing in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Such success in disciple making has brought forth typical opposition from the Protestant clergy, prompting them to pass out leaflets attacking Jehovah’s witnesses as being teachers of lies. One minister warned “his” flock not to study with Jehovah’s witnesses because they were like babes Scripturally and would not be able to discuss the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses without getting confused. One of the chosen of the flock who was studying with Jehovah’s witnesses arose in church and asked: “How can we grow up to be mature if we don’t study the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses? You don’t come to our homes and teach, while the Witnesses come and prove all their teachings from the Bible. You live just three houses away from me, yet you never came to my house to teach me and my family the Bible, while the Witnesses live over ten miles away from here and they visit me every week.” Realizing that this member was going to leave the church, they endeavored to bribe him with a higher position as &quot;deacon” in the church, next in rank to the minister himself, but he refused. From that time onward this person, accompanied by his wife on a motor scooter, has traveled regularly to the meetings over ten miles of bumpy coral roads despite inclement weather conditions at times. He was baptized at a recent circuit assembly and enjoys his share in the disciple-making work in the Marshall Islands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Honduras, the second-largest republic in Central America, has indeed enjoyed its finest year to date as far as the preaching of the “good news” is concerned. The series of assemblies through Central America in December certainly proved to be a milestone in the advancement of pure worship here in Honduras. Besides the excellent attendance, far above any seen before, the fine spirit that was cultivated in the brothers to serve with endurance and greater zeal has been seen throughout the past service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Taking advantage of opportunities to help our relatives come to an accurate knowledge of the truth can prove to be very beneficial. A local family of Jehovah’s witnesses were notified that the cousin of the wife was to come to Tegucigalpa and study in the University and her parents wanted to know if she could stay with them during her studies. The family explained to the parents of the girl that she was welcome and also that they were Jehovah’s witnesses and that much of their time was spent in attending meetings, assemblies, and so forth, and if it was agreeable to them to have their daughter with them that they would be glad to have her, one another’s freedom of religion being respected. The parents of the girl prepared her to resist any proselytizing by the Witnesses and then sent her to begin her studies in the University. The family is Catholic and so wanted to protect their daughter. Due to the forewarning on her parents’ part she was quite cautious at first,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">not taking part in the prayers at mealtime, and so forth, but little by little she began to show interest. Within a short period of time she had learned enough to know that she did not want to continue her long period of study of some six years in the University, as this world was passing away. So she chose to leave the University and take a course that would be about a year, preparing her to be a secretary. By the time that that first year passed she had spent a good percentage of it having a free home Bible study and by the end of the year was a publisher of the “good news.” Now it was time to return home, and she wrote the family of her arrival, which caused the older sister to say in disgust: “I hope that S---- does not bring</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">that religion with her.” Upon returning home she began to talk to the family about her newfound religion, and the first one to accept it was the older sister, who is now also a Kingdom publisher and plans to be baptized next month at the circuit assembly, just a few months after her sister’s baptism. They are both excellent publishers and rejoice that their younger sister is now publishing, and even their mother, who was quite opposed to her daughter’s course, is now having a free home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many times the older and sickly brothers and sisters set an example for those who are not so old or sick. The congregation in a port of Honduras works an outlying town some seven kilometers away, but due to the distance the interest found had not been cared for. One of the elderly sisters of the congregation had also gone to work this town and found a very interested person who wanted to study the Bible with her. This sister is not only sickly but also suffers from rheumatism, which makes it very hard for her to walk such distances. It takes her about three hours one way on foot, either under the hot tropical sun or under the heavy tropical rains, as she is not able to afford the bus fare there every week. However, not being able to find anyone, young or old, that could care for this interest for her, she decided that she would go. Many a time she had to take off her shoes and walk barefoot during the heavy rains, but she never failed. Soon a neighbor lady also took interest and joined in the study, and this increased the sister’s determination even more to keep going every week. This went on for a year and six months and then her efforts began to show visible fruitage. Both of these women decided to marry the men with whom they were living consensually. One did so after much effort, but did she not have the fine example of this sister to follow as far as sacrifice and zeal are concerned? Both were married and now are Kingdom publishers, having tasted of the same spirit of Jehovah that impels this elderly sister to carry on. And the sister that has rheumatism? She is now a regular pioneer!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">HONG KONG &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,000,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The people of Hong Kong had the opportunity to hear the Kingdom message during the past year. There were 84,319 hours spent in the preaching work in Hong Kong. There was an excellent response on the part of people in that many new subscriptions were obtained for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> and there was an improved distribution of magazines in comparison with previous years. In fact, the distribution of individual copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">reached an all-time peak of 90,677. There were more Bible studies conducted with the people also. With all this fine increase in the witness work, however, there has been a slight decrease in publishers. This has been due to the fact that some have moved away because of the internal troubles in the land. The branch office in Hong Kong looks after the work in Hong Kong and Macao, and tries to keep in touch with any Witnesses in China. It was impossible during the past year to have any communication with people in China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Hong Kong has had its share of turmoil during the past year. The Communist faction attempted to force the local government into carrying out its demands, but they did not have enough support from the people. There has been a lot of rioting and unrest during the year, and now the Communists have resorted to terrorist tactics, planting bombs at bus stops or in lanes and parks where innocent children play. During our district assembly this year three bombs were planted in the courtyard of the assembly hall, but they were found and removed by the police before the brothers arrived for the Sunday sessions. Conditions are far from settled, and people are apprehensive of the future. In spite of all this, a good witness was given during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">District assemblies are a great help In making progress. At our recent district assembly the brothers enjoyed hearing from a sister who had gone to England two years before. She attended a district assembly there and was moved to give much thought to the urgent need of getting the witness work done. Then she heard that the Society had sent more missionaries to Hong Kong to give a greater witness there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">So she told her brothers: “If the Society saw the need of sending missionaries to Hong Kong to learn Chinese and share in giving the witness, then I felt that the place for a young Chinese-speaking publisher was back in Hong Kong.” She is now a pioneer here.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Macao has been a Portuguese colony for about four hundred years and the Roman Catholic Church has always had a favored position there. During the past year the local Communist body forced the government into accepting its demands and they now have a lot to say in the running of the colony. There is now mounting tension between the Communists and the Catholic church. While these two factions are openly opposing each other, Jehovah’s witnesses are going about quietly searching out the deserving ones and giving a witness. They have to exercise extreme caution, for both the Communists and the Catholic church are very much opposed to the preaching of the good news. During the year the first two publishers from Macao were able to attend a circuit assembly in Hong Kong and were baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ICELAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;196,933</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">This past service year was the best thus far for the preachers of the Kingdom good news in Iceland. There are now more publishers than at any time before and this has enabled them to give a better witness to more people. For this we are grateful to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For years a sister had to endure all kinds of abuse and difficulties because her husband did not want to listen to the truth, nor did he want her and the children to pursue it. As they had a big family, he had to work hard and he also went out weekends to play the accordion at dances and balls both in his hometown and other places. At such occasions, of course, he got into bad company and drank too much, which only resulted in more severe abuse to the children and the wife. Despite his threats and very bad behavior, the sister continued to apply the wise Scriptural counsel for such situations (1 Pet. 3:1-6), and in time her course bore fruit, as he started to soften down and finally agreed to have the congregation servant study with him. After that he began making remarkable progress, and was soon attending all the meetings; also, he began to tell others of the truth he formerly opposed so fiercely, becoming finally a regular publisher. To all who knew the situation this was like a miracle, so great was the change in the life of this now-united family. The husband was baptized this summer at our circuit assembly in June, and, all told, there were four vacation pioneers in the family this summer, the father taking the lead himself! One other son, also a regular publisher, was not yet baptized, so he could not enjoy this privilege. Nevertheless, he decided to do his best and in one month he was able to devote sixty-three hours to the preaching work despite the fact that he is only nine years old!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">So patience and endurance in following Scriptural principles bore fruit and brought </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> split-up family together in a unity stronger than ever, resulting in many blessings. As the father himself summed it up: “I, as a father of many children (he has seven), ought to be very grateful to Jehovah for having opened my eyes to understand his Word, and I hope that the change he has effected in our family life will continue, not just for my own sake, but much more for my wife and children.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">It is a pleasure to report that people in India are still saying, “Here I am! Send me,” and taking on the responsibility of teaching others the truth from God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Some worthwhile experiences have been reported during the year that I will now relate. A married man in the Army was longing to obtain his release so that he could devote his time to preaching the message of the Kingdom. He made twenty applications for release, all to no avail, but, rather, leading to imprisonment. After his imprisonment he was sent off to a remote part of the frontier high up in the cold Himalaya mountains along with forty others. All perished except our brother and one other man. Because of bravery in saving an officer’s life, he was granted a request to return to his hometown and he made further appeal for his release from military service. Eventually, after trying for eight years, he was discharged in the early part of 1966 after refusing an offer of promotion. He writes: “I am happy now that I am free, having a clear conscience before Jehovah, and in a position to do full-time preaching in spite of having </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> family of three children. I rejoice to be in Jehovah’s favour along with my family.” He is now enrolled as a special pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another very interesting experience is that of a Hindu rickshaw-puller. In a small town in Bengal the daughter of one of the brothers died. This rickshawpuller was engaged to take some of the brothers to the funeral at the cemetery. Perhaps more out of curiosity than anything else, he stayed on and listened to the funeral discourse. What he heard so impressed him that he began asking questions about the permission of evil, wickedness and death, because, as a Hindu, he believed that God sent these things as punishments for one’s sins in his previous life. He began to study the Bible. Then one day he was asked to participate in some Hindu festival and he refused. This so angered his fellow rickshaw-pullers that they prevailed upon the owner of the rickshaws to refuse to hire out his rickshaw to this man, so he lost his means of livelihood. However, the brothers came to his assistance and bought a new rickshaw for him, having him pay them what he would normally have had to pay each day for the renting of a rickshaw. Pressure came upon him from his widowed mother, who threatened suicide because he had become a Christian. Still he stuck to his Bible studies, and, later, when the district servant visited that town, this man insisted on giving free rides to the district servant, saying he had not much money but this was the least he could do by way of a contribution to the Kingdom work. He was baptized at a recent assembly and then was enrolled as a vacation pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In this vast territory there are some islands away over in the Bay of Bengal, known as the Andaman Islands and the Nicobars, inhabited mostly by tribal people. For a few years now good work has been done on the Andamans, and a brother, previously a Hindu, is now serving as a special pioneer. A man went from these islands to Calcutta to learn a trade. On returning home he interested his own brother, who is a government servant. The government does not allow people from outside to go to the Nicobars to settle there as traders, but this man, the government servant, was transferred to the Nicobars, and in this way seeds of truth began to be sown in this very primitive territory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">About 1,400 more attended the Memorial than last year. One of the celebrations took place in chilly mountain air in the open-air marketplace of a Sumatran village at 10 p.m. with more than a hundred interested persons present. Squatting on the ground with little oil lamps for illumination, the audience gave the speaker undivided attention throughout. The five publishers comprising this isolated group were thrilled that so many of their fellow villagers attended. These people work until late in the evening in the fields, after which they have their evening meal about 9 p.m.; hence the late hour for beginning the meeting. The meeting was remarkable, because just one year previous Jehovah’s witnesses and the good news were unknown in this village. Three years ago, a thousand miles away in the Javanese city of Bandung, one of the villagers was studying to be a teacher when he met Jehovah’s witnesses. He soon accepted the truth and became a regular publisher. Immediately after baptism he became a vacation pioneer. Finally he decided to return to his own village as a teacher. All alone, the brother relates that he did not forget to pray to Jehovah to give him courage to preach the message of the Kingdom in this isolated territory. He spent fifty to sixty hours a month preaching to groups of people almost every night, often until midnight. The village people were about evenly divided between Protestants and animists, who make regular offerings to large stones believed to be dwelling places of souls of departed ancestors. The Protestant clergy strenuously opposed his work, and much patience was needed to remove fear of the spirits from the minds of animists. Obviously Jehovah heard his prayer and blessed his preaching, resulting in five new publishers in a year. Strengthened by the fine results of the Memorial meeting, this brother resigned his teaching job to become a special pioneer, so that he can spend more time helping the interested ones in this isolated area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For two years unsuccessful efforts had been made to obtain a building permit to make much-needed additions to the Branch property. However, Jehovah opened the way for us to purchase a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">new,</span><span class="font11"> large and suitable home in April, making it possible to organize our work better and to care for the expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The new government in Indonesia is making an effort to maintain freedom of religion and freedom of expression, and a good climate exists at present for expanding the preaching work in Indonesia. In the early part of the service year a campaign to eliminate Communists was still being pushed, and clergy in predominately nominal-Christlan areas used the emergency conditions to make false charges against Jehovah’s witnesses. The clergy were able to influence local police and military authorities in some places to harass, beat and arrest our brothers. In September three special pioneers on the island of Alor, in the province of Nusa Tenggara Timur, were arrested and beaten more than twenty times by the police in an attempt to intimidate them to sign a declaration that they would cease speaking about their religion to others. When the police failed to break their integrity, they proceeded to arrest all other known Witnesses and interested persons in the town, bringing them to the police station. The police exhibited the special pioneers in their beaten-up condition to the other brothers and threatened to deal similarly with all of them if they did not sign the same declaration presented to the pioneers. Some interested ones became fearful, but the baptized brothers stood firm and refused to sign. In the end the police did not. have the stomach to beat the other brothers. After detaining them in prison for a few hours they were released. That afternoon the brothers returned to the prison with food for the pioneers still held there. This case was taken up with the authorities, and the provincial police chief took corrective action at that time, although house-to-house work remained under ban in the province for several more months. In June the police chief called the overseer in the provincial capital of Kupang and informed him that Jehovah’s witnesses were now free to preach from house to house throughout the province, and offered his help in the event of interference with the preaching work. The opposition in this province, which has been a hot spot of persecution for several years, has now lessened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">IRELAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,361,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 790 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,520</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For some years Ireland has been divided by a border into two parts. The six counties in the north come under British rule and are mainly Protestant, while the twenty-six counties in the south form a republic that is predominantly Catholic. In the past the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in Northern Ireland was administered by the British branch, and the work in the Republic was cared for by the office in Dublin. At the beginning of the service year, however, the Society amalgamated the congregations in both parts of the country under the Dublin office. Throughout the field, brothers have patiently triumphed over opposition, and the work has made steady progress, as shown by the following experiences sent in by the Branch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One of the experiences related in the latest </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font11">has had a happy sequel. Not only has the young sister who first heard the truth at her place of employment made steady progress, but she has also been tactfully sowing the seeds of truth herself. A young man, a strong Roman Catholic with whom she had been friendly for some time, began to take an interest in the Bible due to her incidental witnessing. The sincerity of this new sister really made him start to think and examine the doctrines of his own religion. Just the same he could not imagine that his church was wrong, so he concluded that the sister was sincere but in error. After a lot of discussion, he accepted her invitation to a meeting of the local group “to see what was going on.” After this he attended all meetings and began to study with a brother. He soon saw the need to break away from his old associations, religion-sponsored sports, clubs, and so forth. On one occasion, being anxious to set things straight, he accepted a repeated invitation from an old friend to visit </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font11">modern-thinking priest in the parish, taking along a brother. After a long and not unpleasant discussion, the priest, who was using </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Jerusalem Bible, </span><span class="font11">admitted that Jesus was the 'faithful and true witness of Jehovah’ (translated Yahweh). Since these events, the young man has made good progress, has taken part in all meetings, witnesses regularly from house to house and is now a dedicated, baptized brother married to the girl who witnessed to him. Despite opposition, they are holding fast to the truth. This experience is all the more remarkable because these are the first two local people in a strong Catholic city to identify themselves as Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The following experience from Northern Ireland illustrates the happy outcome when people who love the truth of God’s Word fearlessly face opposition from neighbours and clergymen. A young couple began studying the Bible with a pioneer. As they owned a grocery shop, they were well known in the village where they lived. Neighbours who belonged to a local women’s church group were very much opposed and began to encourage others to boycott the shop. One induced the local clergyman to get a meeting together for the local women inviting a prominent clergyman from the nearby city to “expose Jehovah’s witnesses.” When the brothers got to hear of this, three went along with the newly interested man, sitting quietly at the back of the hall during the lecture. After explaining some of the teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses, the visiting clergyman concluded his talk by remarking on the zeal of the Witnesses. “If Presbyterians were as zealous for their church, we would accomplish much,” he concluded. This did not suit the local clergyman or the lady who had organized the meeting. At the conclusion the brothers were able to give the visitor a good witness and clear up many points in his lecture—this being done while the lady organizer served them with tea. The young couple were much strengthened, and business was never so good. Many curious customers were given a good witness. But as the couple progressed in knowledge and desire to serve Jehovah, they appreciated that their business was a hindrance, as the shop was open from early morning until late at night. They therefore sold the shop. Then, having a knowledge of gardening, they rented some land, bought a caravan and began to grow vegetables for sale from door to door. This has enabled the brother to limit his work and thus spend more time serving the interests of the Kingdom. “We have certainly proved Jehovah’s blessing when we put Kingdom interests first,” said the sister, “for everything we do seems to flourish and work out right for us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ISRAEL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,664,400</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 126 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 21,146</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We have experienced a most eventful and fruitful year of theocratic activity. It was stimulating to see how the brothers reacted to the emergency, making extra efforts to assemble for the meetings despite a total blackout and restricted transportation during the “six-day war” and seizing opportunities to present the Bible’s assured hope of a permanent solution to problems. The brothers were quite surprised to have relatives and acquaintances turning to them to seek information from the Bible regarding the significance of the local events, some of whom had never paid attention to the “good news” before. It presented a natural opening to discuss the Kingdom hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For the local brothers, the outstanding result of the “six-day war” was the changing of local borders, which opened the way for happy reunions of the congregations in Israel and the territory formerly held by the Arab states. For almost twenty years there had been virtually no contacts between the publishers on the two sides of the border, but now it has been possible for publishers to visit one another and to hold a combined assembly in Jerusalem during the visit by the Society’s vicepresident F. W. Franz. Just about every publisher from the various congregations and isolated groups was present early in August, along with a few visitors from other lands, for this thrilling occasion, an international and interracial gathering free from the distrust and prejudices that the recent conflicts have accentuated and aggravated. How fine it was to see Arabic and Jewish families enjoying one another’s companionship and exchanging experiences and news as far as the language barriers would allow! Only Jehovah’s spirit could produce such genuine, heartfelt unity!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How clearly the expressing of the precious name of Jehovah identifies his people! During recent years the congregations in various Arabic states have been organizing their meetings and field ministry under governmental bans, falsely charged with Zionist activity. As a basis for such a charge the authorities have pointed to our use of the divine name, Jehovah. Interestingly, in Israel itself no Jew ever utters the name Jehovah, and anyone who does so is classified right away as belonging to Christendom, a system hated by many who suffered at its hands. In the house-to-house ministry the brothers have to explain that the expression “Jehovah’s witnesses” means “witnesses of God,” since the people are so unfamiliar with God’s name. In addition, there is a need continually to differentiate between Christendom and the true Christian organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ITALY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 53,447,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">With hearts full of thankfulness toward God, Jehovah’s witnesses in Italy and Libya experienced another year of rich blessings. The work in Italy moved ahead at a steady pace, and it was enjoyable to see 1,045 new publishers started in the Kingdom ministry during the year. This produced an increase of 10 percent. There is a growing interest in the truth among the people all over Italy, and Jehovah’s witnesses are working zealously to cultivate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">People who refuse to hear the Kingdom news today may tomorrow have an attentive ear. A special pioneer had this confirmed while she distributed magazines in her territory. A lady at the door did not allow the pioneer to witness to her when she knew that the pioneer was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. She was a staunch Catholic and had been very much disturbed sometime previously by the explanations given her by another Witness about the doctrines of hell and the soul. She therefore rudely slammed the door in the pioneer’s face. A short time later the same special pioneer received a back-call slip. When she called on the person whose name was on the slip, the pioneer said: &quot;But we already know each other, don’t we?” “Yes, we do,” replied the lady, “I remember slamming the door in your face.” Then she explained that after the first call she had asked herself: “Why am I afraid? What sort of faith do I have if I am afraid to listen to Jehovah’s witnesses?” With these thoughts in mind, she started looking for the truth and bought a lot of books about different religions. She finally came to the conclusion that only Jehovah’s witnesses have the truth, and she wanted to see them again, but no friend or relative could furnish her information about their whereabouts. Then one morning, down in the garden, she found the magazines </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> Some uninterested person might have thrown them down from some window. So these magazines were seeds, not for the earth, but for the heart of this person who was able to get the address of Jehovah’s witnesses. She now studies the Bible with keen interest, attends meetings and hopes to be able to get baptized soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In 2 Timothy 2:9 it is written that “the word of God is not bound.” It gets also to those who are well advanced in age and, if their heart condition is good, brings forth fruit. A seventy-five-year-old man living in a small town took an active part in all activities pertaining to the Catholic church for almost fifty years. He had always been present at the processions and during funerals, when he would wear a frock like those worn by monks. One day the truth reached his home, and his wife and daughters began to study with Jehovah’s witnesses. He did not participate in the study, as he was very much tied up in the traditions of his religion. But one day when he took the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book in his hands things in his life started changing. He read it all alone, and little by little understood the power of the truth. When some brothers called on him, he welcomed them. Finally the time came when he returned to his former religious superiors the frock he had religiously worn for so many years. Having broken every link with Babylon the Great, he now takes an active part in the congregational activities of Jehovah’s witnesses in his town and is also a publisher of the good news of the Kingdom. During the last visit made by the circuit servant to this family, this seventy-five-year-old man and his seventy-three-year-old wife expressed their desire to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">LIBYA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,560,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The spiritual condition of Jehovah’s witnesses in this country is good, though the recent troubles in the Middle East have greatly influenced the political and economic situation of Libya. Theocratic activities, though banned, are regularly carried out with due precautions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">While making strong efforts to find listening ears, the brothers in Libya do not neglect those among themselves that have lost interest. Following the advice of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> to call back on those that have abandoned the truth, they obtained encouraging results, as the experience here supplied shows. A brother who had in the past been a zealous publisher lost interest and left the organization due to his wife, who was against the truth, and his daughter, a former publisher who went astray after getting engaged and then married to a worldly person. For many years this brother had been encouraged to begin to study the Bible again, but apparently without success due to his wife and daughter. The brothers, however, continued visiting him. Finally, one day this inactive publisher and his daughter asked a servant to get somebody to study with them again, hoping that Jehovah would forgive them for their conduct in the past. The younger daughter showed repentance and decided to start her theocratic activity again at all costs, recognizing that her submission to her husband was relative whereas that due Jehovah was unconditional. Now the Bible study continues, and it is hoped that Jehovah will bless these two families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">JAMAICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,859,072</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 5,256 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 354</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses in Jamaica were blessed with assemblies in their island during the past year. First, the “God’s Sons of Liberty” assembly in December was visited by more than 600 brothers from 18 different lands and had a total attendance on the last day of 9,458 for the public talk. During the months of July and August they gathered again for two “Disciple-making” assemblies and had a total attendance of 7,129 persons. These figures show that there is much disciple-making work to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One of Jamaica’s three marriage officers among Jehovah’s witnesses performed the marriage of his own son. The bride is the only one of her Jewish family who has embraced the truth. Many of the relatives objected strongly to the wedding’s being held in the Kingdom Hall and adamantly said they would not attend. But sentiment won out and all attended. The reactions were very favorable, one woman saying, after she heard the talk, that she was going to ask her clergyman why he did not give such excellent counsel to couples at weddings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A missionary going to a foreign land usually must learn a new language. Some in Jamaica learned a new language without leaving their country—the sign language for deaf-mutes. Here is why. A brother who is a deaf-mute visited the island of Jamaica for a few months. During his stay he was very zealous in the field ministry, using a printed card to introduce himself and his mission. He had no difficulty placing magazines, leaving over 2,000 in one month and hundreds of bound books. While here he located other deaf-mutes, with whom he conducted home Bible studies. Realizing he would not be here long, he taught others, not deaf-mutes, the language, so the studies could continue after he left. Now regular home Bible studies are conducted by publishers who learned this language. The results are that other deaf-mutes now attend the meetings regularly. After the meetings you can see the hands flying, even the children in the congregation taking an interest in “talking” to these newly associated people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah “is not unrighteous so as to forget your work,” and he certainly is pleased with all efforts we put forth to sanctify his name and further the interests of his kingdom. (Heb. 6:10) An invalid publisher, a shut-in, has great joy and satisfaction in comforting people who have experienced death in their family. She sends letters to the bereaved, enclosing tracts and booklets in the envelope. Some have taken the time to respond and write a thank-you note to express their appreciation for this sister’s thoughtfulness. One said: “It was very kind of you to write to me, a stranger. Do you always do this? I hope you will continue in the future to comfort those who have lost loved ones, as you have comforted me.” Another responded: “It is very thoughtful of you to write and bring me those comforting words. May the Lord bless you and give you strength to continue his work.” A third writer expressed these words: “Your kind letter has made it so much more easy for me to bear my loss.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A newly interested woman can now testify to the power of the waters of truth in her family. She was depressed and ready to separate from her husband because of his immoral life. Her intentions were made known to the special pioneer who was conducting a home Bible study with her, and after hearing her problem, the pioneer suggested that her husband be invited to attend the study. The invitation was extended and, to the woman’s surprise, was accepted. The man was really interested and made changes in his life to conform to the Scriptures as he learned the truth. This has made for a happy home for the family and eventually contributed to the growth of the New World society, for both of them are dedicated and baptized Witnesses and are now teaching others by helping them to drink of the waters of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">With questions now being included in the “Your Word Is Truth” section of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font11"> some are making more use of this publication to start home Bible studies. One publisher stated that she started seven studies using these articles, and they have continued. A pioneer reported that the same method was used and the result has been ten regular home Bible studies. One group of four publishers testifies that Bible studies in the homes of the people are not difficult to start. This group concentrated their activities, as suggested in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> on offering to study the Bible with the householder. In one morning they started fourteen studies using this direct approach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CAYMAN ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8,758</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A variety of publications of the Society are available as Bible-study aids. Would you think of cultivating the interest of a person using a songbook? One of our brothers did. He wanted to help his family to learn the truth but was having difficulty getting one of his daughters to respond. She liked to play the piano, and so he gave her a songbook. Her interest developed in the music, and the lyrics acquainted her with Jehovah’s purposes. She even checked her Bible to see if the thoughts expressed in the songs were true, especially the thoughts regarding a paradise to be established on earth. This aided her to accept a study in one of the Society’s publications and eventually to meet with the congregation. She is now a baptized Witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,770</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,128</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A brother and his family of six from the United States satisfied their desire to serve where the need is greater by moving to the Turks and Caicos Islands. In order to make this move, they purchased a boat that provided the necessary transportation to the assignment and adequate housing facilities. This taken care of, attention was then directed toward the purpose</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">of their move—the ministry. Arrangements were made to show the Society’s film “Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses,” and there were 240 persons present. Next, efforts were directed to conducting Bible studies with as many persons as possible. One young married couple agreed to a home Bible study and made excellent progress in a short time. The husband learned in the course of his studies that a Christian’s life must be neutral as regards the affairs of the world. He made up his mind to seek other employment to maintain his neutrality, although this meant moving his family to another island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">An </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font11"> book was placed with a man. In it he read that the Bible does not teach the Trinity, and so he went to his Anglican priest to confront him with the information that he had just learned. The priest admitted that the term “trinity” did not appear in the Bible, but said that the doctrine could be proved by inferences, which he would show the man “sometime.” The “sometime” never came, but the interested person is not waiting. He now has the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Babylon”</span><span class="font11"> book and is continuing with his study on his own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Permission to continue the ministry on these islands has not been granted to our brothers for the time being, so they had to leave. But they are optimistic and looking forward to returning to this assignment soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">JAPAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 99,822,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4,914 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 20,314</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Brothers had to make many sacrifices in order to attend the two-week Kingdom Ministry School course. One Bible study servant had to choose between attending school and losing his job. He attended school. When he returned to his home district, he found a new job in a city where a congregation of sisters had just been formed. He moved there with his family and is now the overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another brother works as secretary to the vicepresident of a firm that never permits vacations for more than one week. When this brother showed the vice-president the letter of invitation from the school, the latter was most impressed that the school was operated without cost to the students. As he was about to make </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> business trip to the United States, he arranged for his secretary to attend the Kingdom Ministry School while he was away. What a joy this brother found in the school! When he returned to his home congregation, he talked to the brothers for a whole hour about it, and still there was much more to tell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A young publisher was voted in as a member of her class committee. She told her teacher she could not accept, and the teacher invited her to explain her position to the class. She explained why she could not take part in anything political, and as a result her classmates showed great interest in the Bible and asked many questions. She started Bible studies with two persons, one of whom acknowledged that she had previously been an ‘imitation Christian.’ Both attended the district assembly with her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another young sister has led two of her schoolmates to dedication, and she herself fits regular pioneering in with her attendance at art school. Last winter, during a rest-period conversation around the classroom stove, another student got interested. He took and read the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font11"> booklet. He became a very keen student, and was so enthusiastic that he phoned his mother all the way from Tokyo to the island of Kyushu. On hearing that he was studying the Bible, his mother immediately asked: “With whom?” “With the Watch Tower,” he replied. There was an audible gasp over the phone. For, since he had left home, his mother had also been contacted by Jehovah’s witnesses, had studied and had recently started to publish. Since the young man’s parttime work was connected with false religion, he had to change this and his lodgings in order to qualify for baptism. But now he is baptized, has pioneered for some months and has been invited to special pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Aged publishers can often be a fine example to younger people. A university student had lodgings at the home of a seventy-three-year-old sister. She invited him to a public talk, and soon after, though she felt little qualified at her age, she started a home Bible study with him. Though his secular studies caused him to wander off the track at times, by the time of his graduation from the university he was firmly convinced of the truth, and the sister had the joy of seeing him baptized. During the course of his Bible study he had also changed from a lonely, gloomy individual to a new personality delighting to share the association of the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The circuit servant suggested to two special pioneers that they move their accommodations from the outskirts of the city to the center, if possible. However, rents in the city were very high. During their house-to-house work, a woman commented to one of the sisters, “You are getting sunburned and dark.” The sister explained that she had to travel a long way each day into the city. “But I have some rooms,” the lady said. She offered the sisters a room in the heart of the city, reduced the rent to what they were paying on the outskirts and refused even to take the usual “key money.” To make things easier, the previous landlord refunded a month’s rent that had been paid in advance. One of the neighbors, seeing the sisters packing to move, came over and offered free use of his truck. So the sisters were able to follow through on the circuit servant’s suggestion without any additional expense, and are in a much better position to gather in the “sheep” in that city.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses in the Kenya branch territories thank Jehovah for drenching the fertile soil of their lands and causing the pastures to become clothed with flocks. That he has truly crowned the year with goodness has been manifested abundantly by fine increases and growth to spiritual maturity. Here are some experiences from Kenya, Burundi, Ethiopia, Seychelles, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The rapid growth of the work is largely due to the desire of many meek ones to know the truth, and once they begin to appreciate the value of it they eagerly spread it abroad to others. A young Muslim man accepted magazines one Magazine Day in December 1965. Numerous back-calls were made over a two-week period, then due to the sickness of his mother he had to return to his hometown, where there were no publishers. The sister who had contacted him continued the study by mail. Four months later he returned and commenced to publish, making excellent progress. Six more months passed, then due to lack of employment he had to return home again. This time he was well grounded in the truth. He encouraged his brother-in-law to study the Bible, with the result that he, too, has begun to preach and has so far placed seventeen </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> books and four Bibles with interested persons. The former Muslim traveled 250 miles in order to attend the Memorial, then the following month he was baptized at the circuit assembly. Now his desire is to gather together all those with whom he studies and start a group study, and as soon as he qualifies he intends to be a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many letters of appreciation have been received at the branch office from those who have shared the joys of vacation pioneering. The following letter that rings with deep appreciation is from a sister who is a teacher and also a busy housewife: “I am grateful for a chance to have a go at pioneering. I feel I have never spent any of my previous vacations fully occupied with useful work. I regret I wasted so many days previously taking a rest while many people are eager to meet someone to talk about Jehovah’s promises.” Her report showed 27 books, 80 booklets, 148 hours, 16 subscriptions, 104 magazines, 90 back-calls and 3 studies. And at that time she was an isolated publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">BURUNDI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,224,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 130,824</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The truth is making very good progress in Burundi as the small group in Bujumbura, the capital city, grows in numbers and spirituality. The number of brothers increased from eleven to sixteen, and four were baptized. Good use of literature has been made during the past year, and a number of brothers have begun to share in magazine activity. Though it became impossible for the circuit servant from Uganda to continue his visits to the group, arrangements have now been made for a circuit servant from Tanzania to visit the group every four months. This is a country where the need is especially great, and it would be a fine help if a mature family could find employment in Bujumbura.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ETHIOPIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 25,000 000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 253 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 98,814</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The work in Ethiopia has made a fine forward step during the past year. The witnessing can be done now with much more freedom, and most of the brothers are able to share in all the regular features of service. This has resulted in the distribution of a considerable amount of spiritual food, many times more than in recent years. It has been received with joyful appreciation, and a large number have taken their stand for the truth. During the year a visiting brother was able to show the film “God Cannot Lie” to 585 brothers and interested persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In one area where it had been impossible to preach from door to door for a number of years due to intense opposition from the clergy and security police a change of heart is being experienced. Brothers visited a priest who said their calling to preach to him was a blow to his office. He said that he admired their sincere effort and admitted they were doing a work that he, as a priest, should have done. On another occasion a member of the intelligence service was called on. He said: “You are doing a hard work. In fact, it is the duty of every person to preach about the kingdom of God in the same manner that you are doing—</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">now.</span><span class="font11"> If I wasn’t so busy I would even join you and do the same work too. Don’t give it up! God bless you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">SEYCHELLES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 12,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Though there has been a decrease of publishers in the Seychelles due to brothers’ leaving the islands, this has been an excellent year of theocratic growth on the part of the remaining brothers and interested persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The circuit servant reports on the fine theocratic way the meetings are arranged and the way the interested persons are cared for. The brother caring for the group, and his wife, are setting a very fine example. They have been able to purchase a car, and this has helped them to build up their service activity so that they now are conducting eleven studies between them. Also, they now are able to assist those who have difficulty with public transport to get to the meetings. Though this brother and sister have already converted part of their home into a Kingdom Hall, they are planning to build a new hall at the back of the house so that traffic noises will not interfere with the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">SUDAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 13,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 40 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 325,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Good steady progress has continued in the congregation in Khartoum, and in spite of illness and some publishers’ being away from the country for several months, there have been good increases in a number of features of service. Many of the brothers and sisters arranged their affairs to share in full-time service during the year. One sister carefully planned her domestic affairs so that she was able to serve the entire year as a regular pioneer. Up until this year no one had ever shared in vacation pioneer service. This year two brothers and two sisters enjoyed this activity. The two special pioneer sisters, though well advanced in years, continue to endure the heat and faithfully serve Jehovah in this service year after year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">TANZANIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 10,498,400</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 923 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 11,374</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For more than two years it has been impossible for the brothers in Tanzania to hold assemblies. Though many from the north have crossed the border into Kenya to attend assemblies since early 1965, just a handful have attended from the far south. This year seventy-one brothers and sisters from this area chartered a bus for the 1,800-mile round trip to an assembly in Kenya. After four days, pushing the bus through mud part of the way, the brothers arrived at the assembly place, tired out but very happy. One of these brothers who is eighty-seven years old and has been in the truth since 1919 said afterward: “I must make sure that every possible time I keep even the smallest coin so that I may be able to attend the next district assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many brothers have had great joy and many wonderful experiences from sharing in vacation pioneer activity. One brother reported that at the time he filled out his application he had never had a Bible study. During his period of vacation pioneer activity he started a number of studies, which have resulted in four new publishers. After he studied with one person for some months this man stopped attending his church. He was visited by the son of a pastor who told him that Jehovah’s witnesses were forbidden to preach because of telling lies. The person started to go to church again with the pastor’s son. Later the brother visited his home and found there the pastor’s son, who started to ask him intelligent Bible questions. In spite of himself the son became very interested, and a study was started in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Good Neivs”</span><span class="font11"> booklet. After three months his wife joined in the study. Three months later he wrote to his father telling him that he was finding answers to questions his father had been unable to answer. The study continued, the pastor’s son and his wife are now baptized publishers, and his mother and sister are showing good interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">UGANDA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 7,739,700</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 53 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 146,032</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Patience is having its reward in Uganda. A young man took a very keen interest in the truth, yet stubbornly resisted when the brother teaching him explained again and again the need for him to put his marriage affairs in order. Though he attended the meetings regularly, the study was discontinued because </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> point had been reached when no further progress could be made. After one year another brother started the study again. The same keen interest was manifested in the truth as before, but this time a deep appreciation for Jehovah’s righteous principles entered the man’s heart. Eventually patience broke through the barrier, and the result was a most eventful week of decision and action. First the man sent a telegram to his mate, two hundred miles away. Right away she came, and the very next morning the marriage was legalized. The same day the husband reported three hours of preaching. By the end of the week he traveled to the circuit assembly and was baptized. Now, as his wife continues her own studies in preparation for her own dedication to Jehovah, this brother is sharing in the service more than thirty hours each month. He is working toward the goal of pioneer service back in his own village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A special pioneer and his wife both tell of the difficulty they have in getting their Bible students to obtain their own Bibles, due to lack of money to buy them. The brother invited his student to the congregation book study, and when he saw all attenders with their Bibles he eventually was encouraged to break his smoking habit and now he has his own Bible, which is helping him to clean up his life in other ways. The sister recalls how the lady she studied with wanted very much to obtain a Bible. After studying the truth many months without a personal copy, she decided to cut meat out of her diet so that she could buy a Bible. After obtaining one she said to the sister: “Meat is not going to show me the way to everlasting life but this Bible is.” She was baptized together with her husband at the “Disciple-making” assembly at Nairobi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">KOREA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 29,207,856</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 6,662 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,384</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our brothers in Korea diligently kept letting down their nets during the 1967 service year and Jehovah has blessed them with a fine catch indeed! Eight hundred and thirty-four were immersed this year. Once the symbolic “fish” are inside the net there is still much work to be done to care for them properly, and in this work, too, our brothers’ considerable effort has been rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It has been very encouraging to see meeting attendances increase all around the country. For the first time the average attendance at the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study is equal to 100 percent of all the publishers and pioneers in Korea. The other meetings have increased to 87 percent. The effort one puts forth to attend meetings has a great deal to do with his progress to maturity. This is shown in the case of a brother in the coal mining community near Youngwol. For several years this brother attended the meetings regularly although living twelve miles away over difficult mountainous terrain. He could ride a bus most of the way to the meetings, but the only transportation back did not leave till three o’clock in the morning. Often, especially in the winter, he would walk home rather than wait in the bitter cold. He never missed a meeting. Later, when the special pioneers left, he was appointed as the overseer. He kept up his fine custom until he was able to find employment nearer to the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The effort by some of the brothers to overcome obstacles to enroll as regular pioneers is certainly inspiring. One young sister was baptized in 1965, but her parents opposed her bitterly. She wanted to pioneer but she knew she would have to become independent to do so, as she could not do it from her home. Finally she decided to hire out as a housemaid. She knew that in Korea housemaids have no free time but are expected to work from sunup to late at night every day in the week. However, she kept looking until she found a family who would give her time off for attending meetings and to go in the field service. The only way she could do this was to hire herself out at lower wages. Under this arrangement she was able to get in twenty-five hours a month, but she still was not satisfied, so she asked the family if she could have from nine in the morning to four in the afternoon free six days a week. In return she would work for her board and room only, with no wages. The family agreed and she is now happily pioneering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Even those long in the truth need encouragement to continue in the pioneer work. Overseers and fellow pioneers and even family members can be alert to encourage those faithful workers. One sister who pioneered many years ago and was imprisoned during World War II for seven years when the Japanese government suppressed the work had long waited until her children were grown so that she could again become a pioneer. Some years ago she was able to do so, but then after three years in the full-time service she became pregnant, although she thought it was too late in life for her. For several months after the baby was born she did not make her goal of hours. She was discouraged and thought the Society would remove her from the pioneer list. Instead, she received a letter from the pioneer desk encouraging her and suggesting that, if her family circumstances were favorable, she continue and work toward the 1,200-hour goal for the service year. She adjusted her schedule and, with the help of all her family, she did continue and has been a very productive pioneer. At an assembly this year she told how much that letter of encouragement meant to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The issue of ancestor worship remains a problem for new brothers and sisters. One brother in Cheju was faced with this problem one month after his baptism when his father suddenly died. He tried to explain to his family why he could not participate in ceremonies involving worship of his dead father. His family would not listen and finally forced him to choose between expulsion from the home with forfeiture of his inheritance rights and joining with them in their practice of ancestor worship. He refused to join with them and was expelled from home. Later his mother and family relented and admitted him back into the home when they realized how firm his faith was. Now they do not insist that he join them in the monthly ceremonies for his dead father. His steadfastness in this early test will give him strength in the tests ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There is still much to be done in this country in training children in the field and encouraging them toward careers in the full-time service. There has been good progress this year, however. A missionary overseer in Seoul writes: “On checking the records of our congregation we found that only a few teen-agers were having any part at all in the field activity. On the other hand, about 20 percent of our meeting attendance was made up of teen-agers who not only attended regularly and participated well but did very well on the Theocratic Ministry School program. Personal attention was the answer. We talked to both the parents and the children involved in time for some of them to report in December. Later, when the circuit servant visited, he also personally talked to each of them and to their parents. All saw their responsibilities and privileges and were eager to do something about it. Book bags were bought, presentations prepared and practiced. When April came around we had no trouble making our 20-percent increase because half of it was made by these younger ones who started to praise Jehovah publicly. They are continuing too.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">LEBANON &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,822,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 939 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,940</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Conditions continued to be not very favorable for preaching the “good news” in the Arab countries during the past service year. During June war broke out between the Arab countries and Israel, which brought further upset conditions and tension for a time in addition to heavily affecting the economies of the countries involved. These adverse happenings have had a direct effect on people’s lives and have brought them much unhappiness. However, they have, in many cases, had the good result of causing some to listen more readily to the good news of God’s kingdom. As in the rest of the world, so in Lebanon and the other Arab countries it is becoming more clear all the time that man’s only hope is the kingdom of God, and Jehovah’s witnesses here are determined to keep on pointing this out to all who will listen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Good results can be expected from persevering in teaching one’s children true worship, as a sister learned through the following experience. She was finding it difficult to follow a good schedule in teaching the truth to her children because her husband, who was not in the truth, was involved in politics, and evenings were taken up in the home with long political discussions with his friends, and this left little or no opportunity to study the Bible with the children after they came from school. So the sister asked Jehovah’s help and direction in the matter and determined to study with the children early in the morning before they went to school. At first they objected to using their time before school in that way, but appreciating that children often do not know what is best for them, the sister obliged them to continue. But it was not necessary to insist very long, for they quickly grew in spiritual strength and it was not long before the older ones became publishers along with their mother in the local congregation and soon were reaching the field service goals right along with their mother. All this was very impressive to the sister’s husband, and he too became interested in the truth. Because of the zealous example of the children, he progressed well, and one day he called all his political friends together to tell them that he was no longer concerned with politics because he had become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Politics does not mix with the Bible, so he would not be having political discussions in his house anymore as formerly, but, rather, spiritual matters would be discussed. He has since become one of the mature brothers in the congregation. When it came time for the oldest daughter to decide whether she would obtain a college education, she considered the shortness and urgency of the time and realized she would rather be in the full-time service as a pioneer. She discussed the matter with her parents and found them to be of like mind. It was decided that she should enter the pioneer service right away! Today she is serving happily in another territory as a special pioneer. How glad she and the others in the family are that their mother persevered in teaching the truth to her children!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The vacation pioneer service is a fine privilege that one should not miss if he can at all arrange to share in it. And if one has a strong enough desire he can usually do so sometime during the year no matter how difficult his circumstances. One young brother who is paralyzed, able to move only his arms, managed to spend two weeks as a vacation pioneer. When asked how he could do it, he said he made good use of the telephone and wrote many letters. He never passed up an opportunity to witness to those who came to his house. In this manner he was able to arrange for several persons to come to his home each week for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font11">Bible study. Those of his brothers who call to cheer him up usually find, upon leaving, that they are the ones who have been encouraged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In one congregation the special-pioneer overseer observed that nearly all the publishers had been vacation pioneers at some time or other and wondered if it would be possible for all of them to serve together as vacation pioneers during the same month. He talked it over with each one and found that it was indeed possible, with the exception of one publisher who was not yet baptized. But this unbaptized publisher determined to spend pioneer time in the service that month and report as a congregation publisher. In this way, he said, the congregation would at least have a report for the month. What a happy month they all spent together in Jehovah’s service!</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">An effort was made by the brothers in Iran during the year to aid those who had become inactive or had become weak in the truth. Some good progress was made through the steady efforts of loyal brothers. This has been much appreciated by those who have been thus helped. During the year a brother and his wife moved into the territory from the United States and have been a good source of encouragement and assistance to the congregation in Tehran. Two more hardworking sisters were able to get into the regular pioneer work starting in January, and this has also been a good stimulus for the small congregation. It now has a total of four regular pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Since the country is so large and there are so few publishers, sometimes interest has to be cared for by correspondence. But good results can be obtained in this way, as shown by the following experience. Writes a sister from Tehran: “For years I have been corresponding with a German lady married to an Iranian away out in the provinces who subscribed for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. I</span><span class="font11"> had never met her. When she wrote me that her father died, I gave her comfort from the Scriptures. Then one day while the circuit servant was with us, the doorbell rang and her husband appeared. He said his wife had asked him to visit me and thank me for the comfort I had given her and at the same time to pay for the renewal of the subscription. That evening nearly the whole congregation was at my house to rehearse for the little circuit assembly we were going to have. So I had some food and drinks, and the man was amazed to see so many nationalities and the hospitality they showed. When he left, a brother gave him a lift home in his car. You can imagine how surprised I was when, a week later, the wife appeared, saying she wanted to make an appointment for a lesson. Since it was just time to leave for the meeting, I invited her to come along, and she did. The next day she came to my house to have a two-and-a-half-hour lesson. She said: ‘Please explain to me why </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> says the Kingdom is ruling since 1914. How do you know?’ So we had an interesting study in the appropriate chapter of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True.’ </span><span class="font11">She will come again to Tehran next week, but before leaving she expressed sincere thanks for the warm welcome she and her husband had received and said: ‘I have never felt so at home and natural as among your group.’ And then she said: ‘I have so much work to do to tell others about this kingdom; you are away ahead of me. I must do some real studying now.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">IRAQ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 7,263,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">During the service year another sister moved into the country with her husband who is not in the truth but who has taken up secular employment in Baghdad. She is an Arabic-speaking sister and this is a great advantage in this Arabic country. Her activities have been encouraging to the others in the group. Good interest has been stimulated among several families, and Bible studies have been conducted with them. One young man who has been studied with is now conducting a Bible study of his own and expresses the desire to be baptized when there is an opportunity. He is very much looking forward to the next visit of the circuit servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At the end of the service year a brother and his wife who have been living in Baghdad returned permanently to Germany. So this now leaves the sister alone with the newly interested ones. We pray to Jehovah to send more workers into the harvest in Iraq.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">During the year the brothers in Jordan were encouraged by regular visits from the circuit servant and they were able to hold all meetings including the circuit assemblies. Field service was carried on normally, with some precautions when doing house-to-house work, and as a result sheeplike persons interested in the truth have been found and assisted toward true worship. The main problem has been getting spiritual food to the brothers. Literature sent through the mail is hardly ever received, and so other means have to be found to get things to them. Sometimes they have had just one copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> for a whole congregation to study. At other times they have had none at all and have had to restudy back issues. In June the war came and disrupted things still further. But in spite of these and other difficulties the brothers have kept happy and active in Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah is kind in making it possible for his servants to meet together for spiritual food when they persevere in making the necessary efforts in that regard. During the visit of the circuit servant there was a problem as to where the circuit assembly could safely be held. It was decided that Jericho would be a good location, since it is centrally located and the climate is warm during the winter months. While the matter was still being pondered, a sister from Jericho whose husband has been opposed in the past approached the brothers and said that her house was quite large and she thought she might be able to convince her husband to allow them to use the front room for the assembly if they thought it would be sufficient. The facilities were found to be adequate and the sister’s husband was agreeable, so the assembly was held for a whole day, with seventy-two in attendance. After the assembly all present helped put the house in good order again, and this impressed the man of the house very much. The brothers were very grateful that they were able to hold their assembly peacefully in this “city of the palm trees.”—Deut. 34:3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">In this Arabian Gulf country it is difficult for women to move around with very much freedom. Especially is this so with regard to an activity that requires calling at the homes of the people, such as the preaching work. They would be looked upon as very loose women. Add to this an opposing husband, and you see the difficulty some of our sisters in Kuwait have. In spite of this they manage to keep firm in the truth and conduct Bible studies with interested persons that they are able to meet through incidental witnessing and social contacts. The brother in charge of the group is single and so is hampered by the local customs in calling at the homes of the sisters to encourage them and to study with them. But the brothers manage to meet together for Bible study and keep the preaching service organized. A number of interested persons were located during the year and are having Bible studies. It is hoped they will continue to make good progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">SAUDI ARABIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 8,000,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Saudi Arabia has continued to show itself to be a country where the message of God’s kingdom does not spread easily. Those few publishers serving there are from outside the country and have gone there with employment contracts. The witnessing they are able to do is mostly incidental, but some seeds of truth have been sown. It is not usually easy to witness to native Saudi Arabians due to their often having a narrow view where religious matters are concerned. So the brothers witness to them as they can and also spread the good news to other non-Saudi Arabians living in the country. In this way a witness is given in this oilrich land concerning the spiritual riches of God, and we hope that someday it will produce some native Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">SYRIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 5,067,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The brothers in Syria began the service year with determination to make it a successful one. Early in the year an investigation was carried out by officials in the north of the country regarding each known one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Since they are not a recognized religion in the country, the officials wanted to know what they were doing. Later a report was sent on each one to the government headquarters, and it became known to the brothers that in each case the report was very favorable. Each brother and sister was described as a sincere, religious person with </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a good</span><span class="font11"> record. This gave the brothers a good answer to those religious enemies who would slander Jehovah’s people to government officials in an attempt to get them imprisoned and to stop their preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then during the first week in June war broke out in the Middle East. Martial law was declared in Syria, and with the resulting tense conditions the brothers had to be especially alert as they went preaching about God’s kingdom. People’s minds were not now inclined to pay attention to spiritual matters but only to what was happening in the war going on around them. Certain enemies of the truth took advantage of the situation and denounced some of the brothers as spies. The police came to their homes and made a search and afterward took seven persons off to jail, including the elderly overseer, his wife, his daughter, and two special pioneers, even though they, of course, found nothing incriminating in their search of the brothers’ houses. This was on June 5, the first day of the war, and later that same day one of the special pioneers was released along with another person. Undaunted, even though this was only her second month as a special pioneer, she kept right on caring for the “sheep” in the territory. Those in jail were not told why they were being held but were subjected to questioning for several days. The officials soon learned that they were not dangerous people and that they had done nothing wrong. But the order for their arrest had come from a high source, and matters would now have to go through the usual channels, which they said would take a few days. However, there is such preoccupation with war matters and such confusion in the country that it is extremely difficult to get very important matters such as this dealt with by the officials. As a result five of the brothers are still in prison months later at the date of this writing in spite of constant efforts to get them out. But they are not idle. Many prisoners and guards are hearing of God’s kingdom, some for the first time. We pray for Jehovah’s blessing upon them and hope that they may soon be free.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses in the territory of the Leeward Islands branch, nine islands in all, including Antigua, have many reasons to be joyful and to want to praise Jehovah even more. The wonderful &quot;God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly was held in Puerto Rico, so near to us that over a hundred from here were able to attend. The brothers are still talking of their experiences and of the discourses heard at the assembly that have strengthened their faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Midweek field service has had good results. It was arranged that those going out in midweek service concentrate on a particular territory and keep a careful record of all interest shown. A number of Bible studies were started with interested persons. Three of these soon progressed to the point that they were anxious to come to the congregation meetings four miles distant even if they had to walk, which they have done on a number of occasions. Two of the interested ones were publicly “read out” of the Anglican church when it was found that they were associating with Jehovah’s witnesses. The other interested person, Mr. D----, was</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">upset about this, as he said that he had been attending the Kingdom Hall longer than they, so he should have been “read out” first! However, his turn came when the Anglican minister came to see him personally. “Don’t you know,” said the clergyman, “that Jehovah’s witnesses do not believe in Jesus?” In reply Mr. D----</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">took the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font11"> booklet and, turning to page seven, read the first sentence of paragraph nine: “Jesus is God’s chief Son and most beloved One and he has become the King of God’s kingdom.” “But,” the clergyman went on, “Jehovah’s witnesses would rather let their children die than give them a blood transfusion.” Mr. D---replied: “Well, I do not know about that yet</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">as we have not discussed that, but what I have learned so far is the truth, so I am sure there is an answer to this also.” The clergyman then asked: “When you die, where will they bury you?” To which Mr. D--- re</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">plied: “My brother is an undertaker so that will be looked after, but it is not the burying that counts but the resurrection. I have learned that much.” With that the clergyman tore up Mr. D---’s membership card</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">and scattered the pieces on the doorstep, much to the delight of Mr. D---, who is now a regular participant</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Sometimes the effect of an assembly can be immediate. An elderly interested man came on the last day to our assembly. On the way home that evening some juveniles took after him with switches and other things to do him bodily harm. His first inclination was to fight back, which was his custom, but then he called to mind what he heard at the assembly in the talk “Add to Your Knowledge Self-Control” and decided to &quot;go easy.” At this point another person who was passing stopped to reason with the boys, and the old gentleman walked off, feeling good that he had benefited so quickly from the assembly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The brothers are finding that their meetings are a means of help and encouragement, and they have put forth a great deal of effort to attend. One publisher who is a victim of polio has this to say about getting to the meetings: “Being physically handicapped does not hinder me from getting to meetings that are about two miles from my home. Since I am unable to walk long distances, I leave home well in advance of meeting time and wait along the road to get a ride. Many times I wait for hours before I succeed in catching a car going in the direction of the Kingdom Hall.” This brother has vacation pioneered several times and is a real stimulus to all in the congregation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The influence of Babylon the Great has been strong over the years, but she is losing her hold on the people. A special pioneer sister was in the service and was forced by a shower of rain to take shelter in the home of a person who had opposed her often on previous calls, always stating that her priest provided all she needed to know. The pioneer sister said: “Good morning. The rain has driven me inside.” “Come in. Come in,” was the response. The lady herself took the initiative and asked what the pioneer sister thought about souls’ being tormented in purgatory. A discussion followed concerning the condition of the dead, the resurrection hope and life in the new system of things. The lady was glad to know these things and started to blame her priest for not teaching her the Bible truth. She said: “I regret that I did not study the Bible with you when you first came to my home. By now I would know many things from the Bible.” A Bible study was arranged on the spot.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Steadfastness and determination are often required by those in divided households. A sister with three children had an opposing husband who was under pressure secretly from relatives to join the Methodist Church. He criticized his wife for taking the children to the congregation meetings. When a circuit assembly was held on the island in April he demanded that neither his wife nor the children attend. The children were downhearted, as one of them even had a small part on the assembly program. As the hour approached to go to the assembly the father could see the deep concern in his children, so he questioned them individually as to why they wanted to attend and what they learned at their meetings. The nine-year-old related the entire account of creation and ended with the explanation of the lake of fire. As the overseer arrived to see if the family could go to the assembly, the husband hurriedly prepared himself to go along and “see what was going on.” The circuit assembly program that evening was on the theme “A Sound Spiritual Heritage for Youth.” Later he told his wife: “Well, they do teach you how to raise your children.” The following week the uncle asked the husband why he did not take the children to the Methodist Church. The four-year-old daughter spoke up: “Daddy, you do not want to join a church; you want to join Jehovah.” He agreed to go to the local congregation meetings with his family and was impressed by the fine comments made by his eleven-year-old daughter. At home he began to correct her pronunciation and even obtained a copy of the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font11"> so he could attend the congregation book study with them. Now, to the delight of the whole family, a regular Bible study is being conducted with him by the overseer. Alert children can do much to encourage an unbelieving parent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Good steady work is hard to find in these small islands. One young brother accepted the Society’s invitation to attend the two-week Kingdom Ministry School course in Antigua even though he had to give up a good job. He has given proof of qualifying for greater privileges in Jehovah’s visible organization. He has since been appointed as overseer and is proving to be a valuable aid to his brothers.</span></p>

The circuit servant and his wife have visited three times during the year and, with the help of the publisher, practically every home has been visited. A businessman remarked to the circuit servant: “Not all the seeds you are planting in Saba will die. Your organization is growing.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">'Holding fast what is fine’ is the way to describe the work of a dedicated sister and two of her young children who are making Jehovah’s name known to others in St. Eustatius. Two interested persons with whom they have regularly studied the Bible have begun distributing Bible tracts to friends and neighbors and are preparing to attend the forthcoming district assembly in their neighboring island of St. Kitts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Sometimes we may feel that our territory does not have any “sheep” in it. A special pioneer had worked a village in her territory for four years, and no interest manifested itself. The territory was, however, worked regularly. About a year ago a direct invitation to a Bible study was accepted by a lady who had not shown much interest previously. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font11"> booklet was studied and then they started in the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.”</span><span class="font11"> An effort was made, with success, to have the husband join in the study. At the latest circuit assembly the wife symbolized her dedication to Jehovah and is now a regular praiser of Jehovah. As a result of this the clergy in the village have become much disturbed. One Sunday the Anglicans and Moravians combined their services for “church unity.” However, it was learned that the main topic was that their members should not have Jehovah’s witnesses in their homes. Their only unity was their opposition to the true servants of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A Bible study is being conducted with a thirteen-year-old schoolboy as a result of a tract. This boy traveled in to the main town of Basseterre to attend school. At the home of a friend he found a Bible tract with an invitation to write the Society if further help in understanding the Bible was desired. This he did. A pioneer was directed to his home, and now a Bible study is being conducted by mail. Truly, if honest people are looking for a knowledge of God’s Word, his organization is prepared to give assistance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A positive attitude toward the ministry is important for the greatest measure of success. As a group of publishers were ready to leave for magazine work one Saturday morning the magazine-territory servant asked if all had a good supply of magazines. Everyone said Yes. However, one brother had only seven magazines. He reluctantly accepted twenty more, but thought twenty-seven was more than he would need. He was all smiles after the morning’s service, for he had placed all his magazines. That month he placed more magazines than he had placed in six previous months.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Thank Jehovah for training his people to speak well and display poise. A television program director was invited to see a dress rehearsal of the assembly drama “Look to the Bible as Our' Guide in Life.” Liking it, he arranged for a live production at the station’s studio. Although the brothers were thrilled, there was apprehension, since most of the cast had not gone far in school, some not at all. But instead of their worrying about stage fright, diligent rehearsing ensued. Came the Sunday evening and the hour-long performance was masterfully presented. Not a single line missed, not an action forgotten. The program director was highly pleased and praised the performers for their discipline. Judging from the habits of the people, thousands must have seen the drama. Many asked when we were going to put on more, and comments were very favorable. One man who seldom had a kind word for us remarked: “I don’t know why people hate you folks.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It has taken time for brothers at a rubber plantation to learn to read a little, but in the meantime they have not been able to benefit themselves or their families by considering the text each day from the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font11"> So about thirty brothers now meet in three homes before going to work in the morning, rotating to different homes each W’eek. Those who begin work at 5:30 meet at 4:30 in the morning and others meet an hour later. A capable brother reads and explains the day’s text, field experiences and a portion of the Bible. After work the brothers discuss the information with their families at home. This daily spiritual buildup is really making a difference in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A special pioneer encountered a man who condemned the Witnesses for not saluting the national flag. Noticing a small dictionary on the table, the brother asked him to look up the meaning of the word “salute.” The rebuker was visibly shaken upon reading the definition: “to bow to; to kiss.” The pioneer reminded him of the principles governing worship found at Exodus 20:1-3, whereupon the man thanked the brother, saying that Jehovah’s witnesses know what they are doing. With a changed attitude this person now subscribes for the magazines, and his wife and children are studying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A brother employed as a bank teller faithfully reported all overages. Since he was the only teller to do so, making the other tellers suspect, the chief teller recommended his dismissal on some pretext. The management rejected this, however, stating that the brother was the best teller on the line. So when a general salary increase came into effect, the brother received a bigger raise than did the others. Later he was promoted to a position of special trust. A bank official told him: “Be proud of your religion, because it is your religion that has caused you to be where you are now.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses in Luxembourg did well again in preaching the good news of the Kingdom, as they know that this must be done before the battle of Armageddon. Along with the Witnesses in a number of other European countries, the brothers have enjoyed their work, they have increased their Bible study activity and have spent more hours in the field service than during any year heretofore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The following experience shows us how a wife can gain her husband for the truth. The husband of a sister had a very opposed attitude to the truth, as he had not wanted to hear anything more about God or religion since he graduated from school. The only solution he saw to the problems of the world was communism, which ideology he actively supported. So he forbade his wife to attend the meetings of the congregation, work in the field service or speak to their daughter about the truth. In addition, he never wanted to see one of Jehovah’s witnesses in his house, otherwise he would throw him out. What was the reaction of the sister? She stressed very clearly that she would hold fast to her faith, as this was her right before God. In spite of the fact that her husband disputed much with her, she continued to visit the congregation in secret and she also was active in the field ministry. Soon he realized that his opposition only strengthened her faith. From then on he let her have her way. But the sister was not satisfied with that, because she desired to have him also accept the truth. Some days later she asked him if he would like to come to get her after the meeting, for the weather was bad. As three older sisters also lived in the neighborhood, he could not bring himself to let them walk home in such bad weather, so he brought them home with his car after the meeting that evening. In this way he met some of Jehovah’s witnesses after all. Then the wife did all she could to bring him in contact with more of her Christian brothers. Although he did not show any interest in the truth, yet he went with his wife to an assembly, as he liked being with Jehovah’s witnesses. Then the man became very ill and had to go to the hospital. During this time he was afraid of dying, and he began to read Biblical literature. Not a single soul of his fellow employees visited him in the hospital, but Jehovah’s witnesses did. This made such an impression upon him that he started to attend the congregation meetings after his recovery. In this way he learned the truth, and he was baptized at the latest circuit assembly. The Biblical principles of love and patience once more proved to be triumphant over the communistic philosophy of life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">During the year we had many fine experiences, and we reached many new peaks in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One missionary writes: “Recently a young publisher had an interesting experience while awaiting treatment for his sister at a local clinic. After listening for some time to an Adventist preacher who was explaining his doctrines, the young publisher interrupted politely and said: ‘Pardon me, sir, but where in the Bible do you find that explanation?’ Of course, the preacher, not being able to support his teachings, was obliged to listen to the Scriptural explanation given by the young publisher. All the people present were very much impressed and began asking: ‘How is it that this little boy knows these things and is able to speak so boldly about the Bible?’ One person remarked: ‘He is the “assistant” to the new missionary who teaches the Bible here in T----.’ Responding to the explanation that the pub</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">lisher was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, the doctor himself asked whether the Bible spoke of Jehovah’s witnesses. Using the preacher’s Bible, the youngster applied the text at Isaiah 43:10-12, giving a fine witness about Jehovah’s witnesses. Deeply impressed, the doctor said: ‘Imagine that this young lad, this little boy is able to explain the Bible and his faith to us in this way!’ Then, turning to the young Witness, he said: ‘Will you return here and tell me more about the things that you are learning?’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another missionary writes: &quot;Speaking the truth with everyone on all occasions often brings wonderful results. One day a man seventy years old, with a cane, a long white robe and a beard, came to the missionary home wanting to sell some land on which the missionaries could build a church. He was told that the missionaries were there, not to build churches, but to help people to understand the Bible. After being told about the Kingdom, he was invited to the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study the following Sunday. He came, but his attitude was that he already knew all there was to know about the Bible. Nevertheless, after the meeting, when he was asked if he would like to study the Bible, he answered: ‘Yes, not only with me, but with my whole family.’ Arrangements were made, and the next day twenty persons were waiting at his home. After a month he started attend-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">ing the meetings regularly. Since he lived quite a distance from the Kingdom Hall and walked very slowly with the aid of his cane, it took him two hours to get to the hall. He progressed very rapidly in his study, becoming very humble, realizing he had a lot to learn. He wanted very much to preach, but, because he was so new, it was felt he should wait until he had completed the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Living in Hope</span><span class="font11"> booklet. When the circuit servant visited the congregation the man said to him: ‘Mr.----, the missionary is bad because he</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">said I cannot go out in the preaching work yet.’ After a while it was explained that it would be nice if he shaved, had his hair cut and wore some clothes other than that long robe. Then, if he was in agreement with the truth of God’s Word, he could go with the missionary teaching others this truth. The man was overjoyed, but being poor he said he had no other clothes than this robe. The missionaries were able to get him a pair of pants and a shirt, and when the day arrived for him to go out in the service he looked like a new man. The first month he preached seventy hours, placed many magazines and made over a hundred back-calls. The second month he did more, and one could see that his whole life was to do Jehovah’s will. Sometime during these few months he threw his cane away and, when asked about this, he said: ‘Jehovah has given me new life and I have asked for twenty years of preaching so I can tell everyone about his kingdom.’ The real reason was that he now had a real purpose in life. During his third month of publishing he was baptized at a circuit assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">MALAWI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;4,042,412</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">What a wonderful year of blessings this has been both in Malawi and Mozambique! How great a witness has been given! This is how Jehovah’s witnesses in Malawi feel at the end of the service year. More hours were spent in the ministry than ever before in one year and many new ones have taken their stand for the truth. Yet for many brothers the year has not been without its difficulties. Three Kingdom Halls, thirty-four houses and one store belonging to brothers were burned down by hooligans, besides damage done to other property. Some crops were destroyed. A number of brothers were assaulted and beaten, and one sister was raped. Yet the brothers have continued faithfully preaching in both favorable season and troublesome season. (2 Tim. 4:2) They are determined to continue doing this “urgently,” even though many are trying to stop the work, such as Malawi’s one political party, which on September 16, 1967, passed a resolution that “recommended strongly that the Jehovah’s Witnesses denomination be declared illegal in this country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When conducting a Bible study we should not underestimate or ignore the children, for often they will be a means of helping their parents to appreciate the truth. A study that had been held with a young woman for some time seemed to be fruitless. Then a separate study in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book was also started with her two children, who are four and three years old. After putting them to bed and before they would fall asleep, the mother would overhear the four-year-old girl carefully reviewing and explaining to her young brother things that they had been taught at the study. She would ask questions, and if her brother answered wrongly she would correct him and explain the correct answer. This girl also came to understand that we must not neglect the house of God. So every Sunday she would remind her mother that it was the day for going to the meeting. This has greatly helped and encouraged the mother so that now she is becoming more regular in her meeting attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Schoolchildren should not become discouraged if their efforts to witness to other children do not seem to bear fruit. A young schoolgirl regularly witnessed to others at her school. But none appeared to listen or give attention to what she was saying. Then one day one of the girls went home and told her grandmother all the things the young sister was telling them at school. The grandmother’s interest was aroused. So she told her granddaughter to bring the young sister home with her as she wanted to hear firsthand the things the young sister was saying. The young sister and her mother visited the grandmother, and a Bible study was started. What joy they had when the grandmother later dedicated herself and was baptized!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Although most who come in the truth are first called upon in the door-to-door ministry, sometimes a sheeplike person will himself look for and search out the brothers. This happened when a brother was approached by a man who said: “I have come to offer myself; I want to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” This man had read many of the Society’s publications, including the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1967 Yearbook,</span><span class="font11"> yet no brother was calling upon him or studying with him. For many years he had been a regular churchgoer and had been nominated to be a deacon. But as he continued studying the Bible by himself and reading the publications he came to see that what his church was teaching was not in harmony with God’s Word. He became troubled in mind. About this time, much to his surprise, he received an offer to become </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> pastor in the church. It was then that he made his decision. He resigned from the church and informed his wife and family of the steps he was taking. He then went to find the brothers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">It is often necessary to help newly interested ones to see the importance of removing things connected with Babylonish worship. An interested lady who had been studying for some time said that ever since she began studying the Bible she had had her sleep disturbed. She felt the presence of demons in her room and had seen demonstrations of unnatural powers at night. She remembered what she had learned of the power of the demons to work through images, so she immediately removed from her room three images, carefully wrapping them up and placing them in a trunk in which she had some things stored in her daughter’s room. Then her daughter began to complain that she was unable to sleep at night because of the sound of running feet in the room. The lady opened the trunk and saw that everything was in disorder, and that some shoes that were there had been thrown out of their boxes. The images were then removed to a spare room, but the lady still had her sleep disturbed. It was not until she saw the need to destroy the images completely that she finally had peace in her home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A number of government officials have come to respect the neutral position taken by Jehovah’s witnesses and have allowed them to meet openly and engage in the ministry. A chief was summoned to the local government office and asked how many churches he had in his village. He replied that he did not have any, but that he did have some who called themselves Jehovah’s witnesses. The District Commissioner (the local government official) asked if the chief had given them a place to build their church. He explained that he had not and that the brothers were meeting in a private house. The District Commissioner told the chief to bring the leaders of this group to him. Two of the brothers were brought in, and when they acknowledged that they were Jehovah’s witnesses, the District Commissioner told them: “I am happy to see you people; you are people who never engage in politics, and we have this stated in our records.” Having found out that the brothers had paid their tax, the District Commissioner told the chief to return to his village with the brothers and to give them a place to build a “church” and to see that nobody worries them. The Kingdom Hall is now completed; and the chief admitted that, when he was told to take the two brothers to the local government office, he thought that they were going to be arrested and possibly killed, but to his surprise they were praised. Since the building of the Kingdom Hall, meeting attendance has more than doubled and the congregation is very strong.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Is the gathering work finished? Certainly not in the Indian Ocean on the islands of Mauritius, Reunion and Rodrigues! One missionary put it this way: “Back home I used to think, Ah, this afternoon I have two studies; if I stretch them to an hour and a half I can get in three hours easily. Here, how different! I think, If I can get to Mrs. So-and-So a quarter of an hour earlier and stay only three-quarters of an hour I can visit the lady across the road who is asking for a study and, if I don’t stay more than twenty minutes with her because she’s newly interested, I can fit in that other study near there. I can then do my other four studies if I don’t stay too long at each. Yet I always seem to have to miss somebody because of lack of time.” In Reunion at one time about twenty new ones were wanting to go out in service, but they were asked to study more. The main reason for this was that the capable brothers in the congregations already had more persons to train than they could handle, so there was no one with whom they could work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Making disciples calls for loving care and great effort. This is illustrated by the following experience: A sister had been a regular publisher for six or seven years, making placements, doing a few back-calls but without conducting a Bible study. Although she was encouraged by the congregation servant and the book study servant, it was clear that something was holding her back. Then it was learned that she had started to work for a religious organization of Babylon the Great. The overseer, accompanied by his wife, visited the family and tactfully showed them their position. Their good attitude was demonstrated by her immediate decision to leave this employment at the end of the month. The overseer suggested that his wife, a special pioneer, study the booklet </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Living in Hope of a Righteous New World</span><span class="font11"> with the family, and arrangements were made for the two sisters to work together in service each week. After a few weeks of this personal aid the special pioneer sister accompanied her husband in the circuit work for two months. On returning to the congregation they were amazed to hear that the sister now had five Bible studies and had applied for vacation pioneer service. That was not all; so that she would not be alone in the vacation pioneer work, she asked one of the older sisters if she could work a little more often in service during that month so that they could be together. When encouraged by her husband, a dedicated brother, this other sister, although in her sixties, decided that she too would vacation pioneer. Together they went to see their book study servant to get their vacation pioneer applications. He had already applied, and on hearing that these sisters were going to pioneer, he encouraged his wife to join them. So in this congregation book study group five persons vacation pioneered. Yes, spending time with those already dedicated, helping them really to become progressive disciples, brings rich blessings from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Though opposed by her mother with whom she has lived since separating from her husband, a young Catholic woman regularly studied the Bible. Relatives who were worried over their financial position encouraged her to take up living with a certain man, although she was not free to remarry. On being questioned about the problem, the publisher showed, by means of the booklet </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Living in Hope of a Righteous New World,</span><span class="font11"> the Bible principles on the matter. Both the newly interested one and her mother, who had been listening, were pleased with the good counsel given. Although invited at that time to study, the mother refused, saying that she must stick to her church. A few months later she returned from church with a cross marked in ashes on her forehead. Her daughter told her it was just tradition and had nothing to do with the Bible. She replied that she would have ashes put on her forehead every year until she died. But the following week she learned that the church had decided not to continue this ceremony, this being one of the changes brought by the church council. Since then she has studied regularly with her daughter.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A young brother who now enjoys vacation pioneering is a living example of how those who oppose the message of truth may be helped. He writes: &quot;It was five years ago that I first saw Jehovah’s witnesses going from house to house in my neighborhood. At that time I would hide in the tall grass and throw stones at them, and if I was on vacation I would follow them and shout ‘Don’t listen’ as they would knock at the doors. Later my parents began to study with them, and I received a great deal of correction, particularly to make me attend meetings. Gradually I began to understand, and within a year I was myself going from door to door and I began to receive the same treatment that I had given to others as the neighborhood children followed me from door to door. Now, four years later, I am myself a baptized member of the congregation and as often as possible enjoy the service as a vacation pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is common in Reunion for persons to practice both Catholicism and Hinduism, and often as the publishers go from door to door they meet with the objection that the family already has two religions and they do not want a third. A study was started in just such a family with a young girl. As the study progressed it seemed that the father and the rest of the family went deeper and deeper into the cult of Hinduism. However, a great change suddenly came about, and the father explains it this way: “That Sunday I decided to make a bigger sacrifice of animals than I had ever made before. This cost me a lot of money. The next day my wife and I were involved in a very bad accident that ended up with our using all our savings and we nearly lost our lives. I began to think, What good were all these sacrifices? These gods that I am worshiping can’t protect me. I questioned the Witness that was studying with my daughter and decided then to examine the Bible carefully.” One year later this family is completely free from Babylon the Great, and the parents and three of the children have symbolized their dedication to Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">During the service year the two pioneers that were working in the island returned to Mauritius. Another special pioneer minister, along with his wife and children, have replaced them. Regular congregation meetings are held and two local persons are having a share in the ministry. The opposition to the work has changed somewhat; no longer do we have government opposition, but the clergy have had to fall back on their own resources in their fight against truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Even young children stand fast for Bible principles. During one of the feast days a seven-year-old daughter of a newly interested person was offered black pudding by a neighbor. She refused, saying that it was not permitted for Christians to eat blood. Surprised by these words from one so young, he inquired of her mother the reason for this. On receiving the Bible’s reply, this neighbor family stopped eating blood, and one of the family is now studying and attending meetings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Persistence has its reward. A sister writes: “I obtained a subscription from a very interested lady who assured me that she would study the Bible, but when I returned the first, second, third and more times one of the little girls would come out and say: ‘Mama is not at home.’ After several visits I hid like a spy behind the trees, waiting for the moment when the lady would come near the street door so I could catch her there and not give them an opportunity to tell me: ‘Mama is not at home.’ When I said ‘Hello’ to the lady, who is also an acquaintance, she said: ‘You have come to my home looking for me several times, haven’t you? You want to talk to me about your religion? Well, you can visit me as a friend, but not to talk to me about religion. If you want to talk about religion, go visit my neighbor who lives in the back to whom I have passed on all the magazines since the very first copy arrived. She surely reads them and likes them because scarcely three or four days go by before she shouts from the backyard and asks me if </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> has arrived. So she has read about eight issues.’ After I talked briefly with this lady, I went to visit the one who was reading the magazines. The magazines had done a good job. From only eight issues the family had learned the basic truths of God’s Word and had become free from lies, idols and certain superstitions. The final result is that two of these persons are now baptized and two more have recently begun to publish. There is also something else. When this family began to publish, they saw the need of taking advantage of their friendship with the lady who had subscribed for the magazines. They went to her and told her: ‘We want to pay the debt that we owe you.’ The original subscriber said: ‘Don’t worry; to the contrary, I’m happy that you have taken advantage of the money that I paid for the subscription.’ But the sisters were not referring to the cost of the subscription and they told her: 'No, you gave us the truth, and we want to give it to you. We know that you are very busy in your home, so we are going to adjust our schedule to your spare time and study with you then.’ The study was successfully started and now she is progressing in knowledge and going to meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s right principles must be followed, because many times when it seems that God’s servants go unnoticed they are being observed by others. A brother returned to his former place of residence to attend an assembly. While there he met an old friend who, knowing that he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, invited him to a cornfield to eat some roasted ears of corn, as is the custom. When in the cornfield and ready to cut the ears of corn the one extending the invitation said: “I just want to tell you that this field is not mine. But do not worry, nobody will miss the few ears of corn that we cut. Why, everybody does the same thing and nobody notices it.” The brother flatly refused and said that if he had no permission from the owner he would not cut or eat even one ear of corn because that would be stealing, even though it was a small amount and was the custom in the community. Then the man said: “Now I am convinced that what your ‘brothers’ have told me is true, that you Jehovah’s witnesses really practice what you preach and try to be honest in all things.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">It is wonderful that we are able to report another year’s activity by the brothers in Morocco and Gibraltar. We obtained 1,359 new subscriptions during the service year. This figure represents the highest obtained in Morocco during a service year. There is a great deal of atheism among the younger generation, as they find that their religion does not satisfy their needs, and many are searching for something better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">While going from door to door a pioneer was about to skip a door, thinking that the householder would not speak French. However, he decided to try it after all. An Italian man who answered the door was impatient and wanted to give a $2 contribution to get rid of the pioneer. But with persuasion he accepted literature in exchange for the money, stating that he was leaving the country the following month. Two months later the pioneer decided to make a back-call on this man to see if he was still there. He had not left, but he had read the literature and was asking for more books. Yet when arrangements were made for back-calls he was never at home. This happened about thirty times during several months. Finally he invited the brother into the house and a study was started. His sixteen-year-old daughter was always present and prepared for the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">After a few months a visitor who was a non-Christian schoolteacher attended one of the studies. When the pioneer was leaving the house she ran after him asking what she must do to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses, as she wanted to live in the paradise also. This girl kept coming to the study, and later another non-Christian girl who lives with the Italian family also attended the study although she had been opposed at first. Then slowly the whole family joined the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Six months later the first girl asked to go out in the service. Two months afterward the schoolteacher joined her. In their first month of preaching together they spent 30 hours each in the field service, placing 80 and 130 magazines respectively. Now both of them are baptized and have done vacation pioneering. Also, other members of the family are now publishing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">We rejoice with the Gibraltar congregation, for once more they proved they are advancing to spiritual maturity. During the past few months the fever of nationalism was getting higher and higher as the day of the referendum approached. Gibraltarians would be able to voice their opinion as to whether they wanted to be ruled by Spain or continue under British rule. Word began to spread throughout Gibraltar that over five hundred of Jehovah’s witnesses would not be taking part in this referendum. Not realizing that there are only twenty-one baptized brothers and a few more than fifty associated with the congregation, many patriotic persons were angry, for they felt it would cause unfavorable results. Therefore many of the brothers were threatened over the phone and their doors were painted red, white and blue. They were told that, not only would the Kingdom Hall be damaged, but the Witnesses would be dragged to the polls by force if they did not vote voluntarily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">News of these threats reached the ears of the authorities. They got in touch with the overseer and his assistant to find out why Jehovah’s witnesses were not voting. When the authorities found out that it was for purely religious reasons, they showed themselves very favorable. They were ready to protect our rights as a religious group to refuse to participate in the voting if we so desired. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">To</span><span class="font11"> protect the brothers, a law was passed and published in the newspapers as well as announced on the radio and TV. It said, in effect, that any person threatening another to vote or not to vote, or anyone trying to find out if someone voted or did not vote would be fined £100 or sentenced to one year in prison or both. The police were also sent to protect the brothers during the meetings. Although none of the brothers took part in the referendum, no one was molested in any way. We can see Jehovah’s protection on those who are determined to maintain their integrity and not violate their neutrality.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Despite the growing indifference toward religion in general, Jehovah’s witnesses in the Netherlands have enjoyed a fine year of progress, spiritually and numerically. The greater interest in the meetings and consistent efforts on the part of the servants to aid the “prodigal son” to come back have had a strong effect on the inner strength of the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A few years ago a congregation overseer got into so many domestic problems that he and his family, consisting of his wife and three children, completely vanished from the scene of activity. The marriage seemed wrecked, the wife even being disfellowshiped. The circuit servant visited him with the overseer and talked about spiritual matters but without any response. Then a program was launched in which the key point was that the overseer would visit him twice a month just for a friendly visit. Soon his heart opened up. A study with the man and the children was conducted every week. The man came back into the truth. His domestic affairs changed, his wife began coming back to the meetings as soon as he and the children did and she was reinstated. Now they are happily united and all the troubles are past. This family is very much respected in the congregation, being exemplary and diligent, and he is a servant again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Some fear to work in the territory where they live and thereby miss many blessings. A sister lives in a community of about forty houses. She must travel quite some distance to work with the congregation but always preferred that to working in her street. One day the weather was wet and stormy and she said to herself: “I have to go to my neighbors now.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">She put on her coat and then took it off again, full of fear. She sat down beside the hearth, but had no peace of mind. Well, it went on like this for four times, coat on, coat off. At last she prayed for strength and went out, with marvelous results. The first neighbor said: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font11"> have been waiting for this visit for thirteen years.” Almost everyone invited her in, and at the end of the month her field service report showed 19 hours, 36 magazines, 11 books and two brand-new studies, both on her own street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A sister writes that during her house-to-house calls she met a woman with whom she placed the special April </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> together with a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> When calling back, the sister, together with her companion, was hugged by this lady, who cried and said that this one magazine had helped her tremendously. She had dabbled in spiritism and was under attack by demons. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> she took contained the article “Repelling the Attack of Wicked Spirits.” Before this she had visited the priest, the doctor and the neurologist, and nobody had given her positive counsel. She had told the priest that she contemplated suicide, and the priest assured her that if this was the case she would find a place in heaven. The demon attacks continued, the demons even knocking her grocery parcels out of her hand. She had wasted hundreds of guilders on books about spiritism, images, incense holders, and so forth, and she asked us if we dared to visit her, because everybody was afraid to enter her home. The sisters explained to her the power of prayer, and a study was started that is still in progress with good results.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The branch office at Willemstad in Curasao, Netherlands Antilles, looks after the work in three islands, Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao. All of these islands enjoyed an increase in publishers during the past service year. The people on the islands of this part of the Caribbean Sea are hearing the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One outstanding event of the year here was the conducting of the Kingdom Ministry School at the branch home in May. A picture of the class along with a write-up was given to the local papers. Two of them published the write-up and the picture. This turned out to be one of the best pieces of publicity we ever had in Curacao. People on the street wanted to know what they could do to get enrolled in such a course of Bible study. “How much would it cost?” One man said: “I have been subscribing to your magazines for years, why can’t I enroll?” They were all told to let us have a home Bible study with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ARUBA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59,209</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Some events of importance that helped the work to move ahead in Aruba during the year are as follows: Late in January the last of the series of assemblies for Latin America was held in San Juan, Puerto Rico. About thirty publishers and pioneers from Aruba attended this assembly. They returned from the assembly so full of enthusiasm that from that time on the work in Aruba took on new life. The visit of the zone servant, Robert Tracy, to Aruba in February was also an inspiration to the brothers there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another thing that helped matters in Aruba was the fine circuit assemblies held during the year, with more than twice as many in attendance at the last one as there are publishers in Aruba. Last but not least was the “Disciple-making” District Assembly, which more than 100 of the 150-odd publishers in Aruba attended, traveling by boat and plane to Curacao for this assembly. There were many large family groups that attended. In fact, about 60 percent of those attending were teen-agers. One brother that attended with many of his large family said: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font11"> want my children to get a good impression of Jehovah’s organization while they are young. I encouraged them to save their money for the trip to the assembly, and they did. I’m sure they will never forget the experience of attending their first assembly on another island. Now we are planning and saving, too, to attend an assembly in the U.S.A, in 1969, if Jehovah wills.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">BONAIRE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7,134</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">22</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 324</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The work in Bonaire suffered some setbacks during the past service year. One family of three publishers left to live on another island. One member of the committee of the small congregation there was dis-fellowshiped for immorality. Still there was </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a 5-</span><span class="font11">percent increase in publishers, and we are thankful to Jehovah for that increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We must be prepared at all times to defend the truth as set out in God’s Word. At harvesttime in Bonaire there are corn-cutting matches for which the neighbors come together to harvest a crop and enjoy a big meal on the side. A brother present at one of these functions refused a certain dish prepared with goat’s blood in it. The lady serving the food said: “I know the law of your religion forbids the eating of blood.” The brother answered: “It is not our law, but God’s law.” This opened the way for an extended witness to be given at the same time. Many questions were asked and Scriptural answers were given from the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">NEWFOUNDLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;500,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses in Newfoundland have not treated the ministry lightly. Instead, they permit their ministry to influence their decisions and their entire way of life. This can be noted by the experience of a young brother whose parents continually encouraged him to make the pioneer ministry his goal in life. He had decided, upon completing his high school education, to enter immediately into the pioneer service. Just as he was about to fill out his application, he was offered a scholarship and an invitation to a university education by the government. This appeared at first to be a chance of a lifetime. “However, I permitted my desire to serve Jehovah and the ministry to take first place in my life and enrolled as a pioneer. At first I found the pioneer service a real test of my faith and endurance. But, by putting my confidence in Jehovah, I was able to continue, and my efforts were blessed as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font11"> succeeded in starting many home Bible studies. My experiences in the pioneer service helped me to feel closer to Jehovah and I found a constant need to rely on him for strength. Even my prayers came to mean much more to me.” This young brother is now enrolled as a special pioneer and is looking forward to starting more Bible studies and aiding others to become disciples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Home Bible studies are the most effective means of aiding interested ones to believe God’s Word and call in faith upon the name of Jehovah. While the time is fast running out for Babylon the Great, there are still many who need assistance to break free from her. Listen, as one once caught in Babylon speaks: “Hope of being rescued from Babylon the Great came slowly but surely. Even before I knew anything about Jehovah’s witnesses, I was desirous to know what was right. I always looked to the bishop as a spiritual shepherd but was disappointed by his visits because he was always looking for more money. This made me stop and think. When I was visited by a clergyman after my studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses, he was very angry, pounded the table and refused to answer a single question I raised. This helped me to see that something was really wrong with my religion. It was by the patience and love of Jehovah’s witnesses who studied with me regularly each week that I was helped to take the right steps to come out of Babylon the Great. In just a year and a half, by the help of a home Bible study together with association at the meetings, I have come to a knowledge of the truth. Now I have been sharing with my brothers in the service for eight months. I recognized my responsibility to symbolize my dedication by water immersion and I was very happy that I was among those baptized at the district assembly in Corner Brook. It gives me great joy now to help my family and others to break free from Babylon the Great and become part of the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW ZEALAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;2,727,148</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4,759 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 573</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The year has been rich with rewarding experiences. The apostle Paul said he recommended himself as God’s minister in many ways, including “by kindness.” (2 Cor. 6:4-6) Such kindness produced fine fruit in the following case. A Chinese, looking somewhat lost outside a bus station, was asked by one of Jehovah’s witnesses if he needed help. He had just arrived from Taiwan to spend ten weeks on behalf of his government studying New Zealand’s geothermal-steam electricpower project, but arrangements to meet him had failed in some way. He was invited home for a meal by the brother, and later, when local hotel accommodations proved unsatisfactory, it was arranged that he stay with the brother and his family. This man’s interest in the Kingdom message led to a study in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font11"> booklet conducted by the husband’s pioneer wife each morning. Then each night, as the brother and the man from Taiwan shared a hot mineral bath together, the Kingdom hope was further discussed, so when it came time to return to Taiwan, a firm foundation in the truth had been established. The Branch in Taiwan was advised of the man’s interest, and the week after his return the man wrote to say that his study was now being conducted by a missionary graduate of Gilead’s 43rd class. Kindness, coupled with follow-through when he returned to his own country, ensured that this prospective witness for Jehovah was “netted.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The opportunity to use the magazines may come in strange ways. On waking one morning, a congregation servant found policemen searching the grounds around his house. A youth who had burglarized nearby offices had been apprehended, and a search was being made for stolen property believed to have been secreted close by. Inviting the police sergeant in for a cup of tea, the brother used the occasion to draw attention to the article “Morals and Modern Youth” in the 1965 bound volume of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font11"> March 22 issue. The officer was so impressed that he had the young burglar and his father brought to the house, that they might both listen to the sound Bible counsel contained therein. The teen-ager confessed the location of the stolen goods, and he and his father were advised that they would do well to listen to Jehovah’s witnesses when future house-to-house visits were made. The police sergeant asked if he could borrow the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> volume and later, when returning the book, he asked for additional supplies of the magazine. The offending youth has fulfilled his punishment and, along with his family, shows a willingness to receive visits from the brothers as they engage in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A sister who for two months of the 1967 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">campaign had not succeeded in obtaining a subscription has reason to appreciate what a privilege it can be to share in a demonstration at the service meeting. Preparation and rehearsal for the demonstration trained her in the art of offering subscriptions so that from then on she had success. Soon afterward she obtained one subscription, then two, three, a double subscription, and so on until she had obtained ten for the final two months of the campaign. Further blessings now opened up for her, because, as a result of calling back on each placement, these ten subscriptions produced five home Bible studies, all of which are progressing well. In expressing grateful thanks to Jehovah for his organization, the sister now says: “If we apply the suggestions given, we can have much success in our ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">NICARAGUA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,783,491</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 907 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,966</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The work in Nicaragua has enjoyed relative freedom during the past service year. Despite the fact that a restless and tense atmosphere pervades the country, the “good news” sown in peace-loving hearts reaped an 11-percent increase. Our work was not affected by several days of fierce fighting that erupted in the capital, Managua, between the government and the opposition political party. Just a few weeks after our international assembly the Gran Hotel became the focal point of the outburst as rebel leaders took hostages and sought refuge inside. Machine-gun and rifle fire ripped into the building where, just a short time previously, our visiting brothers had been entering and leaving to attend the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A factor contributing to personal maturity has been the increase in family Bible studies. One brother even takes the daily text so seriously that he has invited his neighbors in the surrounding homes to enjoy it with him each morning. There are now from fifteen to twenty-four persons representing four other families who join in the twenty-minute discussion along with his family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We do not know where stray “sheep” may be hiding. How wise it is to speak to everyone as often suggested. One Four-Square Gospel minister was approached in the door-to-door work and a lively discussion followed. He was impressed with the publisher’s ability to give sermons on various themes. A </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines</span><span class="font11"> booklet was placed. Later he told the brother that he was using this booklet as a basis for his sermons in church. He became more interested and so did his members. Then one evening when the brother made another back-call on him he found him waiting with nine other adult members of the church. Later this minister renounced his position in the church, and when he left, the other nine left with him. Now four are publishers and all ten are attending the meetings and having personal Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">NIGERIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 55,620,268</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 46,085 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,207</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">More and worse troubles developed in Nigeria during the year, resulting in more stringent roadblocks and searches. Most times the brothers get through without difficulty as soon as they are identified as Jehovah’s witnesses. And, O how often we have been helped by having our Bibles and magazines along! “Stop! Get down! Unload everything!” demanded angry soldiers with fixed bayonets. By this time one soldier had pulled open the van door, and, seeing a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">magazine, demanded gruffly: “Who are you? From where? To where?” After we identified ourselves he asked: “Is this your ‘Armageddon’?” We assured him it was not, &quot;though these events do fulfill prophecies in the same chapter of the Bible that foretells the war of Armageddon. Armageddon will be worse, is fast approaching, will guarantee peace. We are preaching God’s kingdom as man’s only hope. When you’re off duty read in this </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> how you can escape that Armageddon trouble and And peace.” The lines of tension eased on the soldier’s face and he accepted the gift, saying: “We know you Jehovah’s witnesses can be trusted. Never mind [getting down to be searched]. Go on!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A father studied the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font11"> booklet several times with his family at home. After thus going through the booklet his twelve-year-old son felt he was well equipped to teach others. So at school he put his ten-minute rest period to good use each day by conducting a Bible study with his schoolmates. A curious teacher investigated what was going on in these get-togethers of the students during intermission and found himself getting really absorbed in the study conducted by the child. Not only has the teacher’s interest been aroused, but several students have become regular meeting attenders. Active in the regular door-to-door ministry too, the young publisher averaged five Bible studies per month for the past six months. Both father and child are very joyful over these results of regular family Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">That Jehovah blesses the willing effort of his Witnesses to expand the preaching work can be appreciated from this experience. Five years ago a regular pioneer determined to help a group of a few publishers some twenty-five miles away from his assignment, cycling this distance to and fro every Tuesday and Sunday. His relatives warned him that he would be killed either on the road or in the town, as they thought the town was dangerous. The pioneer wrote the Society showing his desire to go and live in the town, as he saw the need was great. The Society encouraged him to do so if he could arrange his affairs. His relatives opposed his move and made every effort to dissuade his wife from following him. The wife, however, stuck by the pioneer and they moved to the assignment. They were further strengthened by the encouragement given them by both the circuit servant and the other brothers in the congregation. After less than six months in his assignment he was appointed a special pioneer, and his wife has recently been appointed a special pioneer too. He says of the townspeople: “They are kind to us, and we receive gifts from them in appreciation of our work.” The chief of the town even assured him no one would trouble them either by day or by night. And the pubUshers he went to help? They have been helped to be clean morally and to be industrious both in their secular work and in the service of Jehovah, something that was a problem with them before. One sister told him: “As soon as I thought of going back, Jehovah used you to wake me up.” As a result of his fine work and Jehovah’s blessing, the small group of seven publishers has grown into a thriving congregation of forty-one publishers now, making known Jehovah’s name where it was not known before—all because a pioneer had pity for the few publishers and made a determined effort to help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">NIGER &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,870,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 130,455</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A good witness was given in this territory during the service year, not only by the special pioneers and the small band of publishers in the two cities, but also by the traders from the neighboring countries. The visit by the branch servant from Lagos was a great stimulus to the brothers and resulted in better organization for the future of the work in this territory. One of such blessings was the formation of the first congregation at Zinder. The brothers are grateful for this arrangement and also for the shipment of literature received following the visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Some who had lost contact with the organization were helped back to Christian association and service, as this experience shows: “On arriving at my assignment I set out searching for the sheeplike ones. At one door I introduced myself as one encouraging free Bible studies at the homes of the people and offered to demonstrate it if the elderly man would permit me. Without hesitation he invited me in and showed me a book and Bible he had obtained before leaving his country for Niger. As I examined the book, which happened to be </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True,’</span><span class="font11"> I saw a Publisher’s Record card and learned that he had begun associating with the brothers before moving from his country but had lost contact here. He made rapid progress in the study, and by the time we finished studying the book he realized it would require his return to his country to be able to put his marriage on a legal basis in order to be accepted for baptism.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">NORWAY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;3,770,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4,270 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 883</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The good increase in the Bible-study work is due to the publishers’ offering a free home Bible study at the initial call, and their use of the excellent Biblestudy aid </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.”</span><span class="font11"> The Kingdom Ministry School course that was arranged in different cities around the country has contributed a great deal to strengthening the congregation organization. The district assemblies also made a deep impression and encouraged the brothers to continue their faithful service. The following experiences emphasize that use of the direct approach to start home Bible studies has had good results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A brother talked to a man he met in the ministry about the prospects for the future according to the Bible. The man asked a series of questions, but instead of answering all of them at once the brother thought this might be a possibility for starting a study. He said: “Say, now, that someone gave you a bull to eat. Would you be able to eat the whole bull in one meal?” The man said that he, of course, would need many meals to do that. The brother said: &quot;Likewise with the Bible truth. We cannot digest the whole truth at once. We must take one subject at a time, and I will therefore offer you a free home Bible study without obligation.” The man gladly accepted. They have now been studying for several months, and he has attended the congregation’s meetings and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> circuit assembly and is planning to symbolize his dedication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses, being willing to teach people from the Bible, make the difference between true and false Christians obvious. A congregation servant writes in this regard: “A schoolteacher with whom I was conducting a study visited the minister of her church to withdraw from the church. The minister wanted to know why, and she answered: ‘Jehovah’s witnesses are offering all persons free home Bible studies. I have had such a study for several months now and it has given me a clear understanding of many Bible questions.’ She pointed out how the church had failed in this respect, for as far as she knew, no members of the church were conducting such studies. ‘No,’ said the minister, ‘but that can be arranged. I have a friend in the congregational council who can study with you. You just give me your telephone number, and I will call you later and make an appointment.’ This happened several months ago, and the minister has not called her yet. She has, of course, withdrawn from the church, and so have her husband and their four children. She is now a publisher and wants to be baptized at the next circuit assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A circuit servant wrote the following letter when he and three regular pioneers and eight vacation pioneers had worked an isolated territory in the northern part of the country, where the people in some places never had heard the Kingdom message: “ ‘Let down your nets for a catch,’ Jesus said, and the disciples enclosed so many fish that their nets began ripping apart. During our work in isolated territory this summer we experienced that this also can happen when we are fishing for men. At each of the seven public talks we arranged during two weeks, between thirty and forty persons attended, and after each meeting they asked many questions, indicating that they were hungering for the truth. At one talk two religious leaders showed up to ask us some questions. When those in attendance were encouraged to ask questions after the talk, all turned around and looked at these two, but they did not say a single word. Some others, however, asked questions for more than an hour. These religious leaders must have been tormented to hear a woman say: ‘I am so happy that at last there came someone who could answer our questions and help us understand the Bible.’ We offered all in attendance a free Bible study, and many accepted. We placed 1,041 magazines, 331 booklets and 838 books, and obtained 40 subscriptions in the territory. Although two of the pioneers remained to take care of the interested persons and conduct studies, it will certainly be difficult for them to get all these ‘fish’ ashore. Before I close I would like to mention that all the vacation pioneers were so much encouraged by this that they are planning to start out as regular pioneers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The following experience told by a special pioneer emphasizes the importance of calling back on persons whom we have promised to visit again: “One day when I was working from house to house I met an ardent evolutionist. I let him talk for a while, hoping that he would let me say something later. After having talked about his theories for about twenty minutes he still had much to say, so I brought the visit to an end and said I might call on him again a few days later. When I was working this territory again some days later, I recalled our talk and walked up to his place, although I was hoping he would not be at home as I thought there was no use talking to him. The house was all dark, and I breathed a sigh of relief and turned around and left. Having walked for a while, I began to think of how angels are supervising our work, and that I did not even ring the bell. What would the angels think of that? I went back to the house and rang the bell, and the man came out and said: ‘My wife and I were waiting for you. Won’t you come in?’ I thought he intended to tell me more about evolution, but I was mistaken. They did not mention it at all, but they had a lot of questions that they wanted me to answer from the Bible. They had just supported the evolutionary teaching because no one had been able to answer their Bible questions. I offered them a regular Bible study using </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font11"> and they gladly accepted. We have been studying regularly since then, and you can imagine how happy I was about making this back-call after all.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The climax to a year of excellent theocratic advancement was the “Disciple-making” District Assembly held in the capital city, Naha. An all-time peak of 429 persons attended the public meeting and 16 were baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A young high school girl who started to study progressed very rapidly. Soon her parents began to oppose her, stopping her from studying and from attending meetings. But she cautiously continued her studies and meetings without being seen by her parents. Then one day her whole family got together to offer incense to their ancestors. When she refused to take part, her father flew into a rage; he yelled and scolded her, even to the point of beating her. She quietly maintained her position, thinking to herself, “Even if he kills me I will not serve idols.” After this she was baptized at the first assembly. When her mother heard that she was baptized, she began to cry, saying that she had been deceived and now she would go to the nunnery, leaving her family and home. Then she explained to her mother that Christians are not commanded to become nuns, but that God’s will was different and she explained from the Bible all the good things God has in store for mankind. Relieved, her mother said: “Why did you not explain these things to me before? Then I would not have worried so much.” She is looking forward to becoming a special pioneer after graduation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Nothing occurred in the country during the past year to disturb the worship of the brothers. They have faithfully continued to witness to all who will hear. By far the greater number of individuals who hear the message from door to door and who receive literature are Muslims, but these have shown no response to the message. The seven individuals immersed during the year were from among nominal Christians. There were fewer publishers giving the witness than the previous year, but these continue to show a fine spirit of perseverance and patience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The decision to serve in a foreign country, or to serve at home is not always easy, but once made in favor of serving where the need is great it can prove to be a blessing. This proved true for a Japanese sister who accompanied her unbelieving parents to Pakistan. On arriving home one evening from a meeting, she met a Japanese couple and their niece, and they asked many questions about Jehovah’s witnesses. The uncle suggested that the sister study the Bible with his niece. However, she was not anxious to have a study, as she said that she had learned nothing from the Baptist church in Japan. However, she did agree to attend a meeting with the sister. The result of this was that a study was arranged to be held twice a week. Until she returned to Japan four months later the girl was regular in attending meetings, and countless times she expressed her appreciation for the Bible study. Back home she met with opposition from her family, friends, relatives and clergyman. She then made contact with the local congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses. It was with tears of joy that the sister received this further news from this partially crippled Japanese girl: “I had been tempted by Satan for a while, but now I realize what I should do. I have started preaching. I have now become used to walking for two and a half hours at a time, a thing I could never have done before.” She is really bubbling over with the truth and is considering baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Witnessing during lunch hours should not be overlooked, as Scriptural answers can often result in creating interest among fellow workers. Relating this, a sister says: “An ardent young Catholic working in my office began asking a lot of questions from which it was obvious that he was anxious to ‘save’ me from ‘false prophets.’ Gradually, as I gave Scriptural answers and asked a few questions about his religion, his interest was kindled. One day as I approached the Kingdom Hall, to my surprise I saw him standing on the corner. When I asked him where he was going, he said he was waiting for me so that he could attend the meeting. Now he is attending the meetings quite often and, if he misses, he will ask me at the office what the subject was about. Although at present fearful to have </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> home Bible study, he is interested to know all about how they are conducted. He now reads our literature, although forbidden by the priest to do so. Perhaps in time he will accept a Bible study and eventually become the one to be ‘saved.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">During the service year the brothers have been very busy, spending many hours in the service and keeping spiritually strong by regularly attending meetings. They were visited by the zone servant and twice by the circuit servant, and they very much appreciate these visits. Several brothers spent vacations with them at different times of the year, and all this has kept this small isolated group in personal touch with Jehovah’s people. Due to more liberal developments in the country, people feel freer to speak about religion, but regular service is still restricted to the foreign community. Even so, fine Christian conduct can impress others. When contacted in the service, a Mormon said to the publisher: “You are only one of Jehovah’s witnesses because you do not want to pay a tithe.” The publisher suggested that the man look up Scriptural references to prove his point, and he, in turn, would return with a Scriptural answer for his own belief. When he returned as promised, the man was not at home, so the list of Bible references was left with the wife. The publisher returned several times, but the Mormon had not prepared anything. Observing this, the servant of the house said to the publisher: “I cannot follow everything you say, but one thing I have surely noticed. Your religion is far better than his, because you are making serious efforts, whereas he is just laughing about you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">PANAMA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,328,700</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,495 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 889</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The biggest single happening in Panama was the international assembly at which we were privileged to be host to several hundred brothers from other lands. The brothers here are still talking about that assembly and the resulting interest it stirred up among many who learned about it, and quite a few Bible studies have been started due to the fine example set by our foreign brothers in talking to the local people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It certainly does not pay to decide that there is no one interested in a particular building just because you have been there many times with no results. A missionary writes in saying: “I had never found anyone interested in this building and really was not enthusiastic about working it again but went ahead to give the witness. Imagine my surprise at the response at one door when a young girl from Texas who was recently married and had been in Panama just a month brought out a Bible and the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font11"> book and said that her mother had given them to her with instructions to try to get in touch with Jehovah’s witnesses if she could on coming to Panama. Her parents had been studying about a year in Texas but she had never taken part; to the contrary, she had shown a hostile attitude toward the study, telling the Witness who studied with her parents that after she married she would decide what religion she would teach her children, but to count on the fact that they would not be Jehovah’s witnesses. Now in a strange land with no friends, and a husband whose job kept him away from her during long hours, things looked different and a study sounded good to her, in fact, ‘Why not twice a week?’ she asked. Since the Kingdom Hall was in the next block, she started coming to the meetings after the first study. Long, lonely hours, previously spent crying, were now used in studying about a new system of things. After two months she started out in field service and was soon placing forty to fifty magazines a month. In just ten months we studied all the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font11"> book, are finishing the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font11"> book, she has a Bible study of her own with another interested person, and now she expects to get baptized shortly at our circuit assembly and be a vacation pioneer for fifteen days before moving back to the States right afterward.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the year we have continued to have difficulty as school authorities have expelled some children of Witnesses because of their steadfast refusal to participate in patriotic ceremonies. In some of these cases the parents have been able to get the children into other schools where the teachers have a more understanding attitude, while in other instances the parents have had to work out a program of home instruction to give the young ones some education.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">During the year more cleaning up of the organization was necessary, with many more being disfellow-shiped for moral uncleanness. With the emphasis placed upon the need for a clean organization, we have found that those who have enjoyed the prospects of life in a new order but who had no intention of changing their lives to conform to Jehovah’s will have left the organization. This has resulted in a drop in the number of publishers; however, we are happy to report that in the majority of the congregations many new ones are now being added, and with Jehovah’s blessing we hope to see the work begin to move ahead in Papua as well as Manus Island, New Britain, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Recently a brother’s wife died while he was tending his garden. When he returned, worldly mourners had practically taken over his house. In a kind way he told them that he did not want any custom rituals performed because of his wife’s death. The brother’s father, a witch doctor, after touching the dead woman’s lips and uttering his own name and another witch doctor’s name, raised his arms to invoke the spirits in order to find out who was responsible for her death. At the onset of this outburst of demonism, the brother ordered his father to stop. He told him that he did not want him to do anything of that kind in his house. Another brother there at the time quoted Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10 and Revelation 21:8, showing the condition of the dead and the results of witchcraft. Slowly the old man’s trembling hands descended and no further attempt was made by him to invoke the spirits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another experience comes from the Gulf District of Papua. An overseer of a small congregation there knew for some time that his mother was demonized. He knew that she had a “lucky stone” through which the demons operated, and he had looked for this stone for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> long time. One day when his mother came from the coast to visit him he saw her basket lying on the floor. It was open and inside was the stone. He immediately took it and threw it into the river. His mother was very angry at first but later calmed down, and has since stopped having her demonized spells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Later a special pioneer came to live in the house, and he had some weird experiences that indicated to him that the demons were still very much interested in that house and its occupants. One day as he was sitting on a mat in the house, a red stone came floating in and glided across the mat in front of him. Knowing this to be demon inspired, he immediately took up the stone and placed it on a large post outside the house and proceeded to pound it into powder. That night a young boy in the house awoke to see something like a sheet appear in the doorway. He called the brothers, who realized that it was the demons acting up again. As soon as they got up, the sheetlike apparition disappeared. The next day they made a thorough search of the house and found an old garment belonging to the mother. After disposing of this, the brothers were no longer troubled by the demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">MANUS ISLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20,647</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Although there are only three families in the island’s one small congregation, the brothers have worked very hard during the year, and just as the service year ended they moved into their new Kingdom Hall. How pleased they are to have a very attractive concrete-block and steel building to which to invite interested persons'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For their first meeting in their new Kingdom Hall the brothers arranged for the district servant to show the film “God Cannot Lie.” How happy the eleven publishers were to see 115 persons file into the hall to enjoy this film!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW BRITAIN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;154,188</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">During the past service year a concentrated effort has been made to get the good news preached outside the main town area. It has been possible for the Society to get special pioneers established in two new areas a considerable distance from Rabaul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One special pioneer went with a vacation pioneer back to his home village. After about three weeks the Society received this report from the brother: “Many, many village people here want to study the Bible. We are finding many interested people. We are now teaching only two villages, but many more villages have been asking us to come and study with them, but we do not have time now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“The Catholic church sent one of its priests to see us the other day. He was very angry with us and told us not to teach these people about the Kingdom. He said that all these people belonged to the Catholic church. Then he asked the people to choose for themselves. The people from the two villages said: ‘We want to be Jehovah’s witnesses; we do not want to be Catholics!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“We are now studying with forty to fifty people, and we are only waiting now to get a good piece of land to build a Kingdom Hall. We are having some little difficulties about getting the ground, but I can see that the work in this area is going to get very big.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW GUINEA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,407,604</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Early in the year the brothers in Madang started organized magazine work in the local market. Soon one of the Lutheran missionaries stirred up a mob to drive the brothers out. The brothers withdrew the first week, but the next Saturday they came back to work there again. Once more the Lutheran missionary exhorted the people to assault the brothers. This time the brothers informed the police, who quieted the people down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the following weeks this person continued to follow the brothers around in their preaching work. He would either try to frighten the people so that they would not listen or try to get them to form a mob to chase the brothers away. This action of his did not pass unnoticed, and one week the local paper even wrote an article on the matter as well as publishing a picture showing the minister at his work of stirring the people up to mob action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Following this, the overseer of the local congregation wrote to the president of the Lutheran Church in New Guinea about this minister, asking that they take some action to control him. Their reply: “We of the Lutheran Church Lae are very much disturbed by the un-Christian tactics that are being employed by this member of our staff. Our vice-president is writing him a letter and informing him of our dissatisfaction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Evidently he took no more notice of this letter than of the overseer's trying to reason with him, for he was soon back using Lutheran teachers to try to bully the brothers into stopping their public preaching work. The overseer again went to the police, and he gives us this account of what happened: “The following Saturday the Chief of Police attended the market in plain clothes. He soon observed sufficient of the behaviour of the Lutheran bullies for him to order them off at once. One of the teachers actually ran off when he recognized him! We are now able to do magazine work anywhere in town without interference.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Toward the end of the service year the Society was able to rent a missionary home on New Ireland. The special pioneer couple working from this home report much interest. The Society has been in contact with interested persons here since 1960, and so when the special pioneer couple moved into the area they found a very fertile field for their preaching. A fine, strong group is being built up, with three publishers now reporting regularly. There are even some who have been ministers of Babylon the Great who are obeying the call to “get out of her” and who are desirous of taking up the work of proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom to others. One such person is a retired Methodist minister who lives some distance from the missionary home. The special pioneer who studies with him by mail writes: “The other morning his wife came to visit us for a study. She said her husband was preaching the good news up and down the road where they live. She said that he has already found several people who want to become Jehovah’s witnesses! So even though he does not have much knowledge yet, he is at least preparing the way for a future witness to be given.” The local Methodist missionary brought a lot of pressure on the Methodist woman who rented us the building we are using as a missionary home. You can imagine his horror at passing the home one day several months later and finding this man, one of his former ministers, assisting in caring for the grounds of the home and Kingdom Hall!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">SOLOMON ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;139,730</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">This service year it has been possible to get the special pioneers organized for the work we want them to do. In past years the Society has had to use them as overseers to look after the congregations here. Because of this a good number of the brothers had gotten the wrong idea of what a special pioneer was. They had the idea that they were paid ministers, and as a result of this attitude the overseers were left to do almost everything in the congregation themselves. But during this service year the Society has made a concerted effort to change this situation, and as </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> result we now have only one special pioneer who is serving as an overseer. What has been the result?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A very fine spirit is being developed among the servant bodies as they become aware of the fine work entrusted to them, and as they understand that this is a work they do because they love Jehovah and their brothers and not because they get paid for it. Much better support for the congregation activity has been seen as the publishers realize that the overseers are brothers with families and problems just like themselves. And the special pioneers? They are very happy to be able to get on with their work of opening up new areas and they have been enjoying some wonderful experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Two special pioneers were assigned to the New Georgia group of islands. As this is the center of the Methodist missions activity in these islands, the brothers have been hard pressed to be able to stick in their assignment. They were able to stay with a local family in the main government center and soon were preaching the good news with much success. This was too much for the local religious leaders, and soon they came storming up to the house where the brothers were living, bringing the village headman with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What was their complaint? “If you had come here just to live and work you could stay as long as you wanted, but we do not want you to stay if you are going to teach about the Bible!” The brothers went on to report: “When these men said this, we had a very good time talking to them about Matthew chapter 10, showing how Jesus and his disciples were doing the same type of work, going into new villages to find those who were interested in learning about Jehovah and his purposes. We also showed them Acts 5:26-39 and some of the people with them said: ‘Yes, they are right,’ but others were telling us to take our Bibles and go back to where we came from. Then the headman asked the man of the house whether he wanted Jehovah’s witnesses to stay and teach him. ‘Yes!’ came the answer. With that the headman turned to the religious leaders and said: ‘Did you hear that? I will not do anything, and if you want to do something about them, then you will have to go to the government yourselves.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">PARAGUAY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,030,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 586 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,464</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s provision of spiritual food “at the proper time” was certainly appreciated by a sister in the E--- congregation. Several years ago she had helped</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">a woman learn the truth; but this woman, after a period of zealous activity, went bad and had to be disfellowshiped for causing dissension and practicing spiritism. On being disfellowshiped she vowed: “Now you will see what kind of a spiritualist I am!” Shortly thereafter the sister who had originally helped her began to suffer abdominal pains. Medical attention was sought and her appendix was removed, but the pains continued and increased in intensity until one night the sister and her husband thought that she would die. The pains would come regularly every night at 10:30, and the sister, on closing her eyes, would have a mental picture of the disfellowshiped woman. Then through the mail came a wonderful provision from Jehovah in the form of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font11">article “Repelling the Attack of Wicked Spirits.” Could her sickness be the result of demonic activity as some of her superstitious neighbors had suggested, even counseling her to go to the local </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">curandero</span><span class="font11"> or herb doctor, who, in many cases, also dabbles in spiritism? On studying the article carefully with her husband and daughter, they began to check over her household items. Out went a set of dinner plates that the dis-fellowshiped woman had used for a time. No relief. Out went an attractive picture that had been a gift along with some long-forgotten wine in the pantry, but still the pain continued. After reviewing the article along with fervent prayer to Jehovah, a further search of the house turned up a board that was nailed to the cover of the well and that had come from the disfellowshiped person. Eliminating this last item brought instant relief. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> article was certainly for her “food at the proper time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The seed of truth sown on a right heart can bring about rapid results. For some years a man had been accepting the magazines from the publishers every time the territory was worked, and then two books were placed with him. Thereafter things began to happen quickly. He did not wait for a back-call to be made on him, but found the home of the nearest brother and came to him twice a week for a personal Bible study. After a month of studying he stopped smoking without anyone telling him that he should do so. Then he started to attend the congregation book study. Being observant, he saw the need to clean house religiously speaking and did so thoroughly, even to removing a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">santo</span><span class="font11"> (image) from a sealed water-filled globe that also contained flowers. Only when the flowers began to lose their colors did the wife discover that the image was missing. He was shown the importance of having his wife join him in the studies, and, on speaking to her, she agreed to do so. Toward the close of his third month of studying he started attending all the congregation meetings, and during the fourth month he enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School and gave his first talk. Also, during his fourth month he started out in the field ministry, and now, by the end of his fifth month of progress, he is conducting two of his own Bible studies. Not wanting to be left behind, his wife purchased her own book bag and goes out in the service with him. He hopes that his home can soon be used for a congregation book study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">PERU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 12,014,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A rich harvest has been gathered in Peru during the past twelve months. Jehovah’s people are most thankful to him for his rich blessing on their harvesting activities in this country. As we look back on this past service year and try to count our blessings we must join the psalmist David in declaring: ‘They have become more numerous than we can recount.’ (Ps. 40:5) Were we to try, the foremost blessing would have to be counted in two parts: the international assembly, with so many brothers from other lands to highlight the true international flavor of this blessed event, and then the anxiously awaited fulfillment of Brother Knorr’s promise of the release of the complete </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </span><span class="font11">in the Spanish language. These two things, more than any others, have spurred our brothers on to greater zeal in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The seeds of truth germinate and develop under varied and interesting circumstances. One sister, who has been serving for many years in Peru where the need is great, found that the seed she planted five years earlier finally could be harvested. Her secular work requires that she travel by taxi a lot, and she has always made it a habit to carry a few tracts or magazines in her handbag and take advantage of every opportunity to engage the different drivers in conversation about the blessings of God’s kingdom. Many taxi drivers, due to the nature of their work, are never at home when Jehovah’s witnesses call at their doors. The message struck a responsive chord in the heart of a driver one day. This sincere person could not understand why he had need of confessing his sinful course to one whose course was every bit as sinful or, perhaps, worse. As the taxi rapidly brought her to her destination, she hurriedly covered a few of the more important doctrinal differences between Bible truth and the traditions of false religion. The driver was happy to find his own thoughts reflected in much of what was said. All too soon the trip ended and the sister remarked about his interest and expressed her hope that they could meet again soon and continue their discussion. How she wished later that she had had time to get his name and address! But Lima is very large and taxi drivers are many, and as time went on she forgot the incident. One day, five years later, she got into another taxi and, after striking up a conversation, the driver recognized her as the same lady who had talked to him that day so long ago about God’s new system of things. During all this time the seed of truth lay dormant, though very much alive. A lively discussion ensued, terminating once again by their arrival at her destination. This time, however, the sister noted his name and address and arranged to make a return visit soon. When she called at the home, both the wife and the husband eagerly agreed to a Bible study. So full of appreciation for the truth were they that soon they were attending meetings and engaging in the preaching activity. Now father, mother and the four children are all active ministers, and their enthusiasm is spreading to other members of their family. How poignantly the need for being alert to note names and addresses of interested ones was brought home to the sister when the wife exclaimed one day recently: “If only you had been able to visit us soon after you talked to my husband that day five years ago! Imagine the blessings we could have enjoyed all this time!’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One day a zealous young Mormon appeared at the Society’s branch office in Lima. He had taken it upon himself to convert the one in charge of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. He arranged an interview to be held with some missionaries of the Mormon religion and the branch servant. The discussion ended with the Mormons’ being unable to prove their beliefs by the Highest Authority, Jehovah God, by means of His Word, and in total confusion they left. How did this affect the young man who had arranged the “conversion”? He is now actively engaged in the true harvest work, serving as a regular pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To what lengths will you go in order to attend a circuit assembly? Two young special pioneers, mindful of the importance of the assembly being held in a distant jungle town, journeyed over three hundred miles down a jungle river on a small motor launch to be with their Christian brothers. The trip, ordinarily of five days’ duration, took eleven days and was duly seasoned by almost every peril known to river travel: treacherous rapids, whirlpools, voracious insects and, yes, having the launch sink from under them! Undaunted, the brothers continued their journey and came through unscathed to enjoy a rich spiritual repast. They were determined not to ‘forsake the gathering of themselves together’ with their brothers, however distant, as Paul admonished. They were not too absorbed in their adventure to continue preaching, however, and were able to place twenty-five bound books with interested ones along the way.—Heb. 10:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">PHILIPPINE REPUBLIC Population: 34,000,000 Peak Publishers: 39,266 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 866</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the past service year more attention has been given to the internal organization to strengthen spirituality among the brothers. This was given impetus by the arrangement for circuit servants and overseers to spend more time aiding weaker and inactive ones. The reopened Kingdom Ministry School also contributed much to this work, and it is evident that Jehovah added his blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One congregation reported that in just six months ten persons were helped to become active again by applying the Society’s suggestions to study with those needing help. In addition they helped thirteen new ones to begin in service, resulting in an increase from thirty to fifty-three publishers! Another reported a jump from twenty to thirty-nine publishers in four months, mainly due to having aided sixteen formerly inactive ones to regain their zeal in service. Many other similar experiences could be related if space permitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Parents, do you feel at times that your child is too young to understand the truth? If so, you may benefit from this experience: An eight-year-old son of dedicated parents was assigned, along with his classmates, to prepare a poem for recitation in school. When his turn came, instead of reciting a poem, he gave a short talk that his parents had taught him entitled “The True God.” The teacher was so surprised that she asked him to repeat it three more times and then asked him to write every word on the blackboard. The entire class was then instructed to copy it in their notebooks. On hearing God’s name, the teacher commented that Jehovah and Jesus are the same, but the young publisher respectfully explained that this was not the case. The next day he brought copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> and now the teacher is on his magazine route. His classmates often ask him Bible questions. Truly children can be taught at a very early age, just as Samuel was.—1 Sam. 2:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A twenty-four-year-old brother in northern Luzon is an encouragement especially to those with a physical handicap. He is totally blind and yet has served as a regular pioneer for over three years. Not once in those three years has he missed his goal in hours and, in fact, he has averaged 160 hours and 47 back-calls a month since he began pioneering. He conducts seven Bible studies each week. He is helped by his pioneer sister and by other publishers when reading and studying, and when he is conducting Bible studies, his companion reads the questions for him. Of course, he has to work harder than others to gain knowledge, but the fact that two of those he studied with symbolized their dedication by baptism during this year shows that Jehovah is rewarding his efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One congregation found that vacation pioneering resulted in almost doubling its publishers in one year. In April 1966, when they had seventeen dedicated publishers, fourteen of them vacation pioneered. They started so many new studies during this month that during the next twelve months sixteen additional individuals were baptized, making thirty-three dedicated publishers. In April 1967, seeing such a blessing on vacation pioneer service, twenty-two of the thirty-three publishers took up the vacation pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The advantage of holding regular family studies can be seen in the case of a family with nine children. The dedicated parents arranged to have two studies each week with the family, one in a bound book and one in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> in preparation for the congregation study. This was held regularly, with all in the family taking part. The result is that within nine years five of the children have become dedicated servants of Jehovah, with three of them serving in the pioneer ranks. The other four are still under parental care and are being given the same training that has been so blessed by Jehovah. What a joy it is to make disciples of one’s own children!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We were thrilled this year to be able to send nine more brothers and sisters to Thailand and Indonesia as missionaries, and plans are under way to send more. It is a privilege to have a small share in expanding the Kingdom proclamation in this part of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">PORTUGAL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 9,470,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Early in the service year many brothers in Englishspeaking lands wrote letters to thousands of Portuguese professional people informing them of the shameful court trial and miscarriage of justice in sentencing to prison forty-nine members of Jehovah’s witnesses. These letters presented unusual opportunities to explain the Kingdom message. One brother who is a teacher in a vocational school was requested to be present at a special meeting of all teachers. At the outset the chairman mentioned he and others of the faculty had received personal letters from Witnesses in other lands along with a detailed report of the court trial. They were curious to know how these Witnesses in other lands obtained their names and addresses. One question led to another about the organization, its purposes and basic teachings of the Bible, and our brother reports that a splendid witness was given for nearly two hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">While in prison the brothers of the Feijo congregation enjoyed many experiences, one of which follows: Two rowdy men had fought and knifed each other, resulting in their imprisonment. Now bitter enemies, the two men showed hatred toward each other. It happened that our brothers from Feijo were condemned to serve time in the same prison. There one of these rowdy men heard the Kingdom message for the first time. Later our brother was transferred to another dormitory and unwittingly began witnessing to a prisoner who turned out to be the bitter enemy of the man who had shown much interest in the previous dormitory. The value of the ransom sacrifice was emphasized, along with explanations on putting on the new personality according to God’s will. One day several months later, to our brother’s surprise and joy, these two bitter enemies met in a hallway from the dining room and apologized to each other for their hot-headed actions and lack of self-control. Before the prison authorities these men made known their peaceful relations. As the two men came to agreement their change in attitude was noticed by all, and as a result many other opportunities were opened to give a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Adverse publicity can serve to awaken keen interest in the minds of truth seekers. A strongly prejudiced article was printed on Jehovah’s witnesses at the time of the Feijo trial. The newspaper also gave the name and address of the overseer who was imprisoned. The unexpected result was that an unbiased reader wrote the overseer and, in part, his most interesting letter says: “Those who foment such persecution against Jehovah’s witnesses only cause me to inquire more as to the reason. I compare your position with that of the persecution heaped upon Jesus and his apostles. If it would not be too much trouble, kindly answer this letter and send me any pamphlet you have for distribution. Also, if any of Jehovah’s witnesses live near me I would appreciate being able to contact them. From what I have read, I believe this to be the only true religion.” The man who wrote this letter lives a distance of 350 kilometers from the overseer. Information was forwarded to the nearest congregation to visit this man. Immediately a Bible study was started. It is a pleasure to say he is now regularly associating with us at congregation meetings and laying the groundwork for a personal dedication to do Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Braga, the religious capital of Catholic Portugal, was the scene of mob action during April and May. On three occasions crowds numbering over three hundred surrounded private homes where publishers were studying the Bible with interested people. In one of these incidents some of the crowd began throwing rocks and stones at the home, others began forcing the door while the mob yelled for the Witnesses to come out. No police protection was to be seen. When the owner of the home became visibly nervous at the growing rage of the mob, the sisters thought it best to leave before serious damage was done. Upon leaving they were accosted by the mob made up especially of female Catholics of all ages and some young boys. Insults and all manner of abusive talk were heaped upon these three Christian women. One of the Witnesses was a seventy-year-old sister who was called “a prostitute,” “an old witch,” and so forth. Judging her an easy mark, the mob singled out this elderly sister and tried to force her to kiss an image of Fatima. When she refused, some in the mob kicked her, others threw stones at her and the kerchief on her head was torn off. Two unknown men finally penetrated the crowd and escorted our sisters to safety. Only when they reached home did they have opportunity to see the black-and-blue marks on their bodies. Undaunted, they continue regularly to preach the good news in this territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">True Christians are known to be honest, and this in itself can focus attention on Jehovah’s people. A businessman recently introduced a brother to the owner of a textile store. Our brother was interested in purchasing a large quantity of merchandise and was told his order would be immediately filled on the condition a guarantor signed the necessary papers. At this point the businessman who had introduced our brother stated to the store owner: “I’d like to mention that my friend is one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and I must admit that when it comes to this matter of honesty, not even we who are Catholics in any way measure up to their standards.” Upon hearing this, the store owner immediately became more friendly. He mentioned he personally knows some Witnesses and greatly admires their faith and courage in the face of persecution. It so happens that his store is located on the very premises where there had previously been a Kingdom Hall until a police order closed it down. A friendly discussion about the Bible followed, and in conclusion the owner of the store told our brother he would gladly dispense with a guarantor since he knew the Witness must be faithful to his God, and “that obligation is the best security possible.” There appear to be many such symbolic “fish” in our national waters.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Since the flames of terrorism broke out in 1961, Jehovah’s people have been the target of constant persecution. Some faithful brothers imprisoned that year are still being held as slaves in penal colonies. Arbitrary police action has no limits. Two brothers known to the authorities were picked up in broad daylight while walking on the street caring for routine matters of life. They were turned over to an Administrative Board and, without any sort of trial, condemned to two years of forced labor. Both these brothers had previously served three-year prison terms. Once again, they are suffering for righteousness’ sake simply because they are Christian witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In February a small group of seven brothers met one evening in a private home to study the Bible. Shortly after, the home was completely surrounded by Public Security Police armed with rifles and machine guns. The Bible discussion was stopped, all religious literature including personal copies of the Bible was confiscated, and then the peaceful group was marched off to police headquarters for interrogation until 3 a.m. The chief of police concluded the incident by saying he had some “good advice” to offer the group, which was: “My advice is for all of you to stop this business of studying the Bible and use your time more wisely, like dedicating yourselves to subduing young girls. If you want to know anything about the Bible, then go to the priest who will give the right explanation.” They were released, with the threat of imprisonment the next time they are found together discussing the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One publisher who is completely isolated gets his field service reports through regularly. It is thrilling to read his letters and see his determination to serve Jehovah. Every Sunday this publisher spends five hours in field service. For the celebration of the Memorial he was most happy to gather together sixteen people!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">AZOKES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;348,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A publisher started a home Bible study with two Catholic women who regularly attended church. As the study progressed, the two ladies began missing more and more church services. The priest observed this strange change of events and decided to visit them to discover the reason. As the conversation developed, he learned they were studying the Bible with the Witnesses. When he was shown the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book and several booklets, he became furious. Completely losing self-control, he ripped up several booklets and seized other publications to take with him. The two ladies were severely tongue-lashed and told they were sinning in studying the Bible. Upon leaving the home, he threatened to tell the police if they dared continue to study the Bible. Such shameful conduct clearly helped these sheeplike women to identify the real shepherds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A man and his wife had been studying the Bible with a publisher for several months. During this time the local priest visited their home frequently, employing pressure tactics to stop the study. When his attempts were thwarted, he tried to connive with the owner of the building where the couple live. The landlord was encouraged to inspect this couple’s apartment at the very hour of the study and then threaten them with expulsion from the apartment if the study did not immediately stop. Once again there was no success, since the landlord refused to cooperate. In desperation the priest informed the International Police (secret police), and two agents visited the man and his wife, resorting to threats of imprisonment to frighten the couple. All this has been to no avail. How true are Jesus’ words: &quot;My sheep listen to my voice.” —John 10:27.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Life is easygoing on this group of ten islands situated off the African West Coast. Although the inhabitants are not swept up into the whirl of modern life with its changing philosophies and materialistic pursuits, the tight grip of tradition coupled with fear of man exercises full sway. The Catholic religion is professed by nearly all, but spiritism is the practised faith. This year a publisher from France visited her fleshly sister for the first time in over twenty-five years. Armed with the truth of God’s Word, she tactfully explained the source of “magical arts” to her sister. Politely she refused special delicacies prepared from blood. Before leaving the islands, she was rewarded with the pleasure of seeing her sister also refrain from eating blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The two interested persons reporting field service regularly were overjoyed with the addition of another symbolic fisherman to their ranks. During this year the two publishers for the first time were sent copies of the written review used in the Theocratic Ministry School. Their happiness with this provision was expressed in the following way: “We want to tell you that this method of Bible study by means of writing answers is most valuable and deeply appreciated. It is a great incentive to look up the answers, almost obligating us to open our Bibles and become familiar with each book of the Bible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">MADEIRA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">One day a group of men were discussing world conditions and who is responsible for this state of affairs when a Catholic priest happened to walk by. One man, pointing to the priest, commented: “They have great responsibility because they do not teach the truth of the Bible. They even attempt to hide God’s real name, Jehovah.” One of the group became very impressed, since he had never before heard God’s name. When he asked for more information, the man said he could not explain much but gave the address where Jehovah’s witnesses held meetings, saying: “They really know the Bible!” Grateful and even more curious, this man attended a public meeting shortly after. Arrangements were immediately made for a home Bible study. Progressing rapidly, he spoke about God’s purposes to his family. But the Kingdom message infuriated his Catholic family, and he was told he would have to attend mass or get out of the home. Courageously, he held fast to the truth in spite of opposition from the family. He later dedicated himself to Jehovah and this summer he had the privilege of attending his first assembly of Jehovah’s people. For the 1968 service year he has enrolled as a regular pioneer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">This service year has been a milestone for progress in Puerto Rico, Tortola and the Virgin Islands (U.S.A.). Right from the start of the year, with the thought in mind of the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly in January, the brothers worked with enthusiasm. The assembly itself made a great impact on the brothers. Not only the rich spiritual food provided, but the sight and companionship of so many thousands of their brothers from other lands brought much happiness to their hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Never should we miss an opportunity to preach the good news of the Kingdom. A publisher writes: “I was in need of a new automobile since mine was in bad condition, and I heard of a man who had some for sale. I went to him and we talked about cars and prices, and so forth, and then he asked me what my work was. I took this opportunity to tell him about an important work I was doing, ‘Kingdom work.’ We talked until 11 p.m., and by then the man said he would sell me a car under whatever conditions I wished to name. We made arrangements to finish the deal the next day but had to travel to another town to make up the papers. I took this opportunity to continue my witness. He subscribed for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> and a study was arranged, with his wife and children joining in. After a short while he offered his home for meeting purposes if needed and then took us to see the mayor in order to obtain some land on which to build </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> Kingdom Hall. He also said he would help pay for the construction. He is now progressing rapidly in the truth, and it is fine to see him and all his family at the Kingdom Hall. So never pass by an opportunity to tell out the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Sometimes we might think that a person is so entrenched in his religion that it does not do much good talking to him, but this is not always so. In the territory of two special pioneers lived a man who was a very strong Roman Catholic, and each time the pioneers tried to witness to him they were met with strong objections, although at times there were questions. It was finally suggested that a Bible study would answer his questions, and he said that this would be a good idea but that only the Catholic Bible could be used. This was agreed upon and a study was started. The man very carefully would compare all the Scripture texts word for word to see if the Bible said the same thing and then he was satisfied. Little by little he came out of Babylon the Great. After a while it was suggested that he visit the Kingdom Hall, and he was told that if he brought his wife and seven children that would be just fine. Then came the time for him to begin in the ministry. However, his wife was by now also progressing in the truth, and when she saw that her husband and two children were going out and she was left with the smaller ones, she began to complain and asked: “How can I serve Jehovah like this?” So arrangements were made for the family to take turns going out in God’s service, and now all are progressing in the truth. The husband has two Bible studies, the wife one, and the ones with whom they study are attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall. At the present time they are discussing the time when they will be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is good to invite all those who might be present in the house to join in a home Bible study. A study was conducted with a group of fleshly sisters, and on one occasion the boyfriend of one of the girls was present, so an invitation was extended to him to join the study. It turned out that this young man belonged to an Evangelical church, but he liked to drink heavily and drive his automobile at great speeds. However, he began to study and after his marriage the two continued progressing in the truth. His mother, who was a strong member of the Evangelical Church, marveled at the change in her son. She could see that the truth had done for her son what the church could not do. Soon the young couple were baptized and began cultivating the seed of truth among their families. In one family studies were started with the young man’s mother, an aunt and two sisters. In the other family three sisters, two sisters-in-law and three other members of the family study. So this invitation to join in a Bible study resulted in two dedicated servants of Jehovah and twelve more studying to become “men of good will.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A study was started with a lady who at once began to receive opposition from her husband. However, the study continued even though the husband said she would have to leave the house if she studied anymore. One day the married daughter was at the home at the time of the study, and she was sad because that very next day she was going to start proceedings to divorce her husband. Upon hearing that the Bible gives much counsel on marriage, she asked for help. The publisher sat down right then and there and studied half of the chapter on marriage in the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God.</span><span class="font11"> It was suggested that she consider the rest of the chapter alone and then make her decision. She finished the chapter and decided not to divorce her husband. However, she wanted to continue her study and did so in spite of much opposition from her husband. One day he told her that he hated the publisher that came every week, to which she replied: “Do you know that the only reason I am living with you now is because of the counsel from the Bible that that lady gave me?” This evidently surprised her husband, because now he even takes her to the congregation book study. And her father, who had told his wife that she would have to leave home if she continued studying, had a change of heart. He had seen the great change in his daughter in her attitude toward her husband and that she no longer fought him. The father stopped worshiping images and became anxious that his wife together with his married daughter should go out from house to house teaching others. Now the whole family is studying with the publisher, and some even conduct their own Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">TORTOLA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8,619</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The great event of the year for the publishers was the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly in Puerto Rico. At the time there were seventeen publishers in the congregation, but as a result of strong emphasis and encouragement given by the mature brothers twenty-five finally attended the assembly. This proved to be a great blessing. A former minister of the Church of God came with his wife. They said that they had never before seen such a large crowd displaying such love, unity and cooperation. This fully convinced this former minister and his wife, and they have taken a firm hold of the truth and vigorously defend it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">An elderly lady was a strong pillar and also a preacher in the local Methodist church, but she had been studying for around sixteen years with Jehovah’s witnesses. Finally she made up her mind for the truth and left false religion. After her baptism she became very zealous, spending up to thirty-eight hours a month in the service. She made a special effort to talk to most of the ministers and leaders in the Methodist Church to give them a good witness and to tell them her reason for leaving the church. Many other members have come to her to learn the reason why. Her daughter was a Sunday-school teacher but is now zealous for the truth. Her son on another island is also dedicated. This has had a great effect on the people in the islands and as a result the Bible studies jumped from five to sixteen a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">VIRGIN ISLANDS (U.S.) Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The past year has seen good progress on the three islands that compose this group. The brothers have</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">matured well and the work is becoming more effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Young folks can give an effective witness, as this short experience shows: A publisher and an eightyear-old boy were in the house-to-house work with magazines. The publisher gave the short sermon and offered the magazines, but the householder said he did not wish to have any. So the publisher, seeing no apparent interest, walked away from the house, not noticing that the young boy had remained and was still talking to the man. When the publisher went back to see what was happening, he found that the little boy’s sermon had caused the man to change his mind and he had now taken the magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is good to see young ones rejecting the call of materialism and taking up Jehovah’s service. In June of 1967 a young sister graduated from high school as the valedictorian of her class and, therefore, much pressure was put on her to attend college. But to everyone that asked she expressed her desire to be a missionary, and when asked what school she would attend she would reply: “I hope to attend the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.” She sent in her application to start pioneering, and during the first 10 days of pioneering started 11 home Bible studies, placed 169 magazines and 9 books. She radiates happiness and says, “I never realized that pioneering would be so joyous.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The good work of Jehovah’s people is noticed by many people. One day an officer of the penal system stopped a Witness on the street and asked if he would visit the prisoners in the prison. This was done, and in forty minutes two Bible studies were started. One man who had been convicted for murder showed great interest and asked that someone visit his Spanishspeaking common-law wife and her daughter. This was done, and a study was started with them. Now this man wishes to legalize his marriage and is looking forward to freedom either during this system of things or, if not, then in the new system when he can serve Jehovah fully.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Jehovah has richly blessed the arrangement of the Kingdom Ministry School. A brother who received his invitation to attend writes in appreciation: “Ever since I first heard about the school it has been something that I’ve thought about a great deal. Now it seems that Jehovah is once again displaying his great goodness and undeserved kindness to me—that he wants me to be a better minister, to be better able to help my brothers—yet I do not deserve his consideration.” This same fine attitude was displayed by this brother after he had shared with his wife in the vacation pioneer ministry. His letter continues: “For years we had wanted to vacation pioneer together, but due to Scriptural obligations in the home it was not possible until last April. When at last we could vacation pioneer, I just cannot describe the joy it brought us! No other occupation can give a person such satisfaction as doing the work Jehovah wants us to do. And when you can do this work with your wife, well, it just has to be experienced to understand the contentment and peace of mind it brings. I certainly plan to vacation pioneer again with my wife just as soon as I possibly can.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One overseer who vacation pioneered found that while engaged in this activity he could be of great assistance to the brothers in the congregation. He explains how he was able to do this: “As an overseer, I have enjoyed this April from the aspect of rendering personal assistance to many brothers in such a practical way, training them in the ministry. What I found helpful was to spend a whole morning with just one publisher, vacation pioneer or regular pioneer, starting off with early morning magazine activity, either street work, shop to shop or car to car. This set a fine start for the day. We then went to the rendezvous for service and spent perhaps two hours in the door-to-door ministry, then the remainder of the morning in the back-call and Bible study work. Sharing in these features of the work and having the time really to observe their presentations, I was able to offer some useful suggestions, and I, too, learned many fine ways of presenting the ‘good news.’ I encourage all servants and overseers to consider these special months as a practical way to ‘shepherd the flock’ under your care.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Do you feel discouraged sometimes when people do not seem to listen in the field ministry? Do you think that nothing is being accomplished? That our activity does not go unnoticed is well demonstrated by this experience related by one of our circuit servants. In one part of his territory there had been an earth tremor, which he described as being accompanied by a low, heavy, rumbling noise. This tremor covered a wide area, shaking a number of small towns and villages, causing people to run from their homes and places of business trembling in fear. What effect did all this have on the attitude of these people toward those engaged in the field ministry? The circuit servant tells us: “After the end of this heavy tremor the territory became soft and ready for seeds. Many people started to hunt for the Witnesses. About midday one woman carrying a Bible came to my house dressed in her Methodist church uniform. She was very eager, saying: ‘Please tell me what you think this is. I know that you Witnesses know the Bible better than any other religion does.’ A very good discussion followed. I placed a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font11"> booklet with her, and a study was started on the sign of the ‘last days.’ When we met for the witness work in the afternoon, all the publishers related similar experiences. Some even had more than ten people at a time who wanted to know about the earth tremor.” No, our work does not go unnoticed. When in trouble people know whom to look for to get comfort from God’s Word.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Senegal is known as a fisherman’s paradise, and the Ministry of Tourism spares no effort to attract avid fishermen to its rich fishing waters. Jehovah’s witnesses, as qualified “fishermen,” have found the symbolic “waters” of Senegal very rich for symbolic fishing as well. More and more men are being ‘caught alive’ and then, in turn, have been trained to let down their own nets for a catch. Of course, collecting the “good fish” into the congregational “vessels” requires wisdom and spiritual discernment. Nevertheless, this has been done successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Although the Kingdom message is relatively new in Senegal, the Society’s publications have done a marvelous work in quickly getting people acquainted with the Word of life, its Author and his purposes. The value of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazines is widely recognized by people in many different positions. Office clerks sometimes can be seen reading </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> when their work slacks off. When a brother went into the telegraph office one night to send a cablegram, he found the telegrapher busy reading an old issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">After an encouraging conversation, the brother was pleased to give the man a fresh copy of our magazine, and entered a new subscription as well. So well is the message of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> appreciated, that it is not unusual for people to stop a publisher on the street and ask for the latest copy. Further indicating the esteem in which the magazine is held is the following letter received by the branch office: “Gentlemen: My </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> subscription expires the end of August. I beg you to come to my office and renew my subscription.” No wonder the relatively small group of publishers in Senegal placed 43,571 magazines and entered more than 1,000 new subscriptions I</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many honest people have made rapid progress after hearing the truth. A young man who had been studying a year was invited into the preaching work, and, to the surprise of the missionary studying with him, he asked: “Why did you wait so long to invite me?” A short while later, when the subject of dedication was being discussed, he expressed the desire to be baptized. When the missionary studying with him seemed surprised that he should want to be baptized after such a short time of studying the Bible, he replied: “You should have known that I wanted to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses when I bought this briefcase.” After his baptism, he continued to be a regular publisher and meeting attender, and at the time of writing he has sent in an application for vacation pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">That people change with time and circumstances is shown by the following experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A man who was previously opposed surprised two ministers one day by inviting them to come inside. He said that his newborn son had died recently and that this had caused him to consider the Bible more seriously. A discussion followed and arrangements were made for a Bible study. This man is now attending and participating in the congregation meetings, witnessing to all he meets, and he speaks of the day when he and his family will be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">GAMBIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;316,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The most outstanding event during the service year was the projection of the Society’s new film “God Cannot Lie” at the hall of the British Council in Bathurst, which had been kindly offered free of charge. The brothers were delighted to welcome 153 persons who viewed the film with rapt attention. Many were the favorable comments at the end of the projection and some Bible studies were arranged on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The need for Kingdom publishers always to be ready to offer the printed message on any occasion, even when the householder does not show much interest and only accepts the offer out of politeness, is emphasized by the following experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Someone obtained the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book without intending to read it. The book found its way into the hands of a news vendor, who, in turn, sold it to a sincere Cath-olio man who he knew was interested in religious literature. It happened that this sincere Catholic had suffered many bitter disappointments from his church and had stopped attending for two years, although he never could dismiss the idea of a personal God from his mind. He continued visiting various religious bodies in order to And the true worshipers of God. As he explained later, as soon as he began reading the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book he realized that the publishers of this book had the truth. The next time a Witness was working the territory the man greeted him, book in hand, with the question: “Are you from the organization that publishes this book?” Needless to say, the publisher took full advantage of this excellent opportunity, giving a thorough witness and answering dozens of Bible questions in his effort to quench the thirst of this sincere truth seeker. A Bible was placed and a subscription was obtained and arrangements were made for a regular home Bible study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A special pioneer in Senegal was mindful of the spiritually weak condition of his cousin who lives in Bamako, and asked the circuit servant to give him special attention during his visit to that city. As a result of the visit, the young man’s failing faith was strengthened and he once again became a regular meeting attender and very enthusiastic in the ministry. This regained spirituality helped him to make the proper decision when, a few months later, he was faced with a difficult choice for a young athlete such as he, as he holds a gold medal in sports for his country. The opportunity presented to him was to take a free trip to Moscow for special training in sports during his vacation time. At the same time his cousin invited him to come to Senegal and join him in the ministry as a vacation pioneer. After counting the cost and considering the advantages of both opportunities, he was wise enough to All in an application for vacation pioneer service and come to Senegal. Was he sorry for missing the attractive trip to a world capital? Here is what he says in a letter addressed to the Branch at the close of his two months of vacation pioneering: “I would like to express my gratitude to our heavenly Father, Jehovah God, who protects us in every circumstance by his undeserved kindness. Really, brothers, I do not know how to express the joy that I And in the vacation pioneer service. Yes, my heart is Ailed with happiness in helping my fellowmen to learn what Jehovah has in store for humanity and thus developing my own knowledge as well. So, to feel always this joy that comes to the ones walking with Jehovah, I think I will continue in the pioneer service after arranging my affairs in Bamako.” Did he have good reasons to express himself in this way? Yes, indeed! He had the joy of spending 293 hours in the field ministry during the two months he was pioneering, placing 56 bound books, 75 booklets and 673 magazines, while making 56 return visits and conducting 3 Bible studies, not to mention the blessed and enjoyable companionship that he had with his cousin, a mature special pioneer. Once more the wisdom behind the words of Paul has been emphasized: “Bodily training is beneficial for a little; but godly devotion is beneficial for all things.” —1 Tim. 4:8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">In spite of the most unfavorable conditions in this sunburned desert territory, the two isolated sisters continued steadfastly doing their best in some incidental witnessing, devoting 168 hours in the ministry. Due to the secular work of their husbands, both families left the country at the end of May. However, another publisher moved to the capital of Mauritania, Nouakchott, due to his secular work, and it was a pleasure to receive his report during August. Since this publisher is a brother, he will be able to do more, due to the mentality of this country, but, again, he will stay only for two months. Conditions continue to be unfavorable for any organized work in this isolated territory, and only Jehovah can change the situation if it is his will that a further witness be given in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">SIERRA LEONE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,180,623</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Of course, the highlight of the year for Jehovah’s people in Sierra Leone was the completion of the new branch office, Kingdom Hall and missionary home in Freetown. The dedication was held just before the close of the service year, with nearly 300 persons touring the building and attending the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We are glad to report that, according to the circuit assembly reports just received before the service year ended, in relation to the total publishers in Sierra Leone, 173 percent are now attending the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study, 129 percent the service meeting, 124 percent the Theocratic Ministry School, and 163 percent the congregation book studies. What a fine potential for increase in the months ahead!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Witnessing to one’s fellow employees can produce good results. One brother who was much respected in his office for honesty and truthfulness was able to assist two of his fellow workers and their wives into the truth. Apparently both couples were regularly having family quarrels before embracing Bible principles. Now they started enjoying their marriages, but the neighbors began to say that Jehovah’s witnesses have “medicine” they offer to husbands and wives having trouble in order for them to live in peace. But the couples explained the so-called “medicine” was really the Bible and its principles concerning marriage. This has inspired </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> third couple now to start solving their marriage problems, and they now have started to attend the congregation meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Distances and handicaps are no insurmountable obstacles when the love of the truth is strong in the heart of a brother. One aged and blind man who was formerly a persecutor of the brothers had his eyes opened by a brother upon hearing a sermon including Isaiah 35:5 read to him. Taking the truth seriously, he started to attend meetings, walking to the Kingdom Hall, which was seventeen miles distant. He soon became a publisher, and at the time of the recent circuit servant’s visit his report showed an average of 47.8 hours a month in Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One preacher in one of the false religions accepted the truth as presented by the brothers and soon started preaching his newfound understanding of God’s Word in his church, condemning polygamy, among other things practiced in his congregation. Soon great confusion developed, and he was stopped from preaching in the false religious institution. He soon left his former associates and joined the great chorus of praisers of Jehovah and encouraged others to do the same. Although he was threatened from every quarter, including his family, his zeal was not dampened. His strong stand for the truth has caused many people in a number of villages where he formerly preached false doctrines to make exhaustive inquiries as to what prompted him to change his religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF GUINEA Population: 2,500,000 Peak Publishers: 89 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 28,090</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It has been a very unsettled year for the brothers in Guinea. Most of the brothers in the capital at Conakry moved to other countries because of economic and other pressures brought to bear on them. Because of conditions there, the activities of the brothers have been greatly restricted. Early in the year one special pioneer in the capital was imprisoned for five months without charge, and only after exhaustive efforts were made in his behalf was he released, being expelled from the country. However, his stay in prison was not fruitless, for, though under restriction, his zeal enabled him to conduct several home Bible studies regularly. One intelligent young man with whom he studied in prison accepted the truth and dedicated his life to Jehovah. When his own release came, this young man took the step of baptism, and during the latter part of the service year enrolled as a vacation pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There are not so many restrictions in the isolated villages, and the public talks stir up tremendous interest. After a special pioneer had concluded his public talk, one man stood up and summed it up for the audience this way: “My friends, this is just like an old fat cow that cannot live long and cannot bear any calves as compared with a very young calf, healthy and strong, with every prospect that a very young calf should have of bearing other calves and her young ones bearing also. So these two animals are put before us to choose which we would like to have. The big fat old cow is our world today that is not fulfilling its promises to its inhabitants and none of its societies are doing any better, but we are told it will soon pass away. But the young little calf will live long and bear man many more calves. These are like the new order that this man has been telling us about. So let us make our choice. As from today, I have chosen the young little calf, though it will take time and hardship to bring it up.” At this he held his hand up with the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book in it and then sat down. All in attendance joined in applause.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Much good work has been accomplished in the field, and during the year we moved into a new branch home, from which place the work in Malaysia is directed too. A highlight of the year was the enjoyable “Disciplemaking” District Assembly. One brother commented: “I have never before been instructed in such a pleasant and yet impressive way as I was during those dramas. They were excellent.” We still hear brothers making quotations from the different dramas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We feel sure that there is much work to do in the “fishing” industry here, and that Jehovah is directing honest-hearted ones to his organization. This was impressed on one of our brothers who had this experience: A young married woman was contacted by the Witnesses in a neighboring territory, but before getting to learn very much, the family was suddenly transferred to Singapore, due to the husband’s work. After about two weeks the wife felt that she should try to contact the Witnesses, but she did not know where to begin. Being a religious woman, she turned to God in prayer and asked him please to help her. The very next morning a brother called at her home, and excitedly she told him: “You know, last night I prayed to God to send his servants to come and help me, and this morning, here you are! </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font11"> am so very happy.” She readily subscribed for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">magazines, and a home Bible study is in progress. This woman’s appreciation for Jehovah and his people is growing fast. She has attended several meetings, even commenting at the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study. She has begun to talk the truth to her friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Doing things the Bible’s way pays off in the long run. A young disciple explained that he started to read the King James Version of the Bible because his schoolteacher had told him that his knowledge of English would be incomplete if he had not read the Bible. His non-Christian parents did not mind. Then a Witness called at his home and offered to study the Bible with him free of charge. There would be no better or cheaper way to improve his English, he thought. He accepted the offer. His parents did not mind this either. However, when they discerned that the Witness was there on no English-teaching mission, they began to discourage his visits. He says: “The Witness showed me in the Bible that a Christian must have endurance and continued study is necessary. So I decided to test </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font11"> endurance and avoided him for several weeks. But he kept coming and proved his point about endurance. I kept studying although my parents objected. I got the new book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font11"> and was startled to learn of the nearness of the end of this old system. That settled it for me. English language took a step backward, and the Kingdom service came to the fore. In fact, when I heard of the “Disciple-making” assembly, I decided to symbolize my dedication. Being nineteen years old and under parental control, I thought it honest to discuss this with my parents. They were greatly disturbed. They took away my study books. I recovered them and studied more fervently right up till midnight. My parents thought I had gone insane. One morning they asked me to accompany them to a doctor. I obeyed, and the doctor turned out to be a psychiatrist at the mental hospital. I followed the Bible principle and did not rebel against my parents, but I attended the sessions arranged. Instead of the psychiatrist cross-examining me, I was giving him a good witness. Finally he told me that my faith was remarkable and then assured my parents that there was no cause for alarm, for I was far from being insane. My parents were relieved at this and were also glad to know that as a Christian disciple I would be required to follow the Bible’s principles regarding relationship between child and parents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">MALAYSIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 8,967,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A special pioneer related this experience at a recent assembly: “When traveling to conventions I found one of the problems to cope with is tiredness and boredom. For this year’s trip to Singapore I found a way to make the one-day journey quite interesting—witness on the way. The night before, I had made plans and preparations by getting my books and bag ready. Territory? Yes, I had a nice piece of territory, somewhat unassigned. There would be no not-at-homes and so I was assured of a successful day. In fact, the day after, those people would not be there. How so? I was going to witness on the train. The next morning, fifteen minutes after the train pulled out of the station, I took my witnessing bag and began working from one end of the train to the other. Eventually I covered the whole train, from the third-class carriages through to the first-class carriage. I met many very friendly but lonesome people who were happy to have someone to talk with. It took me several hours to cover this long, narrow piece of moving territory, with everybody at home. The immediate results? Many Bible sermons, three bound books and thirty-one booklets. I found the entire period most refreshing and stimulating, and the trip was a most pleasant one. Time spent in incidental witnessing was certainly worth while.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A sister had been studying with a family for a long time; in fact, too long, she thought. They had come to an occasional meeting but did not seem to show much appreciation. The sister decided to stop the study. She explained in a kind yet serious manner that she had passed on as much knowledge as she could and that now it was up to the individual to choose whether to come to the Kingdom Hall or not. The sister attended an assembly, and on returning and attending the first meeting thereafter, who should be there but the woman with whom she studied. She began to come regularly. Then the brother in whose home the congregation book study was held had to move out of town, and this left the group without a place to meet. The woman who had studied so long was approached and she was very willing to offer her home. She discussed it with her husband and he was agreeable, in fact, they were pleased to be able to do something that would advance the work. Jesus was right when he said that “there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUTH AFRICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 18,298,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The branch office for much of the territoiy located in southern Africa is located in Elandsfontein, Transvaal, in the Republic of South Africa. The Society has a very fine printing plant there, and each month they publish the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> magazine in twelve different African languages and the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazine in three languages. During the year they had the privilege of printing 2,967,050 copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font11"> 159,000 more copies than were required the preceding year. They also produced 94,105 booklets, and these were printed in a number of languages used in that part of the world. The branch office in South Africa looks after the work in Ascension Island, Botswana, Lesotho, St. Helena, South-West Africa and Swaziland. Set out below are some of the interesting experiences enjoyed in all this territory by Kingdom publishers. The first experiences have to do with the Republic of South Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Being prompt in giving attention to sheeplike ones has Jehovah’s blessing. A dedicated couple were advised by the branch office of an interested woman who had just moved into their neighbourhood from Britain. That very evening a call was made and a study started with the young woman and her husband. Nine months later this woman was immersed. Her zeal and enthusiasm were irrepressible, and she witnessed to all with whom she came in contact. One day she witnessed to a salesman who called at the door and followed this up by starting a Bible study with him and his wife. The following week this young salesman and his wife began attending meetings and have not missed since. Within a matter of weeks they were sharing in the service, and were immersed shortly at a circuit assembly. Now a lady with whom this new couple are studying is attending meetings. All this because of appreciating the importance of following up interest promptly in the first instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When the householder does not take literature on the first call, this does not always mean there is no sincere interest in Bible truth. Realizing this, a publisher, after such a call on a young couple, made a return visit the following Sunday. On this occasion it came to light that the couple had a copy of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font11"> and had previously studied with Jehovah’s witnesses, and they agreed to study again as long as “no one told them what to do in their own home.” The publisher tactfully continued the study without attempting to push them along. He made a point of highlighting features from the congregation meetings without a direct invitation to attend. Soon the husband asked: “Are not all people allowed to come to your meetings?” It was not long before both husband and wife were regularly attending meetings with their children and then sharing in the field service. The wife’s two brothers attended one or two of the studies with their fiancees, and this was sufficient for the elder brother to decide not to get married “in church” but to have one of Jehovah’s witnesses give the wedding talk. Thereafter this couple began to have their own home Bible study, and they are now sharing in the field service also. The first couple by this time were baptized. In addition, the wife’s mother and an uncle, who had both once associated with Jehovah’s people but had grown cold, were revived. Now her father, who was previously opposed, has suggested selling his farm so he can move into the city, where he too can associate and attend meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Young and old alike can be used by Jehovah to make known his purposes and attract sheeplike ones to the truth. The nine-year-old daughter of dedicated parents asked her mother one day for two </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News” </span><span class="font11">booklets to take with her to school. The next day she arrived home, her face beaming, and told her mother that the father of the two children with whom she placed the booklets would be bringing the children that afternoon for a Bible study. And sure enough he came, and the study was started. The young girl conducted the study herself, and she has conducted it regularly now for the past five months, sometimes at her parents’ home, sometimes at the home of the children. After the third study she told her mother that she was now opening and closing the study with prayer. The mother of the children has been most impressed by the way this young publisher has conducted the study, and now the way is opening up for a Bible study with her and her husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Concern for true worship in the face of hardship such as sickness is observed by others and draws honest-hearted ones to associate with God’s people. A circuit servant, confined to a tuberculosis hospital, writes: “I thought this would be the first time in sixteen years that I would miss attending the Memorial. But why not have it right here in the hospital? So I asked the nearest congregation to supply me with the bread and wine. Not having an outline for the talk at hand, I prepared a talk using the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Make Sure’</span><span class="font11"> book under the heading ‘The Lord’s Evening Meal.’ We were two brothers in the hospital along with a newly interested person. Saturday morning we began to invite the people in the hospital who would come, to attend the Memorial that evening. The matron of the hospital allowed us to use the beautiful hospital hall and supplied us with flowers for decoration. I asked the staff nurse whether I could have my own personal clothes to wear for the occasion rather than the clothes provided by the hospital. Although I was still weak, I found strength to stand to deliver my talk that evening. We were thrilled to see forty-three in attendance, with much interest being aroused.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Ascension is a small island in the middle of the Atlantic with but a few hundred inhabitants. The nearest congregation is about 700 miles away on the island of St. Helena. To find oneself on such an island as the only Christian witness of Jehovah was the challenge facing a sister who arrived with her husband, who had been assigned to the island in connection with his secular work. She soon found joy in being able to start a Bible study and has found other interested persons. She took the opportunity also of witnessing to the Catholic priest, and, at the conclusion of the discussion, he had to say that “Jehovah’s witnesses have a very good knowledge of the Bible.” So the “good news” is being preached even in this small, seldom-visited island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">BOTSWANA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;543,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 187 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,904</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During the past twelve months this country became independent under the name Botswana, instead of Bechuanaland. A new capital city was built, and, to serve the interests of Witnesses and other interested persons who would undoubtedly move in, special pioneers were assigned there. Very quickly a large group was organized for study and service. One woman who welcomed the message and a Bible study in her home illustrated the interest of many. At the conclusion of her regular Bible study, she started to ask many questions of the visiting district servant. Since her questions were mostly answered in the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lief’</span><span class="font11"> and since she could read English, it was suggested that she obtain a copy. She said she would like the book but had no money. However, the next day she made a special visit to the district servant and offered a scarce 5/-d piece that she had treasured. She said: “But I value the answers to my Bible questions more than money, so I have decided to take the book.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In spite of a drop in the number of publishers in the last two years or so, due to many being removed from the publisher ranks because of failure to register their marriages, the work in Botswana is getting more firmly established month by month. This is seen in the desire by some congregations to build permanent Kingdom Halls. The local brothers did not know how to go about constructing a building larger than their locally made huts, using local material that they could afford, so brothers in South Africa helped out by designing a Kingdom Hall using local materials but introducing superior building standards to provide a permanent structure. A congregation, on seeing these plans, became so enthusiastic that they began planning to gather materials to build a hall for themselves. It is hoped that others will follow suit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Our brothers in Lesotho (previously, Basutoland) really appreciate the need not to neglect the assembling of themselves together. Lesotho is literally </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font11">land of mountains, and when the time came for two circuit assemblies at the end of May and the beginning of June, the country was blanketed with snow. One isolated group lay right at the other side of the country from one of the assemblies. Traveling to the assembly meant either a several-hundred-mile detour by road or the shorter route by footpath right through the mountains—more than eighty miles! Would any make it from that group for the assembly? On Friday morning how encouraging it was to see the special pioneer along with a newly dedicated brother who wished to symbolize his dedication by water baptism at the assembly! They had made the journey through the mountains and snow on foot. They had witnessed to all whom they met along the route and were looking forward to doing the same on the return journey. To get to the other circuit assembly, a sister, six months pregnant, walked twenty-five miles through the mountains and snow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Here is an unusual way of continuing a Bible study in the face of opposition: An interested woman’s husband forbade her to have a sister call on her to study the Bible or even to go to the home of the sister to study there. Yet the study continued underground, or, rather, under rocks! The sisters wrote out questions on paper and placed them under a rock near the interested woman’s home. The interested person collected the questions, supplied the answers and deposited them under the same rock. And so the study continues.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Witnessing to the same people year after year on a small island is a real test of faith and endurance, and it certainly is a joy to see how the publishers on St. Helena have kept on in the ministry, with joy and appreciation for their privileges of service. True, a few have fallen into inactivity, but the decrease this past year has been due to families’ leaving the island for economic reasons to seek employment elsewhere. The two small congregations on the island were united to form one larger congregation, thus providing better servant leadership for the brothers. This was much appreciated, as the following comment shows: “Meetings are better, more enjoyable and upbuilding, with more participation. This will help build stronger faith in the brothers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A brother who was leaving the island had a Bible study with a man who had ten children. One or two of the children would sit in from time to time but not regularly. Since the publisher to whom the study was being turned over could not call every week, the man was encouraged to conduct the study with the children himself when the publisher could not call. He agreed, and one evening when the publisher called late for the study, he found the whole family around the table busy enjoying the Bible study. This man has been able to get one of his former workmates to attend the study. Now, strengthened by this experience in teaching his family, he has also enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School and is giving fine talks with real conviction and is looking forward to enlarging his privileges of service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Here in South-West Africa there is much work yet to be done. That there are sheeplike ones thirsting for the truth in this land and willing to respond to it is shown by the following experience. A young woman received a letter from her mother in the Republic of South Africa. She had just begun to study with Jehovah’s witnesses and asked the daughter to contact them also, since ‘they were the only people who could help her to understand the Bible.’ The daughter immediately phoned one of the sisters and arranged for a study, at the same time arranging for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> friend to join in. The friend, being self-conscious and shy, held back. So, after her very first study, the young interested woman began her own Bible study with her friend to teach her the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A young sister, eleven years of age, regularly and zealously shares in street magazine activity, with outstanding results. Recently the circuit servant was working in a town a few hundred miles away when he was warmly welcomed by a man who asked for a subscription and expressed his appreciation for the magazines. He explained that he had got acquainted with the magazines through this young sister who had witnessed to him when he was visiting the town where she lived.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A brother who served faithfully for many years in Swaziland as a circuit servant was faced with a problem. During those years his family had increased, but he was anxious to keep on in circuit work. While attending the first class of the new Kingdom Ministry School at Bethel he heard the matter of family responsibility fully discussed. As he left to return to his assignment, expressions such as “the family comes first,” “the family needs a father’s care, spiritually as well as physically,” rang in his ears. He was honest with himself. “My family needs me, and right now they are not getting the attention they should have,” he reasoned. The thought of leaving the circuit work saddened him, but after prayerful thought he could see it was the only right thing to do. His right desire was indeed rewarded. Some months later he wrote to the Society: “I wish to thank the Society for helping me to take on my family responsibilities more fully. It is quite a job to train a wife and children spiritually as well as to provide physically. But what a blessing it is to me to see my sons and daughters progressing, helping me in the field service as a ‘small congregation’! It is so true what the Bible says: ‘Look! Sons are an inheritance from Jehovah.’ But for this to be true, the children need daily attention and training by a father who is a servant of Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">SPAIN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;31,089,200</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A fresh outlook in regard to non-Catholic religions has been taking root in Spain during the past year, and the relaxed atmosphere prevailing among many government officials in regard to our Christian ministerial activity has allowed Jehovah’s witnesses to realize more fully their aim in this system of things of “leading a calm and quiet life with full godly devotion and seriousness.” Much interest has been stimulated on the subject of religious liberty due to the publicity given to a law passed by Spain’s legislative body on June 28, the purpose of which is to ‘regulate the exercise of the civil right in freedom of religious matters.’ Because of the law’s newness and apparent ambiguity in certain declarations, much speculation exists as to how it will be interpreted and applied. Nevertheless, the Spanish populace, for the most part, already thinks of religious freedom as an established fact, which has made it even easier to strike up conversations on the subject of religion. For example, at the place of work of one Witness, a conversation arose among the workers regarding the many religions in existence, with each one claiming that his was the true one. A brother took advantage of the situation by explaining that the Bible is the only true measuring rod for judging all religious doctrine, and he then introduced the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font11"> as an aid to Bible study. One of the workers found that the book was so beneficial that he asked for three more copies to place with other acquaintances who also wanted answers to their Bible questions. Now home Bible studies are being conducted with several of these interested persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The new law regarding religious freedom specifically declares that ministers of non-Catholic religions will not be exempt from military service (as are Catholic priests). This means that no solution is yet forthcoming for the sixty-four ministers of Jehovah’s witnesses who are presently imprisoned because of their conscientious refusal to participate in the activities of bellicose organizations, and who are thus perpetually denied their freedom according to the laws presently in force. However, even in their prison confines, they are not only able to give a fine witness to those who would not otherwise be in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> position to hear the Kingdom message, but their Christian conduct also gives mute testimony to onlookers. At one prison the director asked the one in charge of the carpenter shop why it was that he always requested that one of Jehovah’s witnesses be in charge of the equipment storage room. The reply: “The Witnesses are the only reliable and honest persons in the prison. They don’t fight with others or gamble, nor do they sneak liquor into the prison against the regulations. If you would give me the choice between twenty prisoners who are carpenters and twenty Witnesses who know nothing about carpentry, I would choose the Witnesses, for with just a little instruction they would be doing better and more work than the others!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Andorra is a semiautonomous republic perched high in the eastern Pyrenees, with joint sovereignty being shared between the French and Spanish governments, the latter by means of the Roman Catholic bishop of Urgel. Long hours of secular work and transportation problems to and from the various small villages in order to attend meetings regularly are among the obstacles faced by Andorrans who desire to share fully in theocratic activities. And to make the necessary arrangements to travel to another </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">country in </span><span class="font11">order to attend Christian assemblies requires additional planning and effort. How pleasing it was, then, to learn that, with the exception of a sister about to give birth, the entire group was able to attend the Spanish “Disciple-making” District Assembly held in France. One Bible student was at first not able to obtain the permission of her husband to attend the assembly, for he did not share her point of view in regard to the truths she was learning. However, one of the things the Bible teaches is that, in such a case, the head of the family may often be won without a word through the subjection, chaste conduct and deep respect of his wife. So after months of perseverance and full confidence in Jehovah, what a pleasant surprise it was not only to win the husband’s permission to attend, but to have him kindly agree to accompany her and the children to and from the assembly. Special efforts were also put forth to bring a total of twenty-nine together for the annual Memorial celebration, causing the hearts of all to rejoice; and efforts are continuing to be made to help these and others take a firm stand on the side of the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Due to the adversity following the death of the father of three small girls, the mother decided to send the oldest of the children to be raised and educated by other relatives. Years later the mother and the two younger daughters dedicated their lives to Jehovah after a careful study of the Bible conducted with them in their home. But by this time the eldest daughter had received a good education and was serving as a teacher at a well-known elementary school operated by nuns, and her different background caused her violently to reject the Kingdom message presented to her by her family. Sometime later the two younger daughters made arrangements to attend one of the Society’s conventions in another country, and they asked their older sister to stay with their mother during their absence. What better opportunity could there be to examine closely her sisters’ library of religious books in private, in order to demonstrate to them how far they had strayed from the true faith! But rather than finding errors and contradictions, her personal examination of the Bible literature showed their beliefs to be solidly founded Biblically, while several tenets that she had previously accepted as true were completely shattered. After long meditation, the schoolteacher humbly decided to ask for a home Bible study upon the return of her sisters. And in spite of difficulties with relatives and the loss of her work at the school, this sincere woman dedicated her life to Jehovah last December.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Many of our faithful brothers have worked hard, and in spite of the decrease in publishers, we put in more hours, placed more magazines, made more back-calls and conducted more home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Sometimes fear of what others may think can hold one back from making a decision to serve Jehovah. That was the case with some of the rulers in Jesus’ day. (John 12:42, 43) But do you have the courage to serve Jehovah in spite of any position you may hold? A special pioneer met a woman who took two magazines. An appointment was made to visit her again when her husband would be home. Although her husband had told her that he would drive Jehovah’s witnesses away, he listened attentively to the message. After a few calls he recognized the voice of the Fine Shepherd. He withdrew from three Friendly Society Orders, renounced his membership in a political party and the local Boy Scouts and refused to retain the chairmanship of the local labor union. In spite of much opposition from his wife, who never thought he would take the message seriously, he attended the district assembly for all five days. His wife traveled to the assembly in order to cause a commotion there. When he went out in the service she sometimes threw water at him and tore his clothes to pieces. She has tried everything possible to discourage him from associating with God’s people. After several months the attitude of his wife became more tolerant, and now she attends the meetings of the local congregation. His uncompromising stand for true worship has given this brother many blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Solomon wrote that even a child can make himself recognized, as to whether his activity is pure and upright. (Prov. 20:11) And sometimes young children have to make firm decisions to serve Jehovah. A sister was studying with a girl thirteen years of age. She made good progress, attended meetings and began to publish. But her parents are steeped in demonism. Her fleshly sister got sick, and it was claimed that an evil spirit caused the illness. The whole family, including this young girl, were to go to a witch doctor to appease this evil spirit. However, the young girl refused to go along and told her parents that she would obey Jehovah rather than men. As a result her parents put her out of the house. Now, although she has lost her fleshly parents, she has received “many times more” and has the prospect of everlasting life. —Matt. 19:27-30.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A lady did not feel satisfied in the Pentecostal congregation as their teachings did not agree with what she had read in the Scriptures, and she expressed herself accordingly. They told her she ought to go to Jehovah’s witnesses, who shared those erroneous views. Finally they threw her out. Sometime thereafter two Witnesses called, but she felt off balance and did not dare to let them in. W’hen they kept coming, she finally got enough courage to receive them, opened her heart and told her story. After the visit she was so anxious for them to return that she looked for them every day. Now she enjoys fellowship in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The value of a helpful attitude is shown in the case of a man who had heard that there were Witnesses employed at the same factory where he worked but did not know who they were. One day his car got out of order. He regretted this very much because he had to take his wife on an important visit out of town, and all the repair shops were too busy because of the coming weekend. One of our brothers, however, heard of this, and, without telling the man, used an off hour to check the car and get it in running order. Then, when the man came by, he addressed him, just asking that he take out his key and try to start the car. The man obeyed, and when the car turned out to be all right, he looked the brother straight in the face and said: “You must be one of those Jehovah’s witnesses, aren’t you?” Then followed a discussion about the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Two sisters gave out handbills in the street when walking to a back-call. A foreigner who could speak English gave his address. He turned out to be Greek, teaching languages at a high school. He likes the Bible truth but said that he hated religion, especially the Catholic one. Before he went to Sweden he had prayed to God, however, that he might find in this foreign country a religion in which he could believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The family study arrangement has been stressed, so at one circuit assembly the brother who conducted the part about the value of this illustrated his point by asking his boy, who is fourteen years old, to tell what they were doing at home and how they liked it. The boy said they liked it very much and always attended. “All of you?” asked the father. “No, the oldest one has a family of his own and conducts such a study with them. The oldest sister cannot attend because she is a missionary in Madagascar, the next brother is a special pioneer in the town of Trelleborg and the next sister is a special pioneer in Kiruna. But my youngest sister and I always attend!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The past service year has been greatly blessed by our heavenly Father. Three peaks were achieved in the number of home Bible studies, and we hope that many sincere persons may be helped to become disciples. It was also the first time that more than 10,000 persons attended the Memorial service. Another richly blessed feature was the Kingdom Ministry School, which we held here in the Berne Bethel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The publishers often have good success in their service among the foreign workers who have come into Switzerland to earn more money, as the following experience demonstrates: A sister met a Turkishspeaking man. As he only knew a little German, she tried to get her message over to him with the aid of a dictionary. A week later when the sister called at the house with a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> in Turkish, she found that the man was seriously ill and had been taken to a hospital. It was even more difficult to converse with his wife, as she understood still less German, and yet a subscription for the Turkish </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> was taken. The sister continued to make short visits and took along the newest issues of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> until the mailman began to deliver the subscription issues. In the meantime the man wrote a letter from the hospital to the Society in Brooklyn, saying among other things: “Sometime ago one of Jehovah’s witnesses visited me and gave me </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> in Turkish. I have carefully examined the contents of this magazine and see that people can be morally built up thereby and made into better people. It is my wish to learn more of this truth so that I too may become a witness of Jehovah. I admit that I am a man of many weaknesses, but I have a good heart. I want to walk in the way that leads to life. Please do not forget me; help me, please. I shall be very grateful to you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This letter finally reached the overseer in the nearest congregation and immediately he went to the hospital to visit the man, and there and then began a home Bible study with him. Later a Turkish-speaking brother was found and he now continues the study. These people are making good progress and attend the congregation meetings regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Physical disability is not always a disadvantage. A young sister who, as result of a serious illness, is now almost completely blind told us on a tape recording how she masters her situation: “People come to ask how I am getting on. They are most astonished to see that I am content and happy, and then I have an excellent opportunity to explain the reason for my contentment, and I can tell them of our wonderful hope. Of course, it is hard that I cannot read the Bible and the magazines anymore myself, and I point this out to the people who visit me. Most of them immediately respond by asking me if there is anything they could read to me. So I show them an article in a magazine and ask them kindly to read it to me, and this gives me a further opportunity to bring my visitors into contact with the truth. My oculist is also very surprised to find me so cheerful, and then I can always tell him something of the coming paradise restored and my hope of receiving my eyesight back again. I may say my blindness even has advantages. My husband, who is not in the truth, often reads to me out of the Bible in the evenings now. He takes me to the meetings too, and stays now and again to listen to a talk himself.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Publishers from neighboring Swiss congregations are endeavoring to assist the faithful little group of publishers in Liechtenstein. A special pioneer who worked in Liechtenstein for a time gave an address to a brother of a neighboring congregation when he left. The brother made the return visit and reports the following: “When I called on this man it seemed strange to me that he was expecting me. But the reason became clear when I learned that he had had contact with the demons. Without further ado we started to discuss this subject. Taking the Bible, which he as an active Catholic respected, I explained to him that there are not good and bad spirits seeking to get into contact with human creatures in this way. It was not difficult to show this man what the Bible says about the demons and their origin. Later on he told me that he had only ventured into this field out of curiosity, but then to his dismay he found he could hardly tear himself free from the influence of the demons. He often had to fight hard, and his wife was filled with anxiety and many nights could not sleep. A Bible study was begun immediately. The whole business with the demons soon stopped, and both were happy that the truth had made them free. They attend the meetings now and are seriously considering dedication and baptism.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The faithful brothers in Taiwan who ‘considered it all joy when they met with various trials’ over the past six years since uncleanness came to light and was cleaned out of God’s organization in Taiwan have found deep satisfaction in the past two years as they have seen a number who had been led away from the organization at that time returning to the organization. Three groups that had completely separated now report that, following adequate instruction in the basic teachings, some sixty-three have qualified to share in the ministry again. (Jas. 1:2, 3) Some who had to be disfellowshiped for opposing the work have been allowed to come back into the organization. Additionally there have been a number of new ones associating as a result of the missionaries’ diligent work among the Chinese, and the results of both of these forms of productive ministry almost offset the drop caused by disfellowshipment and disassociation of some fiftyeight during the year to maintain the cleanness of the congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Illustrating the results of the continued efforts of the Branch and the local circuit servants to teach and train the Amis brothers is the following experience related by an Amis circuit servant: “During a visit to an isolated group an older brother who had recently learned to read the new Amis writing told me he was extremely discouraged because he had been asked a question about a basic doctrine and had been unable to answer it, with the result that he had been ridiculed for going preaching when he could not answer questions. When I asked him if he had read the Amis </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font11"> booklet, he said, ‘Yes, but I can’t explain what it says.’ I encouraged him to use it to study with his family, and he would learn to explain the Bible doctrines. A study was arranged, and he regularly taught his family from the booklet. On a later visit this brother came back from field service elated with his experience that day. He had met a seminary student of his own tribe who took issue on the trinity doctrine. This time the brother was able to use the things he had learned from teaching his family and to overcome the objections on this and other doctrinal matters. He was overjoyed with the provision of this first Amis Bible-study aid and the encouragement and help to use it to teach his family, as this enabled him really to understand how to express the truth himself instead of being a ‘silent’ publisher.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A man had been searching for the right religion for fourteen years but could not get satisfied. He would listen to sermons and then ask the clergyman one question: “At Romans 10 it says that only those who make public declaration with their mouths will be saved. That means that only you and none of the rest of us qualify for salvation. What about the rest of us?” He could never get a satisfactory answer. Finally he came across copies of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and discovered that those distributing them belonged to an organization of preachers. He is now a regular meeting attender and has started to make public declaration himself so that he may gain salvation. What power in two magazines, and how lovingly Jehovah locates his sheeplike ones!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">THAILAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 31,800,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">For a number of years there was no increase in Thailand, even though the brothers worked hard in the field and many books and magazines were being placed. During those years we took comfort in the scripture found at Ecclesiastes 11:1: “Send out your bread upon the surface of the waters, for in the course of many days you will find it again.” We kept on sending out spiritual bread upon the waters of humanity here in Thailand and this past service year we have had some returns. Twenty-four new ministers were baptized during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The highlight of the year was the “Disciple-making” District Assembly in August in our branch building in Bangkok. For the benefit of the missionaries from Laos and Vietnam and a number of local foreigners who do not understand Thai, the whole program was given in Thai and English simultaneously, in Thai in our Kingdom Hall and in English in the room that normally serves as the office. We were delighted to have an average of 300 in attendance for all sessions and a peak of 351 for the public talk. Seventeen got baptized at this assembly, among them a man from away down south toward Malaya who used to study with a missionary many years ago. After the missionary was transferred this man kept on reading the Thai </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and was regularly visited by the circuit servant. His appreciation for what he learned moved him to speak about it to others and, when reporting was explained to him, he began to send in his isolated publisher report and has never missed a month since. He was so happy to be able to attend this assembly and to get baptized. Truly, the Lord’s “sheep” listen to his voice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One result of our sending out our “bread upon the surface of the waters” that was manifest this year was that a greater number of individuals wrote to the branch office for additional literature than in any previous year and quite a number of good Bible studies were started when back-calls were made on those persons. One of those who wrote was a Buddhist monk who had received a magazine from a missionary two years ago. When he found the magazine among his books he read it again and realized that it was the truth. When the back-call was made he readily took the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book, and a study was started right away. After the study of the first chapter he confessed to believe in God the Creator and told the publisher that he had been a monk for ten years but had never learned about God. Soon he accepted the invitation to attend lectures at the Kingdom Hall, and he stays for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> study too. Now he has started sharing with others the knowledge he receives. He attended many sessions of our assembly and says that his understanding about God is getting clearer and clearer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One sister who is a schoolteacher also has </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> family for whom to care, but that does not keep her from being a productive minister. Since her heart is filled with the good things she learns in her personal study and at the meetings, she speaks to her students at every opportunity about the truth. She is so successful in arousing interest that up to ten students use their lunch hour almost every day to study the Bible with her, and on holidays when there is no school they come to her house and discuss the Bible all day long. Five of her students were among those that got baptized this year. Most of them had to overcome family opposition but they have taken a firm stand for the truth and are zealous in sharing it with others from house to house.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">Our brothers in Cambodia are holding fast to the truth and encourage each other to stand firm in the faith. They appreciate very much the regular visits made by representatives of the Society to build them up and help them feel closely united with the brothers in other parts of the earth. They were pleased to have the circuit servant with them for the Memorial celebration. They ask their brothers in other parts of the earth to remember them in their prayers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The greatest blessing that we enjoyed in Laos in the 1967 service year was to receive four new missionaries from Gilead School. Having served in Quebec, Canada, and Eire, they fit right into the missionary work here. After just three weeks of strenuous language study, they could read the daily text from the Laotian Bible. Those of us here are very thankful to Jehovah for answering our prayers for further assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Another reason for joy was the appointment of a Laotian brother to the special pioneer work. He is spearheading the work in a little town about two hundred miles south of the capital, Vientiane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The following experience shows that the Bible can attract persons of any faith. A missionary had the opportunity to present ideas from Jehovah’s Word to a young Buddhist girl who would listen to what the Witness had to say but almost invariably responded, “The Buddhist religion teaches the same thing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">She did not consent to a Bible study, but as time went on the sister was surprised to hear expressions from her that were obviously thoughts from God’s Word but that the girl thought she had gained from her Lao Buddhist heritage. The sister could see that the girl had a deep love for righteousness, so she cultivated a friendship with her that proved to be mutually beneficial, as she was able gradually to impart a knowledge of the truth and in return learn from this young Buddhist more of the customs and attitudes of the Lao people. Eventually the sister had to move to another part of Laos. Two years elapsed, and then this young Buddhist moved to the same town and the discussions were resumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But now this young Lao was more receptive to the truth. Because righteousness appealed to her, the Bible’s righteous principles were stressed as well as the high moral standard that already exists within the society of those who have learned about Jehovah and have individually made a dedication to serve Him. When the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazine arrived containing the article “A Father Talks to His Sons,” the sister showed it to her and discussed the practical value of the education based on the Bible and that is dispensed by Jehovah’s organization. She was very impressed with the fact that people could learn to lead good lives and get along well with one another. This seems to have been a turning point in her life, for she soon started to attend meetings regularly as well as having a personal Bible study. She is now zealously telling others about the precious knowledge she is learning. She often expresses gratitude for having come in contact with the truth and is now talking of someday symbolizing her dedication to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">VIETNAM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;16,973,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">The publishers and missionaries have worked hard in Vietnam, and now fruitage is beginning to be seen. Many meetings are now attended by as many as fifteen men and seven women who are studying and making good progress. Four of these are now publishers and three were baptized during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One brother placed two magazines with one of the above men but forgot about him, thinking he was not really interested. In a few days the man wrote a letter to the local congregation requesting baptism. His reasons were: “(1) Your belief revives in me the joy of living despite this troubled world. (2) This religion serves as a guide to my conduct, helps me distinguish good from bad and helps me to acquire new virtues.” In conclusion, he wrote: “I swear in the name of Jehovah to keep his religion, to remain faithful and obedient all of my life.” After this the brother made the back-call, and now the man is making splendid progress, giving good comments at the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower </span><span class="font11">study. Yes, it is important that we follow up all interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">People are still coming out of demonism, and one twenty-five-year-old woman who speaks six different languages is a good example of this. Coming from a family of witches, this woman regularly visited fortunetellers and heard voices at night when she tried to sleep. When a study was first started with her, she was contemplating suicide due to personal troubles. She refused to use Jehovah’s name. But in order to get rid of the voices at night, she was told to stop going to the fortune-tellers and to pray fervently to Jehovah through Christ Jesus, even using Jehovah’s name out loud. At first she did this somewhat reluctantly. But, much to her surprise, when she used Jehovah’s name audibly, the voices immediately stopped. In just a few days the voices stopped completely. Now she is making such splendid progress that she recently remarked: “Now my goal in life is to serve with Jehovah’s witnesses in a foreign field just as you are doing.” And, by the way, she very happily uses Jehovah’s name all the time now. She is convinced that he is the true God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">This service year was a marked one for Jehovah’s witnesses in Togoland. A new branch office was established in Lome, the capital city. There was a steady increase of publishers and good progress in all features of the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One brother often neglected meetings. When meeting time came he would feign sickness. If he heard that the circuit servant was to visit the congregation, he would arrange to be away. The congregation servant, other brothers, and even his wife warned him, but he never listened. During one visit of the circuit servant, all went to the meeting on Tuesday night, but the brother said he was sick. After all the brothers had left for the Kingdom Hall, he went to a worldly friend’s home to visit. What a surprise when the police surrounded the house and all there were arrested and taken to the police station, where the police began to beat them! But one of the soldiers knew the Witness, so he brought him outside and allowed him to go. He left for his home with great fear. Since then this brother never makes excuses not to attend meetings. He is now spiritually strong and he enrolled as a vacation pioneer. He found that meetings are a great safeguard to Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On Magazine Day two publishers went from house to house. It was very hard to place magazines, because it was the day of independence and all were saying, “Freedom, freedom.&quot; A Witness told his companion that the direct approach on such a day of celebration would be best. So they explained that complete freedom is coming soon from Jehovah. As a result they placed nineteen magazines in a short time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">TRINIDAD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;935,959</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,986 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 471</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The response to invitations to engage in vacation pioneer activity was most thrilling and encouraging. Every month but one saw more vacation pioneers reporting than last year. April had a substantially larger number this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Arousing interest in the next study is vital to successful and productive Bible studies. Here is how one publisher does this: “I placed a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font11"> booklet with a woman and asked: ‘Do you know what the first thing God created was?’ Her answers were only guesses. I told her that on my return I would discuss that subject from the booklet I had placed with her. The next week when I returned I explained to her how God created Jesus Christ, his Son, first. She was well pleased with the explanation. To keep up her interest for the next call, I asked her: ‘Do you think you can see a soul?’ She looked at me wonderingly, so I told her I would discuss that subject on my next visit. From, then on I always leave her with questions to hold her interest in the weekly Bible study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Those who truly grope for Jehovah find him and also find strength from him to overcome any problems that stand in the way of serving him with a good conscience. For some time a young woman studied the Bible with a pioneer sister and showed much interest. She began attending meetings regularly. When the congregation was making arrangements to get sound equipment to play the new records for singing in the Kingdom Hall, she contributed a substantial sum toward the expense. She was willing to share in the service but was living with a man to whom she was not married. Determined to let nothing stop her from starting as a publisher in April, she moved from her home with the man and began living alone. In April she was able to get 21 subscriptions and place 184 magazines. The man told her he was willing to marry her in the future, some months away. She held firm against such an arrangement, so he agreed to be married at once so that they could live together as a properly married couple and she could continue as a publisher. Now he attends meetings some of the time and wants to have a study as soon as he finishes building his house. Meantime, the new publisher has been baptized and looks forward to being a vacation pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Is your house-to-house service limited because of many home obligations? Why not do as this sister did? She states: “With Jehovah’s help I make my home part of the field and preach and teach at every opportunity. In this territory I have had success. During an epidemic some years ago I was vacation pioneering. My whole family became ill. I had all the household duties to care for. But how about my hours? Well, I asked a relative to assist me in the home and I preached to her and taught her every day. I started a study in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font11"> book. When she realized God has a name, she was so happy that she started telling her acquaintances. When we were halfway through the book, she saw the need to straighten out her life, as she was anxious to go with me on Bible studies. Within eighteen months she was baptized and started going in the service every day. In six months’ time she was a vacation pioneer, in two years a regular pioneer; then she married a special pioneer and now is serving well as a special pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Publishers and especially servants have been encouraged to make the circuit servant’s visit a time of special service. In a small rural congregation the overseer sets an example in this matter. During the whole week he rises at about 4 a.m., takes care of his job of highway maintenance and returns home about 8 a.m. He then gets ready for service. Since he has the only car in the congregation, he picks up the scattered publishers and all spend the day in the service. He sets this pattern each day that the circuit servant serves the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Sometimes inactive ones live in a congregation where it is difficult to get a publisher to call and study with them. Should they be neglected because of such circumstances? Not in the opinion of this circuit servant. His wife relates: “We met a family that was inactive, and my husband suggested that I begin a study with the eldest child by correspondence. Each time I wrote I always sent a letter of encouragement, though some brothers told me I was wasting time with that family. Jehovah has blessed the effort, however, as the mother is now studying with the children, attends meetings along with them regularly, and is engaging in the field service once more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">TOBAGO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38,861</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">One publisher learned the importance and practicality of calling at every home in house-to-house witnessing. A special pioneer relates that as he and his companion worked very hilly territory in the blistering sun, his companion “felt the need to quit for the day, but we had decided to complete the area. Standing on the road, he would look at the houses away on the top of the hills, and, if there was no evidence of the householder’s being at home, he would suggest that we move on because, as he put it, ‘It would be a terrible thing to climb that mountain in vain.’ Not wanting to discourage him, I asked him to wait under the shade of a tree while I went to the house. On three occasions I went up alone and in each home I placed the offer. As we approached the last house he said to me: ‘You wait here under the shade of this tree and I’ll go.’ Now he is conducting a very lively study on the highest hill in that territory from the first book he ever placed.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A person with whom a study is conducted began to share the good things she learned with a fellow workerin a drugstore who was also a high-school teacher. This person had been disillusioned by false religion and had become an atheist. Many proofs of the truthfulness and authenticity of the Bible were presented on different occasions. Such matters as the origin of the races, divine inspiration, why God permits wickedness, apparent contradictions in the Bible, and so forth, were covered. The teacher was invited to the public talk on “Evolution or Creation—Which Do the Facts Support?” and listened attentively, also taking note of the announcement that those who desired might request a study. Then she asked: “When do we begin to study?” Her progress was rapid. Soon her faith was put to the test. She was offered an additional job in the high school, in addition to her work in the drugstore, but accepting this would mean having no more time to study or attend meetings. Her decision was to quit her job in the drugstore. Now she is baptized, regularly attends meetings and participates in the ministry; in turn, she is conducting three studies as well as helping her own family study the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The following experience shows how the truth can free one from the use of good-luck charms and demon religion: On working an isolated town to care for the interest there, two pioneer sisters had to stay overnight in a hotel. They entered into a conversation with the owner and a neighbor woman who was the daughter of a rich Moslem businessman. After considering various themes this woman went home and got her Bible. She showed such interest that a study was started and conducted twice a week, often until very late at night. When the discussion was about demonism, she related how in the past she had heard voices saying that she would die within a short time, and then there was wild laughter. She came to have such fear before studying the truth that, although she is a woman forty years old, her mother had to be with her at night so she could sleep. When she tried to read the Bible, a voice insisted that, instead of reading the Bible, she ought to begin to write. One time she did this and wrote things with beautiful handwriting that she herself could not understand. After she turned out the lights to sleep, every night a luminous star came toward her and it scared her. Some local evangelists told her that it was an angel of divine light. As a last resort she began to read Psalm 121. It was then that the demons let her alone. But she still kept two amulets she had gotten from an Arab who told her that she should never tell that she had them nor should she open them. One was a bronze coin with a cross and other figures, and lettering on it said, “The true charm of the holy grave.” On the other side there were stripes in the form of a half moon and two small dots in which power by means of radiations was supposed to dwell. The other was</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">an “amulet of luck” that had an image of the “virgin” of Lujan and the Star of David. On opening it, she found inside a printed paper with many prayers in Portuguese directed to many “saints” and signed by a bishop in Jerusalem. To get rid of it, the owner finally threw it down a drain. All this occurred in just two weeks. The words of Jesus in John 8:32: “You will know’ the truth, and the truth will set your free,” turned out to be true in freeing this person from the influence of demons.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">One family made good progress, even to the point of defending new truths learned, as the following experience shows: A lady told the wife of the family that was studying that the Witnesses would give long sermons and pray a long time at dinnertime, so the food would get cold before it could be eaten. Another told her that we used a different Bible, to which she answered: “You are welcome to come and see for yourself.” Her oldest daughter, of eleven years, defended the truth in school when the teacher talked against the visiting missionaries. She told the teacher that the Witnesses are just telling the people about God’s kingdom. Unable to answer, the teacher dismissed the class before the usual hour. On another occasion this young girl asked the priest how Jesus could pray to God if he himself were God. The priest, of course, was unable to answer, so the class backed her up, saying she was right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The head of the family and father of this girl made it possible for the Witnesses to deliver a ten-minute talk over the local radio station after overcoming some objections, and it was broadcast at a very good hour when most people are at home and have the islands’ only radio station tuned in. The intense house-to-house activity and this timely radio program enraged the false religious clergy of Babylon the Great and stirred them to publish an article against us in the “Cathedral Messenger.” Slanderous statements accused the Witnesses of spreading confusion and said that their work is a plot against all government and authority and that they are not a religion at all but are peddlers of perversion. Most of the people were displeased by the attitude of their clergy and resented their church’s position. Commenting on this, the Colonial Secretary was highly amused at the way they went on, and said: “Well, they can’t help blowing off steam once in a while.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">One of the outstanding events of the year was the international assembly that was held on January 23 to 27 in Caracas. The many visitors from other lands along with the directors of the Society made it a wonderful assembly and served as a great witness to this city. Up till this time there had not been much increase in the country, but from February on the reports began to show a wonderful increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Expressions of love and consideration are rather unusual in this selfish world. When shown by the very young ones, they are even more impressive. An eightyear-old girl, the daughter of a dedicated Witness, tells this incident: “On returning from school one day, I saw several children making fun of an old lady with a twisted hand. I noticed she was crying and asked her why. She answered that it was partly because the children were making fun, and also she was tired of asking God to make her well, as God didn’t answer her prayers. I explained that one must pray to the true God, Jehovah, through his Son Christ Jesus. Also, I told her that now isn’t the time for such miracles but when he restores the paradise on earth, then all sick people will be healed. I invited her to accompany me to my home so that my mother could explain more. There I placed the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> book with her and began a study. She has studied twice a week for five months with real interest. She says that what interested her was to see how the children of Jehovah’s witnesses weren’t like the others but are the only ones showing true love to the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How often science and its accomplishments attract and absorb the minds of people today. Yet the seeds of Bible truth sown in the hearts of the honest-hearted ones many times bear fruit. The experience of a missionary proves this point. He writes: “One day I accompanied my wife to visit an Italian man who had conversed several times with Witnesses and had some of the literature. He explained that he was studying about antimatter and other scientific subjects but he wanted to know what we thought, so I placed a Bible and made arrangements to study with him. We began with the topic ‘What Is Man?’ Immediately he expressed the thought that our method was very simple and that we needed a more dynamic approach. Nevertheless, the first study changed his mind, and he admitted he learned many things he didn’t know before. After only three visits he said he was returning to Italy and asked if it could be arranged for someone to continue with him there. This was done. One day I received a letter from Torino, Italy, and didn’t have the slightest idea from whom it could be. The paper had pictures of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> in Italian that puzzled me even more. This man wrote me that he had immediately started in the Theocratic Ministry School there, attended all the meetings, was now baptized, and is considering taking up pioneer work in Italy. So the man said: ‘I took the liberty to start this letter calling you brother.’ Also, his fleshly brother is now baptized.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">YUGOSLAVIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The brothers in Yugoslavia have made diligent efforts to make disciples, and their work has been blessed during the past service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In a village in Serbia a small congregation exists. Regularly magazines and other literature are sent to the address of the congregation servant. But the postman’s service was not satisfactory at all. The deliveries were not regular and sometimes magazines were missing. It has to be mentioned that postmen in Yugoslavia watch what people get through the mail. One day the postman went to the secretary of the community, a member of the Communist party, and brought him a parcel of our literature addressed to the congregation servant. The postman told the secretary that a lot of such religious propaganda material is addressed to the congregation servant, and he was not sure if he should continue to deliver these parcels there, or just what he should do. The secretary told him: “Do you not know that this man is one of Jehovah’s witnesses? The whole world is fighting against these people but without success. What shall we do against them? Deliver everything to him properly and don’t come and ask again. By the way, if everyone would be like these witnesses of Jehovah, then things would be different in this crazy world.” Since that time the brother receives his parcels regularly. Yes, we are a spectacle to the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Christian conduct of a wife may result in changing the mind of a husband not well disposed toward the truth. A sister made many back-calls on a woman who was interested in the truth but who did not want to come to the congregation meetings. The woman revealed to the sister that her husband was against the truth and the reading of our publications. One day the two women were studying the Bible when the husband unexpectedly came home. He did not say a word, so the sister tried to start a conversation with him and explain the purpose of her calls. He refused to listen, saying that this was something for women and not for men. The sister did not give up, however. The next time she took along a mature brother with her, to prove that the truth is also for men and not only for women. And, indeed, the man listened to the brother, who gave him a thorough witness. The man then said that he did not understand this new religion, but one thing he had noticed, namely, a big change in his wife. She had become so different it made him think, and as a result he was ready to listen to what Jehovah’s witnesses had to say. The study was then continued with both husband and wife. They started to attend the meetings, and now they are talking about getting immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Oftentimes it pays to be patient in extending help to weak and immature ones who neglect doing God’s will. In a village there lives an older man who studied the truth and even talked about getting baptized. But then his children experienced great difficulties in school on account of the truth, so this man discontinued his association with us. However, the publisher who studied with him attended a circuit assembly where the thought of helping those who had become inactive was stressed. Prayerfully this publisher went to call on this elderly man; and when he had greeted him, he said: “I am coming in the name of Jehovah, and I consider it my obligation to help you.” The brother then opened his Bible and read a number of texts, showing that we must not be fearful. The man listened very attentively, and at the end he had tears in his eyes. His question was: “When can I get baptized?” For three years he had been delaying baptism and had become weak, but. now he felt the time had come for it and that he would get strong after taking this required step. What he had resolved, he did. The loving, positive call of the publisher had borne fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ZAMBIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,780,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 35,523 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 106</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Despite the expulsion of thousands of children from school, regular threats of banning by government officials, misrepresentation on the radio and in the press, deprivation of jobs and even violent attacks, the brothers in Zambia have not faltered nor slowed down, but have increased their ministry in all aspects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At Kabompo, an isolated area in the Northwestern Province, about four hundred brothers, including women and children, had come together for special meetings. Two days before the program was due to begin, the commander of police for the province arrived with forty armed police. The brothers were given two hours to disperse; so, as quickly as they could gather their belongings together, they moved away from the camp and the meeting arena. Some, including the district servant, remained in a nearby village. The police shouted a last warning, surrounded this village and for thirty minutes bombarded the brothers with tear-gas shells and smoke grenades. Several tear-gas shells landed at the feet of the district servant. Some shells were even fired at a house where a local brother was sheltered with his wife and children. Naturally, the infant children, choking from the smoke and with eyes burning from the tear gas, began to cry and scream. However, the brothers and sisters displayed remarkable calmness, neither getting panicky nor trying to retaliate in any way. Later that evening the brothers’ sleeping camp and meeting arena were burned down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The brothers dispersed to the bush and surrounding villages, but returned by Friday. The police left. The district servant succeeded in getting a telegram through to the branch office; and, owing to the kindness of a brother who owns a plane, two representatives were immediately flown to the area. The brothers were greatly encouraged, and the program continued in a normal way on Saturday and Sunday. Even the new ones were not dismayed, for when the baptismal talk was delivered on Sunday morning, forty-six stood up to indicate their dedication to Jehovah. At this moment the commanding officer responsible turned up, but he was greeted kindly by the brothers and soon left. This incident, now known as the “Kabompo Incident,” and the fine conduct of the brothers during this provocation received country-wide publicity, especially in police circles. After this incident, interference with our religious meetings considerably lessened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The district servant went on to hold two other assemblies in the same province. The second of these had been arranged in the main provincial town near police headquarters. What would happen? Again many police came along, but this time quietly and peacefully, and they listened. After viewing the illustrated Bible lecture “God Cannot Lie” many were heard to remark, “The Watchtower is the only true church.” Among those who attended the meetings was the same commanding officer. But this time he approached the district servant and contributed for copies of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font11"> books. After attending the Bible talk on Sunday he commented: “I have never seen people as orderly as you are. Your Society is really a Bible-based society.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The circuit servant, writing from the Kabompo area, says that now no one .turns Jehovah’s witnesses away, but all show a desire to listen. In the three congregations nearest the scene of the tear-gas attack, twenty new publishers have begun to share in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It is not unusual for former opposers to be won over because of the marked contrast between the conduct and the kindness of the brothers and that of those associated with worldly organizations. One person wrote in, saying that a few years ago he was a Roman Catholic and an organizer for the Young Christian Workers. At the same time he was the propaganda secretary for the local branch of his political party. Jehovah’s witnesses were having an assembly in the area, so six branches of the political party met together and chose this person to attend the circuit assembly on their behalf as a reporter, to write down anything that might be said against the Freedom Fighters or the political party. They equipped him with a notebook, a ball-point pen, and gave him 3/- for food. The assembly began, but the first day he wrote nothing in his book. He was amazed that among the brothers there was no pushing, no bad language, no stealing, and that all lost things were collected into one place. He contrasted this with Roman Catholic meetings where one heard a lot of shouting, such as, “Who has taken my firewood?” This favorable comparison continued on into the evening, as he noted how the brothers sat around their fires, singing Kingdom songs and addressing one another as brother and sister. On Sunday the reporter listened with intense interest to the Bible lecture “Who Will Rule the World?” and he began to use his notebook to write down the scriptures cited by the speaker. When he arrived home, the branch chairman and other party members hurried him into their office to receive his report. They opened his notebook and read: “Daniel 2:44.” They demanded to know if they had sent him to write down things like this. He then explained he no longer was the propaganda secre-retary, nor </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> Roman Catholic, but a witness for Jehovah. He had heard that Jesus Christ has the power to rule all the earth. The reporter then returned the collecting book used for party funds. Next he went to the Roman Catholic evangelist and returned his cross and prayer book, telling him that he was now one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Soon thereafter this new brother became a vacation pioneer, and at the time of writing this report he has married a pioneer sister and is now himself a regular pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many of the circuit servants express appreciation for the arrangement whereby they now have more time to visit inactive and weak publishers. One mentions that in his circuit he visited, all together, 120 weak ones and that 100 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">ot</span><span class="font11"> these are now regular publishers and have subscribed for </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font11"> Another reports that in the past twenty-four months in his circuit he has had the joy of aiding twenty-eight inactive persons to become regular publishers again. No doubt, the application of this arrangement by the circuit servants contributed to the fine increase during this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES WORK UNDER DIFFICULTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When Jesus Christ was training his disciples to take up the ministry, as he sent them forth he said: “As you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.’” (Matt. 10:7) He also gave them due warning that they would not be very acceptable because of introducing this new teaching. At Matthew the tenth chapter, beginning with the sixteenth verse, Jesus said: “Look! I am sending you forth as sheep amidst wolves; therefore prove yourselves cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves. Be on your guard against men; for they will deliver you up to local courts, and they will scourge you in their synagogues. Why, you will be haled before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them and the nations. And you will be objects of hatred by all people on account of my name; but he that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved.” (Matt. 10: 16-18, 22) Having these words of Jesus in mind as you read the experiences from the countries that follow, you will appreciate why many of Jehovah’s witnesses have had to work underground in some countries and why they have had to be very careful in others; but still they associate together and speak to others as they have opportunity. And despite the restrictions that have been put upon Christians in different parts of the world, their whole purpose in life is to preach the good news as it is recorded in God’s Word. They know that “in all the nations the good news has to be preached first.&quot; (Mark 13:10) So Jehovah’s witnesses around the world are earnestly trying to get this message preached, and in some countries they are having great success. In others there is great opposition. But read their experiences and see what they have done. The Society does not think it wise to indicate just how many publishers are in every land where the opposition is so great, because it might cause the religious leaders or the government officials to put on more pressure and interfere to an even greater extent with the preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Still the good news is being preached in all these countries, and Jehovah’s witnesses world wide will continue to reach out into every nook and corner of the globe so that everyone who wishes may have the opportunity to hear this marvelous message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ALBANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">No field service reports were received during the service year; however, we have learned that the dedicated brothers and sisters have not given up their faith. They continue to come together for worship in small groups as conditions permit. A number of them are under restrictions, and all feel the effects of this pressure upon the congregation. We have confidence in Jehovah that these faithful Witnesses will be helped to endure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">BULGARIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our brothers in Bulgaria are few, and they have to cope with difficulties, the main one being the lack of freedom to preach the good news of the Kingdom publicly and from house to house. Nevertheless, the scattered groups of brothers do some preaching, using the possibilities they have. And they find a good number of persons who listen to what the Bible has to say for our day and for the future. Honest people in all parts of that land find no hope in the churches, and this makes them receptive to the Kingdom message. But patience is needed to develop the work. We trust in Jehovah that increase will come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One brother who made use of an opportunity to give a witness writes: “When I visited a certain factory as a specialist, I used the opportunity to give a witness about the Kingdom to three workers during the noon break. One of them immediately showed interest, so I made a back-call at his home and started a Bible study. He grasped the truth very quickly and started to preach it to others. He invited me to make some visits with him at the homes of his friends. The outcome was that two new Bible studies were started in two weeks’ time. All three studies proved to be a great joy to me. After two months we organized a public talk for all these interested persons and their families. This helped them to leave Babylon the Great. Now, six months after I gave that initial witness in the factory, all of these interested men and their wives are preaching the truth regularly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Sometimes persons we witness to do not respond positively, but relatives of the uninterested party do. A sister returning home by train took the opportunity to start a conversation with an elderly woman about the new order of things and its blessings. The woman, however, said that she had no interest in this religion but that her daughter, nineteen years old, would be keenly interested in getting a knowledge of the Bible. As they left the train together, the sister was introduced to the young daughter waiting for her mother at the railroad station. The sister summarized her sermon for the daughter. When she noticed how great this girl’s interest was, she brought her in touch with the Witnesses in the village where the girl lived. A productive study was started with her. Difficulties in her family came up, but after a year of study the girl was baptized, and now she conducts two home Bible studies herself. How joyful it is to see the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promise that he will bring the “resources of the nations” to his organization!—Isa. 60:11</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">EAST GERMANY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Conditions in East Germany did not change much for the publishers. The last three of fifteen brothers who were arrested in November 1965 in a surprise raid throughout the country received their sentences in the city of Halle in December 1966. After they had been kept in prison for investigation for thirteen months, they received terms of ten, eight and five years respectively. The authorities seemed to have had </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font11">hard time finding sufficient material against them. The average sentence of those fifteen brothers thus was seven years and four months, just for being Christians and living their faith. It is true that the publishers have no longer been physically abused as was the case in previous years. But it convinced everybody who may have had doubts that the authorities still mean to crush the faith of the publishers by cruel treatment, even though at times they just show a soft paw in an effort to win the brothers to their side with sweet talk and seeming friendliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Incidental witnessing is a big field for the publishers. A sister was approached by a woman in the street with a collecting box for a fund-raising campaign of the Protestant church. The publisher asked her whether they should not together check God’s Word to find out about such collections or what God’s will for us really is, as both of them desired to serve God. An appointment resulted, and now this woman has a Bible study to learn Jehovah’s will and enjoys it very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Last spring when a publisher passed by a house she noticed that there were abundant peppermint plants in the garden. She went to the householder, asking her whether she could have some of the roots for her own garden. While they talked the woman mentioned that she had just returned from church where she attended the Lord’s supper. The sister invited her to check in her own Bible what it says about the Memorial and who is worthy to partake of the emblems. Ever since she has had a fine home Bible study with this woman who is so happy she has found the truth. The woman has already started to instruct her husband, son and grandchild in God’s Word. She also got one of her friends to study the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A pioneer publisher who has been in this full-time service under these difficult conditions for more than ten years is so happy to have experienced Jehovah’s rich blessing all that time. More than thirty persons have been helped to the point of baptism by this one pioneer publisher. The pioneer says: “This has only been possible with Jehovah’s help and protection as he really strikes his enemies with blindness. As mentioned by the prophet Malachi, God’s blessing can be felt every day as he invites all of his servants to ‘test me out, please, in this respect . . . whether I shall not open to you people the floodgates of the heavens.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Making initial calls, two sisters called on a woman who invited them in and offered a seat. But then she rushed out and locked the door from the outside. Through a connecting door the sisters could hear this woman phoning the secret police. The sisters prayed to Jehovah for his help and strength. Then suddenly the locked door was opened. A young girl coming from school had opened it and asked: “Where is Mam-mle?” “She is next door making a call,” the sisters replied. “Please tell her that we cannot wait any longer. Remember us to her. Good-bye.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">HUNGARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The work in Hungary has progressed well in the past service year. Many persons have symbolized their dedication by water immersion. The authorities have shown themselves quite tolerant toward Jehovah’s witnesses. Maybe they are more and more aware of the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses are honest, lawabiding citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Honesty is a quality that recommends Jehovah’s witnesses. A village in Hungary got a new police commander. He did not know much about Jehovah’s witnesses when he arrived; and, in fact, his attitude was rather hostile toward the Witnesses. One day a sister, when on her way to the village, found a portfolio on the road. It contained a considerable amount of money. The sister brought the portfolio straight to the police station and handed it over to the police officer. The officer looked at the sister and said: “You are Jehovah, aren’t you?” The sister then explained who Jehovah is, and said that she was one of his witnesses. Seeing the money in the portfolio, the officer remarked: “You are truly honest people.” He kindly shook hands with the sister as she left. The honesty of this sister completely changed the police officer’s mind about Jehovah’s witnesses. This became evident somewhat later when a family in the village arranged a party to which the police officer was also invited. It may be added that in the meantime the police officer had spoken with various witnesses of Jehovah. During the party some in attendance made abusive remarks about Jehovah’s witnesses. The police officer listened for a while and then said with indignation: “These people should not be abused in this way, because they are truly honest, the best of all people. If only all were Jehovah’s witnesses! I never have any trouble with them.” At this the police officer was ridiculed with remarks such as: “Do you want to become one of them? Then beware—with them you will not be permitted to carry a gun!” The police officer answered: “Jehovah’s witnesses do not need the police; they know order and respect it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Taking an active share in the ministry helps us to grow spiritually and solve our personal problems better. Neglecting our ministry, on the other hand, has a contrary effect. A circuit servant noticed this particularly in the case of one family in the truth. When he visited the congregation, he called on them, and they usually brought up their numerous personal problems. The circuit servant knew, however, that this family was neglecting the study of God’s Word and also the field service. The attitude of the sister was especially objectionable. She did not respect her place in the family arrangement and used her tongue a lot to speak against her husband. Naturally she was not happy. Then this sister fell sick, had to go to the hospital, and underwent a serious operation. There she started to use her tongue for a better purpose and witnessed to people around her. When she could get up, she took her Bible and went from room to room in the hospital, comforting the sick with the Kingdom hope. When she left the hospital, all very kindly bade her farewell, even those who were initially against her preaching. A number of persons left their addresses with her, so that the sister could visit them when they returned home. The circuit servant noticed a drastic change the next time he visited this family. The atmosphere was different. There was joy. Nobody was talking about petty problems. The active share in the ministry had resulted in a real blessing to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">POLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During summer vacation time hundreds went out with the message into outlying territories. A number put in so much time that they were able to vacation pioneer. All of these workers returned to their home territories filled with enthusiasm, and several publishers were so impressed with the spiritual blessings of the service that they are planning to enter the pioneer ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">God’s Word has the power of a mighty hammer crushing the hardest foundation of false reasonings. This fact was experienced by a superior in a factory who for twenty years had been an ardent adherent of the evolution theory. He was convinced that evolution was a proved scientific fact. Then a new worker was hired who worked under him and who turned out to be a Witness. The brother started to preach the “good news” to his fellow workers during mealtimes. Of course, he was ridiculed, and those in charge treated him badly. The superior himself decided to cure him of his ideas by discussing religion with him. He devoted every spare minute and even nights to prepare himself, studying religious science, world history and archaeology. He tried to gather arguments against the Witnesses by talking to representatives of other religious organizations, but he found them contradicting one another. He bought himself a Bible and began to compare it with our study material. Then something happened he had never expected. He became more and more convinced that there is a God and Creator and that the Bible is God’s Word of truth. A short while and he became a Witness. His family are still atheists, but he hopes that there is enough time left so he can help his wife and children to learn about Jehovah, the true God and Creator of the marvelous things around us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Incidental witnessing can bring fine results. As a sister waited for a train in the waiting room of a railroad station she began to witness to a woman sitting beside her. It was during the months of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> campaign. Her little daughter of three years copied the example of her mother. She took two magazines from her mother’s bag and handed them to another woman sitting nearby. The lady accepted the magazines and asked the mother to call on her. When the publishers called, the husband of that friendly woman had many questions. After a few back-calls a home Bible study was started. When the Memorial date approached, the couple were invited to attend. They did not mind traveling the distance of fifteen miles and were present. Since then they have not missed a meeting. The husband has already become a fellow publisher of God’s kingdom and is contemplating baptism. He has been talking about the Kingdom to all the inhabitants of their village, and they already consider him a Witness. Now he has started a Bible study with his brother-in-law. And all these good results are the fruitage of an incidental witness at the station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A young sister ten years old tried to witness to her classmates, but none of the other girls cared to listen to the message. She did not give up, but started to talk to the janitor about God’s kingdom during intermissions and before school started in the morning. He had many questions, and she regularly gave him magazines to read. Before long the second janitor of the school by mistake approached her fleshly sister who attended the same school and who was two years older. He asked her whether he could also get those magazines that she gave to the other janitor, because he thought that she supplied them. When she told him that she did not understand, he ran into his apartment to get a copy of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> magazine to show her. His colleague had already begun talking the truth to him. He, of course, was also supplied with magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Funeral services are a splendid way to reach the public with God’s message of comfort and hope. When a funeral of someone whose family had recently become Witnesses was held, thirty-three members of the family were present for the talk, but the total attendance was 2,000. All listened attentively to the discourse and to the songs sung by the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ROMANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The work of Jehovah’s witnesses in Romania goes on. The brothers stick together, study the Bible and are strengthened thereby to endure to the end. Their possibilities of preaching the gospel are limited, so they make use of what opportunities they have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The brothers must be very cautious in their ministry; but if they find a sincere person who desires to be instructed in the Word of God, they do everything they can to help such a person. A sister, for example, regularly travels about fifty miles to visit an interested family and study the Bible with them. Once when waiting at the railroad station she met a woman and started to converse with her about the truth. The woman showed genuine interest. Time passed quickly; and this person whose interest in the Kingdom message had been kindled felt sorry that the sister had to leave her and get on the train. So she decided to buy </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> ticket, too, and take the train and accompany the sister. This gave them a very good opportunity to continue their discussion of Bible subjects. Since that time this interested woman regularly accompanies the sister on the train when she goes to have her study, and they study God’s Word as they travel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Recently a master builder became a witness of Jehovah. In the past he used to do repair work on the church building of the town. Of course, after he became a brother, he broke his connections with the church, and the priest and other people began to miss him at the church services. So the priest decided to call on this brother, to find out why he failed to come to church. The priest took with him three men, all members of his church. When the priest stated the purpose of his visit, the brother began to explain why he was not attending church and gave them all a thorough Kingdom witness. This was too much for the priest, however. He got furious and declared that he would find a way to cause the brother plenty of trouble. Two of the three men who accompanied the priest, however, reacted differently. Both were members of the church committee. To them what the brother explained from the Bible made sense. Here was a real hope. So they asked for more information on God’s kingdom; the brother gave it, and a time was fixed for further discussions. The result? Both men are really interested in the Kingdom message, and they have both quit the church. How good it is to act in harmony with 1 Peter 3:15: Always be “ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">TURKEY</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Each dedicated servant of the Most High God has said the words of Isaiah: “Here I am! Send me.” These are not only words, but they carry a deep meaning, and each dedicated servant has to live up to these words. A brother who from the time of his dedication deeply appreciated these words writes: “Since my dedication I understood that to serve Jehovah in the full-time service would be the ideal thing, so I resolved to become a pioneer. However, I was afraid I could not reach the goals of a full-time minister. Two times I had vacation pioneered, but I could not reach the goals. This gave me more reason to be afraid of entering the pioneer service. However, I started again to rearrange my secular work; and during an entire year I constantly prayed to Jehovah for help, and then I applied again for this service. Now I have been a pioneer for eight months, and during all these months I reached my goals and sometimes I could do even more. Eights months ago what has now come true seemed like a dream to me. The fact that I feel I will be able to continue my whole life in the full-time service makes me feel even happier.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Exclusive devotion shown even by new ones can be of great help to those who have been dedicated servants for a long time but who are still weak. This can be seen from the following experience: Two brothers who were in the truth for many years progressed very little and finally became irregular in the field service despite the fact that they received constant help and encouragement. Their answer was always: “You cannot imagine how difficult our job is.” In their shop a young man was doing exactly the same work ana therefore knew what was involved and what a person can do if he has the right attitude. A publisher started a study with this young man, and he progressed very well. After a few months of study the Moslem fasting time called “Ramazan” came. Of course, this friend already understood so much of the truth that he acted accordingly. However, at the end of this fasting time, which concludes with a big feast, he decided to visit his parents who were living in a small village. After writing to his parents about his arrival, he was invited to a Bible discourse. His appreciation was already so great that nothing could keep him back from attending this discussion, and he postponed the visit to his parents. He even gave his first comment at the meeting, and since this time always has been present when the Bible is discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In the meantime he got married. Due to his zeal and the good example he set, he started a study with his wife, also a Moslem. Both are making good progress and never miss the opportunity to associate regularly with those of the same faith. He even has expressed his desire to get baptized at the next opportunity. Meanwhile he has opened his own shop, doing exactly the same work as he did before, but he never uses his secular work as an excuse for not being able to fulfill his obligation toward God. This has made such, a deep impression on the other two brothers that they are now more zealous in the service and never use their secular occupation for an excuse, but, rather, are making a good effort to progress too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our brothers in Russia have had another successful year of work. A number of them went into new places, virgin territory, and have found many people who like to hear the truth of God’s Word. A message from them says: &quot;We realize that the fact we are living under hard conditions in this country does not relieve us of our responsibility to preach the ‘good news.’ We have in mind the issue caused by the challenge of the Devil and its consequences. For that reason true worship and the service of Jehovah have been under constant attack, with persecution and cruel suppression by the evil spirit operating in the sons of lawlessness today.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Last year a book called “Dictionary of the Atheist” was published in Moscow. “Jehovah’s witnesses” is one of its captions, heading a sizable write-up of five hundred words. In it the Witnesses are no longer painted as a secret army of the Western imperialists set to undermine the fighting morale of the Soviet people. To the contrary, it now says that the Witnesses “draw upon themselves the adverse judgment of society, not only in our country, but in many others, including the bourgeois countries.” This indicates that the uncompromisingly neutral stand of the brothers world wide has also impressed the Russian authorities, who now tell their people that, the Witnesses are no part of this world, neither East nor West.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Two years ago a whole group of twenty-four former Baptists came into the truth in one place in Siberia. Their leader was baptized too. Having become a Kingdom publisher, he moved to a big city where there was much unworked territory. In that place fifteen new ones and then a short while later ten new ones were baptized recently, so there are now twenty-five new publishers in that promising field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In addition to the hardships and risks people have to face when associating with God’s people, they are not spared their own personal problems. But it is inspiring to see how God’s Word supplies the necessary power for them to overcome all these detrimental things. A young couple with two children showed some interest. After a while the husband became indifferent, while his wife made good progress. One day he even began to make a scene after the publishers left. He did not like the fact that the Witnesses shunned getting drunk and spending their time loitering about. He became utterly negative in his outlook. He started to return home from work drunk and then used to beat up his wife. She was expecting another child and would not agree to an abortion. He spent most of their income on drinks, so there was not enough left for the family to live on. But all these trying experiences only strengthened the woman, as she got to see more and more clearly the great difference between the ways of the old system and the new order. She dedicated her life and was baptized. She cannot be regular at meetings because of her husband; but when he is at work, she has an opportunity to get out her hidden study material or to talk to some sisters who call on her. She has already found another woman with whom she was able to start a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Two young sisters started preaching in a city where the good news never before had been preached. They started by talking to a. woman in the city park. She was very much surprised to hear them speak about such matters, exclaiming: “What an amazing thing I am hearing about, and to have you young people talking in such a way!” She gave her address to the sisters. They called on her and found that the woman’s fleshly brother also wanted to learn the truth. They are now having a fine home Bible study in that home. The first foothold in that city has been established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Even brothers who have to serve long prison terms do not become introverted. They do not feel sorry for themselves, but share in the joy of Jehovah. One of them wrote a fine letter of encouragement to those outside, saying, among other things: “We are still living in this world, surrounded by idols and worshipers of false gods; and we will continue to live in it until the hour of divine justice comes. We cannot cease obeying God’s commands, and we believe in Jesus who has opened up the way of reconciliation for us with God. We will obey Jehovah God despite the consequences to us due to the treatment we receive from this old system. ... It is a grand privilege to endure all tests and remain faithful to Jehovah God, to praise God forever in one’s life in order to gain everlasting life from Jehovah through Jesus Christ. I wish you strong faith and endurance until the final victory over this old system of things and the entry into the new system of things, and may Jehovah be with you and bless you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our loving Father, Jehovah, true to his Word and promises, prepared and forearmed our brothers in Egypt for many years in order for them to be able to stand firm and steadfast in the face of violent persecution and all the other trials that befell them during the year. To cut a long story short, although the preaching of the “good news” was twice banned (in 1960 and in 1964), and conditions for pure worship were very difficult, it was only in 1967 that brutal persecution and mass imprisonment of the Witnesses took place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">From November onward, more than a hundred brothers and sisters were haled before public officials in most of the cities where there are organized congregations. The objective of these summonings was to stop the group studies of the friends as well as the announcement of God’s established kingdom by intimidating them through threats. The result, though, was contrary to what was expected. The number of the friends continued to increase, and their activity became more intense. Therefore, the “superior authorities,” under the continual instigation of the promoters of false religion, launched a campaign of arrests and physical abuse of those detained. Did this campaign stop the work? By no means! It only contributed to giving a further witness to the authorities and to the people in general, as Jesus had pointed out: “People will lay their hands upon you and persecute you, delivering you up to . . . prisons, you being haled before kings and governors for the sake of my name. It will turn out to you for a witness.”—Luke 21:12, 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The first serious incident took place on the 25th of March, during the Memorial, when secret agents of the Investigations Department arrested fifteen men, women and children who were peacefully celebrating the death of our Lord Jesus Christ in a private home. All the religious literature, photographs and correspondence found with them and at their homes were confiscated, with the hope of finding anything to incriminate them and prove that they are Zionists. Eleven of the fifteen were detained for thirteen days. The other four, who were considered leaders, are still detained in prison and have been brutally treated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Two other couples were later arrested at their homes just for being Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The wave of persecution was intensified when the authorities heard of the beginning of the Arab-Israeli war on the fifth of June. The Investigations Department lost their temper in many cities and went to about twenty brothers’ homes and indiscriminately arrested all brothers of eighteen years or more and imprisoned them. Until the time of writing, all these brothers and the four arrested during the Memorial celebration are still incarcerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Investigations Department, in order to complete their campaign to silence the witness work, went as far as deporting some European brothers whom they considered to be very active and responsible for the expansion of the Society’s preaching activities in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">During April and May three long articles of five to eight pages each were written against the Witnesses in two Arabic weekly magazines, “Al-Mussawer” and “Sabbah-El-Kheir,” as well as a couple of articles in the daily newspapers “Al-Ahram,” “Al-Goumhouria” and “Al-Messa.” These contained names and photographs of friends who were arrested as well as others who were not yet arrested, in order to misrepresent us as Zionists and as a security risk to the country, as well as to justify the arrests of so many of the friends. Their ultimate goal was to convince the public not to receive the Witnesses into their homes. But did they succeed in doing so? The following experiences will show us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Quite a few persons who were contacted after the violent persecution started were more interested in hearing our point of view than ever. Some of them even mentioned that since they read the article in the “Al-Mussawer” magazine, which was partly inspired by a Coptic-Orthodox priest, they were convinced that we have the truth, because that priest is a well-known materialist who was recently tried by a court for extortion and even menaced with imprisonment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Regarding this article one brother reported: “I had an appointment with an interested person to study the Bible, using the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font11"> as a help. When I entered the room where the study usually is held, I saw some of the magazines and papers that wrote against us on the table near the Bible and the study book. Of course, I expected that the person would accuse us with what was written in the magazines and refuse to continue the study. But how I was surprised to hear him say: ‘Previously I was in great doubt as to the steps I should take as to this study, but after having read the slanders of the clergymen I have decided to get baptized and be a true witness of Jehovah.’ Thus the lies of the clergy helped one person take a positive stand for Jehovah’s kingdom, just the opposite of what they aimed for.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As you see from the foregoing, our fellow servants did not stop praising Jehovah’s name despite all the violent persecution and hardships they had to undergo and still are undergoing. So while quite a few left the country, either willingly or unwillingly due to being deported, and a few compromised, and the reports are not entirely accurate due to the circumstances, still the number of brothers is almost equal to last year. We hope with Jehovah’s help, not only to hold our own, but to find even more of the remaining “other sheep” in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">After reading these many experiences of Jehovah’s witnesses in all parts of the world we feel sure that your heart has been made glad. At times, however, some of the experiences may have made you sad because of the persecution and difficult circumstances that Jehovah’s witnesses endured due to their faithfulness. But while there may have been a moment of sadness, still the true Christian will rejoice because of the faithfulness, loyalty and devotion fellow Christians displayed under difficult circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Jehovah’s witnesses around the world have one thing in mind and that is accomplishing the work given them to do now at the end of this system of things. Jesus said it must be accomplished first, this preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom, before the end of the wicked system of things. Knowing that the end is near, Jehovah’s witnesses have been diligent in preaching this good news everywhere. During the service year 1967 they preached in 197 lands, as compared with 199 lands the year before. There were a few countries where all the Witnesses had to leave and there are none of Jehovah’s witnesses there at the present time to speak in behalf of God's kingdom as ambassadors for Christ. But someday someone else may be able to go there and these areas will open up again. The Watch Tower Society now has 96 branch offices in operation and these have oversight of the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses world wide. There are also 25,206 congregations now, to compare with 24,910 last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The congregations have grown in numbers too, and there has been a fine increase of publishers. In the lands reporting that are not behind the Iron Curtain, of which there are 186, there was a 4.3-percent increase in the average number of publishers in the field each month. However, behind the Iron Curtain there was a decrease of 3.8 percent. When we consider how difficult it is to witness in some of these countries, it is little wonder that there has been some decrease in activity. That is not true in every country, however. Really, in the majority of the countries behind the Iron Curtain there have been marked increases. Whether there is an increase or decrease, this does not discourage the brothers who are there. They will keep right on preaching the good news, because they have the faith of true Christians that this work must be done. Do you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Throughout the entire world, in 197 different lands, there were 1,094,280 Witnesses, on the average, sharing each month in declaring the Kingdom good news, to compare with the previous year, when 1,058,675 publishers were active every month. This meant that every month during the past twelve months there were, on the average, 35,605 more witnesses of Jehovah preaching from house to house and publicly than the year before. That is good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There was a good, steady growth during the past year and that can be seen in the peak number of publishers reporting, 1,160,604, to compare with 1,118,665 in 1966. This was an overall increase in the peak of publishers of 41,939, which is excellent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We must remember that about one percent of all the population in the world dies each year. So when there are well over one million publishers we can expect that at least 10,000 of them will die. Then there are those who fall away because the seed that fell was in rocky places, and when tribulation and persecution arose the persons at once stumbled. There was also seed sown among thorns; these are the ones hearing the word, but the anxiety of this system of things and the deceptive power of riches choke the word, and they become unfruitful. (Matt. 13:5-23) They soon leave the organization, and this often amounts to another one percent during the year. So we cannot expect that the increase in publishers should equal those baptized, which was 74,981 during 1967. Jehovah’s witnesses are trying diligently to help those who have become inactive and stopped their association with the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">They try to show such ones that the course of wisdom is to stick close to Jehovah’s Word, to keep on studying it. From time to time some who accept the help Jehovah’s witnesses offer return, and we are very grateful for that. So we want to keep in mind that we always want to build Christians with fire-resistant materials, because everyone will be tested sometime.—1 Cor. 3: 11-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Happily we can report, too, that there were 53,764 pioneers in the field every month on the average. This includes missionaries, special pioneers, regular pioneers, circuit and district servants. During the previous year there were 47,092 full-time field ministers. This was a fine increase of over 6,000. Of this number, there were 9,528 who were registered as missionaries and special pioneers. Then there were 2,138 who were in the circuit and district work. All of us certainly appreciate the good works they perform. To assist these brothers and sisters of ours who have so unselfishly given of their time and effort in Jehovah’s service, the Society used $4,551,014.87 to help them with their expenses. We are glad that we could do this and that the contributions on the part of the brothers the world around made it possible for the Watch Tower Society to give this financial assistance to missionaries, special pioneers, circuit and district servants. These brothers and sisters have done a wonderful work, and we are grateful to them. By their full devotion to our brothers in the congregations and in the isolated areas many new ones have been aided. The good counsel and assistance of the circuit and district servants have been of much benefit to the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We also have 1,717 members of the Bethel family working in the 96 branches throughout the world. This is an increase over last year’s membership of 1,591. A greater demand has been put on the Bethel families for more supplies and service, and this can easily be seen by what they have accomplished. During the past year they produced 8,802,794 bound books at all of their printing plants. They manufactured 14,651,142 booklets, and we had our greatest year in the printing of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font11"> magazines. We printed 127,531,779 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font11"> magazines and 123,873,853 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font11">magazines. This gave us a grand total of 251,405,632 magazines printed in one year’s time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">There were millions upon millions of handbills and tracts distributed. And we also had to print letters, letterheads, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font11"> and many other things for use by Jehovah’s people in advertising the King and the Kingdom. This incidental printing, small printing we call it, amounted to 442,217,434 pieces. So the increased Bethel family world wide had a lot to do and they are very happy for the privilege of doing it. Jehovah willing, they hope to do more for you in 1968.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When we think of the great witness given around the world by Jehovah’s witnesses’ devoting 183,995,180 hours to the field ministry we think of the 66,703,208 back-calls that were made too. Think of it! Sixty-six million return visits! This Jehovah’s witnesses did on Sundays, during the week, in the evenings, at any time it might be convenient to the people to see them. This in itself shows the zeal of God’s people and their love for the people of all nations. We recall Jesus’ own words that “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son,” and certainly, if Jehovah would do that so people might gain salvation, we, too, can exert ourselves by going to the people with this wonderful message of salvation through his Son and God’s kingdom. Our calling back on interested persons resulted in 943,108 regular weekly home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">You who have found the way of life certainly want others to know it and you have proved it by what you are continually doing year by year. Under Jehovah’s direction we will joyfully move ahead with this work, because the end is not yet. We are willing to conduct more home Bible studies with the people so that those who desire to know can clearly learn the truth from God’s Word and dedicate their lives also to Jehovah. This takes time but it brings results. What a joy it has been to every one of us to see 74,981 baptized, the second-highest number ever baptized in a single year! Evidently Jehovah has been directing his people to ‘cast their nets’ in the right places, and no one should be discouraged. No matter where we are, let us ‘cast our nets’ so as to catch some men alive, as Jesus said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">All of you brothers and sisters around the world are doing a fine work, and it certainly makes all of our hearts glad. What a marvelous year of work! What cause for rejoicing! And to think that 2,195,612 persons attended the Memorial! This is ah increase of 224,505 over the previous year. Surely we can say, Come, you people, and “take life’s water free.” (Rev. 22:17) By Jehovah's undeserved kindness we will continue to work hard to enliven the interest in people to flee Babylon the Great so as to live!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Out of the great number of persons that did attend the Memorial celebration on March 25, 1967, only 10,981 professed to be of the anointed. How grateful we are that some of the “little flock” are still with us and that some of the remnant of the body of Christ are still being used as the governing body, all of whom are of the anointed! So, together, the remnant and the “great crowd” will press on for another year, if this be Jehovah’s will, and longer, knowing that “in all the nations the good news has to be preached first.”—Mark 13:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It was indeed a pleasure to compile this information for the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">1968 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span><span class="font11"> In the reports from all the countries and the letters that the branch servants wrote, they all requested that I convey to Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere their warm love and best wishes. Each one of these branch servants expressed gratitude for what you have done as Jehovah’s witnesses in aiding them in all these different countries of the earth in supplying the Branches with literature and funds to keep the work moving ahead. All are very grateful for the loving-kindness you have shown to them. They feel that the only way they can tell each of you of their love for you Is to have it expressed in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font11"> It is indeed a pleasure to tell you by this means of their love for you, and of their faith, and of their joy in this wonderful work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Certainly this is no time to be discouraged, but it is a time for vigorous action in Jehovah’s service. There is every reason for us to continue ‘fishing’ and ‘casting our nets’ time and time again for a catch. Let us always keep in mind what our brothers are going through in various places in the way of persecution and opposition and yet remember their joy in declaring the good news of the Kingdom. As the years fly by we are glad we have shared in the great witness given for God’s kingdom, but we know that the end is not yet. So, together, by Jehovah’s help we are determined to do what Jesus said would be done: “And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.&quot; —Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Please remember, too, that our prayers are always In your behalf, requesting Jehovah to pour out upon you a blessing and to show you his favor as all of us together continue in this grand and glorious work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Your brother and fellow servant,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&gt; President</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society of Pennsylvania</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">P.S. We are sorry Sweden incorrectly reported 83,017 Bible studies. The correct figure is 6,918. Please change the grand total Bible studies to 867,009 instead of 943,108 on pages 28, 34, 43 and 287. Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Annual Meeting</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Pursuant to charter provisions and State statutes, the annual meeting of members of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania was held at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at 10 a.m., on Sunday, October 1, 1967, with a total attendance of 11,793.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The annual business meeting proper was preceded by a program that began at 8:30 a.m. In the absence of the president of the Society, N. H. Knorr, the vicepresident of the Society, F. W. Franz, presided. The meeting was opened by prayer offered by L. A. Swingle. The text for the day and comments made on it were handled by G. M. Couch. Brother M. H. Larson talked about new construction. Brother F. W. Franz spoke on the subject “In All the Nations the Good News Has to Be Preached First.” This was a very encouraging discourse and this excellent discussion on the yeartext for 1968 deeply impressed everyone. It will be published in the December 15, 1967, issue of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Brother Franz finished his discourse at ten o’clock and then opened the annual meeting. Notice of the annual meeting had been sent to 407 members, and, of those notified, 394 were present in person or by proxy. There were two vacancies on the board of directors that had to be filled, and Thomas J. Sullivan and Grant Suiter were unanimously reelected as directors of the Society for a term of three years. After handling the usual business of the Society, the chair requested L. K. Greenlees to make a report on Palestine, where he had recently visited. W. B. Akin, from Peru, gave a very interesting report on the missionary work in that land, as did A. L. Thompson on the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in Japan. A. D. Schroeder reported on the progress of the Kingdom Ministry School now being held in Brooklyn, New York, and R. W. Wallen gave a brief report on the work in the United States. Then the secretary and treasurer of the Society, Grant Suiter, read a number of messages that were received from members of the Watch Tower Society in different parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This very fine meeting, which adjourned at 11:30 a.m., proved to be spiritually beneficial to all who were in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On October 10, 1967, the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania met in the office of the president for the election of officers. Six members of the board were present and one was away. All of the officers were reelected to their positions unanimously, namely, N. H. Knorr, president; F. W. Franz, vice-president; Grant Suiter, secretary and treasurer, and J. O. Groh, assistant secretary and treasurer. The other directors are M. G. Henschel, L. A. Swingle and T. J. Sullivan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The president of the Society then read a report of the receipts and disbursements of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania for the service year of 1967. A statement of condition as of August 31, 1967, showing assets and liabilities and the net worth of the Society was also read to all present. N. H. Knorr then gave a general report of the past service year’s activity on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the world. The report was most encouraging and showed Jehovah’s rich blessing upon the work of his servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The directors of the Society are very appreciative of their privileges of service and with joy are anxious to go ahead with their respective duties during the coming year, having uppermost in their minds that this good news of the Kingdom must be preached first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WATCHTOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY OF NEW YORK, INC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The annual meeting of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., was held on Saturday, January 7, 1967, for the purpose of transacting the business normally coming before the members at the annual meeting. In view of the absence of the president, vice-president and the secretary, all of whom were attending conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses in South America, the assistant secretary and treasurer, J. O. Groh, presided. Of the 60 members, 54 were present at the annual meeting either in person or by proxy, so there was a quorum to carry on business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The present directors and officers for the New York corporation are: N. H. Knorr, president; F. W. Franz, vice-president; Grant Suiter, secretary and treasurer; J. O. Groh, assistant secretary and treasurer; G. M. Couch, M. H. Larson and L. K. Greenlees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Also, in all the nations the good news has to be preached first.”—Mark 13:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Nineteen hundred years ago the apostles were interested in the sign of the end of this system of things. Jesus described to them what his followers should be looking for when he said: “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, there wall be earthquakes in one place after another, there will be food shortages. These are a beginning of pangs of distress.” (Mark 13:8) Students of the Bible have found that this period of time really began in 1914 and that the thirteenth chapter of Mark closely describes conditions in the earth from 1914 onward until the end of this system of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of course, one of the things that was to be part of this sign was the preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom first in all the nations. This preaching work was to be done within the generation of mankind living in this system of things. (Matt. 24:34) Without question this ministry on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses must be very important if they were going to finish the preaching within this generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">By seeing the fulfillment of Bible prophecy, and also through study of Bible chronology, we have learned that the authority for Christ to rule began in 1914. In Revelation, the 12th chapter, there is a description of what happened when the Gentile Times ended and the Devil was cast out of heaven: “Now have come to pass the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ, because the accuser of our brothers has been hurled down, who accuses them day and night before our God! On this account be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them! Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.”—Rev. 12:10,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This is truly good news to know that the power and kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have already come to pass. So, then, this kingdom was established, and to prove that it was established the Devil was hurled down out of heaven, and since then </span><span class="font8">291</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">there has been great woe in all the earth. What we see occurring in the earth today proves this very fact, and this good news about the established kingdom of God must be heralded far and wide. This kingdom’s being established in the heavens is brand-new information. It is something that occurred in 1914, and as many people in the world as possible are to be told about this. In fact, this publicity information about this established heavenly kingdom must be preached first before the complete destruction of this system of things comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">This is truly the greatest news of our day, and Jehovah’s witnesses feel the importance of telling this good news of the Kingdom world wide. This year’s </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font11"> shows that Jehovah’s witnesses have again spent their time declaring the wonderful good news of the Kingdom world wide, in 197 lands in thousands upon thousands of cities, towns and villages. In millions of homes Jehovah’s witnesses have talked to the people about this kingdom of God. By many it was accepted as good news. Never in all the history of mankind has so much been said about God’s kingdom as in the last fifty years. The reason for this is that Jehovah God through his Son Christ Jesus has established the Kingdom in the heavens and wants that news declared far and wide. Jehovah’s witnesses know that and they are putting forth every effort to preach it first before the end comes. God’s servants in the earth are happy that they have this grand privilege and they will continue to preach this wonderful message in vindication of Jehovah’s name and Word right down to the end. Thousands upon thousands of people today are hearing the message and are joining with Jehovah’s witnesses in preaching this good news of the Kingdom. In fact, this past year 74,981 individuals dedicated their lives to Jehovah and were baptized by water immersion in symbol of their dedication. They have declared publicly that they, too, want to preach the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom in all the nations first before the end comes.</span></p>

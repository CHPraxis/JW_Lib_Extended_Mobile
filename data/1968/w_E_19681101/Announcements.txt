FIELD MINISTRY
Bible prophecy and current events indicate that little time remains for this wicked system of things. How vital, then, for people to remember their Creator now, while there is opportunity! (Eccl. 12:1) Jehovah’s witnesses are wisely using their time in order to help others remember their Creator. An outstanding way they do this is by conducting home Bible studies. During the month of November they will be offering help to interested people by means of a free home Bible study. Additionally, as an aid in these Bible discussions, they will offer the fine new book that presents Bible truths so clearly—The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life—on a contribution of 25c.
“BUY TRUTH ITSELF”
Truth is precious. The Bible book of Proverbs says: “Buy truth itself and do not sell it—wisdom and discipline and understanding.” (Prov. 23:23) Can you imagine a space scientist trying to plot the path of a rocket to the moon with inaccurate or untruthful information from his electronic computers? How much more important is truth, then, in preparing our own course to gain everlasting life? How well do you understand the Bible, the “holy writings” that the apostle Paul said “are able to make you wise for salvation”? (2 Tim. 3:15) Obtain and read the invaluable 192-page Bible-study aid The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. Send only 25c.

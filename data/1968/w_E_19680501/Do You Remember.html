<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have you read recent issues of <em>The Watchtower </em>carefully? If so, you should recognize these important points.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>● What is ‘the spirit that returns to God’ when a person dies?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is the active force of life, an impersonal force that activates both animal and human souls. It can be likened to electrical power that activates all kinds of electrical motors.—P. 6.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>● How many copies of the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines have been published and distributed in the past twenty years to carry to all people the good news of God’s kingdom?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">More than 1,300,000,000 copies of The Watchtower in 74 languages, and more than 1,100,000,000 copies of <em>Awake! </em>in 26 languages. Laid end to end, they would circle the globe fourteen times.—Pp. 21, 22.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>● How many hours did Jehovah’s witnesses devote to preaching the Kingdom message during their 1967 service year?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">183,995,180 hours. That means that, on an average, each Witness devoted 168 hours to this service during the year.—P. 27.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>● Why did God warn the Israelites to have nothing to do with the pagan inhabitants of the Promised Land?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">To protect them against being ensnared in false worship. Though they might begin with apparently harmless social courtesies, these could lead to their eating things sacrificed to false gods.—P. 47.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>● Why are Jehovah’s witnesses the target of bitter persecution in the African nation of Malawi?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">It is because Jehovah’s witnesses refuse to <span id="page286" class="pageNum" data-no="286" data-before-text="286"></span>violate their Christian neutrality and buy political membership cards in Malawi’s Congress Party. As Christians, they are “no part of the world.”—Pp. 72, 73.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>● What are some common fallacies that parents should avoid in the training of their children?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The idea that their children are “little angels”; the Bible shows that all are born with a tendency to do what is bad. The belief that it is a kindness to give to their children all the things the parents did not have when they were young; it is wiser to give gifts in proportion to the child’s ability to appreciate them and use them properly.—Pp. 80, 81.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>● Upon what false assumption is the claim made that Mary is the mother of God?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">It is based on the wrong assumption that Jesus is God. The Bible teaches that Jesus is the Son of God, so Mary was the earthly mother of God’s Son.—P. 104.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>● Whom does the Assyrian king Sennacherib picture today?</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Satan the Devil.—P. 141.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn"><strong>● The destruction of sacred pillars of false worship in Hezekiah’s day fits what aspect of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses today?</strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">It fits the polemic aspect of their work of exposing the war-mongering, nationalistic, idol-worshiping leaders of false religion as being rejected by Jehovah.—P. 151.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn"><strong>● Why do true Christians avoid Easter celebrations and customs?</strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Easter is rooted in paganism and ancient sex worship.—P. 168.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn"><strong>● What are two qualities that Christians must cultivate in order to avoid thinking more of themselves than necessary?</strong></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Submissiveness and humility.—P. 182.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sn"><strong>● What is “the resurrection on the last day” of which Martha spoke at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:24-43:11:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>John 11:24</strong></a><strong>, and when does it take place?</strong></p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">It is the general resurrection in which thousands of millions will be brought from their tombs to earthly life. It takes place after the battle of Armageddon.—P. 200.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sn"><strong>● What can be done to prevent festive occasions from degrading into revelries?</strong></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Sensual dances and loud, noisy music should be avoided. A reasonable hour should be set for the festivities to end. Keep conversation upbuilding, in harmony with Bible principles.—Pp. 215, 216.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sn"><strong>● Why is Melchizedek, the ancient king-priest of Salem, important to us today?</strong></p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">He is a prophetic figure of Jehovah’s heavenly King and great High Priest, Jesus Christ.—Pp. 235, 240.</p>

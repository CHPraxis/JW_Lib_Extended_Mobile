“Good News for All Nations” District Assembly
ASSEMBLY time is drawing near. Yes, in just a little over two months the first ones of the “Good News for All Nations” District Assemblies of Jehovah’s Witnesses will begin. Everyone who is sincerely interested in God’s purpose for mankind is welcome to attend.
Are you making definite arrangements to be there? Will you be on hand when the program begins on Thursday afternoon? We urge you to do so. And for Thursday evening, we especially encourage you family groups, parents along with children, all to be present. That program is being prepared with you in mind.
At each assembly there will be arrangements for baptism of those who have dedicated themselves to Jehovah. If you have in mind getting immersed at one of these assemblies, we suggest that you talk to your congregation overseer about it now, because there are some matters that he would like to discuss with you by way of preparation.
One of the highlights of the assembly will be the public talk “Man’s Rule About to Give Way to God’s Rule.” Yes, we are living in that thrilling time. Be sure to attend.
Assembly locations for all of the United States, Canada, Bermuda and the British Isles are listed below. Five weeks before the assembly of your choice is due to begin, you may write Watch Tower Convention at the rooming address given for that city, and the Rooming Department will gladly assist in making arrangements for your accommodations.

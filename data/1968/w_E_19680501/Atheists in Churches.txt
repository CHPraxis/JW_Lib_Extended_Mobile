Atheists in Churches
“Lutheran Church Historian Martin Marty argues that all too many pews are filled on Sunday with practical atheists—disguised nonbelievers who behave during the rest of the week as if God did not exist.” (Time, April 8, 1966) Such is the fruit of religious Christendom, which outwardly professes to be Christian but whose heart inwardly is far removed from true Christianity. In this respect she is like the religious leaders of the first century about whom Jesus said: “You hypocrites, Isaiah aptly prophesied about you, when he said, ‘This people honors me with their lips, yet their heart is far removed from me.’”—Matt. 15:7, 8.

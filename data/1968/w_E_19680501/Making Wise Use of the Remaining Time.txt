Making Wise Use of the Remaining Time
 1. What false belief do many have today?
MANY in this world, particularly scientists, educators and political leaders, accept the view that man has been on earth millions of years. They believe that he has arrived at his present state of development by the process of evolution, and that this process will continue into the indefinite future. Because of this they feel that man has unlimited opportunities and time to make a success of his plans. But the Christian is not fooled by this Satanic doctrine. God’s chief adversary would like all persons to believe that there is no set time for anything, even God’s purposes. But the Christian, having full confidence in God and his Word, knows that man does not have an indefinite future in this system of things. He realizes where we stand in the stream of time, and that God’s judgments against this system of things are soon to be executed.
2, 3. (a) What can be said of many of the dates secular historians give? (b) What is the safest guide in these matters?
2 With accurate knowledge of Jehovah and his purposes, the Christian rejects the speculations of men. This includes the speculations of historians who do not believe the Bible, but who attach fantastic dates to events in man’s history. Concerning the unreliability of such dates the book The Secret of the Hittites, by C. W. Ceram, in the chapter entitled “The Science of Historical Dating,” states:
“Anyone approaching the study of ancient history for the first time must be impressed by the positive way modern historians date events which took place thousands of years ago. In the course of further study this wonder will, if anything, increase. For as we examine the sources of ancient history we see how scanty, inaccurate, or downright false, the records were even at the time they were first written. And poor as they originally were, they are poorer still as they have come down to us: half destroyed by the tooth of time or by the carelessness and rough usage of men.
“As a matter of fact, the more we pursue our studies, the less are we impressed by the dates which initially filled us with respect. We begin to recognize the framework of chronological history for what it is—a purely hypothetical structure, and one which threatens to come apart at every joint. Crooked and tottering, it gives us a picture of a strangely arbitrary history, while at the same time our instinct tells us that the ancient civilizations must have had some sort of reasonable and organic growth. When we reach this point in our studies we begin to be doubtful of every single date!
“To give an example of the untrustworthiness of chronology: investigators toiling for a century have had to shift the date for the unification of Egypt by King Menes, who established the first Egyptian dynasty, from 5867 B.C. to 2900 B.C. And even this latter date, which is considered the real beginning of Egyptian history, has not yet been determined with complete certainty. . . .
“But as we go even deeper into the subject, our respect for the achievements of historical detective work returns. We learn that the scholars have been careful to distinguish between ‘assured’ and ‘assumed’ dates. And we discover that the chronological framework of ancient history rests upon at least a few firm points. Certain key dates, around which other dates are mustered, can be determined almost without error. They are ‘assured.’”
3 Hence, outside the Bible’s timetable, most dates set by historians are unreliable. Only a few “assured,” or absolute, dates, such as 539 B.C.E., can be accepted as certain. Christians, confident in Jehovah’s Word, know that the internal evidence of the Bible is the safest guide in these matters. This helps us to determine with great accuracy where we stand in the stream of time, particularly in regard to the seventh period of time, or “day,” mentioned in Genesis.—Gen. 2:2, 3.
THE SEVENTH DAY
 4. When were Adam and Eve created?
4 According to reliable Bible chronology Adam was created in the year 4026 B.C.E., likely in the autumn of the year, at the end of the sixth day of creation. Then God brought the animals to man to name. Yet, of Adam, Genesis states these words of Jehovah: “It is not good for the man to continue by himself.” (Gen. 2:18) Adam would realize this lonely condition very quickly, perhaps in just a few days or a few weeks. He would realize he needed another earthling with whom he could communicate, share his experiences, and his life. Nor would his naming the animals take an unduly long time. The basic animal kinds could have been relatively quickly named, for when such basic kinds were taken into the ark in Noah’s day, it did not involve millions of beasts, but perhaps only a few hundred basic kinds. Thus, Adam’s naming of the animals and his realizing that he needed a counterpart would have occupied only a brief time after his creation. Since it was also Jehovah’s purpose for man to multiply and fill the earth, it is logical that he would create Eve soon after Adam, perhaps just a few weeks or months later in the same year, 4026 B.C.E. After her creation, God’s rest day, the seventh period, immediately followed.
 5. How can we calculate where we stand in the stream of time?
5 Therefore, God’s seventh day and the time man has been on earth apparently run parallel. To calculate where man is in the stream of time relative to God’s seventh day of 7,000 years, we need to determine how long a time has elapsed from the year of Adam and Eve’s creation in 4026 B.C.E. From the autumn of that year to the autumn of 1 B.C.E., there would be 4,025 years. From the autumn of 1 B.C.E. to the autumn of 1 C.E. is one year (there was no zero year). From the autumn of 1 C.E. to the autumn of 1967 is a total of 1,966 years. Adding 4,025 and 1 and 1,966, we get 5,992 years from the autumn of 4026 B.C.E. to the autumn of 1967. Thus, eight years remain to account for a full 6,000 years of the seventh day. Eight years from the autumn of 1967 would bring us to the autumn of 1975, fully 6,000 years into God’s seventh day, his rest day.
6, 7. (a) To what can the 1,000-year reign of Christ be likened? Why? (b) What fills Jehovah’s servants with anticipation now?
6 After 6,000 years of misery, toil, trouble, sickness and death under Satan’s rule, mankind is indeed in dire need of relief, a rest. The seventh day of the Jewish week, the sabbath, would well picture the final 1,000-year reign of God’s kingdom under Christ when mankind would be uplifted from 6,000 years of sin and death. (Rev. 20:6) Hence, when Christians note from God’s timetable the approaching end of 6,000 years of human history, it fills them with anticipation. Particularly is this true because the great sign of the “last days” has been in the course of fulfillment since the beginning of the “time of the end” in 1914. And, as Jesus said, “this generation will by no means pass away until all these things occur.” (Matt. 24:34) Some of the generation that discerned the beginning of the time of the end in 1914 will still be alive on earth to witness the end of this present wicked system of things at the battle of Armageddon.—Rev. 16:14, 16.
7 The immediate future is certain to be filled with climactic events, for this old system is nearing its complete end. Within a few years at most the final parts of Bible prophecy relative to these “last days” will undergo fulfillment, resulting in the liberation of surviving mankind into Christ’s glorious 1,000-year reign. What difficult days, but, at the same time, what grand days are just ahead!
 8. Can anyone say with certainty when the battle of Armageddon will come?
8 Does this mean that the year 1975 will bring the battle of Armageddon? No one can say with certainty what any particular year will bring. Jesus said: “Concerning that day or the hour nobody knows.” (Mark 13:32) Sufficient is it for God’s servants to know for a certainty that, for this system under Satan, time is running out rapidly. How foolish a person would be not to be awake and alert to the limited time remaining, to the earthshaking events soon to take place, and to the need to work out one’s salvation!
THE VALUE OF TIME
 9. What is one way the value of time can be determined?
9 Knowing about God’s timetable, where we are in the stream of time, is one thing; using the time available is another. If an understanding of time is valuable, using it wisely is even more so. Time is considered so valuable that some say “time is money.” It is precious, valuable, a prized commodity. One way to determine the value of time is the way the value of merchandise is often calculated—by the supply and demand. For instance, during the days of the pony express in the United States, it used to cost several dollars to send a letter that now costs about six cents. Why the difference? Because in the old days there were very few pony express riders. The supply was very limited, but the demand for their service was great, so they were valuable. But today the supply of mail carriers is much greater, therefore not as costly.
10, 11. Why is time so precious in this system of things?
10 By the standard of supply and demand, then, how should time be valued? Is the supply of time for humans in this system limited? Yes. Is the demand for more time, and for an extended lifetime, great? By all means! For imperfect humans subject to death the supply of time is very limited, but the demand for it is great. So time is extremely valuable. At best, man’s life-span is about seventy or eighty years. A few live a bit longer. But it is much, much less in many places where disease, malnutrition or violence cut it short. Even for the healthy, as they get older their strength will ebb, so that they cannot do as much in a given amount of time as they used to do. Eventually, the day will come when they can do nothing at all, because death will have claimed them as victims. That is why Ecclesiastes 12:1 counsels: “Remember, now, your grand Creator in the days of your young manhood, before the calamitous days proceed to come, or the years have arrived when you will say: ‘I have no delight in them.’”
11 In any way that we view the matter, whether young or old, our time is precious. Particularly is this true for worshipers of Jehovah. How often we hear those busy in the ministry proclaiming the good news of God’s kingdom say: “Why, there just isn’t enough time in a day!” Yes, there is a great demand for time everywhere. It is even more valuable than money, for money lost can be replaced, but time lost cannot be replaced. It is gone forever.
12. Particularly in view of what is time valuable?
12 The apostle Paul put a high value on time. When he wrote to the Christians at Ephesus he stated: “So keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, buying out the opportune time for yourselves, because the days are wicked.” (Eph. 5:15, 16) Paul told the Ephesians to put the more important things first in their lives, even if it cost something, even if it cost time from other pursuits. Now, if such was true in Paul’s day, how much more so is it true in our day! By measuring and calculating time, we know we are living in the final years of this system of things. It is crumbling before our very eyes in one orgy of violence and crime after another. Minute by minute, day by day, year by year it moves without fail toward its catastrophic end. There is no going backward for this system. How true, then, in our day, what Paul stated at 1 Corinthians 7:29: “Moreover, this I say, brothers, the time left is reduced.” It is especially reduced in our day, as we are near the end of 6,000 years of human history.
13. What is Satan’s condition relative to time?
13 Satan the Devil also knows that the time left is very reduced. Revelation 12:12 states: “The Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.” Satan the Devil has a real problem where time is concerned. He has very little left. What he would not give to have more time to work out his debased purposes! But he does not, and so is furious. You can be certain that he will use that remaining time to his best advantage in opposing God and his servants on earth. “And the dragon grew wrathful at the woman, and went off to wage war with the remaining ones of her seed, who observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness to Jesus.”—Rev. 12:17.
USE IT WISELY
14. How can we wisely use time today?
14 Ours are “critical times hard to deal with,” for they are the “last days.” (2 Tim. 3:1) “Wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled.” (2 Tim. 3:13) Surely, Christians want to use their remaining time in this system of things wisely, for the right purpose, so they are not overcome by these bad times so “hard to deal with” due to Satan’s schemes and assaults. But how can we do this? One way is by not wasting time on unprofitable pursuits. This we will do if, to the best of our ability and circumstances, we follow the lead of Jehovah through his visible organization on earth today. Through his visible arrangement we receive counsel on how best to use our time. Meetings are provided for receiving uplift spiritually. There is also wholesome, stimulating activity in preaching the truths we learn to others.—Matt. 24:45-47.
15. Why is a schedule of Christian activity a protection?
15 True, much of our time is consumed in preparing, going to meetings and out in the ministry. In fact, it seems as though such a schedule leaves little time for other pursuits. But do you think such is an accident? Does Jehovah not know what is best for his people in these very dark and critical days? Aside from the primary purpose of educating us in Jehovah’s purposes and requirements so we can carry out his will, the consuming of our time at meetings and in the ministry means that God’s servants are doing the right thing and will not be in another place doing the wrong thing! The more time they spend working with Jehovah’s visible organization, the less time they will have left to get into difficulty. Yes, the arrangements Jehovah has provided now are certainly a source of great protection. “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower. Into it the righteous runs and is given protection.”—Prov. 18:10.
16, 17. What is the proper view of rest and recreation?
16 Making wise use of the remaining time does not mean we will get no rest or recreation. Such is proper, but the kind we choose and the time we devote to it should be balanced with our Christian obligations. True, we would all like more time to enjoy such things as Jehovah’s creation and other forms of recreation, and to a degree we can do that now. But the real enjoyment will come in Jehovah’s new system where there will be real and everlasting enjoyment of all the things Jehovah has provided and will yet provide. But when a ship is sinking, one’s thoughts should be more on survival than recreation or rest. This old system is sinking into disbelief, immorality and degradation. Soon it will sink completely out of sight when it is given its deathblow by Jehovah’s chief heavenly executioner Christ Jesus. That is why the primary consideration of God-fearing persons now is doing the will of Jehovah and working for survival.
17 Those who have already separated themselves from this dying old system can be likened to those who have successfully abandoned a sinking ship and are in a lifeboat. Their thoughts should be concentrated on reaching a safe shore regardless of the effort required. Jehovah’s servants have come to a place of survival, a place where they can learn of everlasting life in a righteous new system. But there are others who also want survival. They, too, need to know of Jehovah’s will and promises. They need to be aided, even though it means sacrificing one’s own time and effort from personal pursuits. Such giving of oneself is the best way to make wise use of the remaining time.
18. How can time be used even more wisely?
18 To use our time even more wisely, we need to become proficient in our lifesaving work. We want to do more than just occupy our time with the ministry. We want to make the best use of that time we spend, and we can do that if we put our heart into what we do and endeavor to improve the quality of our service to Jehovah. At 1 Corinthians 9:26 Paul said: “The way I am directing my blows is so as not to be striking the air.” Paul was not going to waste time and energy in accomplishing little or nothing. He would learn to direct his efforts skillfully to use in the best way the time he spent. We can do the same. If we do, we will be productive in the ministry, diligently working to find, feed and tenderly care for interested persons with whom we come in contact.
19. How is time used wisely regardless of which feature of the Christian’s daily activity he is performing?
19 No matter what feature of our daily activity we are performing, whether it is going to Christian meetings, teaching others about God’s purposes in their homes, or in our work in offices, factories, farms or homes, we will make wise use of our time if we perform that activity in a manner that will honor Jehovah. Even though we may not be in a position to be a full-time preacher, we will want to conduct ourselves as Christians, working hard to do as Paul counseled: “You should put away the old personality which conforms to your former course of conduct and which is being corrupted according to his deceptive desires; but . . . you should be made new in the force actuating your mind, and should put on the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty.”—Eph. 4:22-24.
ADVANCING IN TRUE WORSHIP
20, 21. What should individuals who have not used their time wisely in the past do?
20 Some, after considering the many things they could be doing to make wise use of time, will recognize that they have not honored God well in the past. Certainly before coming to an accurate knowledge of God and his Word, they did not honor Jehovah. Perhaps there was even a dishonoring. But do not waste more time dwelling on the past that is squandered. There is nothing you can do to bring it back. What you can do is to learn from the experience and determine not to repeat it.
21 At times individuals let their unwise past hinder them. They worry over it to the point where it interferes with the wise use of their time now and in the future. That is not appreciating to the full that Jehovah is a loving and forgiving God, and that what really counts is what we are doing today and will do tomorrow. Jehovah is merciful and forgiving if we are truly repentant and work hard to obey his commandments. “‘Come, now, you people, and let us set matters straight between us,’ says Jehovah. ‘Though the sins of you people should prove to be as scarlet, they will be made white just like snow; though they should be red like crimson cloth, they will become even like wool. If you people show willingness and do listen, the good of the land you will eat.’” (Isa. 1:18, 19) Accept that loving-kindness, then strive to gain Jehovah’s approval by advancing in true worship.
22. (a) Even to whom does Jehovah’s mercy extend? (b) What appreciation should this build?
22 The love and mercy of God extend even toward those who had once been cut off from the Christian congregation. Such ones, after coming back into Jehovah’s favor and demonstrating their faith and loyalty, now have the prospect of being used in positions of responsibility in the Christian congregation. Is that not a wonderful expression of Jehovah’s love? If he exercises such forgiveness toward those once cut off, do you not think he will do the same for those who have not, but who have been previously unwise in the use of their time? Such marvelous attributes of Jehovah should make us love Him even more, should make us reaffirm our desire to make wise use of our time by advancing in true worship now and forever, giving the best we have. As Exodus 23:19 says: “The best of the first ripe fruits of your ground you are to bring to the house of Jehovah your God.”
23. What should the Christian’s outlook be?
23 Therefore, learn how to improve your worship to God, not only in quantity, but, even more important, in quality. Stretch forward to the things ahead, forgetting the bad things behind. Pursue the goal of everlasting life, when we will have endless time to enjoy what Jehovah provides for obedient mankind. Look forward to and work toward a progressively enriched and happy life of service to Jehovah. Making wise use of this present time to honor God in all we do, we will then be among those doing as Psalm 115:18 says: “We ourselves will bless Jah from now on and to time indefinite.” For those who make such wise use of their time now, Psalm 37:34 holds out the promise: “Hope in Jehovah and keep his way, and he will exalt you to take possession of the earth. When the wicked ones are cut off, you will see it.” With time running out for the wicked, it is truly time to be molded by God’s words of truth so we can bless Jehovah daily and thus be preserved to bless him to time indefinite.

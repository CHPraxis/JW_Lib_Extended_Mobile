“Prove Yourself a Blessing”
●When Jehovah directed Abraham (Abram) to move to another land, God had a loving purpose in view. Abraham responded, and as a result he was blessed, and he proved himself a blessing to others. The account at Genesis 12:1-4 reads: “Jehovah proceeded to say to Abram: ‘Go your way out of your country and from your relatives and from the house of your father to the country that I shall show you; . . . and prove yourself a blessing.’ . . . At that Abram went just as Jehovah had spoken to him, and Lot went with him.”

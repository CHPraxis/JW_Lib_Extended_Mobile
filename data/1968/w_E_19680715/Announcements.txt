FIELD MINISTRY
Jehovah’s people have long rejoiced in the victories of their God Jehovah. In harmony with the prophecy at Psalm 68:24 they want men everywhere to see Jehovah’s victory processions. All the preaching that Jehovah’s people do throughout the earth today is really a part of this foretold victory procession. In carrying on their preaching work during July, Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering Bible study-aid publications from house to house. The offer will be the book Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God, with a booklet, on a contribution of 50c.
WHERE CAN YOU FIND COMFORT?
Disappointments face us on all sides. Evidence is to be seen in the unsettled world conditions, the poverty-protest marches, student revolts against classroom and school administration, strikes against employers, rebellion against governmental controls. How will it all end? In an amicable solution of all social issues or as many are beginning to fear, in either anarchy or a police state? Regardless of what men do, God’s purpose for blessing this earth will not fail. Do you know how and when it will take place? how you can benefit? Take comfort! Read “Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.” Send only 50c. Send now and receive free a booklet on a timely Bible subject.

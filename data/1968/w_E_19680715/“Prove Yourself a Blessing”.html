<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">●When Jehovah directed Abraham (Abram) to move to another land, God had a loving purpose in view. Abraham responded, and as a result he was blessed, and he proved himself a blessing to others. The account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:12:1-1:12:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 12:1-4</a> reads: “Jehovah proceeded to say to Abram: ‘Go your way out of your country and from your relatives and from the house of your father to the country that I shall show you; . . . and prove yourself a blessing.’ . . . At that Abram went just as Jehovah had spoken to him, and Lot went with him.”</p>

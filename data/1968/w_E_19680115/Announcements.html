<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The faithful men of old times, such as Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the other prophets, endured many trials in proving their faith and love for God. Was it because they were powerful physically? No, but, rather, it was mainly their powerful spiritual condition, their faith, that enabled them to serve and please God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:32-58:11:34" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 11:32-34</a>) The same is true with Jehovah’s Christian witnesses today. Though having physical limitations it is powerful spirituality that enables them to endure successfully the tests of faith in these critical times. Thousands of persons have been aided by them to gain such spirituality through the faith-strengthening magazine, <em>The Watchtower. </em>Throughout January, Jehovah’s witnesses will be offering to all interested persons a year’s subscription for this Bible magazine, along with three Bible booklets, for $1.</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
Festivals are happy occasions. To the faithful Jews of ancient Israel, the annual festivals were reminders of their blessed lot as God’s people, carrying on worship in purity and truth. Today true Christians celebrate those festivals in an antitypical way. They celebrate the festival of unleavened cakes, for instance, by keeping pure, by avoiding the leaven of unrighteousness and by holding to the truth of God’s Word. (1 Cor. 5:8) To help others hold to the truth that means everlasting life, Jehovah’s witnesses freely teach others the Bible. As a further aid to interested persons during April, they will be offering a year’s subscription for this fine Bible-study aid The Watchtower, with three booklets, for just $1. Take advantage of the opportunity to obtain it.

FIELD MINISTRY
Many persons today express a desire to have contentment, but very few really have it. Why? Because real contentment comes from knowing and serving the true God, Jehovah. Jehovah’s witnesses enjoy this contentment and are happy to aid others to possess it. During February, as they share in their Christian ministry, they will offer to all persons the outstanding aid to godly contentment, The Watchtower, with three booklets, on a $1 contribution.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU?
What does the preaching of the “good news of the kingdom” mean to you? Its extent and its effectiveness are of vital importance to you, because when it is finished this system’s end will come. Read Mark 13:4, 10. Viewed in this light, a report of the work throughout the world takes on new meaning. It is just another reason why you will want the 1968 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The response in the remote corners of the earth will inspire hope in you as the good news spreads out farther and farther. Send for your copy of this 416-page report. Only 50c. Send also for the beautifully illustrated 1968 calendar on this inspiring theme. Only 25c.

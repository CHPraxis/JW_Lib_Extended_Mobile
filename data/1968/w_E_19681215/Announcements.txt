FINDING A WAY OF DELIVERANCE
From all over the world come reports of people studying the Bible with similar results: they are recognizing that the remaining time for this present system of things is fast running out, yet a way of deliverance has been provided. They are learning that God has a purpose for our generation that will involve everyone living whether all persons want it so or not. They are accepting the responsibility of doing something for themselves but also of taking these lifesaving findings to others. Their experiences, and those of thousands of others of Jehovah’s witnesses, are to be found in the 1969 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Sent postpaid for only 50c. Send also for the beautiful 1969 calendar depicting a similar time of deliverance in Bible times. It is only 25c.
FIELD MINISTRY
What takes first place in one’s life? Is it one’s family, secular work, some hobby or perhaps sports? It may be that one has several interests in life, each taking a relative position according to the importance placed upon it. To Christians, however, the kingdom of God comes first in their lives. And during the month of December Jehovah’s witnesses will be putting first the preaching of the Kingdom good news by engaging in their house-to-house ministry and conducting free home Bible studies. (Mark 13:10) They will also be offering to interested persons a copy of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures along with an appropriate booklet for $1; or they may combine the Bible and a copy of the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, for $1.25.

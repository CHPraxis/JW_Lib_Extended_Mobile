FIELD MINISTRY
Millions of persons are in bondage to superstition and false religion. Shackled by doctrines that are contrary to the Bible, they are in fear of mortal men and religious systems. But the truth that Jesus Christ taught can free them. All who would be free today and who would stay free spiritually need to follow that Fine Shepherd and walk in the paths of divine truth. First, however, people must wake up to their bondage to religious superstition and falsehood. To help people wake up and break free and stay free by means of God’s truth, Jehovah’s witnesses are offering in their ministry during the month of October a year’s subscription for the Awake! magazine, with three Bible-study-aid booklets, on a contribution of $1.
NOW OVER 5 MILLION!
So much in demand is The Watchtower’s fine companion magazine, Awake!, that over five million copies each issue in twenty-six languages are needed to supply its readers. Here is what some have written about it: “Sincerely hoping this magazine never quits coming to my house.” “Factual, unbiased, instructive, vital.” “No other magazine brings so much wisdom, true facts, health information and current events.” “Painstaking research.” “My sixteenth year as a subscriber though I am not one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” Send for your subscription today. Only $1. Send now and receive free three timely booklets on vital Bible subjects.

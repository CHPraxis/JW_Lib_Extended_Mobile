FIELD MINISTRY
What takes first place in one’s life? Is it one’s family, secular work, some hobby or perhaps sports? It may be one has several interests in life each taking a relative position according to the importance placed upon it. To Christians, however, the kingdom of God comes first in their lives. And during the month of December Jehovah’s witnesses will be putting first the preaching of the Kingdom good news by engaging in their house-to-house ministry and conducting free home Bible studies. (Mark 13:10) They will also be offering to interested persons a copy of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures along with an appropriate booklet for $1; or they may combine the Bible and a copy of the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, for $1.25.

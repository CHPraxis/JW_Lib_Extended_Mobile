What Does the Bible Say?



Is religion man-made?

SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE that religion is a human invention; others think that God uses religion to help people draw close to him. What do you think?
WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS
There is a “religion that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father.” (James 1:27, footnote) Pure, or true, religion comes from God.
WHAT ELSE WE LEARN FROM THE BIBLE
  To please God, a religion must be based on Bible truth.—John 4:23, 24.

  Religions based on human ideas are futile.—Mark 7:7, 8.





Is it necessary to belong to a religion?

WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
  Yes

  No

  It depends


WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS
“Let us consider one another so as to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking our meeting together.” (Hebrews 10:24, 25) God wants his worshippers to gather as an organized group.
WHAT ELSE WE LEARN FROM THE BIBLE
  Those who worship God together should be united in belief.—1 Corinthians 1:10, 11.

  Members of the religion that God approves form a worldwide brotherhood.—1 Peter 2:17.

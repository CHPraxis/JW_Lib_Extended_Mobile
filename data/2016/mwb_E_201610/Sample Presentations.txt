Inviting people to the meeting





Sample Presentations



AWAKE!






Question: Some people doubt whether Jesus really existed, while others are convinced he did. Still others say there’s no way to know for sure. What’s your opinion?
Offer: This issue of Awake! considers what the evidence shows.



TEACH THE TRUTH






Question: What happens when we die?
Scripture: Joh 11:11-14
Truth: When a person dies, his life ends. So we do not need to fear an afterlife. Jesus compared death to sleep. Just as he did with Lazarus, Jesus will “wake up” our dead loved ones so that they can enjoy life on earth again.—Job 14:14.



CONGREGATION MEETING INVITATION (inv)






Offer: I’d like to invite you to a free Bible talk. It will be given at the local Kingdom Hall, our place of worship. [Offer the meeting invitation, point out the time and location of the weekend meeting, and mention the theme of the public talk.]
Question: Have you been to a Kingdom Hall before? [If appropriate, show the video What Happens at a Kingdom Hall?]

“Train a Boy in the Way He Should Go”









Proverbs contains sound advice for parents. Just as bending young branches influences their growth, training children inclines them toward serving Jehovah when they grow up.
22:6





  Training children properly takes much time and effort

  Parents must set a good example, and they must carefully instruct, admonish, encourage, and discipline their children


22:15
  Discipline is loving training that corrects the mind and heart

  Children require different types of discipline

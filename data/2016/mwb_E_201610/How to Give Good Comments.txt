How to Give Good Comments









Good comments build up the congregation. (Ro 14:19) They also benefit those who give them. (Pr 15:23, 28) Therefore, we should try to give at least one comment at each meeting. Of course, we will not be called on every time we raise our hand. Therefore, it is best to prepare several comments.



A good comment . . .

  is simple, clear, and brief. In most cases, it can be given in 30 seconds or less

  is best given in your own words

  is not a needless repetition of a previous comment





If you are called on first, . . .

  give a simple, direct answer to the question





If the question has been answered, you could . . .

  show how a cited scripture bears on the point under consideration

  mention how the matter affects our lives

  explain how the information can be used

  briefly relate an experience that highlights a key point

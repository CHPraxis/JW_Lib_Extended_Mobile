We Are Wonderfully Made




David meditated on the evidence of God’s good qualities reflected in His creation. He confidently used his life to serve Jehovah.








When David thought deeply about creation, he was moved to praise Jehovah:

139:14
  “I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way I am wonderfully made”


139:15
  “My bones were not hidden from you when I was made in secret, when I was woven in the depths of the earth”


139:16
  “Your eyes even saw me as an embryo; all its parts were written in your book”

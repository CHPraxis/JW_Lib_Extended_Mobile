<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>WHY IMPORTANT: </strong>Meetings provide regular occasions to “sing to Jehovah” and to “praise him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:149:1-19:149:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps 149:1</a>) At the meetings, we are taught to do God’s will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:143:10-19:143:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 143:10</a>) Interested ones and Bible students usually make greater progress once they begin attending meetings.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sc">Some who attend our meetings for the first time have drawn the conclusion: “God is really among you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:14:25-46:14:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1Co 14:25</a>) During the month of October, we will make a concerted effort to invite people to the weekend meeting. We will offer the congregation meeting invitation and, if the householder allows, play the video <a href="http://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502014315&amp;wtlocale=E"><em>What Happens at a Kingdom Hall?</em></a> A sample presentation will be viewed and discussed next week.</p>

Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Encouraging Interested Ones to Attend Meetings









WHY IMPORTANT: Meetings provide regular occasions to “sing to Jehovah” and to “praise him.” (Ps 149:1) At the meetings, we are taught to do God’s will. (Ps 143:10) Interested ones and Bible students usually make greater progress once they begin attending meetings.
OCTOBER OFFER: CONGREGATION MEETING INVITATION
Some who attend our meetings for the first time have drawn the conclusion: “God is really among you.” (1Co 14:25) During the month of October, we will make a concerted effort to invite people to the weekend meeting. We will offer the congregation meeting invitation and, if the householder allows, play the video What Happens at a Kingdom Hall? A sample presentation will be viewed and discussed next week.


HOW TO DO IT:
  Extend an invitation as soon as possible. You need not wait until a Bible study has been established.—Re 22:17






  Explain to the interested person what he can expect and what will be discussed at the next meeting. The following can be of help in this regard: the congregation meeting invitation, the video What Happens at a Kingdom Hall?, and lessons 5 and 7 of the Jehovah’s Will brochure






  Offer help. Does the interested one need a ride or assistance with choosing appropriate clothing? Sit next to him at the meeting, and share your publications. Introduce him to others

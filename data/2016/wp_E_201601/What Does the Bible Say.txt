WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY?



What happens when we die?

SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE that we live on in another form, while others feel that death is the end of everything. What do you believe?
WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS
“The dead know nothing at all.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5) When we die, we cease to exist.
WHAT ELSE WE LEARN FROM THE BIBLE
  The first man, Adam, returned to the dust when he died. (Genesis 2:7; 3:19) Likewise, all others who die return to the dust.—Ecclesiastes 3:19, 20.

  People who die are acquitted of, or pardoned for, their sins. (Romans 6:7) There is no further punishment for sin after a person dies.





Can the dead live again?

WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
  Yes

  No

  Maybe


WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS
“There is going to be a resurrection.”—Acts 24:15.
WHAT ELSE CAN WE LEARN FROM THE BIBLE?
  The Bible often compares death to sleep. (John 11:11-14) God can awaken the dead, just as we can awaken a person from sleep.—Job 14:13-15.

  The Bible records several resurrections, thus giving us a solid basis for believing that the dead will be raised up.—1 Kings 17:17-24; Luke 7:11-17; John 11:39-44.

In fact, during 2015, there were 8,220,105 of Jehovah’s servants who preached the good news of the Kingdom around the world! God said about the increase among his people: “I myself, Jehovah, will speed it up in its own time.” So as time goes on, there will be more work for all of us to do. Are we doing all we can now to preach and teach the good news? Many brothers and sisters are already serving as regular or auxiliary pioneers.

For someone to reach something that is far away, he would need to make an effort and perhaps stretch out his arm to get it. Now imagine a brother who would like to qualify as a ministerial servant. He realizes that he needs to make an effort to improve his Christian qualities. Then, after he begins serving as a ministerial servant, he continues to work hard so that he can qualify to become an overseer.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Young people can do much in Jehovah’s service because they are strong and healthy. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:20:29-20:20:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 20:29</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Some young brothers in Bethel help to print and bind books and Bibles. Many young brothers and sisters build Kingdom Halls or help to repair them. Some volunteer to help when there is a natural disaster.

He wanted to enjoy serving God, but he was not happy.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Aaron made an effort to read the Bible regularly, prepare for the meetings, and give comments at them. He also started praying more often. All of this helped him to make spiritual progress. He got to know Jehovah better and began to love him even more. As a result, Aaron felt happier. He pioneered, helped others when there were natural disasters, and went to preach in another country. Now he is an elder and serves at Bethel. How does he feel about his life? Aaron said: “I have ‘tasted and seen that Jehovah is good.’ Because of his blessing, I feel indebted to him and am moved to do <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>more in his service, and this results in more blessings.”</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>We may desire to do more in Jehovah’s service. But what if we have been waiting a long time for a certain privilege in the congregation or for our circumstances to change? We may need to be patient. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:7:7-33:7:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Micah 7:7</a>) And even though Jehovah may allow the situation we are in to continue, we can be sure that he will always support us. We can learn from the example of Abraham. Jehovah promised him that he would have a son, but he had to wait for many years before Isaac was born. During that time, Abraham was patient and never lost his faith in Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:15:3-1:15:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 15:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:21:5-1:21:5" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 21:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:6:12-58:6:15" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Hebrews 6:12-15</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:13:12-20:13:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:12</a>) But if we keep thinking about our situation and about how disappointed we are, we will feel very discouraged. Instead, we could use the time to improve the qualities we will need in order to care for certain responsibilities in the congregation.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup>Develop the qualities and abilities you need. </strong>By reading the Bible and meditating on what you read, you can learn to be wise, to think and reason clearly, and to make good decisions. In fact, brothers need qualities and abilities like these to take care of the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:1:1-20:1:4" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:1:7-56:1:9" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Titus 1:7-9</a>) When we study the Bible, we can find out how Jehovah feels about many matters.

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>How can members of the congregation prove themselves trustworthy?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup>Work hard at any assignment you are given. </strong>When God’s people were rebuilding the temple, Nehemiah needed men to care for various responsibilities.

But if you keep defending yourself and insisting that you are right, you could make the problem worse. We can learn much from the example of Joseph. His brothers treated him badly. People lied about him, and he was put in prison for something he had not done. But Joseph relied on Jehovah. He thought about Jehovah’s promises, and he remained faithful. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:105:19-19:105:19" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 105:19</a>) In those difficult times, he developed many good qualities that helped him later when he was given important work to do.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Paul told Timothy to continue to improve the way he explained the Scriptures. Paul said: “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:4:13-54:4:13" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:4:16-54:4:16" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 16</a>) Timothy had already been preaching for many years. So why did he need to improve? Timothy knew that people and circumstances change. He wanted people to keep listening to him, so he had to continue to improve and change the way he taught them. As we preach today, we need to do the same.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>In some places, we find that many people are not at home when we preach from door to door. In other places, people may be at home, but we cannot get to their doors, perhaps because we cannot enter the building they are living in. If that is true in your territory, can you try another method to find people?</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>16. </strong>How can public witnessing prove to be effective?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Many brothers and sisters enjoy public witnessing. For example, they go to train stations, bus stations, markets, and parks to find people to talk to. A Witness may start a conversation with someone about a recent news report. Or the Witness might say something nice about the person’s children or ask a question about his work. If the person seems to be enjoying the conversation, the publisher may mention a point from the Bible and ask what the person thinks about it. Often, people want to know more about the Bible.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>17, 18. </strong>(a) How might you become more confident in public witnessing? (b) Why do you find David’s spirit in praising Jehovah valuable as you engage in the ministry?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Perhaps you find it difficult to start conversations on the street with people you do not know. That is how Eddie, a pioneer in New York City, felt. But he found something that helped him to be more confident. He says: “During our family worship, my wife and I do research to find answers to objections and opinions people express. We also ask other Witnesses for suggestions.” Now Eddie looks forward to public witnessing.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>When we enjoy our ministry more and improve the way we talk to people about the good news, our spiritual progress will be seen by others. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:4:15-54:4:15" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 4:15</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>And we may even help someone to become a servant of Jehovah.

But what if because of sickness or old age, you cannot spend as much time as you would like preaching from house to house? Always remember that you are praising Jehovah every time you speak about him to those around you, such as to nurses or doctors. If you are in prison because of your faith, you may still be able to tell others about Jehovah, and that makes his heart rejoice.

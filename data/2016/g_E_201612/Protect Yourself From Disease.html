<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">MANY ancient cities were protected by massive walls. If an enemy breached just a small section of a wall, the safety of the entire city was at risk. Your body is like a walled city. How you care for your defenses has much to do with how healthy you are. Consider five elements that can expose you to disease and how you can put up the best possible defenses.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>YOUR DEFENSE: </strong>The best defense is to protect your water supply from contamination. If you know that your water supply is contaminated or suspect that it is, you can treat the water at home to make it safe.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Store potable water in a closed vessel, and dispense it hygienically with a clean ladle or through a tap. Never put your hands into a clean water supply. If possible, you should try to live in a community that properly disposes of human waste so that it does not contaminate local water sources.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>YOUR DEFENSE: </strong>Contaminated food may look fresh and nutritious. So get into the habit of thoroughly washing all fruits and vegetables. Ensure that food utensils, kitchen surfaces, and your hands are clean when preparing or serving food. Some foods require cooking at a certain temperature in order to destroy dangerous microbes. Beware of food that is discolored or has an unpleasant odor or taste<wbr />—signs that an army of microorganisms could be waiting for you. Refrigerate unused food as soon as possible. Avoid preparing food for others when you are sick.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>YOUR DEFENSE: </strong>Some people choose to keep their animals outside the house to minimize contact with them.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>THE THREAT: </strong>Some germs can invade your body by riding on tiny droplets in someone’s cough or sneeze. They can also spread through skin contact, such as hugging or shaking hands. Microorganisms from other people may lurk on such items as doorknobs, handrails, telephones, remote controls, or computer screens and keyboards.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn"><strong>YOUR DEFENSE: </strong>Do not share personal items, such as razors, toothbrushes, or towels. Avoid contact with body fluids from animals or from other people, including blood and products derived from blood. And do not underestimate the benefits of washing your hands thoroughly and frequently. It is perhaps the most effective way you can stop the spread of infection.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">If possible, stay home when you are sick. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that you cough or sneeze into a tissue or your sleeve, but not into your hands.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">An ancient proverb states: “The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:3</a>) How true are those words today in a world plagued with potentially dangerous diseases! So inform yourself by consulting local health services, and conceal yourself from danger by practicing good hygiene. Bolster your defenses, and reduce the risk of disease!</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sc">In 2014, the Ebola virus spread rapidly throughout West Africa, making headlines around the world. The offices of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the region launched an information campaign that helped many in the community to reduce the risk of infection. Witness representatives explained how they handled the situation.</p>

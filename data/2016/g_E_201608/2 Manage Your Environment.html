<ul><li><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="su">  You resolved to eat better, but that tub of ice cream seems to have your name written all over it.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="su">  You decided to quit smoking, but once again, your friend<wbr />—who knows you are trying to quit—<wbr />offers you a cigarette.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Can you see a common thread in those scenarios? Time and again, experience has shown that our environment<wbr />—the situations we put ourselves in and the people we spend time with—<wbr />influences our success in building good habits and breaking bad ones.</p>
<div class="grpItems indent"><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>BIBLE PRINCIPLE: </strong><em>“The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself, but the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences.”<wbr /></em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:3</a>.</p>
</div><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Bible advises us to think ahead. By doing so, we can cautiously avoid situations that could undermine our goals, and we can thus actively put ourselves in more favorable situations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:2:22-55:2:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:22</a>) In short, we are wise to manage our environment.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="su">  Make it <em>harder </em>to do the wrong thing. For example, if you want to eliminate junk food from your diet, try not to keep food in your kitchen that you know is not good for you. That way, when temptation strikes, giving in will require more effort than not giving in.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="su">  Make it <em>easier </em>to do the right thing. For instance, if you plan to exercise first thing in the morning, set your exercise clothing next to your bed the night before. The easier it is to get started, the more likely you are to follow through.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="su">  Choose your friends carefully. We tend to become like the people we spend time with. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>) So limit contact with people who encourage habits that you are trying to break, and seek out those who can reinforce good habits.</p>

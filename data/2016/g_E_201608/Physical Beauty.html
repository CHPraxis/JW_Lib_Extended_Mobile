<h2 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>Why do we appreciate beauty?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In ways that are still a mystery, the human brain perceives beauty. The Bible does not explain how this happens, but it does reveal why we have an aesthetic sense: God endowed us with his attributes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:27-1:1:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:3:11-21:3:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>) He also created the highly complex human body, giving it amazing form and function. In that regard, an ancient songwriter said: “I praise you [God] because in an awe-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:139:14-19:139:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 139:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Today, though, attitudes toward physical beauty are often unbalanced<wbr />—a trend promoted by the fashion industry and the popular media. According to the book <em>Body Image, </em>a number of studies in Western cultures “suggest that body image is the single most important factor in a person’s overall self-image.” Such a narrow focus, however, can mean ignoring something far more important<wbr />—an individual’s heart.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:16:7-9:16:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Samuel 16:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Hand in hand with the focus on the body is growing overemphasis on sexuality, especially that of women. “Virtually every media form studied,” says a 2007 American Psychological Association (APA) report, “provides ample evidence of the sexualization of women.” The Bible firmly encourages us to avoid being influenced by such trends<wbr />—and for good reason!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:5-51:3:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Colossians 3:5, 6</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="rule"><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><em>“Do not let your adornment be external . . . , but let it be the secret person of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of the quiet and mild spirit, which is of great value in the eyes of God.”<wbr /></em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:3-60:3:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:3, 4</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>Why is it wise to have a balanced view?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Concerning physical beauty, some say: “If you’ve got it, flaunt it!” In cultures where such thinking is common, adolescent and even preadolescent girls learn to view themselves “as objects of others’ desires . . . , to be looked at and evaluated for their appearance,” says a report by the APA. That view can be most harmful. In <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>fact, it has become a major social and health concern that, according to the APA, may lead to “a host of negative emotional consequences.” These may include anxiety and “even self-disgust . . . , eating disorders, low self-esteem, and depression or depressed mood.”</p>

<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>What attitude reflects a sound mind?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The Bible associates “soundness of mind,” or sensibleness, with modesty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:2:9-54:2:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:9</a>) Consider: Modest people are not superficial or vain, obsessing about their looks, but they have a healthy, balanced view of themselves. They also consider the feelings of others and thus earn admiration, respect and, above all, God’s favor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:6:8-33:6:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Micah 6:8</a>) Moreover, they are more likely to make true friends and attract potential marriage mates who are interested not just in physical intimacy but also in a lasting and happy union.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">For many good reasons, then, the Bible exhorts us to focus on the inner person<wbr />—“the secret person of the heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:3-60:3:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:3, 4</a>) Inner beauty truly is ageless. In fact, it can improve with time! “Gray hair is a crown of beauty when it is found in the way of righteousness,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:16:31-20:16:31" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:31</a>. Hence, whether young or old, people who heed the Bible’s superior advice will find the key not only to the beauty that lasts but also to dignity and contentment.</p>
<blockquote class="rule"><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><em>“Charm may be false, and beauty may be fleeting, but the woman who fears Jehovah will be praised.”<wbr /></em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:31:30-20:31:30" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:30</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There is a popular notion that it takes 21 days to cement a new habit. In reality, though, research shows that it can take some people less time<wbr />—and others a lot more—<wbr />to make significant changes. Should that discourage you?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Well, think of this scenario: Imagine that you want to build a habit of exercising three times a week.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">  The first week, you meet your goal.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  The second week, you miss a day.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">  The third week, you are back on track.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">  The fourth week, you barely exercise once.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="su">  The fifth week, you reach your goal again, and from that point forward, you meet it each week.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">It took five weeks to solidify your new habit. That may seem like a long time, but once you reach your goal, you will be glad you have cultivated a new good habit.</p>
<div class="grpItems indent"><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>BIBLE PRINCIPLE: </strong><em>“The righteous one may fall seven times, and he will get up again.”<wbr /></em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:24:16-20:24:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:16</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="su">  Focus on the times when things went <em>right. </em>For example, if you are trying to improve the way you communicate with your children, ask yourself: ‘When was the last time I felt like yelling at my children, but didn’t? What did I do instead? How can I repeat that?’ Such questions can help you to reinforce your successes rather than dwell on your setbacks.</p>

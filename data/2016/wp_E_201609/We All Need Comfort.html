<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Do you remember falling down when you were a young child? Perhaps you cut your hand or scraped your knee. Can you recall how your mother comforted you? Maybe she cleaned the wound and then put a bandage on it. You cried, but her soothing words and warm embrace soon made you feel better. At that time in your life, comfort was never far away.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But life gets more complicated as we get older. The problems get bigger, and comfort becomes harder to find. Adult problems, sad to say, can rarely be solved with a bandage and a mother’s hug. Consider a few examples.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">  Have you ever faced the trauma of losing your job? Julian says that when he got fired, the shock left him feeling distraught. ‘How will I care for my family?’ he wondered. ‘After I put in years of hard work, why does the company feel I am useless?’</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  Perhaps you are devastated by the breakup of your marriage. “When my husband suddenly left me 18 months ago, I felt a sadness come over me. It was as if my heart had broken in two,” explains Raquel. “The pain was physical as well as emotional. It frightened me.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">  Maybe you have a serious health problem that shows little sign of improving. There may be times when you feel as did the patriarch Job, who lamented: “I loathe my life; I do not want to go on living.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:7:16-18:7:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 7:16</a>) Perhaps you share the feelings of Luis, a man in his 80’s, who confessed, “Sometimes I feel that I am just waiting to die.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">  Or possibly it is the death of a loved one that makes you yearn for comfort. “When my son died in a tragic plane accident, my first feeling was disbelief,” explains Robert. “Then came the pain, the pain that the Bible compares to having a long sword run through you.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:2:35-42:2:35" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 2:35</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Robert, Luis, Raquel, and Julian did find comfort, even in those distressing circumstances. They found the best Person to provide it<wbr />—none other than Almighty God. How does he provide comfort? Will he likewise provide the comfort you need?</p>

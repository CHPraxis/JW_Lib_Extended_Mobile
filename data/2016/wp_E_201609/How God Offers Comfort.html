<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The apostle Paul describes Jehovah<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> as “the God of <em>all </em>comfort, who comforts us in <em>all </em>our trials.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:1:3-47:1:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 1:3, 4</a>) Thus the Bible assures us that no person is beyond God’s help and that no tragedy is so great that our heavenly Father cannot comfort us.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Of course, we must do something if we want comfort from God. How could a doctor help us if we never made an appointment to see him? The prophet Amos asks: “Will two walk together unless they have met by appointment?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/30:3:3-30:3:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Amos 3:3</a>, footnote) The Scriptures therefore urge us: “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">How can we be sure that God will draw close to us? First of all, because he tells us repeatedly that he wants to help us. (See the <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:2016325/19-24">accompanying box</a>.) And second, because we have convincing testimony from people whom God has comforted<wbr />—real people, both from our time and the past.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Like many today who seek help from God, King David was all too familiar with tragedy. “Hear my pleas when I cry to you for help,” he once begged Jehovah. Did God respond? Yes. David added: “I have received his help, and my heart rejoices.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:28:2-19:28:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 28:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:28:7-19:28:7" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 7</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>JESUS’ ROLE IN COMFORTING ALL WHO MOURN</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">God intended that Jesus have a key role in providing comfort. Among other tasks that God assigned him, Jesus was “to bind up the brokenhearted” and “comfort all who mourn.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:61:1-23:61:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 61:1, 2</a>) As foretold, Jesus took a special interest in people who were “toiling and loaded down.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:11:28-40:11:30" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 11:28-30</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Jesus comforted people by giving them wise advice, by treating them kindly, and even, in some cases, by curing their sicknesses. One day a leper pleaded with Jesus: “If you just want to, you can make me clean.” Moved with pity, Jesus replied: “I want to! Be made clean.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:1:40-41:1:41" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 1:40, 41</a>) And the leper was healed.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>Today, the Son of God is not present on earth to comfort us personally. But his Father, Jehovah, “the God of all comfort,” continues to help those in need. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:1:3-47:1:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>) Consider four principal means that God uses to comfort people.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="su">  <strong>The Bible. </strong>“All the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction, so that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="su">  <strong>God’s Holy Spirit. </strong>Not long after Jesus’ death, the whole Christian congregation entered into a period of peace. Why? “It walked in the fear of Jehovah and in the comfort of the holy spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:9:31-44:9:31" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 9:31</a>) The holy spirit, God’s active force, is very powerful. God can use it to comfort anyone in any circumstance.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="su">  <strong>Prayer. </strong>“Do not be anxious over anything,” the Bible advises us. Rather, it says, “let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your mental powers.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="su">  <strong>Fellow Christians </strong>can provide a comforting ‘safety net’ of true friends. The apostle Paul described his companions as “a source of great comfort” in times of “distress and tribulation.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:4:11-51:4:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Colossians 4:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:3:7-52:3:7" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 1 Thessalonians 3:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">But you may be wondering how all this works in practice. Let us take a closer look at the experiences of people who have faced the problems mentioned at the outset. Like them, you can discover that God still fulfills this heartwarming promise: “As a mother comforts her son, so I will keep comforting you.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:66:13-23:66:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 66:13</a>.</p>

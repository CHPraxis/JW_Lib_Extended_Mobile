Schedules for Regular Pioneering









Regular pioneering requires a good schedule. If you share in the ministry 18 hours a week, you can pioneerâ€”and still have time for vacation! Such a schedule even allows for some unexpected disruptions, perhaps because of sickness or inclement weather. The accompanying chart offers ideas for publishers who work part-time or full-time or whose poor health or lack of energy limits them. With some adjustments, perhaps someone in the family can begin pioneering in September. Why not discuss this during your next family worship?

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | PSALMS 79-86
Who Is the Most Important Person in Your Life?









The composer of Psalm 83 was likely a descendant of the Levite Asaph, a contemporary of King David. This psalm was written during a time when enemy nations were a threat to Jehovah’s people.
83:1-5, 16
  In his prayer, the psalmist focused on Jehovah’s name and sovereignty rather than on his personal safety

  Today, God’s servants continue to face one attack after another. Our faithful endurance brings honor to Jehovah


83:18
  Jehovah wants us to know his name

  We must show through our actions that Jehovah is the most important Person in our life

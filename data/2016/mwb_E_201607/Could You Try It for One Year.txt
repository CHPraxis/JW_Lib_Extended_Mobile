LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Could You Try It for One Year?









Try what? Regular pioneering! What rich blessings you will enjoy!—Pr 10:22.



BY PIONEERING, YOU CAN . . .

  gain skill as an evangelizer and enjoy the ministry more

  strengthen your relationship with Jehovah. The more you talk about him to others, the more you will be reminded of his awe-inspiring qualities

  experience the satisfaction that comes from putting Kingdom interests ahead of your own and the joy that results from giving of yourself in behalf of others. —Mt 6:33; Ac 20:35

  attend the pioneer meeting conducted during the visit of the circuit overseer, the special meeting in conjunction with the circuit assembly, and Pioneer Service School

  have more opportunities to start and conduct Bible studies

  spend more time with fellow preachers, enjoying an interchange of encouragement.—Ro 1:11, 12

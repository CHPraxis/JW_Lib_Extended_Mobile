LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Using Videos to Teach



WHY IMPORTANT:






Videos can touch the hearts of people by appealing to the senses of sight and hearing. This helps to hold attention and to make a lasting impression. Jehovah has set the best example of using visual aids to teach.—Ac 10:9-16; Re 1:1.
The videos Does God Have a Name?, Who Is the Author of the Bible?, and How Can We Be Sure the Bible Is True? supplement lessons 2 and 3 of the Good News brochure. The videos Why Study the Bible?, What Happens at a Bible Study?, and What Happens at a Kingdom Hall? encourage individuals to study the Bible with us or to attend congregation meetings. Some of our feature-length videos may also be used to teach on Bible studies.—km 5/13 3.



HOW TO DO IT:

  Download in advance the video you want to show the householder

  Prepare one or two questions that will be answered by the video

  Watch the video together

  Discuss the main points





TRY THIS:

  Turn to the back of one of our tracts, and direct attention to the code that links to the video Why Study the Bible?

  Show the video How Can We Be Sure the Bible Is True? and offer the Good News brochure, highlighting lesson 3

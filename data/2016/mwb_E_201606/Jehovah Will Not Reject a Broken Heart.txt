Jehovah Will Not Reject a Broken Heart









Psalm 51 was written by David after the prophet Nathan called attention to David’s grave sin with Bath-sheba. David’s conscience struck him, and he humbly confessed.—2Sa 12:1-14.



David had sinned but spiritual recovery was still possible

51:3, 4, 8-12, 17
  Before he repented and confessed, his conscience made him miserable

  He suffered such agony over God’s disapproval that he felt like a man whose bones were crushed

  He longed for forgiveness, spiritual recovery, and the joy that he had previously experienced

  He humbly begged Jehovah to help him develop a willingness to obey

  He was confident of Jehovah’s forgiveness

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Sixty-one percent of youths aged 18-25 believe that premarital sex “is no longer a big issue in India,” according to a 2014 survey. A Mumbai-based physician told the <em>Hindustan Times </em>that in his view, “embarking on a relationship does not mean youngsters have marriage on their mind. Whether it is a one-night stand, a casual relationship or a live-in, commitment does not have to be on the agenda.”</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Having frequent arguments with family members is associated with a double risk of dying in middle age. Researchers at the University of Copenhagen tracked almost 10,000 middle-aged people over an 11-year period and found that participants who frequently argued with someone close to them were far more likely to die prematurely than those who seldom had conflicts. An author of the study says that handling worries and demands and managing conflicts “may be considered important strategies for reducing premature deaths.”</p>

They also tend to have more conflict and to be less satisfied with their marriage.</p>

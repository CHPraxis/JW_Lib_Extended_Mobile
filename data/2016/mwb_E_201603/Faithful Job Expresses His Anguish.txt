TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | JOB 6-10
Faithful Job Expresses His Anguish









Job was destitute, bereaved, and gravely ill, but he remained faithful. So Satan tried to use discouragement to break his integrity. Three “companions” arrived. First they made a public show of sympathy. Then they sat with Job in silence for seven days, not offering even one word of comfort. The speeches that followed were full of charges and harsh accusations.



Job maintained his loyalty to Jehovah despite severe pressure

6:3; 7:16; 9:20-22; 10:1, 12
  Extreme grief caused Job to have the wrong perspective. He mistakenly concluded that God did not care if he remained faithful

  Because of discouragement, Job did not consider other possible reasons for his suffering

  Though grief-stricken, Job still spoke to his accusers about his love for Jehovah

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | JOB 11-15
Job Was Confident in the Resurrection



Job expressed his faith in God’s ability to resurrect him

14:7-9, 13-15





  Job used a tree—perhaps an olive tree—to illustrate his confidence in God’s ability to resurrect him

  An olive tree’s expansive root system enables it to rejuvenate itself even when the trunk has been destroyed. As long as the roots remain alive, the tree will sprout again

  When rainfall breaks a severe drought, a dry olive stump can spring back to life with shoots rising from its roots, producing “branches like a new plant”

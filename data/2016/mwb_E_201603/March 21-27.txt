Job 9:20-22—Job mistakenly concluded that God did not care whether he kept his faith in Him or not (w15 7/1 12 ¶2)

Job 6:14—How did Job highlight the importance of loyal love? (w10 11/15 32 ¶20)

Job 7:9, 10; 10:21—If Job hoped in a future resurrection, then why did he make the statements found in these verses? (w06 3/15 14 ¶11)

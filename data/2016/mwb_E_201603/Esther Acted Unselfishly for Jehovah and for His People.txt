TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | ESTHER 6-10
Esther Acted Unselfishly for Jehovah and for His People



Esther was brave and selfless in defending Jehovah and his people

8:3-5, 9
  Esther and Mordecai were safe. But Haman’s decree to kill all the Jews was making its way to every corner of the empire

  Esther risked her life again, appearing uninvited before the king. She wept for her people and asked the king to revoke the terrible edict

  Laws passed in the king’s name could not be revoked. So the king empowered Esther and Mordecai to enact a new law





Jehovah gave his people a great victory

8:10-14, 17
  A second proclamation was made, giving the Jews the right to defend themselves

  Riders sped to every part of the empire, and the Jews prepared for battle

  Many people saw evidence of God’s favor and became Jewish proselytes

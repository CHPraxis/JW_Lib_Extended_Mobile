WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS
“Jehovah is near to all . . . who call on him in truth.”—Psalm 145:18.
WHAT ELSE CAN WE LEARN FROM THE BIBLE?
  God ignores the prayers of those who rebel against him. (Isaiah 1:15) However, they can “set matters straight” with him by changing their ways.—Isaiah 1:18.

  For God to answer a prayer, it must be in harmony with his requirements as found in the Bible.—1 John 5:14.





Do we have to pray in a special position?

SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE that they must always kneel, bow their head, or place their hands together when praying. What do you think?
WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS
God has accepted prayers from those who “sat down” or “stood up” or those who were “lying prostrate” or “kneeling down.” (1 Chronicles 17:16; 2 Chronicles 30:27; Ezra 10:1; Acts 9:40) He does not require a specific bodily position when we pray.
WHAT ELSE CAN WE LEARN FROM THE BIBLE?
  God listens to those who are humble.—Psalm 138:6.

  You can pray in any language, or even silently.—2 Chronicles 6:32, 33; Nehemiah 2:1-6.

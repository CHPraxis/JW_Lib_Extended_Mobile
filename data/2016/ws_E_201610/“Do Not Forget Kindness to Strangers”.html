<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The early Christians learned to overcome strong prejudices that were common among the Jews. At Pentecost of the year 33, Jewish Christians living in Jerusalem showed hospitality to and loving concern for new ones from different countries. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:5-44:2:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 2:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:44-44:2:47" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 44-47</a>) This showed that the Jewish Christians understood the meaning of “hospitality,” that is, “kindness to strangers.”</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>During that time, however, something happened. Greek-speaking Jews complained that their widows were not being treated fairly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:6:1-44:6:1" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 6:1</a>) To solve the problem, the apostles chose seven men to go and make sure that everyone would be treated fairly. The apostles chose men with Greek names, perhaps <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>to make the widows feel more comfortable.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:6:2-44:6:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 6:2-6</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Romans 12:2</a>) Also, we may hear our neighbors, workmates, or schoolmates say bad things about people of another background, tribe, or skin color. How deeply are we influenced by such negative ideas? Or how do we react when someone makes fun of our nationality or some part of our culture?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>There was a time when the apostle Peter was prejudiced against people who were not Jewish.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:4:7-46:4:7" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 4:7</a>) We should feel as the apostle Paul did.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>The faithful man Boaz imitated Jehovah’s view of strangers. How so? When Boaz went to inspect his fields during the harvest, he noticed Ruth, a foreign woman from the land of Moab. She was working hard to pick up grain from the ground. Under the Mosaic Law, Ruth had the right to glean. But when Boaz heard that she had asked for permission to glean in his field, he was deeply impressed and allowed her to glean even among the bundles of grain.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:2:5-8:2:7" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>Ruth 2:5-7,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:2:15-8:2:16" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> <strong>15, 16</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>What happened next clearly shows that Boaz was concerned about Ruth and her difficult situation as a foreigner. He invited her to stay with his group of young women so that she would not be mistreated by the men working in the field. He even made sure that she would get enough food and water, just like his own workers. Boaz showed respect for this poor foreign woman and encouraged her.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:2:8-8:2:10" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ruth 2:8-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:2:13-8:2:14" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 13, 14</a>.</p>

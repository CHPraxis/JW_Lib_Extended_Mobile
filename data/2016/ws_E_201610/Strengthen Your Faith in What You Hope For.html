<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"><strong>1, 2. </strong>(a) How are the things we hope for different from the things other people hope for? (b) What will we discuss in this article?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb">JEHOVAH has given us wonderful things to hope for. He has promised to sanctify his name and to cause his will to be done in heaven and on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>) Those are the most important things we look forward to. Jehovah has also promised to reward us with everlasting life, either in heaven or on earth. How wonderful that will be! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:13</a>) And we look forward to seeing how Jehovah will continue to guide and support his people in these last days.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The Bible says that faith is “the assured expectation” of what we hope for. This means that those who have faith are absolutely sure that the things Jehovah has promised will come true. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:1-58:11:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:1</a>) On the other hand, many people today hope and wish for things, but they cannot be sure that those things will ever come true. For example, someone may hope to win the lottery, but he cannot <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>be at all sure that he will win it. In this article, we will see what we can do to strengthen our faith in God’s promises. We will also discuss how strong faith can help us now.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>Why do we have faith that God’s promises will come true?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>None of us are born with faith. To have faith, we need to allow God’s holy spirit to guide our hearts. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:5:22-48:5:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22</a>) Holy spirit can help us to get to know Jehovah. When we understand that he is almighty and wise, we become confident that he has the ability to do all that he promises. Jehovah himself refers to his promises as if they have already happened and says: “They have come to pass!” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:3-66:21:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 21:3-6</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>We know that Jehovah always does what he promises. He is “the faithful God.” That is why we believe everything he tells us about the future.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:7:9-5:7:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>.</p>

It also mentions many others who pleased Jehovah “because of their faith.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:39-58:11:39" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:39</a>) All of them were waiting for the “offspring” whom Jehovah had promised. They knew that this “offspring” would destroy all of God’s enemies and make the earth a paradise again. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>) And these servants of God had strong faith that Jehovah would bring them back to life. Of course, they did not look forward to being resurrected to life in heaven, since Jesus had not yet made that possible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:3:16-48:3:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Galatians 3:16</a>) Instead, they looked forward to living forever on earth in a beautiful paradise.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:26:19-23:26:19" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Isaiah 26:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/28:13:14-28:13:14" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Hosea 13:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:13-58:11:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:13</a> says about these faithful servants of Jehovah: “In faith all of these died, although they did not receive the fulfillment of the promises; but they saw them from a distance and welcomed them.” They looked forward to the new world and imagined themselves living there. One of them was Abraham. Jesus said that Abraham “rejoiced greatly at the prospect of seeing” that time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:56-43:8:56" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 8:56</a>) Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, and many others also looked forward to the time when the Kingdom, “whose designer and builder is God,” would rule over the whole earth.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:8-58:11:11" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:8-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>How did Abraham and his family keep their faith strong? They continued learning about Jehovah. At times, God spoke to them by means of angels, visions, or dreams. They probably also learned from faithful older ones or from older writings. Abraham and his family never forgot God’s promises, and they loved meditating on them. As a result, they had no doubt that Jehovah would keep his promises. So they <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>stayed loyal to him even when they suffered difficulties or persecution.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What has Jehovah given us to strengthen our faith, and what do we need to do?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>What will help us to keep our faith strong? Jehovah has given us the Bible to teach us about his promises for the future. In it, he shows us what we need to do to be happy. That is why it is good for us to read the Bible every day and follow its guidance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1-3</a>; <strong>read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:17:11-44:17:11" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 17:11</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jehovah also gives us “food at the proper time” by means of “the faithful and discreet slave.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45</a>) Just like God’s people in the past, we regularly need to read about God’s promises and meditate deeply on them. This will help us stay loyal to God and keep looking forward to the time when his Kingdom will rule over the whole earth.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Millions of servants of God are following Jesus’ example. They meditate on God’s promises and remain loyal to him during trials. Consider Rudolf Graichen, who was born in Germany in 1925. When he was young, his parents hung pictures of Bible scenes in their home. He said: “One picture showed the wolf and the lamb, the kid and the leopard, the calf and the lion<wbr />—all in peace, being led by a little boy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:11:6-23:11:9" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>) This helped Rudolf to think a lot about the paradise on earth and strengthened his faith in it. As a result, <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>he remained loyal to Jehovah even though he was harshly persecuted for many years by the Nazi Gestapo and then by the Communist <em>Stasi </em>of East Germany.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Rudolf endured many other trials. His mother died of typhus in the Ravensbrück concentration camp. His father signed a document in which he said that he was no longer one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. But Rudolf kept his faith strong. After he was released from prison, he served as a circuit overseer. Then he was invited to Gilead School and was assigned to Chile, where he again served as a circuit overseer. There he married a missionary sister, Patsy. But sadly, a year later, their baby daughter died. Sometime after that, Patsy also died. She was only 43 years old. Despite all these trials, Rudolf continued serving Jehovah. Even when he was older and did not have good health, he served as a <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>regular pioneer and an elder. We can read his life story in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="9" href="jwpub://p/E:1997565/1-42">August 1, 1997, issue of <em>The Watchtower, </em>pages 20-25</a>.<span data-enid="1" class="en"><strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong><span class="tt en" data-rel-enid="1"></span></span> (See endnote.)</p>

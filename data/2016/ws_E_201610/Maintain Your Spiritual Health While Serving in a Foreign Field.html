Because their children do not fully understand what is being said at the meetings, the information does not move them to act. “When talking about spiritual matters,” says Pedro, who moved his family to Australia from South America, “the heart and emotions should be involved.”<span data-enid="1" class="en"><strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong><span class="tt en" data-rel-enid="1"></span></span> (See endnote.)<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:24:32-42:24:32" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 24:32</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Although we may be very busy with responsibilities in the congregation and at work, we all need to make time for personal study and family worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:15-49:5:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:15, 16</a>) Our goal should not simply be to read a lot of pages or to prepare a comment for the meeting. Our goal should be to allow God’s Word to affect us and strengthen our faith.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>To reach our goal, we need to be balanced. When we study, we should think not only about the needs of others but also about our own needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:1:9-50:1:10" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Philippians 1:9, 10</a>) We must recognize that when we prepare for the ministry, for the meetings, or for a talk, we may not necessarily apply what we read to ourselves. For example, even though a chef has to taste the meals he makes before serving them, he cannot live on those samples of food. If he wants to stay healthy, he must regularly prepare healthy meals for himself. In a similar way, if we want to strengthen our relationship with Jehovah, we need to study the Bible regularly. Such deep study fills our personal needs.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>12, 13. </strong>Why do many feel that it is helpful to study the Bible in their own language?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Many who serve in a foreign-language congregation feel that it is helpful to study the Bible regularly in the ‘language of their birth.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:8-44:2:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 2:8</a>, footnote) Even missionaries know that to remain strong in their foreign assignment, they cannot rely only on what they hear at the meetings.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Alain, who has been learning Persian for about eight years, admits: “When I prepare for meetings in Persian, I tend to focus on the language itself. Since my mind is mainly involved <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>in an intellectual exercise, my heart is not necessarily touched by the spiritual thoughts I am reading.

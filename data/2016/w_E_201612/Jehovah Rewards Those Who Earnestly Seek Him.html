<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Being a rewarder is an integral part of who Jehovah is and what he does. Our faith is not complete unless we are firmly convinced that God will reward those who earnestly seek him, for “faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:1-58:11:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 11:1</a>) Yes, faith involves the certain expectation of God’s promised blessings.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The apostle Peter once asked Jesus: “We have left all things and followed you; what, then, will there be for us?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:27-40:19:27" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 19:27</a>) Instead of rebuking Peter for asking that question, Jesus told his disciples that they would be rewarded for their sacrifices. The faithful apostles and others will rule with him in heaven. But even now there are rewards. Jesus said: “Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother <span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit everlasting life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:29-40:19:29" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 19:29</a>) His disciples would gain blessings far in excess of any personal sacrifices they might make.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>By promising his worshippers a reward, Jehovah helps to sustain them during tests of integrity. Besides enjoying rich spiritual blessings now, Jehovah God’s faithful servants eagerly look forward to even greater blessings in the future. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:8-54:4:8" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:8</a>) Yes, our being firmly convinced that Jehovah “becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him” will help us to stand firm in the faith.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Heb. 11:6</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said: “Rejoice and be overjoyed, since your reward is great in the heavens, for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:12-40:5:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 5:12</a>) Aside from those who will receive a reward in heaven, the prospect of everlasting life on a paradise earth is indeed reason to “rejoice and be overjoyed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 37:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:18:30-42:18:30" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Luke 18:30</a>) Whether heavenly or earthly, our hope can serve as “an anchor for the soul, both sure and firm.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:17-58:6:20" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb. 6:17-20</a>) Just as an anchor keeps a ship steady during a storm, the sure hope of a reward can help us to maintain our emotional, mental, and spiritual stability. It can help us to have the strength to endure hardships.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>How does hope have the power to reduce anxiety?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Our Bible-based hope has the power to reduce present anxiety.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:22-19:55:22" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 55:22</a>) We can have full confidence that God can do “more than superabundantly beyond all the things we ask or conceive.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:20-49:3:20" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Eph. 3:20</a>) Imagine that​—not just abundantly and not superabundantly but “more than superabundantly”!</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>To receive the reward, we need to exercise full faith in Jehovah and be obedient to his directions. Moses told the nation of Israel: “Jehovah will surely bless you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance, but only if you strictly obey the voice of Jehovah your God and carefully observe all this commandment that I am giving you today. For Jehovah your God will bless you just as he has promised you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:15:4-5:15:6" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Deut. 15:4-6</a>) Do you have full confidence that Jehovah will bless you if you continue to serve him faithfully?

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>The Bible was recorded for our benefit. It contains many accounts of how God did indeed reward faithful servants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>) Joseph was an outstanding example. As a result of a conspiracy by his brothers and the later treachery of his master’s wife, he found himself in an Egyptian prison. Was he cut off from his God? Not at all! “Jehovah continued <span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>with Joseph and kept showing loyal love to him . . . Jehovah was with Joseph and Jehovah made whatever he did successful.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:21-1:39:23" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Gen. 39:21-23</a>) Joseph, through those trialsome times, waited patiently on his God.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Years later, Pharaoh released Joseph from prison and made this humble slave second ruler in Egypt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:1-1:41:1" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Gen. 41:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:37-1:41:43" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 37-43</a>) When his wife bore him two sons, “Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, for he said, ‘God has made me forget all my trouble and all the house of my father.’ And he named the second one Ephraim, for he said, ‘God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:51-1:41:52" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Gen. 41:51, 52</a>) Because Joseph remained loyal to God, he was rewarded with blessings that resulted in the preservation of life both for the Israelites and for the Egyptians. The point is, Joseph recognized that it was Jehovah who had rewarded him and blessed him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:45:5-1:45:9" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Gen. 45:5-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>How did Jesus remain faithful when under trial?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Jesus Christ likewise remained obedient to God through various tests of his faith, and he was rewarded. What helped him to cope? God’s Word explains: “For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake, despising shame.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:2-58:12:2" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Heb. 12:2</a>) Jesus certainly found joy in being able to sanctify God’s name. Furthermore, he was rewarded with his Father’s approval and many wonderful privileges. The Bible reports that he “has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.” And elsewhere we read: “God exalted him to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:9-50:2:9" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Phil. 2:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>We can be sure that Jehovah appreciates every effort that we make to serve him. He understands any insecurities or self-doubts that we may have. He shows us compassion if financial burdens weigh us down or our health or emotions tend to limit our sacred service.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Bear in mind, too, that we can approach the “Hearer of prayer” with the confidence that he will give attention to our concerns. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:65:2-19:65:2" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 65:2</a>) “The Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort” will unstintingly give us the emotional and spiritual support that we need, perhaps doing so by means of our fellow worshippers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:3" data-bid="28-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:3</a>) It touches Jehovah’s heart when we show compassion toward others. “The one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah, and He will repay him for what he does.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:19:17-20:19:17" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Prov. 19:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:3-40:6:4" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Matt. 6:3, 4</a>) Hence, when we unselfishly help those who are in difficulty, Jehovah views our good deed as a loan made to Him.

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Jehovah’s servants around the world can testify to the wonderful rewards they receive from him. For example, Bianca from Germany says: “I cannot thank Jehovah enough for helping me with my worries and for being at my side each day. The world out there is chaotic and bleak. But as I work closely with Jehovah, I feel secure in his arms. Whenever I make personal sacrifices for him, he gives me back a hundredfold in blessings.”</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>19 </sup></strong>Or consider 70-year-old Paula in Canada who is severely restricted by spina bifida. “Reduced mobility does not necessarily mean a reduced ministry,” she says. “I take advantage of different forms of service, such as telephone and informal witnessing.

I call it ‘My Survival Notebook.’ Discouragement is temporary if we focus on Jehovah’s promises.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">People may have lower stress when they check their e-mail just three times a day instead of checking it as often as they can, according to research performed in Vancouver, Canada. Kostadin Kushlev, who led the study, says in view of its conclusions: “People find it difficult to resist the temptation of checking email, and yet resisting this temptation reduces their stress.”</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“There have been documented cases of improvements to conch, lobster and fish populations within no-take zones” in Belize and other areas of the Caribbean, says a report to the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). It adds: “Recovery of exploited species within no-take zones as opposed to fished areas may take as little as 1-6 years, but full recovery . . . may take decades.” Janet Gibson, a WCS program director, said of Belize: “It’s clear that no-take zones can help replenish the country’s fisheries and biodiversity.”</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Violence is increasing in Brazil, reports the news service Agência Brasil. In 2012, the number of homicides surpassed 56,000<wbr />—the highest yearly rate ever recorded by the Ministry of Health. Public security specialist Luís Sapori believes that the increase reflects a moral breakdown. Once people lose respect for the laws of a civilized society, “they start using brute force to make their interests prevail,” he said.</p>

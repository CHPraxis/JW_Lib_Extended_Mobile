TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | PROVERBS 27-31
The Bible Describes a Capable Wife




Proverbs chapter 31 contains a weighty message to King Lemuel from his mother. Her wise counsel taught him what to look for in a capable wife.



A capable wife is trustworthy






31:10-12
  She provides valuable suggestions concerning family decisions while remaining submissive

  Her husband trusts her to make wise decisions, not insisting that she obtain his approval for every matter





A capable wife is industrious






31:13-27
  She learns to be thrifty and live modestly so that her family can be neatly dressed, presentable, and well-nourished

  She works hard and watches over her household day and night





A capable wife is spiritual






31:30
  She fears God and cultivates a personal relationship with him





DID YOU KNOW?
Red coral was highly prized in Bible times. It was beautiful, rare, and difficult to obtain. Found in the Mediterranean and Red seas, it was an important trade item.





The Bible indicates the value of coral by referring to it in much the same way as it does to gold, silver, and sapphire.
God’s Word says that the value of a capable wife is “far more than that of corals.”—Pr 31:10.

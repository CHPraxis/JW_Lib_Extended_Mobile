The Shulammite Girl—An Example Worthy of Imitation



What made her an outstanding example for worshippers of Jehovah?

2:7; 4:12





  She wisely waited for true love

  She refused to have others pressure her into feeling romantic love for just anyone who came along

  She was humble, modest, and chaste

  She would not let her love be bought with gold or flattery





Ask yourself:

‘Which quality of the Shulammite girl could I better imitate?’

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A capable wife reflects well on her husband. In King Lemuel’s day, a husband who had a capable wife was “well-known in the city gates.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:31:23-20:31:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Pr 31:23</a>) Today, respected men serve as elders and ministerial servants. If married, their ability to serve depends much on the good conduct and fine support of their wives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:3:4-54:3:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ti 3:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:3:11-54:3:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 11</a>) Such capable wives are greatly appreciated, not just by their husbands but also by the congregation.</p>

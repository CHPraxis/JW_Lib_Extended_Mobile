“Her Husband Is Well-Known in the City Gates”




A capable wife reflects well on her husband. In King Lemuel’s day, a husband who had a capable wife was “well-known in the city gates.” (Pr 31:23) Today, respected men serve as elders and ministerial servants. If married, their ability to serve depends much on the good conduct and fine support of their wives. (1Ti 3:4, 11) Such capable wives are greatly appreciated, not just by their husbands but also by the congregation.








A capable wife helps her husband to serve by . . .

  encouraging him with kind words.—Pr 31:26

  sharing him willingly with the congregation.—1Th 2:7, 8

  living modestly.—1Ti 6:8

  not asking him about confidential congregation matters.—1Ti 2:11, 12; 1Pe 4:15

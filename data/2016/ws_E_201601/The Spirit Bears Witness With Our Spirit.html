<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">IT WAS Sunday morning in Jerusalem. This was a special and exciting day. People were celebrating Pentecost, which was a sacred festival at the beginning of the wheat harvest. That morning at the temple, the high priest offered the regular sacrifices. Then, at about nine o’clock, he offered two leavened loaves made from the first wheat, or the firstfruits, of the harvest. The high priest waved the loaves from side to side to present them to Jehovah. This was Pentecost of the year 33.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:23:15-3:23:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Leviticus 23:15-20</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Every year, for hundreds of years, the high priest made this wave offering. The offering was closely related to something very important that happened on Pentecost of the year 33. And it happened to 120 disciples of Jesus who were praying together in an upper room in Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:1:13-44:1:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 1:13-15</a>) Eight hundred years earlier, <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>the prophet Joel had written about this event.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>) Then, a crowd began to gather around them, and the disciples started to speak about the wonderful things they had just seen and heard. The apostle Peter explained what had just happened and why it was so important. Then, he told the crowd: “Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and <strong>you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit.” </strong>That day, about 3,000 people were baptized, and they too received holy spirit.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:37-44:2:38" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 2:37, 38,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:41-44:2:41" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 41</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>What did the high priest and the offering he made every Pentecost represent? The high priest represented Jesus. The loaves represented the anointed disciples of Jesus. Those disciples have been chosen from among sinful humans and are called “firstfruits.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:18-59:1:18" data-bid="10-1" class="b">James 1:18</a>) God has accepted these ones as his sons and has chosen them to rule as kings with Jesus in heaven as part of God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:9-60:2:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:9</a>) Jehovah will use his Kingdom to bless all obedient humans.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The disciples in the upper room would never forget that day. Each of them had what looked like a flame on his head. Jehovah gave them the ability to speak in a foreign language. They had no doubt that they were anointed by holy spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:6-44:2:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 2:6-12</a>) But these spectacular things do not happen to all Christians when they are anointed. For example, the Bible does not say that something that looked like a flame appeared on the heads of the thousands in Jerusalem who were anointed later that day. They were anointed when they were baptized. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:38-44:2:38" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 2:38</a>) Also, not all Christians are anointed at the time they are baptized.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:8:14-44:8:17" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 8:14-17</a>) And in an unusual case, Cornelius and those in his house were anointed before they were baptized.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:10:44-44:10:48" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 10:44-48</a>.</p>

Some may have realized right away that Jehovah anointed them. Others realized this over a period of time. But the apostle Paul explained what happens to each one of them. He said: “After you <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>believed, you were sealed by means of him with the promised holy spirit, <strong>which is a token in advance </strong>of our inheritance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:1:13-49:1:14" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>) So Jehovah uses his holy spirit to make it absolutely clear to these Christians that he has chosen them to go to heaven. In this way, the holy spirit is “a token in advance,” or proof to them that in the future they will live forever in heaven and not on earth.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:1:21-47:1:22" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>2 Corinthians 1:21, 22;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:5:5-47:5:5" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> <strong>5:5</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>When a Christian is anointed, does it mean that he will definitely receive his reward? No. He is sure that he has been invited to go to heaven. But he will only be rewarded if he stays faithful to Jehovah.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Most of God’s servants today may find it difficult to understand what happens to someone when God anoints him. This is normal, because they themselves have not been anointed. God created humans to live forever on earth, not in heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Psalm 37:29</a>) But Jehovah has chosen some to be kings and priests in heaven.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>But how does a person know that he or she has been invited to go to heaven? Notice what Paul said to the anointed brothers in Rome, who were “called to be holy ones.” He told them: “You did not receive a spirit of slavery causing fear again, but you received a spirit of adoption as sons, by which spirit we cry out: <em>‘Abba, </em>Father!’ <strong>The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God’s children.” </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:1:7-45:1:7" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Romans 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:8:15-45:8:16" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 8:15, 16</a>) By means of his holy spirit, God makes it clear to someone that he or she is invited to rule as a king in heaven with Jesus.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:2:12-52:2:12" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>.</p>

The apostle John tells anointed Christians: “You have an anointing from the holy one, and all of you have knowledge.” He also says: “As for you, the anointing that you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to be teaching you; but the anointing from him is teaching you about all things and is true and is no lie. Just as it has taught you, remain in union with him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:20-62:2:20" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 John 2:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:27-62:2:27" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 27</a>) Anointed Christians need to be taught by Jehovah just like everyone else.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>11, 12. </strong>What might an anointed Christian wonder, but what does he never doubt?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>When Christians are anointed by holy spirit, they change very much. In fact, Jesus said that they are “born again,” or “born from above.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:3-43:3:3" data-bid="25-1" class="b">John 3:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:5-43:3:5" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 5</a>; footnote) He then explained: “Do not be amazed because I told you: You people must be born again.

So it is with everyone who has been born from the spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:7-43:3:8" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 3:7, 8</a>) Clearly, it is impossible to explain exactly how it feels to be anointed to someone who has not been anointed.<span data-enid="2" class="en">[2]<span class="tt en" data-rel-enid="2"></span></span><wbr />—See endnote.</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote"><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sc">Someone who has been anointed does not doubt that Jehovah has chosen him</p>
</div>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Someone who has been anointed may wonder, ‘Why did Jehovah choose me and not someone else?’ He may even wonder if he is good enough for this responsibility. But he does not doubt that Jehovah has chosen him. Instead, he feels extremely happy and is very grateful for such a gift. Anointed ones feel the way Peter did when he said: “Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for according to his great mercy he gave us a new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance. It is reserved in the heavens for you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:3-60:1:4" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:3, 4</a>) When anointed ones read these words, they know without any doubt that their Father is speaking to them personally.</p>

They looked forward to the time when Jehovah would make the earth into a paradise and remove all wickedness. Perhaps they imagined themselves welcoming back a family member or a friend who died. And they looked forward to building a home and living in it or planting trees and eating the fruit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:65:21-23:65:23" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:21-23</a>) Why did they start to think differently? Did they change because they felt depressed or suffered a lot? Did they suddenly decide that it would be boring to live forever on earth and that they would not be happy here? Or did they want to experience what it would be like to live in heaven? No. Instead, God is the one who decided this for them. When he invited them, he used his holy spirit to change the way that they think and the reward that they look forward to.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>So does this mean that anointed ones want to die? Paul described how anointed ones feel. He compared their human body to a “tent” and said: “In fact, we who are in this tent groan, being weighed down, because <strong>we do not want to put this one off, </strong>but we want to put the other on, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:5:4-47:5:4" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>) These Christians do not want to die.

Have you seen proof that Jehovah has helped you in many specific ways in your life? If you answer yes to all these questions, does this mean that you have been invited to go to heaven? No, it does not. Why not? Because all of God’s servants can feel this way, whether they are anointed or not. And by means of his holy spirit, Jehovah can give the same power to any of his servants, no matter what their reward will be. In fact, if you are wondering whether you will go to heaven, it means that you have <strong>not </strong>been invited. Those chosen by Jehovah do not wonder about this! They know!</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">JEHOVAH said that in our time, “ten men out of all the languages of the nations will take hold, yes, they will take firm hold of the robe of a Jew, saying: ‘We want to go with you, for we have heard that God is with you people.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/38:8:23-38:8:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Zechariah 8:23</a>) The “Jew” represents those whom God has anointed by holy spirit. They are also called “the Israel of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:16-48:6:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Galatians 6:16</a>) The “ten men” represent those who have the hope of living forever on earth.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Like the prophet Zechariah, Jesus said that God’s people would be united. He described those who look forward to living in heaven as a “little flock” and those who look forward to living on earth as “other sheep.” But Jesus said that they would all be “one flock” and would follow him, their “one shepherd.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:32-42:12:32" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 12:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> John 10:16</a>) Since there are two groups, some may wonder: (1) Do the <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>other sheep need to know the names of all today who are anointed?

The Bible says that the “ten men” would “take firm hold of the robe of <strong>a Jew, </strong>saying: ‘We want to go with <strong>you, </strong>for we have heard that God is with <strong>you people.’” </strong>The Bible verse mentions one Jew. But “you” and “you people” refer to more than one person. This means that the Jew is not just one person but represents <strong>the whole group </strong>of anointed ones. The other sheep know this, and they serve Jehovah along with that group. They do not need to know the names of every member of that group and follow each one of them.

If he does not keep a good relationship with Jehovah and is unfaithful to him, then when that person eats the bread and drinks the wine, he <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>is being disrespectful. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:6:4-58:6:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:4-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:26-58:10:29" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 10:26-29</a>) This strong warning reminds anointed ones that they must stay faithful if they want to receive “the prize of the upward call of God by means of Christ Jesus.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:3:13-50:3:16" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Philippians 3:13-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>How should anointed Christians feel about themselves?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Paul told anointed Christians: “I, the prisoner in the Lord, appeal to you to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called.” How should they do this? Paul explained: “With all humility and mildness, with patience, putting up with one another in love, earnestly endeavoring to maintain the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:1-49:4:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:1-3</a>) Jehovah’s holy spirit helps his servants to be humble, not proud. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:12-51:3:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Colossians 3:12</a>) So anointed ones do not think that they are better than others. They know that Jehovah does not necessarily give anointed ones more holy spirit than he gives his other servants. And they do not feel that they can understand Bible truths more deeply than anyone else. They would also never tell someone else that he too has been anointed and should start eating the bread and drinking the wine at the Memorial. Instead, they are humble and know that only Jehovah can invite people to go to heaven.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>7, 8. </strong>What do anointed Christians not expect, and why?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Although anointed ones feel that it is an honor to be invited to go to heaven, they do not expect others to treat them in a special way.

So an anointed person is not surprised if some do not believe right away that he has been anointed. He realizes that the Bible tells us not to be quick to believe someone who says that God has given him a special responsibility. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:2:2-66:2:2" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Revelation 2:2</a>) Because an anointed person does not expect others to give him too much attention, he would not tell those he meets for the first time that he is anointed. In fact, he would probably not mention this to anyone. He would also not boast about the wonderful things he will do in heaven.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:1:28-46:1:29" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:28, 29</a>; <strong>read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:4:6-46:4:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 4:6-8</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Anointed Christians do not feel that they should spend time only with other anointed ones, as if they were members of a club.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:7</a>) It is true that the Bible says that some are “worthy of double honor.” But this is because they “preside in a fine way” and “work hard in speaking and teaching,” not because they are anointed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:5:17-54:5:17" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:17</a>) If we give anointed ones too much praise and attention, we would embarrass them.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>12, 13. </strong>Why should we not worry about the number of those who eat the bread and drink the wine at the Memorial?</p>

But recently, that number has been going up every year. Do we need to worry about this? No. Let us see why not.</p>

So the number includes those who think that they are anointed but are not. For example, some who used to eat the bread and drink the wine later stopped. Others may have mental or emotional problems and believe that they will rule with Christ in heaven. Clearly, we do not know exactly how many anointed ones are left on earth.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>14. </strong>What does the Bible say about the number of anointed ones who will be on earth when the great tribulation starts?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup>There will be anointed ones in many parts of the earth when Jesus comes to take them to heaven. </strong>The Bible says that Jesus “will send out his angels with a great trumpet sound, and they will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds, from one extremity of the heavens to their other extremity.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:31-40:24:31" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Matthew 24:31</a>) The Bible also shows that during the last days, there will be a small number of anointed ones left on earth.

It seems that in the first century, all true Christians were anointed. For hundreds of years after that, most of those who said that they were Christians did not really follow Christ. Even so, during those years, Jehovah anointed those few who were true Christians. They were like the wheat that Jesus said would grow among the weeds.

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sc">  The apostle Paul wrote: “Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous. It does not brag, does not get puffed up, <strong>does not behave indecently, </strong>does not look for its own interests.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:13:4-46:13:5" data-bid="46-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4, 5</a>) We “behave indecently” if we are rude, have bad manners, and do not show others that we respect them. Instead, when we love our brothers, we think about their feelings before we say or do something.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="se">  We can show that we love those taking the lead in Jehovah’s organization by the way we treat them. At times, well-known brothers might visit our congregation or the convention we attend. They may be circuit overseers, Bethelites, members of the Branch Committee, members of the Governing Body, or helpers to the Governing Body. Naturally, we want to show them and their wives respect, and this is good. We do not want to be like Diotrephes, who did not welcome the brothers visiting his congregation because he did not respect them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/64:1:9-64:1:10" data-bid="47-1" class="b">3 John 9, 10</a>) But even if we welcome these brothers, could it be that we are still not showing them respect? How might this happen?</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sc">  Although we enjoy meeting and talking with the brothers and sisters who visit us, we would not show them respect if we treated them as celebrities. For example, would it show good manners if we take photos of them without their permission or when they are not aware of it, perhaps when they are eating or doing something else? Would we ask them to sign our books and Bibles? Would we push in front of others and insist that we have a photo taken with them? What effect could such behavior have on those attending one of our conventions for the first time? Surely, if we love our brothers and sisters, we would not do anything like this. Instead, we show them respect because we understand why they are visiting us and how hard they work for us.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sc">  What will help us to know how to treat our brothers? First, remember that we should give glory to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Revelation 4:11</a>) Second, realize that while it is good to respect these brothers and their wives, we would not want to treat them as celebrities. They want to be treated as our brothers and sisters. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:23:8-40:23:8" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Matthew 23:8</a>) Third, remember what Jesus taught us: “All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must do to them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:12-40:7:12" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Matthew 7:12</a>) If we remember these things, we will show love and “not behave indecently.”</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">THE apostle Paul could honestly say: “[God’s] undeserved kindness to me was not in vain.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:9-46:15:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 15:9, 10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Paul clearly knew that he had not earned or deserved God’s great mercy. He had been a persecutor of Christians.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Toward the end of his life, Paul wrote to Timothy: “I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who imparted power to me, because he considered me faithful by assigning me to a ministry.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:1:12-54:1:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:12-14</a>) What ministry was that? Paul told the elders of the congregation in Ephesus: “I do not consider my own life of any importance to me, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, <strong>to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God.”<wbr /></strong>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:20:24-44:20:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 20:24</a>.</p>

Paul said to the Christians in Ephesus: “You have heard about the stewardship of God’s undeserved kindness that was given to me for your sakes.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:3:1-49:3:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ephesians 3:1, 2</a>) Jesus had told Paul to preach the good news to those who were not Jews. Now it was possible for people from the nations to be part of the Kingdom government ruled by the Messiah. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:3:5-49:3:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 3:5-8</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Paul preached with zeal and set a good example for Christians today. He showed that God’s undeserved kindness was not “in vain,” or wasted on him.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>In this time of the end, Jehovah’s people have the assignment to preach the “good news of the Kingdom . . . in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) The good news of the Kingdom is also “the good news of the undeserved kindness of God.” How is that so? All the blessings we will receive from God’s Kingdom will be the result of Jehovah’s kindness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:1:3-49:1:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:3</a>) Paul showed gratitude for Jehovah’s undeserved kindness by zealously preaching.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>When we explain the ransom to people, how are we spreading the good news of God’s undeserved kindness?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Today, many people do not feel guilty when they sin, so they do not understand why humans need the ransom. At the same time, more and more people realize that their lifestyle does not make them happy. And until they talk to Jehovah’s Witnesses, many people do not know what sin is, how it affects us, and what we need to do to be freed from slavery to sin. Once they understand what sin is, sincere people are grateful to learn that Jehovah sent his Son to the earth to free us from sin and death. Jehovah did that because of his great love and undeserved kindness.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:9-62:4:10" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 John 4:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Notice what Paul said about Jehovah’s beloved Son: “By means of him we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one, yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his [Jehovah’s] undeserved kindness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:1:7-49:1:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:7</a>) Christ’s ransom sacrifice is <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>the greatest proof of God’s love for us and shows how great His undeserved kindness is. It is such a relief to learn that if we show faith in Jesus’ sacrifice, our sins will be forgiven and we will have a clean conscience! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:9:14-58:9:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:14</a>) This is certainly good news to share with others!</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>Why do sinful humans need to be reconciled to God?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>If people do not show faith in Jesus’ sacrifice, God views them as enemies. Therefore, we have the responsibility to tell them that they can become friends of God. The apostle John wrote: “The one who exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life; the one who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:36-43:3:36" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 3:36</a>) We can be happy that Christ’s sacrifice makes it possible for us to become God’s friends. Paul described it this way: “You who were once alienated and enemies because your minds were on the works that were wicked, he has now reconciled by means of that one’s fleshly body through his death.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:21-51:1:22" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Colossians 1:21, 22</a>.</p>

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>9, 10. </strong>(a) What responsibility did Christ give to his anointed brothers? (b) How do the “other sheep” help the anointed?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Christ has given his anointed brothers on earth “the ministry of the reconciliation.” Paul told them: “All things are from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of the reconciliation, namely, that God was by means of Christ reconciling a world to himself, not counting their offenses against them, and he entrusted to us the message of the reconciliation. Therefore, we are ambassadors substituting for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us. As substitutes for Christ, we beg: ‘Become reconciled to God.’”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:5:18-47:5:20" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 5:18-20</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>It is a privilege for the “other sheep” to help the anointed in this ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>) As Christ’s “envoys,” or messengers, the “other sheep” are doing the biggest part of the preaching work, teaching people the truth and helping them to have a close relationship with Jehovah. This is an important part of preaching the good news of the undeserved kindness of God.</p>

Paul explained what that privilege will be when he wrote: “God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us, made us alive together with the Christ, even when we were dead in trespasses<wbr />—by undeserved kindness you have been saved. Moreover, he raised us up together and seated us together in the heavenly places in union with Christ Jesus, so that in the coming systems of things he might demonstrate the surpassing riches of his undeserved kindness in his graciousness toward us in union with Christ Jesus.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:2:4-49:2:7" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:4-7</a>.</p>

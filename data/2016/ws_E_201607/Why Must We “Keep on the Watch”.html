<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">THE convention was about to start. The chairman walked onto the platform and welcomed everybody. The music was about to begin. The audience knew that it was time to sit down. They wanted to listen to the beautiful music, and they looked forward to the talks to come. But perhaps there were some who did not pay attention to the chairman or notice that the music was playing. So they did not realize that the convention was starting, and they were still walking around or talking to their friends. This situation shows what can happen if we are not aware of what time it is or of what is happening around us. This is an important lesson for us because very soon a much greater event will begin, and we must be prepared for it. What event is that?</p>

He told them: <strong>“Keep on the watch, </strong>therefore, because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.” And again he warned them: “Prove yourselves ready, because the Son of man is coming at an hour that you do not think to be it.” Then he repeated: <strong>“Keep on the watch, </strong>therefore, because you know neither the day nor the hour.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:42-40:24:44" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 24:42-44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:13-40:25:13" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 25:13</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>When we go to a convention, we know what time each session will begin. However, it is impossible for us to know exactly when the great tribulation will begin. When on earth, Jesus said: “Concerning that day and hour nobody knows, neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, but only the Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:36-40:24:36" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 24:36</a>) Of course, since Jesus is the one who will lead the war of Armageddon, most likely he now knows when that war will be. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:19:11-66:19:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 19:11-16</a>) But we still do not know the date or time when the end will come. That is why it is very important for us to keep on the watch. Jehovah has decided exactly when the great tribulation will begin, and each day it is getting closer and closer. “It will not be late!” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/35:2:1-35:2:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Habakkuk 2:1-3</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Why can we be so sure of this?</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah’s prophecies have always been fulfilled right on time! For example, think about the day he freed his people from Egypt. That was on <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>Nisan 14 in the year 1513 before Christ. Moses later wrote about that day: “At the end of the 430 years, <strong>on this very day, </strong>all the multitudes of Jehovah went out of the land of Egypt.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:40-2:12:42" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Exodus 12:40-42</a>) On Nisan 14 in the year 1943 before Christ, exactly 430 years before the Israelites were freed, Jehovah’s promise that he would bless Abraham’s offspring went into effect. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:3:17-48:3:18" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Galatians 3:17, 18</a>) Sometime later, Jehovah told Abraham: “Know for certain that your offspring will be foreigners in a land not theirs and that the people there will enslave them and afflict them for 400 years.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:15:13-1:15:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 15:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:7:6-44:7:6" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Acts 7:6</a>) The 400 years began in the year 1913 before Christ when Ishmael began to treat Isaac badly. They ended on the day that Jehovah freed the Israelites from Egypt.

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>Why can we be sure that Jehovah will save his people?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Joshua was one of the Israelites who were freed from Egypt. Many years later, he reminded the people: “You well know with all your heart and with all your soul that not one word out of all the good promises that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed. They have all come true for you. Not one word of them has failed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:23:2-6:23:2" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Joshua 23:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:23:14-6:23:14" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Jehovah has promised to deliver his people through the great tribulation and to give them everlasting life in the new world.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>We can learn a lesson from the watchmen who guarded cities in ancient times. Many of these cities, including Jerusalem, were surrounded by high walls so that enemies would not be able to get inside. Watchmen stood on these walls, and from there they could see the land all around the city. Other watchmen stood at the gates of the city. Those men had to keep on the watch night and day, and if they saw enemies coming, they had to warn the people in the city. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:62:6-23:62:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isaiah 62:6</a>) They knew how important it was to stay awake and carefully watch what was going on.

The watchmen who were guarding part of the city had fallen asleep. As a result, the Roman soldiers were able to enter the city. They went to the temple, set it on fire, and destroyed the rest of Jerusalem. That was the final part of the greatest tribulation that the Jewish nation had ever experienced.</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>10, 11. </strong>(a) Of what must we be careful, and why? (b) What convinces you that the Devil has influenced people to ignore Bible prophecy?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Imagine a watchman who has been awake all night. During the last few hours of his watch, it is much harder for him to stay awake because he is very tired. In a similar way, we are living in the last days of this world. And the closer we get to the end, the more difficult it will be for us to stay awake. How sad it would be if we did not keep on the watch! Let us discuss three things that could stop us from staying awake.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup>The Devil deceives people. </strong>He is “the ruler of this world.” Shortly before Jesus died, he reminded his disciples of this fact three times. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:12:31-43:12:31" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 12:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:30-43:14:30" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 14:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:16:11-43:16:11" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 16:11</a>) The Devil has used false religion to deceive people. That is why many today ignore Bible prophecies that clearly show that the end of this world is very near. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/36:1:14-36:1:14" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Zephaniah 1:14</a>) Clearly, Satan has “blinded the minds of the unbelievers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:4:3-47:4:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:3-6</a>) As a result, when we try to tell people that the end of this world is near and that Christ is now ruling, many of them do not want to listen. They often say, “I’m not interested.”</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>Why must we not let the Devil deceive us?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Although many are not interested in Bible prophecies, we must not let their attitude discourage us. We know why it is important to keep on the watch. Paul said to his brothers: “You yourselves know very well that Jehovah’s day is coming.” He added: “Exactly as a thief in the night.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:5:1-52:5:6" data-bid="25-1" class="b"><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:1-6</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jesus warned us: “Keep ready, because at an hour that you do not think likely, the Son of man is coming.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:39-42:12:40" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Luke 12:39, 40</a>) Soon, Satan will deceive people by making them think that there is “peace and security” in the world. Then, Jehovah’s day will suddenly come, and they will be shocked. What about us? If we want to be ready for that day and not be deceived like everyone else, we must “stay awake and keep our senses.” That is why we need to read God’s Word every day and meditate on what Jehovah tells us.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>How is the spirit of the world affecting mankind, and how can we avoid that dangerous influence?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup>The spirit of the world influences the way people think. </strong>Many today feel that they do not need to know God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3</a>) Instead, they use most of their time and energy to get many of the things that the world offers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:16-62:2:16" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 John 2:16</a>) Also, more than ever before, there is a wide variety of entertainment that attracts people and encourages them to love pleasure and satisfy any desire they have. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:4-55:3:4" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:4</a>) These things distract people from what is more important, and they do not think about their relationship with God.

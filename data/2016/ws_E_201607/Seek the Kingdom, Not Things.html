<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>What is materialism? It is the attitude of a person who cares more about things than about his relationship with God. He is not satisfied with having just what he needs, but instead he always wants more. Even those who do not have a lot of money or who do not buy expensive things could become materialistic. They may stop putting the Kingdom first in their lives.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:5-58:13:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:5</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Satan wants us to believe that we can enjoy life only if we have a lot of things.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:15-62:2:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:6-1:3:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Genesis 3:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:27:20-20:27:20" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Proverbs 27:20</a>) We constantly see and hear advertisements that try to convince us to buy new products. Have you ever bought something just because it looked appealing in the store or because you saw it in an advertisement? If so, maybe you later realized that you did not really need it. When we keep buying things that we do not need, we complicate our life. Those things can distract us from serving Jehovah. For example, we may not have enough time left to study the Bible, prepare for and attend meetings, and go out in the ministry regularly. Remember, the apostle John warned: “The world is passing away and so is its desire.”</p>

He knew that if they worried too much, even about things that they really needed, they could forget what is more important in life. Jesus cared about his disciples so much that he warned them four more times about this danger in his sermon.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:27-40:6:28" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 6:27, 28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:31-40:6:31" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 31,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:34-40:6:34" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 34</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>But why did Jesus tell us not to worry about what we will eat, or drink, or wear? Do we not need food and clothing? Of course we do! And if we do not have enough money to get these things, it is normal to worry. Jesus knew that. He knew what people needed. And he knew that “in the last days,” his disciples would be living in very difficult times. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>) In fact, many people today cannot find a job, and things keep getting more expensive.

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>When Jesus taught his followers how to pray, what did he say should be most important in their life?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Earlier, Jesus had taught his disciples that when they prayed, they should ask their Father in heaven to give them what they needed. They could pray: “Give us today our bread for this day.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:11-40:6:11" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 6:11</a>) Another time, he told them to pray: “Give us each day our bread according to our daily <strong>needs.” </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:11:3-42:11:3" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 11:3</a>) But that does not mean that we should constantly think about getting the things we need. In fact, Jesus told his followers that praying for God’s Kingdom to come is <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>more important than praying for their own needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:11:2-42:11:2" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Luke 11:2</a>) To help the disciples stop worrying, Jesus then comforted them by reminding them of how Jehovah cares for all his creation.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>11, 12. </strong>What do we learn from the way Jehovah cares for the birds of heaven? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:26-40:6:26" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 6:26</strong></a><strong>. </strong>We should “observe intently the birds of heaven.” Even though birds are small creatures, they eat a lot. In fact, if a bird were as big as a human, it would eat more food than a human does. Birds eat fruit, seeds, insects, and worms. But they do not need to sow seeds and grow their own food. Jehovah provides everything they need. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:147:9-19:147:9" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 147:9</a>) Of course, he does not put the food in their beaks! They have to go and find it, but it is there for them to find.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Jesus had no doubt that if his Father takes care of the birds, he will also take care of people.<span data-enid="1" class="en"><strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong><span class="tt en" data-rel-enid="1"></span></span> (See endnote.) (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:5:6-60:5:7" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:6, 7</a>) Of course, like the birds, we should not be lazy. We must work either to grow our food or to earn money to buy it. Jehovah can bless our efforts. And when we do not have enough money or food, he can still provide what we need. For example, others may share what they have with us. Jehovah also provides birds a place to live. He has given them the ability to build nests, and he has made the things that the birds use to build these nests. Jehovah can likewise help us find a suitable place for our family to live.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>What proves that we are worth more than the birds of heaven?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>After Jesus reminded his disciples that Jehovah feeds the birds, he asked them: “Are you not worth more than they are?” (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:6-42:12:7" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 12:6, 7</a>.) When he said this, Jesus likely thought about how he would soon give his life for all humans. Yes, Jesus did not die for the birds or for any other animal. He died for us so that we may live forever.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28</a>.</p>

He meant that we cannot make our life any longer by worrying about the things we need. In fact, if we have too much stress, we could get sick and even die.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>15, 16. </strong>(a) What do we learn from the way Jehovah cares for the lilies of the field? (See opening picture.) (b) What questions might we need to ask ourselves, and why?</p>

But do we need to be “anxious about clothing”? Once again, Jesus reminded his disciples how Jehovah takes care of his creation. Jesus used the example of “the lilies of the field.” “The lilies” might refer to flowers such as gladiolus, hyacinths, irises, and tulips. None of these have to sew clothes for themselves. But they are so beautiful <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>that Jesus said that “not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these”!</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Think about what Jesus said next: “If this is how God clothes the vegetation of the field . . . , will he not much rather clothe you, you with little faith?” Of course he will!

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"><strong>1, 2. </strong>(a) Describe Jesus’ illustration of the owner of the vineyard. (b) How does the story illustrate the qualities of generosity and undeserved kindness?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">EARLY one morning, the owner of a vineyard went to a marketplace to hire men to work for him. He offered them a certain amount of money, and the men accepted the offer. But because the owner needed more workers, he went back to the market several times during the day to hire more men. He offered to pay all the men an amount of money that was fair. At the end of the day, the owner gathered the workers in order to pay them. And whether they had worked all day or just one hour, he gave them the same amount of money. However, when the men who had worked all day began to complain, the owner said: ‘Did you not agree to the payment I offered? Do I not have the right to give all my workers whatever I want? Are you envious because I am generous?’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:20:1-40:20:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 20:1-15</a>, footnote.</p>

Some may think that the men who worked all day deserved more money than the others. But the owner showed undeserved kindness to the workers who worked only part of the day. One expert said the following about the word for “undeserved kindness” used in the Bible: “The whole basic idea of the word is that of a free and undeserved gift, of something given to a man unearned and unmerited.”</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"><strong>3, 4. </strong>Why and how has Jehovah shown undeserved kindness toward all mankind?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>The Bible tells us that God’s undeserved kindness is a “free gift.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:3:7-49:3:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ephesians 3:7</a>) Because we cannot obey Jehovah perfectly, we do not deserve to receive any kindness from God. In fact, we deserve to die. King Solomon said: “There is no righteous man on earth who always does good and never sins.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:7:20-21:7:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>) Later, the apostle Paul said: “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,” and “the wages sin pays is death.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Romans 3:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 6:23a</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Because Jehovah loves humans so much, he sent “his only-begotten Son” to die for us. That was the greatest act of undeserved kindness possible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) Paul said that Jesus is “now crowned with glory and honor for having suffered death, so that by <strong>God’s undeserved kindness </strong>he might taste death for everyone.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:2:9-58:2:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:9</a>) Yes, “the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 6:23b</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"><strong>5, 6. </strong>What are the results when we are ruled (a) by sin? (b) by undeserved kindness?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Why do we sin and die? The Bible says that “by the trespass of the one man death ruled as king.” So because we are Adam’s descendants, we are imperfect and we die. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Romans 5:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:14-45:5:14" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:17-45:5:17" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 17</a>) However, we can still choose not to be ruled, or controlled, by sin. How is that possible? When we show faith in Christ’s ransom sacrifice, we benefit from Jehovah’s undeserved kindness. The Bible says: “Where sin abounded, undeserved kindness abounded still more. To what end? So that just as sin ruled as king with death, so also undeserved kindness might rule as king through righteousness leading to everlasting life through Jesus Christ.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:20-45:5:21" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Romans 5:20, 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Even though we are still sinners, we do not have to let sin rule over us. So when we do something wrong, we ask Jehovah for forgiveness. Paul warned us: “Sin must not be master over you, seeing that you are not under law but under undeserved kindness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:14-45:6:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Romans 6:14</a>) How, then, can we benefit from God’s undeserved kindness? Paul said: “The undeserved kindness of God . . . trains us to reject ungodliness and worldly desires and to <strong>live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion </strong>amid <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>this present system of things.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:2:11-56:2:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Titus 2:11, 12</a>.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>How do we benefit from Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, and how can we show our gratitude for it?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup>Jehovah forgives our sins. </strong>Thanks to his undeserved kindness, Jehovah forgives our sins. But he does so only if we repent and continue to fight against our sinful desires. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:1:8-62:1:9" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>1 John 1:8, 9</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Paul explained to anointed Christians of his time how Jehovah forgives sins. He said: “[God] rescued us from the authority of the darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, by means of whom we have our release by ransom, the forgiveness of our sins.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:13-51:1:14" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Colossians 1:13, 14</a>) We are so grateful for God’s mercy that we want to praise him.

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>What do we enjoy because of God’s undeserved kindness?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup>We can have a peaceful relationship with God. </strong>We are imperfect, so from the time we are born, we are enemies of God.

Paul explained this and how it relates to Jehovah’s undeserved kindness when he said to his anointed brothers: “Now that we have been declared <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>righteous as a result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we also have obtained access by faith into this undeserved kindness in which we now stand.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:1-45:5:2" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Romans 5:1, 2</a>) How grateful we are to enjoy a peaceful friendship with Jehovah!</p>

And he answers our prayers even though he does not have to do so. He often uses our brothers and sisters to help us. Jehovah answers our prayers “so that we may be of good courage and say: ‘Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid.

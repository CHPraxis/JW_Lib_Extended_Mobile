Peace With Jehovah Requires That We Honor His Son, Jesus



Hostility toward Jehovah and Jesus was prophesied

2:1-3





  It was prophesied that the nations would not accept Jesus’ authority but would insist on their own

  This prophecy had fulfillment during Jesus’ time on earth and has a greater fulfillment today

  The psalmist says that the nations mutter an empty thing, meaning that their purpose is empty and doomed to failure





Only those who honor Jehovah’s anointed King will gain life

2:8-12
  All who oppose the Messianic King will be destroyed

  By honoring the Son, Jesus, individuals can find safety and peace

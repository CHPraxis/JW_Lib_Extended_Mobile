Are You Using JW Library?




JW Library is a free app (software application) that will allow you to download the Bible and other publications, videos, and audio programs to your phone, tablet, or computer.





HOW TO GET IT: Go online, and install JW Library from an app store. The app is available for various devices. While online, open the app and choose the items you wish to download to your device. If you cannot get online at home, perhaps you can do so at the Kingdom Hall, a public library, or a nearby coffee shop. Once publications are downloaded to your device, you do not need to connect to the Internet to access them. Because new features are regularly added to JW Library, you should go online from time to time and install app updates when they are available.
WHY GET IT? JW Library makes it very convenient to do personal study and follow along during congregation meetings. It is also useful for the ministry, especially when witnessing informally.

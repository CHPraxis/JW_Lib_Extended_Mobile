<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"> <strong>Token: </strong>According to one reference work, the Greek term translated “token” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:1:22-47:1:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 1:22</a> was “a legal and commercial technical term” meaning <em>“first instalment, deposit, down payment, pledge, </em>that pays a part of the purchase price in advance, and so secures a legal claim to the article in question, or makes a contract valid.” In the case of anointed ones, the full payment, or reward, is described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:5:1-47:5:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 5:1-5</a> as involving the putting on of an incorruptible heavenly body. The reward also includes receiving the gift of immortality.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:48-46:15:54" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:48-54</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In modern Greek, a related expression is used for an engagement ring. This is a fitting illustration for those who will become part of Christ’s figurative wife.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:11:2-47:11:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Rev. 21:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:9-66:21:9" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"> <strong>Seal: </strong>In the past, a seal was used as a signature to prove ownership, authenticity, or agreement. In the case of the anointed, they are “sealed,” or branded, figuratively by holy spirit as God’s possession. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:1:13-49:1:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eph. 1:13, 14</a>) This seal is not made permanent, though, until either sometime before the person dies faithful or sometime before the outbreak of the great tribulation.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:30-49:4:30" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eph. 4:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:2-66:7:4" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Rev. 7:2-4</a>.</p>

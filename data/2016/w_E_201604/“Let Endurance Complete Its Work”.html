<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">THE battle was grueling. Israelite soldiers led by Judge Gideon had chased their enemies<wbr />—the Midianite army and its allies—<wbr />all night for a distance of some 20 miles (32 km)! The Bible relates what happened next: “Gideon then came to the Jordan and crossed it. He and the 300 men with him were tired.” Nevertheless, Gideon and his men had not yet won the war, for about 15,000 enemy soldiers remained. After having suffered years of Midianite oppression, the Israelites knew that this was no time to give up. So to eliminate the enemy, “they kept up the pursuit” and subdued Midian.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/7:7:22-7:7:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judg. 7:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/7:8:4-7:8:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 8:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/7:8:10-7:8:10" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/7:8:28-7:8:28" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 28</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What is endurance?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>In the Bible, enduring means more than simply putting up with trials or adversity. Endurance involves our mind and heart, or the <em>way </em>we react to hardships. A person who endures manifests courage, steadfastness, and patience. Endurance is “the spirit which can bear things, not simply with resignation, but with blazing hope,” says one reference work. “It is the quality which keeps a man on his feet with his face to the wind. It is the virtue which can transmute the hardest trial into glory because beyond the pain it sees the goal.”</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Why can we say that endurance is motivated by love?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Christian endurance is motivated by love. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:13:4-46:13:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 13:4,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:13:7-46:13:7" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> <strong>7</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Love for Jehovah motivates us to endure anything that is in harmony with his will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:41-42:22:42" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 22:41, 42</a>) Love for our brothers helps us to endure their imperfections. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:4:8-60:4:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:8</a>) Love for our marriage mate enables us to endure “tribulation” that even happily married couples experience and to strengthen the marital bond.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:7:28-46:7:28" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:28</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>WHAT WILL HELP YOU TO ENDURE?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>Why is Jehovah the best one to help us endure?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong><em>Turn to Jehovah for strength. </em>Jehovah is “the God who supplies endurance and comfort.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:5-45:15:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 15:5</a>) He alone fully understands not only the problems we face but also the way our environment, emotions, and even our genetic makeup affect us. He is thus the best one to equip us to endure. “He satisfies the desire of those who fear him,” the Bible says. “He hears their cry for help, and he rescues them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:145:19-19:145:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 145:19</a>) How, though, will God answer our prayers for strength to endure?</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>As promised in the Bible, how may Jehovah “make the way out” of trials for us?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:10:13-46:10:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 10:13</strong></a><strong>. </strong>When we ask Jehovah to help us cope with trials, he will “make the way out.” Does Jehovah maneuver matters to remove the trial? Perhaps. Often, however, he makes the way out <em>“so that </em>[<em>we</em>] <em>may be able to endure it.” </em>Yes, Jehovah strengthens us so that we “may endure fully with patience and joy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:11-51:1:11" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Col. 1:11</a>) And since he knows our physical, mental, and emotional limits so intimately, Jehovah will never allow a situation to develop to a point that we cannot remain faithful.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>Illustrate why we need spiritual food to endure.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><em>Nourish your faith with spiritual food. </em>On Mount Everest, the world’s tallest mountain, a climber burns about 6,000 calories a day, considerably more than the average person needs. To endure the ascent and reach their goal, climbers must consume as many calories as possible. Similarly, to endure in our Christian course and reach our goal, we must regularly take in as much spiritual food as possible. We need self-discipline to devote time to reading, study, and our Christian meetings. These activities <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>nourish our faith with “the food that remains for everlasting life.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:6:27-43:6:27" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 6:27</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>8, 9. </strong>(a) According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:2:4-18:2:5" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Job 2:4, 5</a>, what is involved when we face trials? (b) When you face trials, what invisible scene might you imagine?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong><em>Remember the issue of integrity. </em>When a servant of Jehovah faces a trial, there is much more at stake than one person’s suffering. By the way we react to our trials, we demonstrate whether we really view Jehovah as the Universal Sovereign. Satan, an enemy of Jehovah’s sovereignty, taunted Jehovah with the words: “A man will give everything that he has for his life. But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike [Job’s] bone and flesh, and he will surely curse you to your very face.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:2:4-18:2:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 2:4, 5</a>) According to Satan, no one serves Jehovah out of unselfish love. Has Satan changed since he made that claim? Not at all! Many centuries later, when he was ousted from heaven, Satan was still called “the accuser of our brothers . . . , who accuses them day and night before our God!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:12:10-66:12:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rev. 12:10</a>) Satan has not forgotten the issue of integrity. He is eager to see us surrender to our trial and withdraw our support of God’s sovereignty.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>When you struggle with adversity, therefore, imagine this invisible scene. Satan and his demonic followers are on one side, pointing to your struggles and alleging that you will buckle under the pressure and give up. On the other side are Jehovah, his reigning Son, the resurrected anointed ones, and myriads of angels. They are cheering you on, delighted by your daily endurance and support of Jehovah’s sovereignty. You can take personally Jehovah’s inspired request: “Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, so that I can make a reply to him who taunts me.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>How can you imitate Jesus in focusing on the rewards of endurance?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>Focus on the rewards of endurance. </em>Suppose that while traveling on a lengthy journey, you stop in the middle of a long tunnel. Everywhere you look, it is dark. Nevertheless, you are confident that if you keep traveling toward the end of the tunnel, you will again see light. Similarly, you may at times feel overwhelmed by the problems you face. Even Jesus could have felt that way. He was the target of “hostile speech from sinners,” humiliation, and even painful execution on “a torture stake”<wbr />—surely the darkest period of his life on earth! Yet, Jesus endured it all “for the joy that was set before him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:2-58:12:3" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Heb. 12:2, 3</a>) He focused on the rewards of his endurance, particularly his contribution to the sanctification of God’s name and the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty. The darkness of Jesus’ trials was temporary, but the brilliance of his heavenly reward would be everlasting. Today, the trials you face may be painful and even crushing. But remember that your tribulations on the road to eternal life are temporary.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>Why should we consider the experiences of “those who have endured”?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>We do not have to endure alone. To encourage Christians to endure the hardships heaped on them by Satan, the apostle Peter wrote: “Take your stand against him, firm in the faith, knowing that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced by the entire association of your brothers in the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:5:9-60:5:9" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:9</a>) The experiences of “those <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>who have endured” teach us how to remain steadfast, reassure us that we can succeed, and remind us that our faithful course will be rewarded. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:5:11-59:5:11" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jas. 5:11</a>) Let us consider a few examples.<span data-enid="1" class="en"><strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong><span class="tt en" data-rel-enid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>What do we learn from the example of the cherubs posted at Eden?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong><em>The cherubs. </em>The example set by some of the first spirit creatures to appear to humans can teach us to endure in a difficult assignment. Jehovah God “posted at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubs and the flaming blade of a sword that was turning continuously to guard the way to the tree of life.”<span data-enid="2" class="en"><strong><sup>[2]</sup></strong><span class="tt en" data-rel-enid="2"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:24-1:3:24" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Gen. 3:24</a>) Surely those cherubs were not originally created for this assignment! After all, sin and rebellion were not part of Jehovah’s purpose for mankind. Yet, nowhere do we read that the cherubs<wbr />—spirit creatures of high rank—<wbr />complained that they were overqualified for this task. They did not become bored and give up. Rather, they obediently stuck to their assignment and endured until their work was completed<wbr />—perhaps at the time of the Flood, over 1,600 years later!</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>How was Job able to endure his trials?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong><em>The patriarch Job. </em>If you are crushed by the discouraging words of a friend or family member, are plagued by a serious illness, or are grieved by the death of a loved one, you can find comfort in the example of Job.

Why not? For one thing, “he feared God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:1:1-18:1:1" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Job 1:1</a>) Job was determined to please Jehovah in favorable and unfavorable circumstances. With God’s help, Job reflected on the wondrous things Jehovah had already accomplished by means of His holy spirit. Job became even more confident that Jehovah would end his trials at the right time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:42:1-18:42:2" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Job 42:1, 2</a>) And that is precisely what happened. “Jehovah removed Job’s tribulation and restored his prosperity.

For instance, what if you struggle with unclean thoughts? Rather than give in to temptation, prayerfully reject such desires. You will thus fortify your self-control.

To survive, the passengers must swim to shore. The swimmer who gives up only a few yards from shore faces the same fate as the swimmer who gave up much earlier. Similarly, we are determined to endure until we reach the new world. Our life depends on our enduring.

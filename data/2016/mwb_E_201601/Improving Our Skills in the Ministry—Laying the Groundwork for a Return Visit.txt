Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Laying the Groundwork for a Return Visit



WHY IMPORTANT:

We want to water the seeds of truth that we plant. (1Co 3:6) When we find someone who shows interest, it is good to leave a question that we can discuss when we return. This will build his anticipation and simplify our preparation for the return visit. When we return, we can tell him that we are there to answer the question we raised the last time we visited.



HOW TO DO IT:






  When preparing your house-to-house presentation, include a follow-up question to be answered on the next visit. It could be something that is answered in the literature you are offering. Or it could be a question that is answered in one of our study publications that you plan to introduce when you return.

  When concluding your conversation with someone who shows interest, let him know of your desire to talk to him again and then share the follow-up question you prepared. Obtain contact information if possible.

  If you tell him that you will return at a specific time, keep your appointment.—Mt 5:37.

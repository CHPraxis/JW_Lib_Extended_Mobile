LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Our Privilege to Build and Maintain Places of True Worship




Constructing Israel’s temple required much work and expense. However, the Israelites supported the project with zeal. (1Ch 29:2-9; 2Ch 6:7, 8) After the temple was completed, the maintenance done by the Israelites reflected their spirituality or lack thereof. (2Ki 22:3-6; 2Ch 28:24; 29:3) Today, Christians put much time and effort into building, cleaning, and maintaining Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls. However, working along with Jehovah in this way is a grand privilege and is part of our sacred service.—Ps 127:1; Re 7:15.

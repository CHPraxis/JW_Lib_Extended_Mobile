TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | EZRA 6-10
Jehovah Wants Willing Servants








Ezra made preparations to return to Jerusalem

7:6, 22; 8:26, 27
  Ezra receives permission from King Artaxerxes to return to Jerusalem to advance worship of Jehovah there

  The king grants Ezra “everything he requested” for Jehovah’s house—gold, silver, wheat, wine, oil, and salt, all worth well over $100,000,000 (U.S.) at modern values





Ezra trusted in Jehovah to protect His servants

7:13; 8:21-23
  The return to Jerusalem would be difficult

  The possible route was nearly 1,000 miles (1,600 km) through dangerous territory

  The journey took about 4 months

  Those who returned needed strong faith, zeal for true worship, and courage

            Read the numbered question in bold print to help the householder focus on the main point.

            Read the paragraph that follows.

             Read the italicized scriptures, and use tactful questions to help the householder see how the scriptures answer the numbered question.

             If there is another paragraph under the question, repeat steps 2 andÂ 3. If there is a video on jw.org that corresponds with the numbered question, play it at some point during your discussion.

             To make sure that the householder understands the main point, ask him to answer the numbered question.

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"><strong>1, 2. </strong>Why do Jehovah’s Witnesses have appropriate standards of dress? (See opening picture.)</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">A DUTCH newspaper described how church leaders were dressed at one of their meetings. It said: “You saw a lot of casual clothing, especially when it was hot.” However, the same newspaper said that this was not how Jehovah’s Witnesses were dressed at their convention. It reported that the boys and men wore jackets and ties and that the girls and women wore skirts that were modest in length, yet modern. Jehovah’s Witnesses are often commended for the way they dress. The apostle Paul said that the clothes Christians wear should show “modesty and good judgment,” which is proper for God’s servants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:2:9-54:2:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:9, 10</a>, footnote) Although Paul was speaking about women, the standard is the same for Christian men.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Good standards of dress are important to us as Jehovah’s people, and they are important to the God we worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:21-1:3:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 3:21</a>) The Bible makes it clear that Jehovah, the Sovereign of the universe, has standards for the <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>way he wants his servants to dress. So, what we choose to wear should please not only us but, more important, our Sovereign Lord, Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What can we learn about clothing from God’s Law to the Israelites?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>In the Mosaic Law, there were rules that protected the Israelites against the very immoral way of life of the nations around them. The Law showed that Jehovah has strong feelings against clothing that does not show the clear difference between men and women. Today, the style that does not make the difference clear is called unisex fashion. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:22:5-5:22:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 22:5</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>From the Law, we learn that Jehovah is not pleased with clothing that makes men look like women, that makes women look like men, or that makes it hard to see the difference between men and women.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>What can help Christians to make good decisions about how to dress?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Bible principles can help us to make good decisions about how to dress. These principles apply no matter what country or climate we live in or what our culture is. We do not need a long list of what is acceptable clothing and what is not. We just need to follow Scriptural principles, which still allow us to wear things we like. Let us consider some Bible principles that can help us determine “the good and acceptable and perfect will of God” when we are deciding what to wear.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:1-45:12:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Romans 12:1, 2</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The apostle Paul was inspired to mention the important principle found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:6:4-47:6:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>2 Corinthians 6:4</strong></a><strong>. (Read.) </strong>The way we look sends a message to others, and many people will form an opinion about us based on how we look. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:16:7-9:16:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Samuel 16:7</a>) Because we are God’s servants, we need to do more than just wear what is comfortable or what we like. When we apply Bible principles, it should help us to avoid wearing clothing that is tight-fitting, revealing, or sexy. This means that we would avoid clothing that exposes or highlights private parts of our body. Nobody should feel uncomfortable or forced to look the other way when they see how we are dressed.</p>

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"><strong>7, 8. </strong>When especially do we need to wear appropriate clothing?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>We owe it to our holy God, to our Christian brothers and sisters, and to the people in our territory to dress in a way that honors Jehovah and the message we preach. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:13:8-45:13:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 13:8-10</a>) What we wear is especially important when we go to our Christian meetings or when we preach. We should dress in a way that is proper for people who worship God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:2:10-54:2:10" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:10</a>) Of course, some clothing that is appropriate in one place may not be appropriate in another. So no matter where we live, as Jehovah’s Witnesses we should avoid offending others by the way we dress.</p>

We should not imitate the extreme styles of clothing common in the world. Even before and after the convention program and when we are checking in or out of a hotel, we should make sure that our clothing is not overly casual or sloppy.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:4-50:2:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Philippians 2:4</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Why should we think about how our clothing affects our Christian brothers and sisters? One reason is that God’s people work hard to follow the advice: “Deaden, therefore, your body members that are on the earth as respects sexual immorality, uncleanness, uncontrolled sexual passion.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:2-51:3:2" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Colossians 3:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 5</a>) Some of our brothers and sisters gave up a sexually immoral life, but they may still be fighting against wrong desires. If we are not careful, the way we dress could make it even more difficult for them to follow the Bible’s counsel and fight against those desires. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>) We would not want to make their fight more difficult, would we?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>When we are with our brothers and sisters, we are safe from people who promote immorality. The way we dress should add to this clean environment, whether we are at a meeting or in a casual setting. Although we have the freedom to choose what to wear, we also have the responsibility to wear clothes that make it easier for others to keep their thoughts, words, and conduct clean in God’s eyes.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>There is another important principle that should affect our choice of clothing.

The apostle Paul wrote: “Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.” Paul added this reason: “For even the Christ did not please himself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:2-45:15:3" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Romans 15:2, 3</a>) Like Jesus, we should view doing God’s will and helping others as more important than our personal preferences.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>The Bible is a practical guide that can help us to make wise choices that will honor God. Even so, what we wear reflects our personal taste. The styles we like and the clothes we can afford may be different from those of others. But our clothes should always be neat, clean, modest, appropriate for the occasion, and acceptable locally.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>16. </strong>Why is it worth making the effort to be well dressed?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>It is not always easy to find modest and appropriate clothing. Many stores sell only popular fashions. So it may take more time and effort to find modest skirts, dresses, and blouses or to select suits and trousers that are not too tight.

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>17. </strong>What are some factors that may affect whether a brother wears a beard?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>Is it appropriate for brothers to wear a beard? The Mosaic Law required men to wear a beard. However, Christians are not under the Mosaic Law or required to follow it.

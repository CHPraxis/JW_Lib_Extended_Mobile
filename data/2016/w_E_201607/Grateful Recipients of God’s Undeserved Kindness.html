<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">A WINEGROWER went to the marketplace early one morning to hire men to work in his vineyard. The men he found agreed to the wage he offered and went to work. The owner needed more workers, however, and returned to the marketplace throughout the day to hire more and more men, offering a fair wage even to those whom he hired at the end of the afternoon. When evening came, he gathered the workers together to give them their wages, and he gave the same amount to each of them, whether they had labored many hours or just one. When those first hired realized this, they complained. The winegrower replied: ‘Did you not agree to the wage I offered? Do I not have the right to give all my workers whatever I want? Are you envious because I am generous?’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:20:1-40:20:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 20:1-15</a>, ftn.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jesus’ parable reminds us of one of Jehovah’s qualities that is often mentioned in the Bible<wbr />—his “undeserved kindness.”<span data-enid="1" class="en"><strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong><span class="tt en" data-rel-enid="1"></span></span> <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:6:1-47:6:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>2 Corinthians 6:1</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>The workers who had <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>labored only one hour did not seem to merit receiving the full wage, but the owner of the vineyard showed them extraordinary kindness. Regarding the word for “undeserved kindness,” which is translated “grace” in many Bible versions, one scholar wrote: “The whole basic idea of the word is that of a free and undeserved gift, of something given to a man unearned and unmerited.”</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"><strong>3, 4. </strong>Why and how has Jehovah shown undeserved kindness toward all mankind?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>The Scriptures speak of “the free gift of God’s undeserved kindness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:3:7-49:3:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 3:7</a>) Why and how does Jehovah bestow this “free gift”? If we met all of Jehovah’s requirements perfectly, his kindness toward us would be deserved. As it is, we fail to do so. Thus, wise King Solomon wrote: “There is no righteous man on earth who always does good and never sins.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:7:20-21:7:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eccl. 7:20</a>) The apostle Paul likewise stated: “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,” and “the wages sin pays is death.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 3:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 6:23a</a>) That is what we deserve.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Jehovah, however, expressed his love toward fallen mankind in an incomparable act of undeserved kindness. He sent his greatest gift of all, “his only-begotten Son,” to earth to die in our behalf. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) So Paul wrote concerning Jesus that he is “now crowned with glory and honor for having suffered death, so that by God’s undeserved kindness he might taste death for everyone.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:2:9-58:2:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 2:9</a>) Yes, “the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 6:23b</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"><strong>5, 6. </strong>What are the results when we are ruled (a) by sin? (b) by undeserved kindness?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>How did humans inherit the sinful, dying condition that plagues us all? The Bible explains: “By the trespass of the one man [Adam] death ruled as king” over Adam’s descendants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:14-45:5:14" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:17-45:5:17" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 17</a>) Happily, though, we can choose no longer to be ruled, or dominated, by sin. By exercising faith in Christ’s ransom sacrifice, we place ourselves under the rule of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness. How so? “Where sin abounded, undeserved kindness abounded still more. To what end? So that just as sin ruled as king with death, so also undeserved kindness might rule as king through righteousness leading to everlasting life through Jesus Christ.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:20-45:5:21" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rom. 5:20, 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Even though we remain sinners, we need not resign ourselves to having sin dominate our lives. When we do give in to sin, we will ask Jehovah for his forgiveness. Paul warned Christians: “Sin must not be master over you, seeing that you are not under law but under undeserved kindness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:14-45:6:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rom. 6:14</a>) Therefore, we come under the rule of undeserved kindness. With what result? Paul explained: “The undeserved kindness of God . . . trains us to reject ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:2:11-56:2:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Titus 2:11, 12</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>7, 8. </strong>What does it mean that Jehovah’s undeserved kindness is “expressed in various ways”? (See opening pictures.)</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>The apostle Peter wrote: “To the extent that each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness that is expressed in various ways.” <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:4:10-60:4:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:10</a>) What does that mean? That whatever the nature of the trials we may face in life, Jehovah can enable us to cope with them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:6-60:1:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:6</a>) There will always be an expression of God’s kindness that will match each trial.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Indeed, Jehovah’s undeserved kindness is expressed in various ways. The apostle John wrote: “We all received from his fullness, even undeserved kindness upon undeserved kindness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:16-43:1:16" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 1:16</a>) The various expressions of Jehovah’s kindness result in our receiving many blessings. What are some of them?</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>How do we benefit from Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, and how can we show our gratitude for it?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong><em>Being forgiven of our sins. </em>Because of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, we have our sins forgiven, provided we repent and continue to put up a hard fight against our sinful inclinations. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:1:8-62:1:9" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>1 John 1:8, 9</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>God’s mercy should fill us with gratitude and move us to glorify him. Writing to fellow anointed Christians, Paul stated: “[Jehovah] rescued us from the authority of the darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, by means of whom we have our release by ransom, the forgiveness of our sins.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:13-51:1:14" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Col. 1:13, 14</a>) Being forgiven of our sins opens the door to many other wonderful blessings.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>What do we enjoy because of God’s undeserved kindness?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong><em>Having a peaceful relationship with God. </em>In our sinful state, from birth we were enemies of God. Paul acknowledged this: “When we were enemies we became reconciled to God through the death of his Son.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:10-45:5:10" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Rom. 5:10</a>) This reconciliation enables us to be at peace with Jehovah. Paul links this privilege to Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, stating: “Now that we [Christ’s anointed brothers] have been declared righteous as a result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we also have obtained access by faith into this undeserved kindness in which we now stand.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:1-45:5:2" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rom. 5:1, 2</a>) What a blessing this is!</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:51:17-19:51:17" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 51:17</a>) To Christians in Thessalonica, who were experiencing persecution, Paul wrote: “May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and gave everlasting comfort and good hope by means of undeserved kindness, comfort your hearts and strengthen you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/53:2:16-53:2:17" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Thess. 2:16, 17</a>, ftn.)

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>While undeserved kindness from Jehovah provides us with many blessings, we should not presumptuously think that he condones all conduct.

No, but go on growing in the undeserved kindness and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:17-61:3:18" data-bid="35-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:17, 18</a>.</p>

APPLY YOURSELF TO THE FIELD MINISTRY
Convention Invitation Campaign









Each year, anticipation builds for the spiritual feast that we enjoy at our regional conventions. So that others too may taste Jehovah’s goodness, we will invite as many as possible to attend with us. (Ps 34:8) Each body of elders will determine how to make the best possible use of the invitations.



DETAILS TO KEEP IN MIND

When is my convention?

When does the campaign begin locally?

When are the local meetings for field service?

What are my goals for the campaign?

Whom do I plan to invite?





WHAT WILL YOU SAY?






After giving a customary greeting, you might say:
“We are involved in a global campaign to distribute this invitation to a very important event. The date, time, and address are printed on the invitation. We would enjoy having you present with us.”



HOW CAN YOU CULTIVATE INTEREST?






Although we want to invite as many people as possible to the convention, we should be alert to cultivate any interest shown.
On weekends, you may offer the magazine along with the invitation.

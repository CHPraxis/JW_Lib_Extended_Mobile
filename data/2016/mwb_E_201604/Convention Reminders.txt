LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Convention Reminders




As at other times, we want to be guided by love for God and neighbor during the convention season. (Mt 22:37-39) First Corinthians 13:4-8 describes love in action: “Love is patient and kind. . . . [It] does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. . . . Love never fails.” As you watch the video Convention Reminders, think about ways you can show love for others at the convention.



HOW CAN WE SHOW LOVE . . .

when saving seats?






when the musical program is about to begin?






at our lodgings in the convention city?






by volunteering to help?

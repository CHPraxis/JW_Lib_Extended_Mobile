TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | JOB 16-20
Encourage and Strengthen Others With Kind Words



A counselor’s words should strengthen others

16:4, 5
  Job felt depressed and anguished, so he needed support and encouragement from others

  Job’s three companions said nothing to comfort him. Rather, they made accusations and added to his anxiety





Bildad’s unkind words caused Job to cry out in distress

19:2, 25
  Job cried out to God for some type of relief—even death

  Job focused on his hope in the resurrection and continued to endure faithfully










JOB’S ACCUSERS





Eliphaz:
  Possibly from Teman in the land of Edom. Teman is noted at Jeremiah 49:7 as a center of Edomite wisdom

  Likely the oldest and most influential of the “comforters,” Eliphaz was the first to speak. He gave three speeches and spoke longer than the other two men


False accusations:
  Ridiculed Job’s integrity and claimed that God had no faith in his servants (Job 4, 5)

  Called Job presumptuous and wicked and claimed that Job had no fear of God (Job 15)

  Accused Job of greed and injustice and claimed that man is useless to God (Job 22)







Bildad:
  A descendant of Shuah. He may have lived along the Euphrates River

  He was the second to speak. His three speeches were shorter and more hurtful than those of Eliphaz


False accusations:
  Implied that Job’s sons had sinned and deserved the calamity that struck them and suggested that Job himself was godless (Job 8)

  Implied that Job was a wrongdoer (Job 18)

  Claimed that man’s integrity is in vain (Job 25)







Zophar:
  A Naamathite, possibly from northwest Arabia

  He was the third to speak and the harshest accuser. He gave only two speeches


False accusations:
  Accused Job of empty talk and told him to put away his evil practices (Job 11)

  Implied that Job was wicked and enjoyed sin (Job 20)

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | JOB 33-37
A True Friend Gives Upbuilding Counsel




When Elihu entered the conversation, his counsel was completely different from that of Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, both in content and in the way he dealt with Job. He proved himself to be a true friend and an effective counselor, worthy of imitation.

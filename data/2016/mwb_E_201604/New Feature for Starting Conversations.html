<p id="p3" data-pid="3">Since January 2016, the back page of the public edition of <em>The Watchtower </em>has featured “What Does the Bible Say?” This new feature is designed to help us start conversations on Bible topics. The format is similar to that of our tracts. There is a viewpoint question followed by a Scriptural answer, as well as additional points for discussion.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4">Pleasant conversations on Scriptural topics often lead to Bible studies. Use this new feature to help many more to satisfy their spiritual hunger.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:6-40:5:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mt 5:6</a>.</p>

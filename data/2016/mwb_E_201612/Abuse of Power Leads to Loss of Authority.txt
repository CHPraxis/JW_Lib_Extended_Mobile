TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | ISAIAH 17-23
Abuse of Power Leads to Loss of Authority




Shebna was the steward “in charge of the house,” likely the house of King Hezekiah. His position was second only to the king, and much was expected of him.





22:15, 16
  Shebna should have cared for the needs of Jehovah’s people

  He selfishly pursued glory for himself


22:20-22
  Jehovah replaced Shebna with Eliakim

  Eliakim was given “the key of the house of David,” which symbolized power and authority


Consider: How could Shebna have used his authority to help others?

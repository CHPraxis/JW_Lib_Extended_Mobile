<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Isaiah’s willing spirit is worthy of imitation. He showed faith and immediately responded to a need, although not knowing all the details. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:6:8-23:6:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 6:8</a>) Can you adjust your circumstances in order to serve where there is a greater need for Kingdom proclaimers? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 110:3</a>) Of course, it is necessary to “calculate the expense” of such a move. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:14:27-42:14:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lu 14:27, 28</a>) Be willing, however, to make sacrifices for the sake of the preaching work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:8:20-40:8:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mt 8:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:10:28-41:10:30" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Mr 10:28-30</a>) As highlighted in the video <em>Moving to Serve Where the Need Is Greater</em><em>, </em>the blessings we receive in Jehovah’s service far surpass any sacrifices we make.</p>

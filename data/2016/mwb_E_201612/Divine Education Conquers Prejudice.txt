LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Divine Education Conquers Prejudice




Jehovah is not partial. (Ac 10:34, 35) He accepts people “out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues.” (Re 7:9) Thus, there is no place in the Christian congregation for prejudice or favoritism. (Jas 2:1-4) Thanks to divine education, we enjoy a spiritual paradise in which we have seen the transformation of human personalities. (Isa 11:6-9) As we work diligently to root out of our heart any traces of prejudice, we prove ourselves imitators of God.—Eph 5:1, 2.

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
“Here I Am! Send Me!”









Isaiah’s willing spirit is worthy of imitation. He showed faith and immediately responded to a need, although not knowing all the details. (Isa 6:8) Can you adjust your circumstances in order to serve where there is a greater need for Kingdom proclaimers? (Ps 110:3) Of course, it is necessary to “calculate the expense” of such a move. (Lu 14:27, 28) Be willing, however, to make sacrifices for the sake of the preaching work. (Mt 8:20; Mr 10:28-30) As highlighted in the video Moving to Serve Where the Need Is Greater, the blessings we receive in Jehovah’s service far surpass any sacrifices we make.

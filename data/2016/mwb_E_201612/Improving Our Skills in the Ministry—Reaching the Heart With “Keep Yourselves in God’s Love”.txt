Improving Our Skills in the Ministry—Reaching the Heart With “Keep Yourselves in God’s Love”




WHY IMPORTANT: People must learn Jehovah’s standards and conform to them in order to worship him acceptably. (Isa 2:3, 4) The “God’s Love” book, our second study publication, helps Bible students to discern how godly principles relate to daily life. (Heb 5:14) We must try to reach the heart when we teach them so that they may have the proper motivation to make changes.—Ro 6:17.





HOW TO DO IT:
  Prepare well, keeping the needs of your student in mind. Formulate viewpoint questions that will help you to draw out his thoughts and feelings about the material.—Pr 20:5; be 259

  Use the boxes throughout the book to help your student see the value of applying Bible principles

  Help your student to reason on matters of conscience, but do not make decisions for him.—Ga 6:5

  Tactfully determine if your student needs help to apply certain Bible principles. Kindly encourage him to make changes based on his love for Jehovah.—Pr 27:11; Joh 14:31





The “God’s Love” book should be studied to completion. Even after the student’s baptism, you may count the time, the return visits, and the study until the book is completed.

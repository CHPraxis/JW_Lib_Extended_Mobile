What Does the Bible Say?



Who or what is the Devil?

WOULD YOU SAY that the Devil is . . .
  A spirit person?

  A symbol of the evil inside a person?

  A product of human imagination?


WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS
The Devil conversed with and “tempted” Jesus. (Matthew 4:1-4) So the Devil is not imaginary, nor is he just a symbol of evil. He is a wicked spirit person.
WHAT ELSE CAN WE LEARN FROM THE BIBLE?
  The Devil was originally a holy angel, but “he did not stand fast in the truth.” (John 8:44) He became a liar and rebelled against God.

  Other angels joined Satan’s rebellion.—Revelation 12:9.

  The Devil blinds many people to his existence.—2 Corinthians 4:4.





Can the Devil control people?

SOME PEOPLE SAY that control by the Devil is a hoax, while others dread being possessed by evil spirits. What do you think?
WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS
“The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (1 John 5:19) The Devil exerts great influence over mankind, but he does not control every human.
WHAT ELSE CAN WE LEARN FROM THE BIBLE?
  The Devil uses deception to increase his influence.—2 Corinthians 11:14.

  Wicked spirits can in some cases take control of people.—Matthew 12:22.

  With God’s help, you can successfully “oppose the Devil.”—James 4:7.

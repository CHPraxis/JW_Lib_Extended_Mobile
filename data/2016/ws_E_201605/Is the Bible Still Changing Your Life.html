<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">FOR many years, Kevin gambled, smoked, drank too much, and took drugs.<span data-enid="1" class="en"><strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong><span class="tt en" data-rel-enid="1"></span></span> (See endnote.) Then he learned about Jehovah and wanted to be his friend. But to do so, he had to make big changes in his life. He was able to change by means of Jehovah’s help and the power of His Word, the Bible.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>After Kevin got baptized, he still had to make changes to his personality so that he could become a better Christian. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:31-49:4:32" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:31, 32</a>) For example, he used to get angry quickly. He was surprised when he found out how difficult it was to learn to control his temper. In fact, Kevin said that learning to control his temper was <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>actually harder than it was to stop the bad things he was doing before he got baptized! But he was able to make changes by begging Jehovah to help him and by a thorough study of the Bible.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Before we got baptized, many of us had to make big changes in our lives so that we could live in the way the Bible says we should. But even now, we realize that there are smaller changes we need to make to become more like God and Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:1-49:5:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 2:21</a>) For example, we might notice that we complain a lot or that we often gossip and say unkind things about others. Or at times we may be so afraid of what others might think or say that we do not do what is right. Perhaps we have been trying to change for many years but we still keep making the same mistakes. So we may wonder: ‘Why is it so difficult for me to make these smaller changes? What must I do to apply what the Bible says so that I can continue to improve my personality?’</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Why are we unable to please Jehovah in everything we do?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>We love Jehovah, and we desire with all our heart to please him. But sadly, we cannot please him all the time, because we are imperfect. We often feel like the apostle Paul, who said: “I have the <strong>desire </strong>to do what is fine but <strong>not the ability </strong>to carry it out.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:7:18-45:7:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 7:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> James 3:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What changes did we make before we got baptized, but what weaknesses may we still struggle with?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Before we could be part of the congregation, we had to stop practicing things that Jehovah hates. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>) But we are still imperfect. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:9-51:3:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Colossians 3:9, 10</a>) So we continue to make mistakes even if we have been baptized for many years. From time to time, we may have wrong desires and feelings, or we may find it hard to control a weakness in our personality. In fact, we may have to fight the same weakness for many years.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>(a) What makes it possible for us to be Jehovah’s friends even though we are imperfect? (b) Why should we not hold back from asking Jehovah for forgiveness?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Even though we are imperfect, we can still have a friendship with Jehovah and serve him. Always remember how you first became Jehovah’s friend. He was the One who saw the good in you and wanted you to know him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 6:44</a>) He also knew that you had faults and weaknesses and that you were going to make mistakes. But Jehovah still wanted you to be his friend.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Jehovah loved us so much that he gave us a precious gift. He sent his Son to earth so that Jesus could give his life as a ransom for our sins. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) When we make a mistake, we can ask Jehovah for forgiveness. And because of the ransom, we can be sure that he will forgive us and that we will still be his friends. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:7:24-45:7:25" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Romans 7:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:1-62:2:2" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 1 John 2:1, 2</a>) Remember, Jesus died <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>for repentant sinners. So even if we feel that what we have done is very bad, we must never stop praying to Jehovah for forgiveness. If we did not ask him to forgive us, it would be like refusing to wash our hands when they are dirty. How grateful we are that Jehovah has made it possible for us to be his friends even though we are imperfect!<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:1:15-54:1:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 1:15</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Of course, we cannot ignore our weaknesses or keep making excuses for them. Jehovah has told us what kind of people he wants his friends to be. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:15:1-19:15:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 15:1-5</a>) So if we want to draw closer to him, we must keep trying to imitate him and his Son. We must also try to control our wrong desires, and we may even be able to get rid of some of them. No matter how long we have been baptized, we must keep improving our personality.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:13:11-47:13:11" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>How do we know that we can keep putting on the new personality?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The apostle Paul told Christians: “You were taught to put away the old personality that conforms to your former course of conduct and that is being corrupted according to its deceptive desires. And you should <strong>continue </strong>to be made new in your dominant mental attitude, and should put on the new personality that was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:22-49:4:24" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:22-24</a>) This means that we need to keep on making the effort to change and “put on the new personality.” So no matter how long we have been serving Jehovah, we can always learn more about his qualities. And the Bible can help us to keep making changes in our personality to become more like him.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>When we think of the universe and all that is in it, we have no doubt that Jehovah has the power to do anything. For example, he made the sun, which is extremely powerful. Every second, the sun produces a huge amount of light and heat, yet only a small amount of this energy is needed for life on earth to exist. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:74:16-19:74:16" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 74:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Isaiah 40:26</a>) Jehovah also gives <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>power to his servants on earth when they need it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:40:29-23:40:29" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:29</a>) Clearly, if Jehovah wanted to, he could make it very easy for us to fight our weaknesses and to stop having wrong desires. So why does he not do so?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Jehovah has given us free will. He allows us to choose for ourselves whether we will obey him or not. When we choose to obey him and work hard to do his will, we show that we love him and want to please him. Satan says that Jehovah has no right to rule. But when we obey Jehovah, we show that we want him to be our Ruler. And we can be sure that our loving Father values every effort we make to obey him.

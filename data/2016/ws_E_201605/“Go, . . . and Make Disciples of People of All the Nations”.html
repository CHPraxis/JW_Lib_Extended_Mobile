<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>1, 2. </strong>What questions arise because of Jesus’ words found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">JESUS foretold that in the last days, the good news of the Kingdom would be preached to all people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we are known worldwide for our preaching work. Some people like the message we preach, while others do not. But even some of those who do not like our message respect us for our work. We claim that we are the ones doing the work that Jesus foretold. Do we have the right to say that? How can we be sure that our preaching is the work that Jesus foretold?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Many religious groups claim that they are preaching Jesus’ message. But their preaching is limited to sermons at church, on television, or on the Internet, or they may simply tell others how they learned about Jesus. Others feel that helping people in need or doing charity work as doctors, nurses, or teachers is their way of preaching. <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>But are these activities the preaching work that Jesus spoke about?</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>, what four things must Jesus’ followers do?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Did Jesus want his disciples to wait for people to come to them? No! After his resurrection, Jesus told hundreds of his followers: <strong>“Go, </strong>therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them . . . , teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>) So as Jesus’ followers, we need to do four things. We must make disciples, baptize them, and teach them. But first, we must <strong>go </strong>to the people. One Bible scholar explains: “To ‘go’ is the task of each believer, whether across the street or across the ocean.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:10:7-40:10:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 10:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:10:3-42:10:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Luke 10:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>What did Jesus expect from his disciples? Did he want them to preach on their own, or did he want them to be organized as a group? Since it would be impossible for one person to preach to “all the nations,” his disciples would need to be organized as a group. That is what Jesus meant when he invited his disciples to become “fishers of men.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:18-40:4:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 4:18-22</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jesus was not referring to one fisherman using his own line and bait, waiting for fish to bite. Instead, the fishing Jesus referred to involves the use of fishing nets. That kind of fishing requires hard work, organization, and many people working together.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:5:1-42:5:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 5:1-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What four questions need to be answered, and why?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>To know who are preaching the good news today, we need to answer these four questions:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">  What message should Jesus’ followers preach?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">  What should their motive be?</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The answers to these questions will help us to identify who are doing this lifesaving work and will strengthen our desire to continue preaching.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:4:16-54:4:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 4:43</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Jesus preached “the good news of the Kingdom,” and he wants his disciples to do the same. Which group of people are preaching that message to all? Only Jehovah’s Witnesses! Even some who dislike us admit that. For example, notice what one missionary priest who had lived in <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>many different countries told one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. In each country, the priest had asked Jehovah’s Witnesses what message they were preaching. The priest said, “They were all so stupid that they gave the same answer: ‘The good news of the Kingdom.’” The priest’s comment actually proves that we are not stupid but that we are united as true Christians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:1:10-46:1:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>) God’s Kingdom is also the main message of <em>The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom. </em>This magazine is available in 254 languages, and an average of nearly 59,000,000 copies of each issue are produced, which makes it the most widely circulated magazine in the world!</p>

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>How do we know that the clergy of Christendom are not preaching the right message?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>The clergy of Christendom are not preaching about God’s Kingdom. If they do talk about the Kingdom, many of them say that it is a feeling in a person’s heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:17:21-42:17:21" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 17:21</a>) They do not teach people that the Kingdom is a heavenly government ruled by Jesus. Instead, they usually talk about Jesus at Christmas or Easter. They do not explain that the Kingdom will solve all mankind’s problems and that it will soon remove all wickedness from the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:19:11-66:19:21" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 19:11-21</a>) Clearly, Christendom’s leaders do not know what Jesus will do as King of God’s Kingdom. And because they do not understand Jesus’ <strong>message, </strong>they do not understand <strong>why </strong>they should preach.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What is the wrong motive for doing the preaching work?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jesus’ disciples should not preach to make money or to build impressive buildings. Jesus said: “You received free, give free.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:10:8-40:10:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 10:8</a>) So the preaching work should not be a business. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:2:17-47:2:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>, footnote) Jesus’ disciples should not ask to be paid for their preaching work. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:20:33-44:20:35" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 20:33-35</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Even though Jesus’ instruction is very clear, most churches are distracted by collecting money in order to keep their churches and pay their clergy and other employees. As a result, many leaders of Christendom have become very rich.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:17:4-66:17:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Revelation 17:4, 5</a>.</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote"><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sc">The preaching work should not be a business</p>
</div>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>How have Jehovah’s Witnesses shown that they engage in the preaching work with the right motive?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Do Jehovah’s Witnesses take collections at their Kingdom Halls or conventions? No! Their work is supported by voluntary donations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>) Yet last year, Jehovah’s Witnesses spent almost two billion hours preaching the good news and conducted more than nine million Bible studies each month. They are not paid for <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>their preaching but are happy to use their own money to do this work. One researcher said about the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses: “The main goal is preaching and teaching.” He also said that Jehovah’s Witnesses do not have a paid clergy. So if we do not preach for money, what is our motive? We willingly do this work because we love Jehovah and we love people. That attitude fulfills the prophecy at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 110:3</strong></a><strong>. (Read.)</strong></p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>What methods did Jesus and his disciples use to preach? They went wherever they could find people. For example, they preached in the streets and at markets. They also looked for people in private homes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:10:11-40:10:11" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 10:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:8:1-42:8:1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Luke 8:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:5:42-44:5:42" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> Acts 5:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:20:20-44:20:20" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> 20:20</a>) Preaching from house to house was an organized way to reach all kinds of people.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>11, 12. </strong>When it comes to preaching the good news, how do the efforts of Christendom compare with those of Jehovah’s people?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Do churches of Christendom preach the good news as Jesus did? Usually, paid clergy give a sermon to their members. These leaders do not make new disciples but simply try to keep the church members they already have. At times, they have tried to encourage their members to preach. For example, in the year 2001, Pope John Paul II said in a letter that church <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>members should preach the Gospel and have the same zeal as the apostle Paul, who said: “Woe to me if I do not preach the Gospel.” The pope then said that this preaching work should be done not only by a few trained people but by all church members. However, few have followed that encouragement.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>What about Jehovah’s Witnesses? They are the only ones who preach that Jesus has been ruling as King since 1914. They obey Jesus and make the preaching work a priority in their life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:13:10-41:13:10" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Mark 13:10</a>) The book <em>Pillars of Faith<wbr />—American Congregations and Their Partners </em>said that for Jehovah’s Witnesses, the preaching work is very important. It also said that when they find people who are hungry, lonely, and sick, they try to help, but they never forget that their main goal is to preach about the end of this world and to teach people about salvation. Jehovah’s Witnesses continue to preach that message and to imitate the preaching methods of Jesus and his disciples.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Only Jehovah’s Witnesses have fulfilled Jesus’ prophecy that the good news would be preached worldwide.

Worldwide, there are about 400,000 Catholic priests, but there are more than 8 million of Jehovah’s Witnesses preaching the good news in 240 lands. Clearly, Jehovah’s Witnesses are preaching the good news worldwide, which brings honor and praise to Jehovah!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:34:1-19:34:1" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 34:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:51:15-19:51:15" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 51:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>As Jehovah’s Witnesses, our goal is to preach the good news to as many people as possible before the end comes. To do this work, we have translated and published millions of books, magazines, tracts, and convention and Memorial invitations in more than 700 languages. We offer these to people free of charge. Just last year, we published about 4.5 billion pieces of Bible literature. We have also published more than 200 million copies of the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</em> in over 130 languages.

Some groups have tried to preach the way we do, but they have failed. Others are willing to preach, but only for a limited time.

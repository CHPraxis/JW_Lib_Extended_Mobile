He felt free to open his heart to Jehovah, asking for help as he struggled with hard questions. For example, when he learned that God was going to destroy the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham was concerned that righteous people might be swept away along with the wicked. Perhaps Abraham was worried about his nephew Lot and his family, who were then living in Sodom. Abraham asked his questions with great humility and trust in God, “the Judge of all the earth.” Jehovah patiently taught Abraham how merciful He is, reading every heart and looking for righteous ones to preserve, even in times of judgment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:18:22-1:18:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 18:22-33</a>) No doubt, every bit of knowledge and experience helped Abraham maintain his close friendship with Jehovah. <a class="xt" data-xtid="279" href="jwpub://p/E:2016122/20-21"><em>w16.02 </em>1:11, 12</a></p>

However, we would miss a vital lesson if we were to admire Jonathan’s loyalty to David without taking into account his loyalty to God. Why did Jonathan view David as a friend rather than a rival? Loyalty to God had first place in Jonathan’s heart. Indeed, loyalty to Jehovah was the very basis for his loyalty to David. And both men loyally lived up to their sworn oath. As Christians, we do not merely admire loyalty in others; we ourselves are loyal to family members, friends, and fellow worshippers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:2:10-52:2:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:10, 11</a>) But what loyalty should take first place in our heart? Why, it is loyalty to the One who gave us life!

Thick smoke poured out, and from this came a plague of locusts. Rather than ravage vegetation, the symbolic locusts swarm against “those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:9:1-66:9:4" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rev. 9:1-4</a>) John no doubt knew how devastating a locust swarm could be.

Jesus explains: “In fact, unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved; but <em>on account of the chosen ones those days will be cut short.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:22-40:24:22" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Matt. 24:22</a>) In 66 C.E., the tribulation was “cut short.” This allowed “the chosen ones,” anointed Christians, to flee the city and its environs. Likewise, the initial part of the future great tribulation will be “cut short” because of “the chosen ones.” The political “ten horns” will not be allowed to annihilate God’s people.

God is not bringing us into temptation. On the contrary, he has confidence in us and he wants to help us. Out of respect for our free will, though, Jehovah does not automatically prevent us from falling into temptation.

Key ways are by regularly and prayerfully studying the Bible, meditating on what we read, and then putting into practice what we have learned. Obviously, this involves more than accumulating facts and learning rules. Our study of the Bible should gradually give us an ever more precise picture of Jehovah, his personality, his qualities, and what he likes or dislikes. Our conscience becomes attuned to the ways of Jehovah God. This should stir our heart, moving us to want to become more and more like him. However, if we cannot understand the conscientious decision of a fellow believer on some personal matter, we should not quickly judge him or feel that we ought to pressure him to change his mind. Perhaps his conscience is still “weak” and in need of more training or is too sensitive on certain issues.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:8:11-46:8:12" data-bid="62-1" class="b">1 Cor. 8:11, 12</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="263" href="jwpub://p/E:2015682/11-11"><em>w15 </em>9/15 2:4,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="264" href="jwpub://p/E:2015682/16-16"> 8,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="265" href="jwpub://p/E:2015682/18-18"> 10</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:13:1-46:13:1" data-bid="87-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:1</a>) Jehovah has intimate knowledge of billions of intelligent creatures, earthly and heavenly. At any given moment, countless individuals may be praying to him in many languages. Not only does he listen to those prayers but he simultaneously gives direction to and communicates with heavenly beings. To accomplish this, his thoughts, language, and communication must be vastly superior to those of humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:55:8-23:55:9" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Isa. 55:8, 9</a>) Clearly, when Jehovah communicates with humans, he simplifies how he expresses his thoughts so that man can understand them. <a class="xt" data-xtid="273" href="jwpub://p/E:2015921/8-9"><em>w15 </em>12/15 1:1, 2</a></p>

A report from Rwanda stated: “For a long time, many people with whom the brothers were studying had not progressed because they had no Bibles. They could not afford to purchase the local church edition. And they often could not clearly understand the meaning of certain verses, which hindered their progress.” Things changed when the <em>New World Translation </em>in their language became available. A Rwandan family with four teenagers said: “We really thank Jehovah and the faithful and discreet slave for giving us this Bible. We are very poor and had no money to purchase Bibles for every member of the family. But now each of us has his own Bible. To show our gratitude to Jehovah, we read the Bible as a family every day.” <a class="xt" data-xtid="274" href="jwpub://p/E:2015922/25-26"><em>w15 </em>12/15 2:15, 16</a></p>

Despite having received God’s forgiveness, David did not forget his own sin with Bath-sheba and its consequences. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:12:7-10:12:14" data-bid="91-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:7-14</a>) Still, the king was sure that God would sustain him on his sickbed. David did not pray for God to heal him miraculously. The context suggests that David asked Jehovah to help him in the same way that He would help an individual who showed consideration to a lowly one. That included being sustained “on his sickbed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:41:3-19:41:3" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Ps. 41:3</a>) Because David’s sin had been forgiven, he could ask that God would comfort and support him and that the physical resources of his body might enable him to recover.

They do not need someone else to verify what has happened to them. Jehovah leaves no doubt whatsoever in their minds and hearts. The apostle John tells such anointed Christians: “You have an anointing from the holy one, and all of you have knowledge.” He further states: “As for you, the anointing that you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to be teaching you; but the anointing from him is teaching you about all things and is true and is no lie. Just as it has taught you, remain in union with him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:20-62:2:20" data-bid="95-1" class="b">1 John 2:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:27-62:2:27" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> 27</a>) These ones need spiritual instruction just like everyone else. But they do not need anyone to validate their anointing. The most powerful force in the universe has given them this conviction! <a class="xt" data-xtid="277" href="jwpub://p/E:2016045/17-18"><em>w16.01 </em>3:9, 10</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:6-54:6:8" data-bid="97-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:6-8</a>) It helps us to realize that our relationship with Jehovah and our Christian brothers is far more important than anything that money can buy. A contented person does not complain, grumble, or find fault; nor does he succumb to feelings of envy and greed<wbr />—feelings that can stifle the development of brotherly love. Rather, contentment promotes a generous spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:17-54:6:19" data-bid="98-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:17-19</a>) Also, our trust in Jehovah gives us courage, no matter what challenges we may face.

<p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="sb">In recent years, we have seen an increase in the number of those partaking at the Memorial of Christ’s death. That trend contrasts with the decrease in the number of partakers that we saw for many decades. Should this increase trouble us? No. Let us consider some key factors to keep in mind. Those taking the count at the Memorial cannot judge who truly have the heavenly hope. The number of partakers includes those who mistakenly think that they are anointed. Some who at one point started to partake of the emblems later stopped. Others may have mental or emotional problems that lead them to believe that they will rule with Christ in heaven. Therefore, the number of partakers does not accurately indicate the number of anointed ones left on earth. And the Bible does not state how many will be left at the time that the great tribulation begins. <a class="xt" data-xtid="278" href="jwpub://p/E:2016046/23-25"><em>w16.01 </em>4:12-14</a></p>

There are thousands of Bible translations, but they vary in how faithfully they convey the message from the original texts. In the 1940’s, the New World Bible Translation Committee established principles of translation that have been followed in over 130 languages. These are: (1) Sanctify God’s name by restoring it to its rightful place in the Scriptures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9</a>) (2) Translate the original inspired message <em>literally </em>where possible, but convey the correct <em>sense </em>when a word-for-word rendering would distort the meaning.

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">From the cradle to the grave, our greatest need is love. Humans do need and crave love<wbr />—and not just the romantic kind. We hunger for friendship and connection with others. But there is one kind of love that we need more than any other<wbr />—Jehovah’s love. Many find it hard to imagine that humans could acquire a close, loving friendship with Almighty God. Do we share such skepticism? Far from it! The Bible shows that imperfect humans have become friends with God. Their examples are worth contemplating, for building such a friendship is the most worthwhile goal we could pursue in life. An outstanding example of a man who cultivated such a friendship was Abraham. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:2:23-59:2:23" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Jas. 2:23</a>) How did Abraham draw so close to Jehovah? A key ingredient in that friendship was faith. In fact, the Bible calls Abraham “the father of all those having faith.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:4:11-45:4:11" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Rom. 4:11</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="100" href="jwpub://p/E:2016122/8-9"><em>w16.02 </em>1:1, 2</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:18:6-12:18:6" data-bid="90-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:6</a>) Hezekiah set about righting the terrible wrongs that his father had committed. He did so by cleansing the temple, atoning for the people’s sins, and destroying pagan idols in a vigorous and far-reaching campaign. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:29:1-14:29:11" data-bid="91-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:1-11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:29:18-14:29:24" data-bid="91-2" class="b"> 18-24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:31:1-14:31:1" data-bid="91-3" class="b"> 31:1</a>) When he faced daunting challenges, such as the threat of attack on Jerusalem by the Assyrian king Sennacherib, Hezekiah showed profound courage and faith. He relied on God for salvation and strengthened his people by word and example. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:32:7-14:32:8" data-bid="92-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:7, 8</a>) Later, when Hezekiah needed correction for showing a haughty attitude, he humbled himself and repented. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:32:24-14:32:26" data-bid="93-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:24-26</a>) Clearly, Hezekiah did not let his past ruin his present or deprive him of a future. Rather, he showed that he was Jehovah’s friend and a fine example to imitate. <a class="xt" data-xtid="101" href="jwpub://p/E:2016123/20-20"><em>w16.02 </em>2:11</a></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">Kindness can help you to deal with a conflict of loyalties. For example, you may have definite knowledge that a certain fellow believer is guilty of serious misconduct. You may feel loyal to him, especially if he is a close friend or a relative. But if you were to cover up the wrongdoing, you would be disloyal to God. Of course, your loyalty to Jehovah should come first. Be kind yet firm. Urge your friend or relative to seek the help of the elders. If he or she does not do so within a reasonable period of time, loyalty to God should move you to report the matter to the elders. In doing this, you are being loyal to Jehovah and kind to your friend or relative, for Christian elders will try to readjust such an individual with mildness.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:5:1-3:5:1" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Lev. 5:1</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="102" href="jwpub://p/E:2016127/24-24"><em>w16.02 </em>4:14</a></p>

Also included are spiritual activities that others do not see, such as your private prayers and your personal study. A person who has dedicated his life to Jehovah will not consider these deeds to be chores. Rather, he will reflect the attitude of King David, who said: “To do your will, O my God, is my delight, and your law is deep within me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:40:8-19:40:8" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Ps. 40:8</a>) Remember, as a dedicated and baptized Christian, you will stand before Jehovah on your own. Your service to him should not depend on others<wbr />—not even your parents. Your holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion give evidence that you have made the truth your own and that you are progressing toward baptism. <a class="xt" data-xtid="103" href="jwpub://p/E:2016202/19-19"><em>w16.03 </em>2:10,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="104" href="jwpub://p/E:2016202/21-21"> 12,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="105" href="jwpub://p/E:2016202/24-24"> 15</a></p>

The Law pointed to an important development as to Jehovah’s will. That was the coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ. The Law made it clear as never before that the Israelites were imperfect. It also impressed on them the need for a ransom, a perfect sacrifice that would fully cover sin.

Yes, the Law acted as a temporary tutor, or “guardian,” leading to Christ. <a class="xt" data-xtid="106" href="jwpub://p/E:2016206/15-16"><em>w16.03 </em>4:6, 7</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:1-20:15:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 15:1</a>) For example, the teenage son of a single mother was leading a double life. A well-meaning Christian sister said to the mother: “It’s too bad you have failed at child training.” The mother thought for a moment and responded: “It’s true that things are not going well right now, but his training is a work in progress. Talk to me after Armageddon; then we will know for sure.” This mild response helped to maintain peace between the sisters, and it encouraged the son, who overheard the conversation. He realized that his mother had not given up on him. This moved him to stop his bad associations. In time, he got baptized, and he later served at Bethel. Whether in the company of our brothers, our family, or strangers, we should always let our words “be gracious, seasoned with salt.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:4:6-51:4:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Col. 4:6</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="201" href="jwpub://p/E:2015924/25-25"><em>w15 </em>12/15 3:15,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="202" href="jwpub://p/E:2015924/27-27"> 17</a></p>

But flirting, or responding to it, may arouse unclean thoughts that can lead to serious sexual wrongdoing. It has happened before<wbr />—it can happen again. Joseph acted wisely in this regard. When the wife of his master, Potiphar, tried to seduce him, Joseph rejected her efforts. But she did not give up. Day after day she invited him to remain with her.

To them, God is to be feared and obeyed. Or perhaps because of certain entrenched erroneous teachings, they feel that God is unloving, even unlovable. On the other hand, there are those who believe that God’s love is unconditional and that he loves them regardless of what they do or fail to do.

But if you regularly feed the fire with more wood, it can be kept going indefinitely. So, too, our faith can be kept alive if we regularly feed on God’s Word.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:6:25-43:6:27" data-bid="88-1" class="b">John 6:25-27</a>) Although you cannot read hearts, you too can show insight and learn how your child feels about the field ministry. Many parents include short breaks during field service to allow their children to rest and enjoy some refreshments. Yet, you might look beyond the obvious and ask yourself, ‘Does my child enjoy the <em>ministry </em>or only the <em>breaks?’ </em>If you discern that the ministry could be more interesting or more rewarding for your children, set goals with them. Use creativity to help them to have a full share as your preaching companions. <a class="xt" data-xtid="199" href="jwpub://p/E:2015845/20-21"><em>w15 </em>11/15 1:10, 11</a></p>

The Bible tells us: “He will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.” What a marvelous future awaits all of us who truly appreciate Jehovah’s love and obey him as our Ruler! Jehovah’s Word tells us: “Take note of the blameless one, and keep the upright one in sight, for the future of that man will be peaceful. But all the transgressors will be destroyed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:37-19:37:38" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Ps. 37:37, 38</a>) “The blameless one” comes to know Jehovah and his Son and obediently does God’s will.

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">God’s people have used a variety of methods in order to reach as many as possible with the good news. This was especially important when ‘the workers were few.’ In the early 20th century, newspapers were used to reach large audiences in areas where Jehovah’s people were few in number. Each week, Charles Taze Russell would telegraph a sermon to a newspaper syndicate. In turn, the syndicate retelegraphed the sermon to newspapers in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It is estimated that by 1913, Brother Russell’s sermons were reaching 15,000,000 readers by means of 2,000 newspapers! After Brother Russell died, another effective method of spreading the good news began to be used. On April 16, 1922, Joseph F. Rutherford made one of his first radio broadcasts, speaking to an estimated 50,000 people. Then, on February 24, 1924, the organization’s first radio station, WBBR, began broadcasting. <a class="xt" data-xtid="198" href="jwpub://p/E:2015843/19-20"><em>w15 </em>11/15 5:10, 11</a></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">Jehovah also causes his creation to become whatever he chooses. In line with the meaning of his name, God caused Noah to be an ark builder, Bezalel to be a master craftsman, Gideon to be a victorious warrior, and Paul to be an apostle to the nations. Yes, God’s name has great meaning to his people. And the New World Bible Translation Committee would never undermine the name’s significance by omitting it from the Bible. Over 130 language editions of the <em>New World Translation </em>honor God’s name by including it where it belongs in the sacred text. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:3:16-39:3:16" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Mal. 3:16</a>) In contrast, the current trend in Bible translation is to omit the divine name, substituting a title such as “Lord” or the name of a local god. This is a prime reason why the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses has given priority to making available to as many people as possible a Bible that honors God’s name. <a class="xt" data-xtid="200" href="jwpub://p/E:2015922/15-17"><em>w15 </em>12/15 2:7-9</a></p>

<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="sb">There is no doubt that God has the power to affect someone’s health. The Bible confirms that. At times, he punished individuals with sickness, such as the Pharaoh in Abraham’s day and later Moses’ sister, Miriam. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:12:17-1:12:17" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Gen. 12:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:12:9-4:12:10" data-bid="98-2" class="b"> Num. 12:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:24:15-10:24:15" data-bid="98-3" class="b"> 2 Sam. 24:15</a>) God warned that if the Israelites proved unfaithful, he would afflict them with “every sickness or plague.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:28:58-5:28:61" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Deut. 28:58-61</a>) On the other hand, Jehovah could remove diseases or prevent sickness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:23:25-2:23:25" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Ex. 23:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:7:15-5:7:15" data-bid="100-2" class="b"> Deut. 7:15</a>) Also, he could heal people. After Job had been so sick that he longed to die, God healed him! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:2:7-18:2:7" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Job 2:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:3:11-18:3:13" data-bid="101-2" class="b"> 3:11-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:42:10-18:42:10" data-bid="101-3" class="b"> 42:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:42:16-18:42:16" data-bid="101-4" class="b"> 16</a>) Yes, God definitely has the power to intervene and heal a sick person. It is similar with his Son. We read that Jesus miraculously cured lepers, epileptics, and blind or paralyzed ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:23-40:4:24" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Matt. 4:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:9:1-43:9:7" data-bid="102-2" class="b"> John 9:1-7</a>) How strengthening it is to think that the healings Jesus performed are a foregleam of what he will do on a grand scale in the new world. <a class="xt" data-xtid="203" href="jwpub://p/E:2015925/10-11"><em>w15 </em>12/15 4:3, 4</a></p>

God’s Word teems with accounts of faithful men and women who feared Jehovah, put faith in him, and became his close friends.

And I will be the one who drives the car, not you.” How would you feel? Now think about what Jehovah rightfully expects of a person who makes a dedication to him, a person who tells him: “I am giving you my life. I <em>belong </em>to you.” What if that person were to start living a double life, perhaps secretly dating an unbeliever? What if he were to accept employment that crippled his whole-souled service in the ministry or attendance at Christian meetings? Would that not be like keeping the keys to the car? A person who dedicates himself to Jehovah is, in effect, saying: “My life belongs to <em>you </em>more than to me. If there is ever a conflict between what you want and what I am inclined to want, what you want will win<wbr />—every time.” That would reflect the thinking of Jesus, as stated in today’s text. <a class="xt" data-xtid="421" href="jwpub://p/E:2016201/27-28"><em>w16.03 </em>1:16, 17</a></p>

If you are a young brother, how can you imitate Elisha today? Promptly accept assignments, including humble tasks. View your teacher as a friend, and let him know how much you appreciate the effort he makes in your behalf. Above all, be faithful in carrying out any assignment you are given. Why is this so important? Because only after you demonstrate that you are faithful and reliable will the elders feel assured that Jehovah wants you to be entrusted with added responsibilities in the congregation.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:101:6-19:101:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 101:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:2:2-55:2:2" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 2:2</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="391" href="jwpub://p/E:2015282/23-24"><em>w15 </em>4/15 2:13, 14</a></p>

And by preaching the good news, we appeal to the conscience of those to whom we speak. Yes, the conscience can be an invaluable tool. By regularly immersing ourselves in God’s Word, meditating on what we find, and striving to put it into practice, we train our conscience.

Perhaps the claim is that it was discovered or used in a distant or remote place, as if hidden from modern research. Does such a claim prove anything or even seem reasonable? Some diagnostic devices or forms of treatment are described as using a ‘secret substance’ or ‘body force.’ That warrants serious caution because God warned against “the use of magical power” and spirit mediums.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:1:13-23:1:13" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Isa. 1:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:18:10-5:18:12" data-bid="91-2" class="b"> Deut. 18:10-12</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="413" href="jwpub://p/E:2015925/26-26"><em>w15 </em>12/15 4:16</a></p>

John the Baptist was one such person. Jesus highly praised him but stated that John would not be included in the heavenly Kingdom. David was likewise moved by holy spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:16:13-9:16:13" data-bid="93-1" class="b">1 Sam. 16:13</a>) He was a man of great spiritual depth and was even inspired to write sections of the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:12:36-41:12:36" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Mark 12:36</a>) Still, at Pentecost, Peter said of David that he “did not ascend to the heavens.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:34-44:2:34" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Acts 2:34</a>) Holy spirit worked mightily in such ones, but it did not give them the special witness that they had been selected for heavenly life. That did not mean that they were in some way unworthy or deficient. It simply meant that Jehovah would resurrect them to life on a paradise earth.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="96-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="96-2" class="b"> Acts 24:15</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="414" href="jwpub://p/E:2016045/26-26"><em>w16.01 </em>3:16</a></p>

We learn not only what they want to accomplish but also how they go about doing it. Jesus worked along with Jehovah for perhaps billions of years, and they forged a strong, unbreakable bond of love and affection for each other. They enjoyed a wonderful unity, always working together in full harmony. In prayer, Jesus asked Jehovah to watch over his disciples. The reason? He prayed: “So that they may be one just as we are one.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:11-43:17:11" data-bid="98-1" class="b">John 17:11</a>) As we conform to God’s standards and share in the work of preaching, we come to understand his appealing qualities.

Moab was her homeland. Its culture was her culture, its language her language, its people her people. Naomi could promise her no such advantages in Bethlehem. In fact, she advised Ruth to stay in Moab. Naomi feared that she could provide neither a husband nor a home for her daughters-in-law. What would Ruth do?

He has journeyed to the Judean wilderness in order to find David and kill him. Abishai whispers: “Let me pin [Saul] to the ground with the spear just once, and I will not need to do it twice.” David’s reply is astonishing! “Do not harm him, for who can lift his hand against the anointed of Jehovah and remain innocent? . . . It is unthinkable from Jehovah’s standpoint for me to lift my hand against the anointed of Jehovah!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:26:8-9:26:12" data-bid="104-1" class="b">1 Sam. 26:8-12</a>) David understood what loyalty to God involves.

It symbolizes your dedication<wbr />—a solemn promise you make to Jehovah that you will serve him forever by putting his will above everything else in your life. Understandably, you should get baptized only when you are qualified to make that decision, you have a personal desire to do so, and you understand the meaning of dedication. What if you are not sure that you are ready for baptism? Or what if you want to get baptized but your parents feel that you should wait, perhaps until you gain more experience in Christian living? In either case, do not be discouraged. Instead, use this opportunity to make progress so that, before long, you <em>can </em>get baptized. <a class="xt" data-xtid="422" href="jwpub://p/E:2016202/8-9"><em>w16.03 </em>2:1, 2</a></p>

Still, applying Bible principles can contribute to harmony in the family. That involves cooperating to the greatest extent possible without compromising. This may be challenging, but think of the possible reward. Also, in view of Satan’s attack on the family today, it is vital for all of God’s servants to maintain good cooperation in their marriage. No matter how long you have been married, give thought to what you personally can say or do to strengthen your marriage. Older ones can even assist younger members of the congregation in this regard. You might on occasion invite a younger couple to your home to share in family worship with you and your mate. While the younger ones are with you, they can observe that affection and harmony are important no matter how long one has been married.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:2:3-56:2:7" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Titus 2:3-7</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="424" href="jwpub://p/E:2016205/24-25"><em>w16.03 </em>3:14, 15</a></p>

The titles given to Satan reveal the depth of his corruption. Satan means “Resister,” indicating that this wicked spirit creature does not support God’s sovereignty; rather, he hates it and aggressively fights it.

Though the circumstances of these brothers vary greatly, the advice they gave was strikingly similar. What does this indicate? That Bible-based training is applicable to learners <em>“everywhere </em>in <em>every </em>congregation”<wbr />—just as it was in the apostle Paul’s day. A teacher needs to create the right conditions for training. Just as a gardener needs to cultivate, or loosen, the soil before sowing seeds, so a teacher needs to prepare, or encourage, the heart of a learner before teaching him new skills. So how do teachers create the right conditions for training others? By following an approach similar to that taken by Samuel when he was preparing Saul to lead Israel.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:9:15-9:9:27" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Sam. 9:15-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:10:1-9:10:1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 10:1</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="107" href="jwpub://p/E:2015281/20-21"><em>w15 </em>4/15 1:11, 12</a></p>

Jehovah’s earthly servants have always benefited from thinking about the fulfillment of divine promises. Abel knew enough about God’s purposes to envision a better future, exercise faith, and embrace a reliable hope. Abraham’s outstanding acts of faith were possible because he “saw” something about the fulfillment of God’s prophecy concerning the promised “offspring.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>) Moses “looked intently toward the payment of the reward,” acting in faith and growing in love for Jehovah.

The waves are pounding the ship, hurling spray and foam into the boat. Yet, despite the noise of the storm and the violent pitching of the boat, Jesus continues to sleep. His body needs rest.

Such needs may include suitable accommodations, employment to provide for our family, and wisdom to cope with health concerns. If we were to pray only for such physical needs, however, it would indicate an imbalance. We have spiritual needs that are of much greater importance. “Man must live,” said our Master, “not on bread alone, but on every word that comes from Jehovah’s mouth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Matt. 4:4</a>) So we should continue to pray that Jehovah will keep on feeding us with timely spiritual food. <a class="xt" data-xtid="118" href="jwpub://p/E:2015447/10-10"><em>w15 </em>6/15 5:4,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="119" href="jwpub://p/E:2015447/14-15"> 7, 8</a></p>

Our upbringing or our past conduct may have developed in us a liking for practices that Jehovah condemns. Even then, he can help us to bring about necessary changes so that we can continue to serve him acceptably. King David recognized this. After he had committed adultery with Bath-sheba, David implored Jehovah: “Create in me a pure heart, . . . and put within me a new spirit, a steadfast one.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:51:10-19:51:10" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Ps. 51:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:51:12-19:51:12" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> 12</a>) Sinful conduct may strongly appeal to our fallen flesh, but Jehovah can stir within us a willing spirit, the desire to obey him.

Although all these devoted brothers were supported by faithful assistants, one person was basically responsible for making decisions in the congregations, at the branch offices, and at world headquarters. During the 1970’s, adjustments were made to put the responsibility for oversight on groups of elders rather than on individuals. These adjustments were based on increased knowledge about the pattern set in the Scriptures. Instead of having the influence of one individual dominate, the composite good qualities of <em>all </em>the “gifts in men” whom Jehovah has provided benefit the organization.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:8-49:4:8" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Eph. 4:8</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="120" href="jwpub://p/E:2015522/23-24"><em>w15 </em>7/15 1:14, 15</a></p>

<p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="sb">Have you ever thought, ‘Am I the kind of person Jehovah will want to save during the great tribulation and bring into the new world?’ One very important requirement is that we cultivate strong faith. The apostle Peter drew special attention to the importance of faith when he spoke of its “tested quality” that “may be found a cause for praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:7-60:1:7" data-bid="84-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:7</a>) Since the great tribulation is fast approaching, do we not want to make sure that we have the type of faith that puts us among those whose faith will be praised by our glorious King when he is revealed? Most certainly, we want to be “the sort who have faith for the preserving of our lives.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:39-58:10:39" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Heb. 10:39</a>) With this goal in mind, we may plead like the man who said: “Help me out where I need faith!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:9:24-41:9:24" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Mark 9:24</a>) Or we may be moved to say, as did Jesus’ apostles: “Give us more faith.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:17:5-42:17:5" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Luke 17:5</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="131" href="jwpub://p/E:2015762/8-9"><em>w15 </em>10/15 2:1, 2</a></p>

<p id="p90" data-pid="90" class="sb">Paul focused on “the more important things” and slaved in God’s service, traveling back and forth between Syria, Asia Minor, Macedonia, and Judea. “Forgetting the things behind and stretching forward to the things ahead, I am pressing on toward the goal for the prize,” wrote Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:1:10-50:1:10" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Phil. 1:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:3:8-50:3:8" data-bid="89-2" class="b"> 3:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:3:13-50:3:14" data-bid="89-3" class="b"> 13, 14</a>) Taking full advantage of his singleness, Paul succeeded in being in “constant devotion to the Lord without distraction.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:7:32-46:7:35" data-bid="90-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:32-35</a>) Like Paul, some servants of God choose to remain single so that they have fewer family responsibilities and can devote themselves to Kingdom service. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:19:11-40:19:12" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Matt. 19:11, 12</a>) Married servants of God often have more extensive family responsibilities. But whether single or married, all can “throw off every weight” and serve God with as few distractions as possible. This may require cutting down on time-wasting habits and setting goals to increase the time spent in the service of God. <a class="xt" data-xtid="132" href="jwpub://p/E:2015766/26-27"><em>w15 </em>10/15 3:15, 16</a></p>

<p id="p93" data-pid="93" class="sb">History has demonstrated beyond any doubt the truthfulness of what the Bible says: “I well know, O Jehovah, that man’s way does not belong to him. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Jer. 10:23</a>) No, Jehovah did not create humans with the ability or the right to direct their affairs independent of him. In addition to showing how futile human rule is, God’s temporary permission of wickedness serves another long-range purpose. It provides permanent testimony that only God’s rule can be successful. After Jehovah destroys wickedness and those who cause it, if anyone ever again would challenge Jehovah’s way of ruling in love, there would be no need for God to permit the challenge to stand. He could use what has happened in mankind’s history as the just reason to remove such rebels quickly, not allowing them to establish wickedness once again. <a class="xt" data-xtid="133" href="jwpub://p/E:2015841/13-14"><em>w15 </em>11/15 3:5, 6</a></p>

<p id="p96" data-pid="96" class="sb">Jesus loved to talk about God’s Kingdom. According to the Bible record, he spoke more about the Kingdom than about any other subject<wbr />—referring to it more than 100 times during his ministry. The Kingdom was truly dear to his heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:12:34-40:12:34" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Matt. 12:34</a>) Shortly after his resurrection, Jesus met with more than 500 prospective Kingdom proclaimers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:6-46:15:6" data-bid="96-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:6</a>) Perhaps it was on that occasion that he gave the command to take the Kingdom message to “people of all the nations”<wbr />—a daunting task back then! This great work, Jesus foretold, would be carried on right up to “the conclusion of the system of things,” and that has proved to be the case. Quite likely you are having a share in the fulfillment of that commission and prophecy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) And our God has equipped us with “every good thing” to help us fulfill that commission. <a class="xt" data-xtid="135" href="jwpub://p/E:2015843/8-10"><em>w15 </em>11/15 5:1-3</a></p>

<p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="sb">Those who study ancient Hebrew Bible manuscripts, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, are struck by the many occurrences of the Tetragrammaton<wbr />—the four Hebrew letters that represent God’s name. The divine name appears not only in those ancient Hebrew manuscripts but also in some copies of the Greek <em>Septuagint </em>from the second century B.C.E. through the first century C.E. Despite the clear evidence that the personal name of God belongs in the Bible, many translations completely omit the sacred name of God. In 1952, the <em>Revised Standard Version </em>was published. That version omitted the name, reversing the policy of the editors of the <em>American Standard Version </em>of 1901. Why? The preface says: “The use of any proper name for the one and only God . . . is entirely inappropriate for the universal faith of the Christian Church.” That set a pattern for many subsequent translations, English and non-English. <a class="xt" data-xtid="137" href="jwpub://p/E:2015922/11-13"><em>w15 </em>12/15 2:3-5</a></p>

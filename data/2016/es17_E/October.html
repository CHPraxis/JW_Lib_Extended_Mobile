(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Josh. 1:8</a>) So ask yourself: ‘How specific are my prayers?

Having such conversations with the learner as part of his training will help him to focus more on people than on rules. He will experience the joy that comes from seeing how brothers and sisters in the congregation benefit from the service he renders.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:13:15-41:13:18" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Mark 13:15-18</a>) To remain faithful, will we be willing to experience material loss? Will we be ready to do whatever is required of us to prove our loyalty to Jehovah? Just think! At that time, we will be the only ones following the example of the ancient prophet Daniel by continuing to worship our God no matter what.

Later, wicked King Ahab had every opportunity to see God’s hand in events. Ahab saw fire come down from heaven when Elijah prayed for his offering to be consumed.

It is noteworthy that when writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures quoted from the Hebrew Scriptures, they usually did so from the <em>Septuagint. </em>These quotations, which at times vary somewhat from the exact Hebrew wording, are now part of the inspired Scriptures.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:4:4-19:4:4" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Ps. 4:4</a>) On the other hand, the Bible also says that there is “a time to speak.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:3:7-21:3:7" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:7</a>) If a friend gave you a beautiful present, you would probably not store it out of sight. Rather, you would show your appreciation by putting it to good use. We show our gratitude for Jehovah’s gift of speech by using it wisely. That might include expressing our feelings, communicating our needs, sharing words of encouragement, and giving God praise. <a class="xt" data-xtid="342" href="jwpub://p/E:2015924/12-13"><em>w15 </em>12/15 3:4, 5</a></p>

Granted, someone might simply offer general, practical suggestions. Paul did so when Timothy was experiencing stomach problems, perhaps because the local water was polluted. That, however, is quite different from trying to persuade a fellow Witness to use some herb, remedy, or diet that may not be effective or in some cases may even be harmful. At times, some have tried to persuade others with an explanation: ‘My relative had a similar disease, and he took . . . Then he got well.’ No matter how sincere the suggestion, we do well to keep in mind that there may be risks even with widely used medications and treatments.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:27:12-20:27:12" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Prov. 27:12</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="343" href="jwpub://p/E:2015925/22-22"><em>w15 </em>12/15 4:13</a></p>

They longed for the time when Jehovah would cleanse this earth, and they wanted to be part of that blessed future. Perhaps they even pictured themselves welcoming back their loved ones from the grave. They looked forward to living in the homes that they built and eating the fruitage of trees that they planted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:65:21-23:65:23" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Isa. 65:21-23</a>) Why did their thinking change? They did not become dissatisfied with that hope. They did not change their mind because of emotional stress or turmoil. They did not give up on this earth, as if they suddenly felt that they would find living forever on earth to be tiresome or boring; nor did they merely want to explore some new frontier in heaven. Rather, they changed because of the operation of God’s spirit that not only called, or invited, them but also changed their thinking and hope. <a class="xt" data-xtid="345" href="jwpub://p/E:2016045/20-20"><em>w16.01 </em>3:11,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="346" href="jwpub://p/E:2016045/22-22"> 13</a></p>

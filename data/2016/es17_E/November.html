How touched he will be to learn that his example of faith helped Jehovah’s servants throughout thousands of years after his death! In Paradise he will even learn that the way Isaac was restored to him was “illustrative” of something far greater.

For example, some young people say that they have made a dedication to Jehovah but are not ready to get baptized. Does that make sense? Making a dedication means telling Jehovah that you will serve him forever. At baptism, a person shows others that he is dedicated. Therefore, baptism is a public expression of a private dedication that you have already made in prayer to Jehovah. Before you get baptized, you need to be sure that you understand what dedication means. Simply stated, when you dedicate your life to Jehovah, you give up ownership of yourself. You promise Jehovah that you will put the doing of his will ahead of everything else in your life. Any promise should be taken seriously, but how much more so a promise made to Jehovah God!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:33-40:5:33" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 5:33</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="389" href="jwpub://p/E:2016201/25-26"><em>w16.03 </em>1:14, 15</a></p>

Furthermore, cooperating in matters like these will likely help all of us to grow in love. <a class="xt" data-xtid="390" href="jwpub://p/E:2016205/17-18"><em>w16.03 </em>3:8, 9</a></p>

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">Our words may be just what our hearer truly needs, but unless we discern the best time to speak, their meaning could be lost. For example, in March 2011 an earthquake and tsunami devastated parts of eastern Japan, wiping out entire cities. More than 15,000 lost their lives. Although Jehovah’s Witnesses in the area suffered along with their neighbors, they took advantage of every opportunity to use the Bible to comfort those who were mourning. However, many of the local people have deep-rooted Buddhist beliefs and little or no knowledge of Bible teachings. Our brothers discerned that immediately following the tsunami was not necessarily the best time to tell the grief-stricken victims about the resurrection hope. Instead, they used their gift of speech to focus on giving emotional support and explaining from the Bible why such terrible things happen to innocent people. <a class="xt" data-xtid="382" href="jwpub://p/E:2015924/15-15"><em>w15 </em>12/15 3:7</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">Sadly, in this greedy world, there are those who seize on people’s illness as an opportunity to make money. Other individuals or companies stress the use of products that are high-priced in order to make large profits. To a sick person who desperately seeks relief or a way to stay alive longer, these “cures” may seem appealing. “The shrewd one” will be particularly cautious if the “word,” or recommendation, comes from someone whose qualifications are questionable. “The shrewd one” might reason: ‘He says that this vitamin, herb, or diet supposedly helped someone, but are there adequate witnesses to establish the matter? People differ. Is there valid reason to trust that it will help me? Should I do more research or even consult with some who are known to be trained or qualified in this field?’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:17:6-5:17:6" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Deut. 17:6</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="383" href="jwpub://p/E:2015925/24-25"><em>w15 </em>12/15 4:14, 15</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">Paul realized that we could not accept the extraordinary love of Christ without being compelled, or moved, to live for him. When our minds fully comprehend what Jehovah has done for us and our hearts are moved by his love, we desire to live our lives whole-souled for Christ Jesus. How do we show that desire? Those who love Jehovah are compelled to imitate Christ’s example, following his steps closely. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="92-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:6-62:2:6" data-bid="92-2" class="b"> 1 John 2:6</a>) Through our obedience, we prove our love for God and Christ. Jesus said: “Whoever has my commandments and observes them is the one who loves me. In turn, whoever loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:21-43:14:21" data-bid="93-1" class="b">John 14:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="93-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:3</a>) So ask yourself: ‘In what areas am I doing well in following in the steps of Christ Jesus? In what areas could I improve?’ This self-examination is vital, as we are constantly being pressured to follow the ways of this world.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="384" href="jwpub://p/E:2016043/16-18"><em>w16.01 </em>2:7-9</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:2:10-46:2:10" data-bid="96-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:10</a>) Have you seen Jehovah’s special blessing on your ministry? Do you have a burning desire to do Jehovah’s will? Do you have a deep inner feeling of responsibility to help others spiritually? Have you seen proof that Jehovah has personally intervened in your life? If you answer these questions with a resounding yes, does this mean that you now have the heavenly calling? No, it does not. Why not? Because these are not unique feelings experienced only by those who have the heavenly calling. Jehovah’s spirit works with equal force in those who have the hope of living forever on earth. In fact, if you are wondering whether you have received the heavenly calling, that would in itself indicate that you have <em>not </em>received it. <a class="xt" data-xtid="385" href="jwpub://p/E:2016045/23-25"><em>w16.01 </em>3:14, 15</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>) It brought us joy to receive the truth, and it brings us joy to share the truth with others. As we share Bible truths with others, we see spiritually hungry ones filled with delight as they begin to understand and appreciate our God and the precious truths contained in his Word. It touches our heart to see them make changes not just in their thinking but also in their way of life. We realize that the work of sharing the good news is vitally important. It opens the way to everlasting life for those who become reconciled to God.

However, that relationship is under attack by pressures not only from Satan’s world but also from our own imperfect flesh. This trying situation faces all Christians. Therefore, our relationship with Jehovah must be as strong as possible. How real to you is your personal relationship with Jehovah? Would you like to strengthen it? <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>, our text for today, tells you how you can do that. Note that this is a two-way process. As we take steps to draw close to God, he takes reciprocating action toward us. This interaction, frequently repeated, progressively strengthens our relationship with Jehovah. As a result, that relationship becomes very real to us. We develop the kind of confidence Jesus had when he said: “The One who sent me is <em>real, </em>and . . . <em>I know him.”<wbr /></em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:7:28-43:7:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 7:28, 29</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="39" href="jwpub://p/E:2015285/7-8"><em>w15 </em>4/15 3:1, 2</a></p>

They can appeal to our fallen flesh and lead us toward immoral acts. In time, the allure of sin may become so great that the unclean desire becomes fertile. At that point, even a servant of Jehovah may be ready to act on his desire when an opportunity arises.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">In what way has God “first loved us”? The apostle Paul said: “God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:8-45:5:8" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Rom. 5:8</a>) Love is Jehovah’s dominant attribute, so we can understand why Jesus told one inquirer that the first commandment from God is: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:12:30-41:12:30" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Mark 12:30</a>) From Jesus’ words, we learn that love for God involves, first of all, our heart. Being halfhearted is displeasing to Jehovah. However, we note that love for God also involves our whole soul, mind, and strength. This means that genuine love for God is much more than just an emotional feeling of the heart. In addition to being heartfelt, our love for God must involve all our spiritual and physical faculties. According to the prophet Micah, that is what Jehovah wants from us.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:6:8-33:6:8" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Mic. 6:8</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="53" href="jwpub://p/E:2015685/8-10"><em>w15 </em>9/15 5:1-3</a></p>

When this happens, we may forget to keep focused on how Jehovah has already helped us. When Queen Jezebel threatened the prophet Elijah’s life, even Elijah momentarily forgot how God had acted in his behalf. Regarding Elijah, the Bible says: “He asked that he might die.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:19:1-11:19:4" data-bid="51-1" class="b">1 Ki. 19:1-4</a>) What was the solution to Elijah’s problem?

The warm, benevolent affection that God has for his creatures assures us that all his purposes for the human family will be fulfilled in the best possible way and will result in the greatest benefit to all who come under his rulership.

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">Abner supported Saul’s efforts to kill David, even though Abner knew that God had chosen David to rule as king of Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:26:1-9:26:5" data-bid="94-1" class="b">1 Sam. 26:1-5</a>) After Saul’s death, Abner could have shown humility and proved his loyalty to God by supporting David, not Saul’s son Ish-bosheth. Later, when Abner had relations with King Saul’s concubine, he may have been seeking the throne for himself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:2:8-10:2:10" data-bid="95-1" class="b">2 Sam. 2:8-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:3:6-10:3:11" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> 3:6-11</a>) Similarly, lack of humility prevented David’s son Absalom from being loyal to God. Why, “Absalom acquired for himself a chariot and horses and 50 men to run before him”! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:15:1-10:15:1" data-bid="96-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:1</a>) He also stole the people’s loyalty. Like Abner, Absalom sought to kill David, even though he knew that Jehovah had appointed David as Israel’s king. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:15:13-10:15:14" data-bid="97-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:17:1-10:17:4" data-bid="97-2" class="b"> 17:1-4</a>) The examples of Abner and Absalom make it clear that inordinate ambition can easily cause a person to become disloyal to God. Surely, no faithful servant of Jehovah would pursue such a selfish and wicked course. <a class="xt" data-xtid="67" href="jwpub://p/E:2016127/18-20"><em>w16.02 </em>4:9-11</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">If you have strong conviction, it is reasonable to expect that you will show it by your actions. Young ones must also manifest “holy acts of conduct.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:11-61:3:11" data-bid="99-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:11</a>) To do so, you must be morally clean. How are you doing in that regard? For example, think about the past six months. How have you demonstrated that your “powers of discernment” have been trained to distinguish right from wrong? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Heb. 5:14</a>) Can you think of specific occasions when you resisted temptation or peer pressure? Does your conduct at school speak well of your faith? Do you stand up for your faith rather than try to blend in with your classmates just to avoid ridicule? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:4:3-60:4:4" data-bid="101-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:3, 4</a>) Admittedly, no one is perfect. Even longtime servants of Jehovah may at times feel timid about taking a public stand for their faith. However, a person who is dedicated to Jehovah will rightly be proud to bear God’s name, and he shows this by his conduct. <a class="xt" data-xtid="68" href="jwpub://p/E:2016202/19-20"><em>w16.03 </em>2:10, 11</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">Down through history, Jehovah has provided specific instructions or directions. For example, in the garden of Eden, Jehovah gave clear instructions that could guide the human family to everlasting life and happiness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:15-1:2:17" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Gen. 2:15-17</a>) Had Adam and Eve obeyed his direction, they would have been spared tragic consequences<wbr />—a life filled with pain and ending in their death with no hope. But rather than obey, Eve listened to advice that seemed to come from a lowly animal. Adam, in turn, listened to her voice, the voice of a mortal human. Both of them turned their backs on their loving Father’s guidance. Consequently, the human family in general was on a fatal path. Today, Jehovah stands before his people, as it were, pointing them toward everlasting life, away from dangers. More than that, he acts like a loving shepherd to his flock, calling out to the sheep proper direction and warnings so that they can avoid dangerous paths. <a class="xt" data-xtid="69" href="jwpub://p/E:2016206/9-11"><em>w16.03 </em>4:2, 3</a></p>

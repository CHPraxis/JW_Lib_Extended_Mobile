Through your example of humble self-sacrifice, you can teach your children the same lesson. “I never felt jealous because of the time my husband spent with others as an elder,” says Debbie, a mother of two. “I knew that whenever our family needed my husband’s attention, he would give it to us.” Her husband, Pranas, adds: “Later, our children were keen to be involved at assemblies and on theocratic projects. They flourished, made friends, and felt that they belonged!” The entire family now serves Jehovah in the full-time ministry. By the way you demonstrate humility and self-sacrifice, your children are likely to learn how to serve others. <a class="xt" data-xtid="164" href="jwpub://p/E:2015845/18-18"><em>w15 </em>11/15 1:9</a></p>

Some tools were useful for perhaps a decade or so, while others have proved to be of timeless value. But all these tools have allowed us to develop our skills as evangelizers in some way. One tool that helped many get started in the ministry was the <em>testimony card, </em>which Kingdom publishers began using in 1933. The card contained a brief Bible message. The testimony card was helpful in more ways than one. Although having a strong desire to share in the preaching work, some publishers were shy and did not know what to say. Others would tell the householder everything they knew in just a few minutes, but their presentation was not always tactful! In contrast, in a few concise, well-chosen words, the testimony card “did the talking” for the publisher. <a class="xt" data-xtid="163" href="jwpub://p/E:2015843/10-14"><em>w15 </em>11/15 5:3-6</a></p>

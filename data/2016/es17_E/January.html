<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Circuit overseers around the world have noted that in many congregations, more needs to be done to train brothers<wbr />—younger and older—<wbr />to help care for the flock. This presents a challenge. Why is that the case? If you are a Christian elder, you no doubt realize that personal training is important. You know that more brothers are needed to keep existing congregations spiritually strong and to allow new congregations to be formed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:60:22-23:60:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 60:22</a>) You also know that God’s Word urges you to “teach others.” Even so, you may find it hard to do so. After you have taken care of family needs, job requirements, congregation responsibilities, and other urgent matters, there just seems to be no time left to train others in the congregation. Yet, training is needed in order for them to share the workload. And as that is accomplished, everyone will benefit. <a class="xt" data-xtid="3" href="jwpub://p/E:2015281/8-9"><em>w15 </em>4/15 1:2, 3</a></p>

The need for change is determined, not by one’s desire for change, but by the needs of the congregation and the direction we receive from Jehovah’s organization. So if you are appointed, reassure your fellow believers and show respect for experienced elders by continuing to use their Bible-based methods. However, as you gain experience, you will no doubt share in applying changes that will help the congregation to stay in tune with Jehovah’s progressive organization. In fact, Jehovah may in time move all you faithful learners to do even greater works than those of your teachers.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:12-43:14:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 14:12</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="4" href="jwpub://p/E:2015282/28-28"><em>w15 </em>4/15 2:17</a></p>

If you are young and are giving serious consideration to a career in Jehovah’s service, why not review some of the material that has been published about various avenues of the full-time ministry and set one of these as a goal? You might talk with some who have spent many years in the full-time service. By making the ministry your career, you are preparing for continued service to God in the new world, where your theocratic training and experience will be of great value. <a class="xt" data-xtid="16" href="jwpub://p/E:2015605/22-23"><em>w15 </em>8/15 3:13, 14</a></p>

In his program of personal study, he continually searches for Scriptural principles that can help him to distinguish right from wrong. Thereafter, when he makes decisions, he gives evidence of spiritual maturity. For instance, he listens to his Bible-trained conscience. The mature Christian shows humility in that he recognizes that Jehovah’s ways and standards are always better than his own. He zealously preaches the good news and contributes to the unity of the congregation. No matter how long we have been serving Jehovah, each of us can ask, ‘Are there areas where I yet should model myself more closely after Jesus, thus continuing to progress spiritually?’ <a class="xt" data-xtid="17" href="jwpub://p/E:2015681/14-15"><em>w15 </em>9/15 1:6, 7</a></p>

Even at a time when many have little or no faith in God, the Bible remains a best seller and is now available, in whole or in part, in over 2,800 languages.

When we are preaching to others, we focus on important and beneficial spiritual matters, not on thoughts that will erode our faith. Preaching strengthens our convictions, reminding us of God’s promises and loving standards. It also helps keep our spiritual armor intact. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:6:14-49:6:17" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Eph. 6:14-17</a>) If we keep busy in our spiritual activities, we simply do not have time to become overly concerned with our own problems, and that helps to protect us. <a class="xt" data-xtid="33" href="jwpub://p/E:2016047/22-23"><em>w16.01 </em>5:12, 13</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:2:12-8:2:12" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Ruth 2:12</a>) That may remind us of a baby bird taking refuge under the wings of a powerful, protective parent.

He rewarded her for her faith, and she never had any reason to regret her decision. Today, many learn about Jehovah but hesitate to take refuge in him. They hold back from becoming his dedicated, baptized servants. If you hesitate to make a dedication to Jehovah, have you stopped to ask yourself why? Everyone alive serves some god or other. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:24:15-6:24:15" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Josh. 24:15</a>) Why not take refuge in the only God worth serving? Making a dedication to Jehovah is an excellent way to demonstrate faith in him. He will help you live up to that decision and face whatever challenges may arise. That is what God did for Ruth. <a class="xt" data-xtid="34" href="jwpub://p/E:2016123/14-15"><em>w16.02 </em>2:6, 7</a></p>

Out of loyalty to David, Abishai was eager to kill King Saul, but David restrained him, realizing that it would be wrong to lift one’s hand “against the anointed of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:26:9-9:26:11" data-bid="92-1" class="b">1 Sam. 26:9-11</a>) From that incident, we learn an important lesson: Although we can properly have several loyalties in our heart, the correct order of their importance should be determined by our application of Bible principles. Loyalty springs from the heart, but the human heart is treacherous. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:17:9-24:17:9" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Jer. 17:9</a>) Thus, one who is loyal to God could easily feel strong ties of loyalty to a close friend or relative even if that person is practicing what is bad. Especially when someone close to us abandons the truth must we remember that Jehovah always merits our primary loyalty.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:22:37-40:22:37" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Matt. 22:37</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="35" href="jwpub://p/E:2016127/13-14"><em>w16.02 </em>4:5, 6</a></p>

He had been taught “from infancy” by his mother and grandmother. Nevertheless, Paul urged Timothy: “Continue in the things that you learned <em>and were persuaded to believe.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:14-55:3:15" data-bid="96-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:14, 15</a>) According to one reference work, the original-language word for “persuaded” has the sense “to be convinced and certain of the truth of something.” Timothy had made the truth his own. He accepted it, not because his mother and grandmother told him to do so, but because he had reasoned on it for himself and had been persuaded.

They would have prepared for the journey, cared for one another’s needs en route, and then been united in worship at the temple. All of this called for cooperation. As we continue our journey toward the new world, we too need to be harmoniously joined together and cooperating. Think of what blessings await us! We have already left behind the disunity and confusion marking the present system of things. We now see being fulfilled what both Isaiah and Micah foretold<wbr />—God’s people are unitedly going up to “the mountain of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:2:2-23:2:4" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Isa. 2:2-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:4:2-33:4:4" data-bid="100-2" class="b"> Mic. 4:2-4</a>) Indeed, how elevated our form of worship is in “the final part of the days.” But how great will be our happiness and joy when we live at the time when all mankind will be harmoniously joined together and cooperating! <a class="xt" data-xtid="38" href="jwpub://p/E:2016205/27-28"><em>w16.03 </em>3:16, 17</a></p>

Perhaps they think: ‘Training is important, but it is not as urgent as other congregation matters that simply cannot wait. If I have to postpone training for a while, the congregation will continue to function.’ Though it is true that numerous matters require an elder’s immediate attention, delaying training may harm the spiritual well-being of the congregation. Elders care for many important tasks that have to be handled promptly. But if elders keep postponing necessary training, sooner or later the congregation will lack sufficient qualified brothers to care for all that needs to be done. Clearly, then, we should guard against thinking that training is of low priority. Elders who take a long-range view and invest their time in training less experienced brothers are wise stewards and a true blessing to the entire congregation.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:4:10-60:4:10" data-bid="102-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:10</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:2015281/11-11"><em>w15 </em>4/15 1:4,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:2015281/13-14"> 6, 7</a></p>

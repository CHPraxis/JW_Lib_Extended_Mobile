Friendship is more like a living thing that needs care and sustenance if it is to thrive and flourish. Abraham cherished and maintained his friendship with Jehovah. How did he do so? Abraham never came to feel that his past record of godly fear and obedience was enough. As he and his large household traveled into Canaan, he continued to let Jehovah guide him in making decisions, from the small to the great. A year before Isaac was born, when Abraham was 99 years old, Jehovah required that all males of Abraham’s household be circumcised. Did Abraham question that command or look for some way out of complying with it? No, he trusted in God and obeyed “on that very day.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:17:10-1:17:14" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gen. 17:10-14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:17:23-1:17:23" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 23</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="241" href="jwpub://p/E:2016122/18-19"><em>w16.02 </em>1:9, 10</a></p>

Jesus’ disciples were told to <em>“go” to all </em>people. On the day of Pentecost 33 C.E., there was an early evidence of Jehovah’s changed strategy<wbr />—that of a global evangelizing work. His holy spirit empowered about 120 members of the new congregation to speak miraculously in different tongues to Jews and proselytes.

Why? “To be tempted by the Devil.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:1-40:4:1" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Matt. 4:1</a>) Should that surprise us? Not if we grasp the main reason why God sent his Son to the earth. That was to settle the issue raised when Adam and Eve rejected God’s sovereignty. Questions needed time to be settled. For example, was something wrong with the way God created man? Was it possible for a perfect human to uphold God’s sovereignty regardless of pressures from “the wicked one”? And would mankind be better off independent of God’s rulership, as Satan implied? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:4-1:3:5" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Gen. 3:4, 5</a>) Answering such questions would require time but would show all intelligent creation that Jehovah exercises his sovereignty in a beneficial way. <a class="xt" data-xtid="216" href="jwpub://p/E:2015447/21-21"><em>w15 </em>6/15 5:12</a></p>

The Bible links a good conscience to faith and love. Paul wrote: “The objective of this instruction is love out of a clean heart and out of a good conscience and out of faith without hypocrisy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:1:5-54:1:5" data-bid="79-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:5</a>) As we train our conscience and respond to it, our love for Jehovah will deepen and our faith will be strengthened.

Am I approachable so that he will come to me for help if he is ever tempted to look at pornography?’ Even while your children are quite young, you could say to them: “If you ever come across an immoral website and you feel tempted to look at it, please come and talk to me. You don’t have to be ashamed. I want to help you.” Insight will also help you to choose your own entertainment prudently. “What we as parents approve of in the way of music, movies, or books sets the tone for the family,” says a father named Pranas. “You can say a lot about a lot of things, but your children will watch what you do and imitate you.” If your children see you carefully choosing clean entertainment, they will probably be moved to make similar choices.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:2:21-45:2:24" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Rom. 2:21-24</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="231" href="jwpub://p/E:2015845/22-24"><em>w15 </em>11/15 1:12-14</a></p>

If engaging in some of these features of service makes you nervous, why not give prayerful thought to this comment of longtime traveling overseer Angelo Manera, Jr.: “We looked at each new feature of service as another way to serve Jehovah, as another way to prove our loyalty to him, as another test of our integrity, and we were eager to prove ourselves willing to serve him in any way he asked.” Engaging in a new feature of the work, perhaps one outside our comfort zone, helps us to build trust and faith in Jehovah, leading to greater spirituality.

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">In the past, the English <em>New World Translation </em>followed the pattern of some other English Bibles that use the Hebrew expression “Sheol” in verses such as <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:9:10-21:9:10" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>. That verse used to read: “There is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheʹol, the place to which you are going.” Translators of many non-English editions faced this problem: The term “Sheol” is unknown to most of their readers, it is not found in their dictionaries, and it sounds like some geographic location. Accordingly, for the 2013 revision, approval was given to make the meaning of “Sheol” and the corresponding Greek term “Hades” clear by translating them accurately as “the Grave.” Obsolete English expressions were also replaced, and a concerted effort was put forth to make the text clear and easy to understand without sacrificing accuracy. Applying what had been done in other languages sharpened the English text. <a class="xt" data-xtid="232" href="jwpub://p/E:2015922/19-19"><em>w15 </em>12/15 2:10,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="233" href="jwpub://p/E:2015922/21-21"> 12</a></p>

Still, we know that an individual living in David’s day who showed consideration to a lowly one did not keep living without end. Hence, when David wrote the above, he could not have meant that such a considerate individual would be kept alive miraculously, thus gaining everlasting life. We can take those inspired words to mean that God would help the loyal considerate one. How? David explained: “Jehovah will sustain him on his sickbed; during his sickness you will completely change his bed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:41:3-19:41:3" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Ps. 41:3</a>) Yes, an individual who showed consideration to a lowly one could be certain that God was aware of him and his faithful course. And the recuperative power of his God-given body might help him to get better, to recover from his sickness. <a class="xt" data-xtid="234" href="jwpub://p/E:2015925/15-15"><em>w15 </em>12/15 4:7</a></p>

The answer is clearly seen in Paul’s words to the anointed brothers in Rome, who were “called to be holy ones.” He told them: “You did not receive a spirit of slavery causing fear again, but you received a spirit of adoption as sons, by which spirit we cry out: <em>‘Abba, </em>Father!’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:1:7-45:1:7" data-bid="114-1" class="b">Rom. 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:8:15-45:8:15" data-bid="114-2" class="b"> 8:15</a>) Simply put, by means of his holy spirit, God makes it clear to that person that he is invited to become a future heir in the Kingdom arrangement.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:2:12-52:2:12" data-bid="115-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:12</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="238" href="jwpub://p/E:2016045/16-17"><em>w16.01 </em>3:8, 9</a></p>

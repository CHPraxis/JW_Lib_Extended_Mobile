So a person who is contemplating baptism needs to be sure that this is his or her <em>personal </em>desire. That might call for self-scrutiny on your part. Why? Because your circumstance as a youth may be somewhat special. For example, you may have been raised in the truth. Over the years, you have likely seen many people get baptized—including some of your peers and perhaps even your siblings. If that is indeed your situation, what should you be careful about? Be alert that you do not come to view baptism as little more than a coming-of-age custom that all young people follow sooner or later. What can you do to make sure that you will keep the right view of Jehovah’s arrangement of baptism? Take time often to stop and think about the reasons <em>why </em>getting baptized is so important. <a class="xt" data-xtid="315" href="jwpub://p/E:2016201/21-22"><em>w16.03 </em>1:11, 12</a></p>

No. Just before Jesus provided this prayer as a pattern, he said: “When praying, do not say the same things over and over again.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:7-40:6:7" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Matt. 6:7</a>) On a later occasion, he restated this prayer but used different wording.

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">What will happen after the destruction of false religious organizations? It will be a time to reveal what is really in our heart. The majority of mankind will seek refuge in human organizations that are likened to “the rocks of the mountains.” Figuratively speaking, however, God’s people will flee to the refuge that Jehovah provides. In the first century, the interval was not a time for a mass conversion of Jews to Christianity. It was a time for action and obedience on the part of those who were already Christians. Similarly, we cannot expect that the future interruption in the great tribulation will result in an influx of new believers. Rather, it will be an opportunity for all true believers to prove their love for Jehovah and give their support to Christ’s brothers.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:34-40:25:40" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Matt. 25:34-40</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="293" href="jwpub://p/E:2015523/16-16"><em>w15 </em>7/15 2:7</a></p>

Perhaps to indicate what was to come, Jehovah inspired the prophets Daniel and Jeremiah and the priest Ezra to record portions of their Bible books in Aramaic. Alexander the Great later conquered much of the ancient world, and common, or Koine, Greek became an international language. Many Jews began to speak that language, leading to the translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek. This translation, thought to have been done by 72 translators, became known as the <em>Septuagint. </em>It was the first translation of the Bible and one of the most important. The work of so many translators resulted in varied translation styles, from literal to rather free. Nevertheless, the <em>Septuagint </em>was viewed as God’s Word by Greek-speaking Jews and later by Christians. <a class="xt" data-xtid="305" href="jwpub://p/E:2015921/12-14"><em>w15 </em>12/15 1:4-6</a></p>

<p id="p84" data-pid="84" class = "themeScrp"><em>Luke, the beloved physician, sends you his greetings.—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:4:14-51:4:14" data-bid="91-1" class="b"><em>Col. 4:14</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">It is reasonable to believe that Luke gave Paul medical advice and rendered medical services to him and to others in his missionary group. Why would Luke need to do that? Because even Paul got sick while traveling. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:4:13-48:4:13" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Gal. 4:13</a>) Luke could provide medical help that was in line with what Jesus had said: “Those who are healthy do not need a physician, but those who are ill do.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:5:31-42:5:31" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Luke 5:31</a>) The Bible does not indicate where or when Luke received his medical training. It has been suggested that Paul mentioned to Christians in Colossae the role of Luke as a physician because they knew him. Interestingly, there was a medical school in nearby Laodicea. In any event, Luke was not some untrained layman spouting health recommendations; he was a physician. That is evident both from the specific medical language that Luke used in his Gospel and in the book of Acts and from the way he focused on Jesus’ healings of others. <a class="xt" data-xtid="307" href="jwpub://p/E:2015925/20-21"><em>w15 </em>12/15 4:11, 12</a></p>

<p id="p87" data-pid="87" class = "themeScrp"><em>Thanks be to God for his indescribable free gift.—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:9:15-47:9:15" data-bid="94-1" class="b"><em>2 Cor. 9:15</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">When Jehovah sent his only-begotten Son to this earth, He gave what would become the greatest possible gift of love! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="95-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:9-62:4:10" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> 1 John 4:9, 10</a>) The apostle Paul called it God’s “indescribable free gift.” Paul knew that all the magnificent promises of God were guaranteed through the perfect sacrifice of Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:1:20-47:1:20" data-bid="96-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:20</a>) Thus, that “indescribable free gift” would include all the goodness and loyal love that Jehovah would extend to us through Jesus. Indeed, that gift is so awe-inspiring that it cannot be fully described in human terms. How should receiving such an extraordinary gift affect us? And in what practical ways should this gift motivate us? Does it compel you to reconsider your actions and even change the way you have been living your life? Are you moved to be more generous and loving toward others and to forgive any who have wronged you? Remember, what Jehovah has given us through Christ is by far the greatest gift ever given.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:18-60:3:18" data-bid="97-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:18</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="309" href="jwpub://p/E:2016043/8-9"><em>w16.01 </em>2:1, 2,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="308" href="jwpub://p/E:2016043/12-13"> 4, 5</a></p>

But they do not question the fact that they have been invited. Their hearts are bursting with joy and appreciation. They feel much as did Peter when he said under inspiration: “Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for according to his great mercy he gave us a new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance. It is reserved in the heavens for you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:3-60:1:4" data-bid="99-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:3, 4</a>) When anointed ones read those words, they know without any doubt that their heavenly Father is speaking to them personally. <a class="xt" data-xtid="310" href="jwpub://p/E:2016045/20-21"><em>w16.01 </em>3:11, 12</a></p>

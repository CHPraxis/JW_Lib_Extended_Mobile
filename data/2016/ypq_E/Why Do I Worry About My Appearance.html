<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">It’s not wrong for you to be concerned about how you look. In fact, the Bible comments favorably on the physical appearance of a number of women and men, including Sarah, Rachel, Abigail, Joseph, and David. The Bible says that a woman named Abishag was “extremely beautiful.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:1:4-11:1:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Kings 1:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">However, many youths are <em>obsessed </em>with how they look. That can lead to severe problems. Consider:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="su">  In one study, 58 percent of girls claimed to be overweight, when, in fact, only 17 percent were.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="su">  In another study, 45 percent of women who were actually <em>underweight </em>thought that they were too heavy!</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="su">  In their quest to lose weight, some youths have fallen victim to anorexia​—a life-threatening eating disorder that really amounts to self-starvation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>If you have symptoms of anorexia or any other eating disorder, <em>get help. </em>Start by confiding in a parent or another trusted adult. The Bible says: “A true friend shows love at all times, and is a brother who is born for times of distress.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>THE BEST IMPROVEMENT YOU CAN MAKE!</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn">Really, it’s the inner person that makes one either attractive or not. Consider King David’s son Absalom. The Bible says:</p>
<blockquote><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="si">“No man was as highly praised for his handsome appearance. . . . There was no flaw in him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:14:25-10:14:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Samuel 14:25</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn">Yet, this young man was full of pride, ambition, and treachery! The Bible, therefore, doesn’t paint a pretty picture of Absalom; it portrays him as a man of shameless disloyalty and murderous hatred.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn">For good reason, the Bible gives us this advice:</p>
<blockquote><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="si">“Clothe yourselves with the new personality.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:10-51:3:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Colossians 3:10</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="si">“Do not let your adornment be external . . . , but let it be the secret person of the heart.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:3-60:3:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:3, 4</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn">While there’s nothing wrong with wanting to look good, far more important than your appearance is your personality. In the long run, praiseworthy qualities will make you more attractive to others than a strong body or a beautiful figure will! “Prettiness can get quick attention,” says a girl named Phylicia, “but who you are on the inside and your good qualities are what people will remember about you the most.”</p>

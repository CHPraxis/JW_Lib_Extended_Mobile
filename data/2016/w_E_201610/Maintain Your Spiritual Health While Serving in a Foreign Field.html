<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">THOUSANDS of Jehovah’s Witnesses today are taking an active part in the fulfillment of the vision to declare the good news “to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:14:6-66:14:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rev. 14:6</a>) Are you among those who are learning another language?

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>As God’s servants, all of us need to give priority to our spiritual health and that of our family. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3</a>) At times, though, we may find it difficult to engage in meaningful personal study because of our busy routine.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The inability to grasp God’s Word in a foreign language can pose a real threat to our spiritual health. In the fifth century B.C.E., Nehemiah showed concern when he learned that some children among the Jews who had returned from Babylon could not speak the Hebrew language. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:13:23-16:13:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Nehemiah 13:23, 24</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>These children were actually losing their identity as God’s servants because they could not fully understand the meaning of God’s Word.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:8:2-16:8:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Neh. 8:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:8:8-16:8:8" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>5, 6. </strong>What have some parents serving in a foreign-language field come to realize, and why?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Some Christian parents serving in a foreign-language field have come to realize that their children’s interest in the truth has waned. Because of not fully understanding what was said at the meetings, the children were not really touched by the spiritual program that was being presented at the Kingdom Hall. “When talking about spiritual matters,” says Pedro,<span data-enid="1" class="en"><strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong><span class="tt en" data-rel-enid="1"></span></span> who moved his family to Australia from South America, “the heart and emotions should be involved.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:24:32-42:24:32" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 24:32</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>When we read in a foreign tongue, our heart may not be as involved as it would be in our own language. Moreover, the inability to communicate well in another language can be mentally and spiritually draining. So while keeping alive our desire to serve Jehovah in a foreign-language field, we do well to safeguard our spiritual health.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 4:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>When Daniel and his companions were exiled, the Babylonians tried to assimilate them into their culture by teaching them “the language of the Chaldeans.” Moreover, the court official in charge of their training gave them Babylonian names. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:1:3-27:1:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Dan. 1:3-7</a>) The name given to Daniel referred to Bel, the main divinity of Babylon.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:9:2-27:9:2" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Dan. 9:2</a>, ftn.)

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Although we may be very busy with theocratic and secular responsibilities, <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>we all need to make time for personal study and family worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:15-49:5:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Eph. 5:15, 16</a>) Our aim, though, should not be simply to cover a certain number of pages or solely to prepare comments to participate at meetings. We want to make sure that we allow God’s Word to reach our heart and strengthen our faith.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>To reach that goal, we should find a balance between keeping in mind the needs of others when studying and reflecting on our own spiritual needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:1:9-50:1:10" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Phil. 1:9, 10</a>) We must recognize that when we prepare for the ministry, for the meetings, or for a talk, we may not necessarily apply what we read to ourselves. To illustrate: Although a chef has to taste dishes before serving them, he cannot live merely on the food he samples. If he wants to remain healthy, he has to prepare nutritious meals for himself. Similarly, we should strive to nourish our heart with spiritual food that fills our personal needs.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>12, 13. </strong>Why do many of those serving in a foreign-language field find it beneficial to study regularly in their mother tongue?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Many among those serving in a foreign-language field find it beneficial to study the Bible regularly in the ‘language of their birth.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:8-44:2:8" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 2:8</a>, ftn.) Even missionaries recognize that to remain strong in their foreign assignment, they cannot rely merely on the basic understanding of the spiritual food they get at the meetings.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Alain, who has been learning the Persian language for about eight years, admits: “When I prepare for meetings in Persian, I tend to focus on the language itself. Since my mind is mainly involved in an intellectual exercise, my heart is <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>not necessarily touched by the spiritual thoughts I am reading.

After serving in a foreign-language field for over three years, Serge and his wife, Muriel, noticed that their 17-year-old son lacked joy in theocratic activities. “It annoyed him to go out in the ministry in another language, whereas before he loved preaching in his native language, French,” says Muriel. “When we realized that this situation had hindered our son from making spiritual advancement,” explains Serge, “we decided to move back to our former congregation.”</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>What factors might influence parents to move back to a congregation that uses the language their children best understand? First, they should determine whether they really have enough time and resources to instill love for Jehovah in their children while at the same time teaching them a foreign tongue. Second, they may notice in their children a lack of interest in spiritual activities or in the foreign-language field in which they are serving. In such circumstances, Christian parents might consider moving back to a congregation that uses the language their children best understand until their children take a firm stand for the truth.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:6:5-5:6:7" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 6:5-7</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

Charles, a father of three girls ranging from 9 to 13 years of age, attends a Lingala-speaking group.

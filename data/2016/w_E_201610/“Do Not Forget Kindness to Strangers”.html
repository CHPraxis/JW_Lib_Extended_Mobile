<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>After Jehovah delivered his people from Egypt, he gave them a set of laws that showed special consideration for the many non-Israelites who had joined them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:38-2:12:38" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 12:38,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:49-2:12:49" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 49;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:22:21-2:22:21" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 22:21</a>) Since foreigners are often disadvantaged, Jehovah lovingly made provisions for them.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Rather than order the Israelites to respect foreigners, Jehovah appealed to their empathy. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:23:9-2:23:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Exodus 23:9</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>They knew ‘how it felt to be a foreigner.’ Even before they were reduced to slavery, the Hebrews were likely shunned by the Egyptians because of racial pride or religious prejudice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:43:32-1:43:32" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 43:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:46:34-1:46:34" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 46:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:1:11-2:1:14" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Ex. 1:11-14</a>) The Israelites had experienced a bitter life as foreign residents, but Jehovah expected them to treat the foreigner “like a native” among them.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:19:33-3:19:34" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Lev. 19:33, 34</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>What shows that first-century Christians learned to overcome deep-seated prejudices?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>First-century Christians learned to overcome the deep-seated prejudices that prevailed among the Jews. At Pentecost 33 C.E., those living in Jerusalem extended hospitality to newly converted Christians from various lands. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:5-44:2:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 2:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:44-44:2:47" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 44-47</a>) The loving concern of Jewish Christians for fellow believers from other lands showed that they understood the meaning of the word “hospitality,” that is, “kindness to strangers.”</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>As the early Christian congregation grew, however, a situation that apparently involved discrimination arose. Greek-speaking Jews complained that their widows were not being treated fairly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:6:1-44:6:1" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 6:1</a>) To settle this issue, the apostles appointed seven men to make sure that nobody was neglected. These men all had Greek names, which seems to indicate that the apostles wanted to ease any tensions over background that might have existed among the early Christians.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:6:2-44:6:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 6:2-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"><strong>8, 9. </strong>(a) What might indicate that we are harboring prejudice or racial pride? (b) What must we root out of our heart? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:22-60:1:22" data-bid="33-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:22</a>)</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Whether we realize it or not, we are all deeply influenced by our culture. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2</a>) Moreover, we likely hear neighbors, fellow workers, or schoolmates make derogatory remarks about those of another background, tribe, or skin color. How deeply are we affected by such biased views? And how do we react when someone makes fun of our nationality<wbr />—maybe by exaggerating some feature of our culture?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>For a while, the apostle Peter harbored prejudice against non-Jews, but <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>he gradually learned to eradicate negative views from his heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:10:28-44:10:28" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 10:28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:10:34-44:10:35" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 34, 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:2:11-48:2:14" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> Gal. 2:11-14</a>) Likewise, if we detect any trace of prejudice or racial pride in us, we should make a conscious effort to root it out of our heart. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:22-60:1:22" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 1:22</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>We might reflect on the fact that none of us deserve salvation; we are all imperfect humans, regardless of our nationality.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:4:7-46:4:7" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:7</a>) We should have a view like that of the apostle Paul, who admonished his fellow anointed Christians that they were “no longer strangers and foreigners, but . . . members of the household of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:2:19-49:2:19" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Eph. 2:19</a>) Earnest effort to overcome prejudiced views regarding those who are of a different background will certainly help us to put on the new personality.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:10-51:3:11" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Col. 3:10, 11</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Boaz undoubtedly reflected Jehovah’s view of strangers in his dealings with Ruth the Moabitess. When he came to inspect his fields during the harvest, Boaz could not fail to notice a hardworking foreign woman gleaning behind his harvesters. On hearing that she had asked permission to glean<wbr />—even though she was within her full right to do so—<wbr />Boaz generously allowed her to glean even among the sheaves.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:2:5-8:2:7" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>Ruth 2:5-7,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:2:15-8:2:16" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> <strong>15, 16</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>The conversation that ensued shows that Boaz was clearly concerned about Ruth and her precarious situation as a foreigner. For one thing, he invited her to stay with his group of young women so that she would not be harassed by the men who were working in the field. He even made sure that she would get enough food and water, just like the hired workers. In addition, Boaz did not speak down to the poor foreign woman but, instead, reassured her.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:2:8-8:2:10" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ruth 2:8-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:2:13-8:2:14" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 13, 14</a>.</p>

Boaz’ kindness was actually an expression of Jehovah’s loyal love toward a woman who had come to ‘seek refuge under the wings of the God of Israel.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:2:12-8:2:12" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ruth 2:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/8:2:20-8:2:20" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:19:17-20:19:17" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> Prov. 19:17</a>) Similarly today, our kindly demeanor can help “all sorts of people” recognize the truth and sense how much Jehovah loves them.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:2:3-54:2:4" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:3, 4</a>.</p>

We may have noticed that new immigrants are sometimes shy and stay by themselves. Because of their upbringing or social status, they may feel inferior to those of another race or nationality.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">SAUL and his 3,000 soldiers were looking for David in the wilderness of Judah to kill him. But one night, David and his men found the place where Saul and his soldiers were camped. They were all asleep, so David and Abishai walked carefully past the soldiers and found Saul. Abishai whispered to David: “Let me pin him to the ground with the spear just once, and I will not need to do it twice.” But David would not let him kill Saul. He told Abishai: “Do not harm him, for who can lift his hand against the anointed of Jehovah and remain innocent?” Then David said: “It is unthinkable from Jehovah’s standpoint for me to lift my hand against the anointed of Jehovah!”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:26:8-9:26:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Samuel 26:8-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>David understood what he needed to do to be loyal to <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>Jehovah. He knew he should respect Saul, and he did not even think of hurting him. Why? Because God had chosen Saul to be king of Israel. Today, as in the past, Jehovah wants all of his servants to be loyal to him and respect those whom he allows to have authority.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:6:8-33:6:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Micah 6:8</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Abishai respected David because he knew that God had chosen David to be king. Yet after becoming king, David committed serious sins. He had sexual relations with Uriah’s wife and then told Joab to make sure that Uriah would be killed in battle.

In addition, Abishai was a military leader and could have used this authority to make himself king, but he never did. Instead, he served David and protected him from his enemies.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:10:10-10:10:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Samuel 10:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:20:6-10:20:6" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 20:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:21:15-10:21:17" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 21:15-17</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>David was loyal to Jehovah all his life. When he was young, he killed the giant Goliath, who was insulting Jehovah and the Israelites.

Immediately, David admitted that he had sinned, and he repented.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:29:1-13:29:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 29:1-5</a>) It is clear that even though David made serious mistakes in his life, he never stopped being loyal to God.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:26:8-9:26:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Samuel 26:8-11</a>) This teaches us an important lesson: When we need to decide whom to be loyal to first, we need to think about which Bible principles can help us in our situation.</p>

Anne’s mother said that she was very unhappy because the family refused to talk to her. This made Anne feel sad, and she promised to reply in a letter.

But after Saul died, Abner did not support David. Instead, he tried to make Saul’s son Ish-bosheth king. Later, Abner may have wanted to <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>be king himself, and perhaps that is why he had sexual relations with one of King Saul’s wives.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>When a person is not humble and wants to have more authority, it is hard for him to stay loyal to God. Of course, we love Jehovah, and we do not want to be selfish and wicked like Abner and Absalom. But we must be careful that we do not start to desire a lot of money or a job that makes us feel important. This will harm our relationship with Jehovah. For some time, Baruch, Jeremiah’s secretary, wanted something he did not have and was no longer happy serving God. Then Jehovah said to Baruch: “Look! What I have built up I am tearing down, and what I have planted I am uprooting<wbr />—the entire land. But you are seeking great things for yourself. Stop seeking such things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:45:4-24:45:5" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Jeremiah 45:4, 5</a>) Baruch listened to Jehovah.

He was not being loyal to Jehovah, and he needed to be humble. So he told an experienced elder about the girl. Daniel explains: “He helped me to see that to be loyal to God, I needed to stop writing to her. After many prayers and tears, that is what I did. Soon, my joy in the ministry increased.” Daniel now has a wife who loves Jehovah, and he serves as a circuit overseer.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>When we are loyal to Jehovah, we can also be loyal to others and help them in the best way. The prophet Nathan stayed loyal to Jehovah and was also loyal to David. After David had taken a man’s wife and then killed him, Jehovah sent Nathan to counsel David. Nathan was courageous and obeyed Jehovah. But he also acted wisely and spoke to David in a kind way. He wanted to help David understand how serious his sins were. So he told him a story of a rich man who stole the only lamb that a poor man had. When David heard this, he got very angry at what the rich man had done. Nathan then said: “You are the man!” David realized that he had sinned against Jehovah.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:12:1-10:12:7" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Samuel 12:1-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:12:13-10:12:13" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 13</a>.</p>

For example, you may have proof that a brother has committed a serious sin. You may want to stay loyal to him, especially if he is a close friend or a family member. But you also know that it is more important to be loyal to Jehovah. So like Nathan, obey Jehovah but be kind to your brother. Tell him that he should ask the elders for help and that he should speak to them soon. If he does not, then you should tell the elders yourself. By doing this, you stay loyal to Jehovah. And at the same time, you are kind to your brother because the elders can help him to have a good relationship with Jehovah again. They will correct him in a calm and gentle way.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:5:1-3:5:1" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>Leviticus 5:1;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> <strong>Galatians 6:1</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

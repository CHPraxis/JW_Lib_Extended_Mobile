<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What situation did Paul describe at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:4-45:8:13" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Romans 8:4-13</a>?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:4-45:8:13" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 8:4-13</strong></a><strong>. </strong>In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:1-45:8:39" data-bid="13-1" class="b">the eighth chapter of Romans</a>, Paul described two different kinds of people, those who live “according to the <strong>flesh” </strong>and those who live “according to the <strong>spirit.” </strong>Some think that Paul <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>was describing those who were not Christians and those who were. But here Paul was writing to Christians, those who were <strong>“called to be holy ones.” </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:7-45:1:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Romans 1:7</a>) So both those who lived “according to the flesh” and those who lived “according to the spirit” were Christians. How were they different from one another?</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"><strong>6, 7. </strong>(a) What are some meanings of the word “flesh” in the Bible? (b) How is the word “flesh” used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:4-45:8:13" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Romans 8:4-13</a>?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>When the Bible uses the word “flesh,” it can refer to various things. Sometimes it means the actual flesh of our body. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:28-45:2:28" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Romans 2:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:39-46:15:39" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:39,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:50-46:15:50" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 50</a>) It can also refer to a family relationship. For example, the Bible says that Jesus was “from the offspring of David according to the flesh,” and Paul called the Jews his “relatives according to the flesh.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:3-45:1:3" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Romans 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:3-45:9:3" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 9:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>So, what did Paul mean when he spoke about those who live “according to the flesh” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:4-45:8:13" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Romans 8:4-13</a>? To find the answer, we can look at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:5-45:7:5" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Romans 7:5</a>. There Paul wrote: “When we were living according to the flesh, the sinful passions that were awakened by the Law were at work in our bodies.” Here Paul explained that people who live “according to the flesh” are those who are focused on and follow their own sinful desires, doing whatever they want.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>Why did Paul need to warn anointed Christians against living “according to the flesh”?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Why did Paul warn anointed Christians against living “according to the flesh”? And why do all Christians today need this warning? Because any faithful servant of God could begin to make his own desires the main thing in his life. For example, Paul wrote that some brothers in Rome were slaves “of their own appetites.” By this he could have meant that sex, food, or other pleasures were the most important things in their lives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:17-45:16:18" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Romans 16:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:18-50:3:19" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Philippians 3:18, 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:4-65:1:4" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> Jude 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:8-65:1:8" data-bid="19-4" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:12-65:1:12" data-bid="19-5" class="b"> 12</a>) And for a time, there was a situation in the congregation in Corinth in which a brother was having an immoral relationship “with his father’s wife.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:1-46:5:1" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>) Clearly, those early Christians needed Paul’s warning about living “according to the flesh.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:5-45:8:6" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Romans 8:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>What is <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:6-45:8:6" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Romans 8:6</a> not talking about?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>This warning also applies today. Even a person who has served Jehovah for many years could begin to live “according to the flesh.” So, was Paul saying that we should never think about things such as food, employment, recreation, or romance? Of course not. These are normal things in life. Even Jesus enjoyed food and fed others. He also realized that he needed rest. And Paul wrote that in marriage, sexual relations have an important place.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>What did Paul mean by the expression <strong>“setting the mind on”? </strong>The Greek word that Paul used refers to focusing all one’s thoughts and plans on something. One scholar explained that this expression refers to those who “are most deeply interested in, constantly talk about,” and focus most on their own selfish desires. They allow those desires to control how they live.</p>

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>What are some things that could become too important to us?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>The Christians in Rome needed to examine themselves and find out what they were setting their minds on. Was it “the things of the flesh”? Today, we too need to think about what is most important to us. What is our favorite thing to talk about? What do we really love to do? Some may realize that they are constantly thinking about trying different types of wine, decorating their home, buying new clothes, investing money, or planning vacations. These things are not wrong. They may be normal things in our life. For example, even Jesus provided wine at a wedding, and Paul advised Timothy to have “a little wine” for his health. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:23-54:5:23" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:2:3-43:2:11" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> John 2:3-11</a>) But wine was not the most <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>important thing in their lives. What about us? What is our main interest in life?</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>12, 13. </strong>Why should we be careful about what we focus on?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Paul warned: “Setting the mind on the flesh <strong>means death.” </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:6-45:8:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Romans 8:6</a>) What did he mean by this? If we live “according to the flesh,” we could lose our relationship with Jehovah now and lose our life in the future. But this does not have to happen. A person can change. Remember the immoral man in Corinth who had to be disfellowshipped? He changed and stopped following his immoral desires. Once again, he served Jehovah in a clean way.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:6-47:2:8" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 2:6-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>That man was an extreme example of living “according to the flesh,” and yet even he was able to change. So if a Christian today has begun to follow his sinful desires instead of Jehovah’s standards, he too can change. Remembering Paul’s warning can motivate us to make any changes we need to make.</p>

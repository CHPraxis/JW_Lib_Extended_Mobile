<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jehovah is a rewarder! It is an important part of who he is and what he does. So our faith in God is not complete unless we are convinced that he will reward those who earnestly seek him. Why is that? Because “faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:1-58:11:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:1</a>) Faith means having the absolute confidence that God will bless his loyal ones.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Jehovah God has promised to reward his faithful servants. He invites us to give him our best and to trust that he will bless us. Jehovah says: “Test me out, please.” He continues: “See whether I will not open to you the floodgates of the heavens and pour out on you a blessing until there is nothing lacking.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:10-39:3:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Malachi 3:10</a>) We show our thankfulness for this offer when we accept Jehovah’s invitation to test him out.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>The apostle Peter once asked Jesus: “We have left all things and followed <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>you; what, then, will there be for us?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:27-40:19:27" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 19:27</a>) Jesus did not correct Peter for asking that question. Instead, Jesus told his disciples that they would be rewarded for their sacrifices. The apostles and other faithful ones will rule with Jesus in heaven in the future. But Jesus also said that even now there are rewards: “Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit everlasting life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:29-40:19:29" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 19:29</a>) All of Jesus’ followers can find fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and children in the congregation today.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus said: “Rejoice and be overjoyed, since your reward is great in the heavens, for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:12-40:5:12" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 5:12</a>) Some of God’s servants will receive a reward in heaven.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>To receive the reward, we need to have complete faith in Jehovah and be obedient to his directions. Moses told the nation of Israel: “Jehovah will surely bless you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance, but only if you strictly obey the voice of Jehovah your God and carefully observe all this commandment that I am giving you today. For Jehovah your God will bless you just as he has promised you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:15:4-5:15:6" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 15:4-6</a>) Are you absolutely convinced that Jehovah will bless you if you continue to serve him faithfully?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>) Joseph was an excellent example of this. First, his brothers sold him as a slave. Later, his master’s wife falsely accused him and he was sent to an Egyptian prison. When Joseph was in prison, was he separated from Jehovah? Not at all! The Bible says: “Jehovah continued with Joseph and kept showing loyal love to him,” and “Jehovah was with Joseph and Jehovah made whatever he did successful.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:21-1:39:21" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Genesis 39:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:23-1:39:23" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 23</a>) Even through those difficult times, Joseph waited patiently on his God.</p>

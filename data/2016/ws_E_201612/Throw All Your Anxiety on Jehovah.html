<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">TODAY, Satan “walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Revelation 12:17</a>) As a result, life is stressful, and even God’s servants experience anxiety. God’s servants in the past also had anxious moments. For example, the Bible says that King David sometimes felt anxious. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:13:2-19:13:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 13:2</a>) And the apostle Paul experienced “anxiety for all the congregations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:28-47:11:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>) But what can we do when we are overwhelmed by anxiety?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Our loving heavenly Father helped his servants in the past to find relief from anxiety, and he wants to do the same for us today. The Bible urges us: “Throw all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:7</a>) How, though, can you do that? We will consider four ways. You can (1) pray, (2) read and meditate on God’s <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>Word, (3) let Jehovah’s holy spirit help you, and (4) talk to someone you trust about how you feel.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>How can you “throw your burden on Jehovah”?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>The first way we can throw our anxiety on Jehovah is through sincere prayer. When you are anxious, your loving heavenly Father wants you to express your deepest feelings to him. The psalmist David begged Jehovah: “Listen to my prayer, O God.” In the same psalm, David also said: “Throw your burden on Jehovah, and he will sustain you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:1-19:55:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 55:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:22-19:55:22" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 22</a>) After you have done all you can to solve a problem, heartfelt prayer to Jehovah will help more than worrying. But how does prayer work? How can it help us avoid feeling overwhelmed by anxiety?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:94:18-19:94:19" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 94:18, 19</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>When we are anxious, why is prayer so important?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Philippians 4:6, 7</strong></a><strong>. </strong>How does Jehovah respond to our heartfelt and persistent prayers? He can help us to feel calm and to avoid negative thoughts and feelings. Instead of our having anxiety and fear, God helps us to have the deepest inner peace we could ever experience. Many of our brothers and sisters have felt this calmness. That can be your experience too. “The peace of God” can help you overcome any challenge! You can fully trust in Jehovah’s promise: “Do not be anxious, for I am your God. I will fortify you, yes, I will help you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:10-23:41:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:10</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>A second way to find inner peace is by reading and meditating on Bible verses. Why is this important? The Bible is God’s Word. It includes wise and practical advice from our Creator. No matter when you feel anxious, you can think deeply about God’s thoughts and meditate on how his advice can strengthen you. This can help you overcome, reduce, or even avoid anxiety. Jehovah specifically linked reading his Word with being “courageous and strong” and not being “struck with terror or fear.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:7-6:1:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Joshua 1:7-9</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>In God’s Word, we read about how Jesus spoke to people. They loved listening to him because his words were comforting and refreshing, especially to those who were weak or depressed. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:28-40:11:30" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 11:28-30</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jesus was <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>very concerned about how others felt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:30-41:6:32" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Mark 6:30-32</a>) Just as Jesus promised to help the apostles who traveled with him, he will help us today. We do not need to be with Jesus in order to benefit. As our King in heaven, Jesus continues to show love for us. So when you are anxious, you can be sure that he will be there for you and help you at the right time. Jesus gives us hope and courage, which help us to overcome anxiety.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:17-58:2:18" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:16-58:4:16" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 4:16</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>How do we benefit from God’s holy spirit?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Jesus promised that our Father will give us holy spirit when we ask for it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:10-42:11:13" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Luke 11:10-13</a>) How will this third way of reducing anxiety help us? God’s holy spirit, or active force, helps us to develop the positive qualities that our almighty God has. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:10-51:3:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Colossians 3:10</a>) In the Bible, these qualities are called “the fruitage of the spirit.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>Galatians 5:22, 23</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>When we develop these good qualities, our relationships with others will improve, and we will avoid situations that could cause anxiety. Let us see how the fruitage of the spirit will help us in specific ways.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>8-12. </strong>How can the fruitage of God’s holy spirit help you?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup>“Love, joy, peace.” </strong>When you treat others with respect, you will find that you have less anxiety. How so? When you show brotherly love, tender affection, and honor, you can often avoid situations that cause you to have negative feelings such as anger, frustration, and stress. This will make it easier to maintain peace with others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:10-45:12:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Romans 12:10</a>.</p>
<div class="stdPullQuote"><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sc">When we develop good qualities, our relationships with others will improve</p>
</div>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup>“Patience, kindness, goodness.” </strong>The Bible says: “Become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:32-49:4:32" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:32</a>) When we follow that advice, we will have peaceful relationships with others, and we will prevent situations that could cause us anxiety. Also, it will be easier to deal with situations that arise because of our imperfection.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup>“Faith.” </strong>Today, we are often anxious about money and material things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:11-20:18:11" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:11</a>) How can we avoid this type of anxiety? We must follow the apostle Paul’s counsel to be “content with the present things.” Strong faith in Jehovah will help us to trust that he will lovingly provide the things we need. He has promised: “I will never leave you, and I will never abandon you.” That is why we can say like Paul: “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>afraid. What can man do to me?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:5-58:13:6" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup>“Mildness, self-control.” </strong>Think how practical and helpful it is for you to show mildness and self-control. These qualities will prevent you from doing or saying things that could cause you anxiety, and you will benefit by avoiding “malicious bitterness, anger, wrath, screaming, and abusive speech.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:31-49:4:31" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:31</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>You need humility in order to trust in “the mighty hand of God” and to “throw all your anxiety on him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:6-60:5:7" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:6, 7</a>) If you are humble, Jehovah will support you and take care of you. When you recognize what you can do and what you cannot do, you will not rely on yourself. You will have less anxiety because you will rely on God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:6:8-33:6:8" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Micah 6:8</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>What did Jesus mean when he said: “Never be anxious”?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:34-40:6:34" data-bid="24-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 6:34</strong></a> <strong>(read), </strong>we find Jesus’ wise advice: “Never be anxious.” This advice may seem impossible for us to apply. But what did Jesus mean? We have already learned that David and Paul felt anxious at times. Jesus did not mean that one who serves God would never feel anxious. Instead, Jesus was helping his disciples to understand that <strong>unnecessary, </strong>or <strong>extreme, </strong>anxiety does not solve problems. There will be challenges each day, so Christians should not add more anxiety by thinking about past or future problems. How can Jesus’ advice help you to reduce severe anxiety?</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>14. </strong>Like David, how can you reduce anxiety?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Sometimes people are anxious because of mistakes they made in the past. They may feel extreme guilt about what they did, even though it was many years ago. At times King David felt overwhelmed because of his mistakes. He admitted: “My anguished heart makes me groan aloud.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:38:3-19:38:4" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 38:3, 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:38:8-19:38:8" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:38:18-19:38:18" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 18</a>) In that situation, David did something very wise. He trusted in Jehovah’s mercy and forgiveness. And David then felt happy knowing that <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>God had forgiven him.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:1-19:32:3" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 32:1-3,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:5-19:32:5" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> <strong>5</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>15. </strong>(a) What else do we learn from David? (b) What can you do to reduce anxiety? (See the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:402016922/54-68">Some Practical Ways to Reduce Anxiety</a>.”)</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>At other times, you may be anxious about the present. For example, when David wrote <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:0-19:55:23" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 55</a>, he was afraid he would be killed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:2-19:55:5" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 55:2-5</a>) Still, he did not let anxiety destroy his confidence in Jehovah. David begged Jehovah to help him with his problems, but he knew that it was also important to do something about his situation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:30-10:15:34" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Samuel 15:30-34</a>) You can learn a lesson from David. Instead of allowing anxiety to overwhelm you, do what you can to solve the problem and trust that Jehovah will care for you.</p>

True friends have also been very helpful to him during difficult times, and he is open and honest with his wife about his feelings. Additionally, fellow elders and the circuit overseer helped him to consider his situation from Jehovah’s viewpoint.

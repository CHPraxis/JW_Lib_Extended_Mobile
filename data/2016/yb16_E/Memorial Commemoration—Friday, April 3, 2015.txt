Memorial Commemoration​—Friday, April 3, 2015




ON Saturday, March 7, 2015, congregations earth wide began a four-week campaign to invite as many people as possible to meet with us to commemorate the death of Jesus Christ and to hear a discourse about how his death benefits us. Millions of invitations were given in person, by telephone, and by mail. What would the response be? How happy Jehovah’s Witnesses were on Friday, April 3, when they welcomed 19,862,783 to this sacred occasion. Now every effort is being made to help all those in attendance to associate actively with Jehovah’s people, to worship the true God, and to enjoy his tender love and rich blessings.​—Mic. 4:2.

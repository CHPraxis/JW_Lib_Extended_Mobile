Fifty Years a Special Pioneer
Alisten Lumare

BORN 1927

BAPTIZED 1962

PROFILE A former police inspector who served as a special pioneer for over 50 years.











IN 1964, I was assigned as a special pioneer to Manokwari, West Papua, where a small congregation faced fierce opposition from the local clergy. Soon after I arrived, a Protestant minister stormed up to my house.
“I am going to destroy this house and rid Manokwari of Jehovah’s Witnesses,” he thundered.
Because of my police training, I was not intimidated by his bluster. Nevertheless, I answered him calmly, and he eventually left in peace.​—1 Pet. 3:15.
Back then Manokwari had eight publishers. Today, some 50 years later, there are seven congregations in the area. More than 1,200 people attended the local convention in 2014. When I see what Jehovah has accomplished in this remote region, I feel truly satisfied at heart.

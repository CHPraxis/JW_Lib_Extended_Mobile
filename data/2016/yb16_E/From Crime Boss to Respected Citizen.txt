ON ONE occasion, Brother Sormin was summoned by the Director of Intelligence at the attorney general’s office.
“You are Indonesian, so be frank with me,” said the official. “What are Jehovah’s Witnesses really doing in Indonesia?”
“Let me tell you my story,” replied Brother Sormin. “I once was the leader of a criminal gang, but now I teach people the Bible. That is what Jehovah’s Witnesses are doing in Indonesia​—taking no-good people like me and turning them into good citizens!”
The Director of Intelligence later declared: “I hear many complaints about Jehovah’s Witnesses. But I know that it is a good religion because it helped Mr. Sormin to change.”

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">IN 2013, our small congregation in Tugala Oyo heard thrilling news​—we would receive a new Kingdom Hall! The local authorities welcomed the project, and 60 of our neighbors signed a petition giving their approval. One neighbor told us, “If you want 200 signatures, you will get them.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Two experienced Kingdom Hall construction volunteers came to supervise the building of the new hall, which was completed in November 2014. We never dreamed that our congregation would ever have such a fine place for worship. Truly, Jehovah surpassed our expectations!</p>

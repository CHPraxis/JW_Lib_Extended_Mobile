<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">IN 1964, I was assigned as a special pioneer to Manokwari, West Papua, where a small congregation faced fierce opposition from the local clergy. Soon after I arrived, a Protestant minister stormed up to my house.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“I am going to destroy this house and rid Manokwari of Jehovah’s Witnesses,” he thundered.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Because of my police training, I was not intimidated by his bluster. Nevertheless, I answered him calmly, and he eventually left in peace.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Back then Manokwari had eight publishers. Today, some 50 years later, there are seven congregations in the area. More than 1,200 people attended the local convention in 2014. When I see what Jehovah has accomplished in this remote region, I feel truly satisfied at heart.</p>

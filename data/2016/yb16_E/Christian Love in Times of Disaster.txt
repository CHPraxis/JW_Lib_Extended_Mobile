Christian Love in Times of Disaster




EARTHQUAKES, tsunamis, and volcanoes often disrupt life in Indonesia. When these disasters strike, Jehovah’s people are quick to help those who are affected, especially their spiritual brothers. For example, in 2005 a massive earthquake leveled Gunungsitoli, the largest town on Nias Island in North Sumatra. Congregations on the neighboring island of Sumatra and the branch office immediately shipped relief supplies to the affected area. The local circuit overseer and a branch office representative flew to the island to encourage and reassure the brothers. “People around us were paralyzed with fear,” says Yuniman Harefa, an elder on Nias. “But the quick response from God’s organization assured us that we were not alone.”

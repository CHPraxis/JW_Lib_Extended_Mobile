<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">ON ONE occasion, Brother Sormin was summoned by the Director of Intelligence at the attorney general’s office.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“You are Indonesian, so be frank with me,” said the official. “What are Jehovah’s Witnesses <em>really </em>doing in Indonesia?”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">“Let me tell you my story,” replied Brother Sormin. “I once was the leader of a criminal gang, but now I teach people the Bible. That is what Jehovah’s Witnesses are doing in Indonesia​—taking no-good people like me and turning them into good citizens!”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The Director of Intelligence later declared: “I hear many complaints about Jehovah’s Witnesses. But I know that it is a good religion because it helped Mr. Sormin to change.”</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:8:3-19:8:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 8:3, 4</a>) Millions of stars move through space in an orderly way. And think of the way the planets in our solar system move around the sun. This amazing order is possible only because Jehovah organized the way the planets and stars move. When we think of how he has “skillfully made the heavens” and the earth, we want to praise him, worship him, and be loyal to him.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:136:1-19:136:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 136:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:136:5-19:136:9" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 5-9</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Scientists have used many of the things they have learned about the universe and our earth to make our lives better. But they have not been able to answer many important questions. For example, astronomers cannot tell us exactly <strong>how </strong>the universe began or <strong>why </strong>humans, animals, and plants exist on earth. And most people cannot explain why humans have a strong desire to live forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:3:11-21:3:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>) One reason why people do not have the answers to these questions is that scientists and others say there is no God and promote evolution. But God gives us the answers in his own Book, the Bible.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah created the many laws of nature. These laws do not change. Electricians, plumbers, engineers, pilots, surgeons, and others rely on these laws to do their work. For example, the human heart is normally located in the same part of the body, so a surgeon knows where to find it in each of his patients. And everyone knows that if a person jumps off a high place, he will fall and could die. We obey the laws of nature, such as gravity, because we want to stay alive.</p>

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What can we learn from the way the Bible was written?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>The Bible is a truly unique gift from God. Some scholars say that the Bible is just a group of Jewish and Christian books put together by humans. But God decided who would write the books, when they would write them, and what they would write. That is why all the books in the Bible help us to understand God’s message. From Genesis to Revelation, the Bible shows <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>that there would be an “offspring” who would make the earth a paradise again. And we have learned that this “offspring” is Christ Jesus and that his Kingdom will prove that Jehovah has the right to rule over everyone.<wbr />—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 3:15;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> <strong>Matthew 6:10;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> <strong>Revelation 11:15</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>The Israelites followed the Law that God gave them and were organized very well. For example, there were “women who were organized to serve at the entrance of the tent of meeting.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:38:8-2:38:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Exodus 38:8</a>) The Israelites also had instructions on how to move their camp and the tabernacle in an orderly way.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>The congregations in the first century were organized too. There was a governing body, that is, a group of men who gave the congregations direction. At first, this group was made up of the apostles. Later, other elders were added to it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:6:1-44:6:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 6:1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:6-44:15:6" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 15:6</a>) Jehovah guided members of the governing body and others who worked closely with them to write letters with counsel and instruction to the congregations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:3:1-54:3:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Timothy 3:1-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:1:5-56:1:9" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Titus 1:5-9</a>) How did the congregations benefit from following the direction of the governing body?</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Members of Branch Committees or Country Committees, circuit overseers, and elders need to obey the direction they receive from God’s organization. In fact, Jehovah’s own Book tells all of us to obey those who are taking the lead.

We would not want to be like Diotrephes, who had no respect for the brothers taking the lead. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/64:1:9-64:1:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>3 John 9, 10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>When we follow the direction we are given, we help to keep peace and unity in the congregation. So we can ask ourselves: <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>‘Do I encourage my brothers and sisters to be loyal to Jehovah? Am I quick to follow the direction I receive from God’s organization?’</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>How are elders and ministerial servants appointed?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Recently, the Governing Body changed how elders and ministerial servants in each congregation are appointed. “<a class="xt" data-xtid="6" href="jwpub://p/E:2014847/1-18">Questions From Readers</a>” in <em>The Watchtower </em>of November 15, 2014, explained that in the first century, the governing body gave traveling overseers the authority to appoint elders and ministerial servants. Thus, since September 2014, circuit overseers have been making these appointments. When the elders of a congregation recommend that a brother serve as an elder or a ministerial servant, the circuit overseer tries to get to know him and his family. For example, he might work with the brother in field service. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:3:4-54:3:5" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Timothy 3:4, 5</a>) Then the circuit overseer and the elders meet.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>The elders give us direction from the Bible because they want to protect and take care of the congregation. We need to cooperate with them because this instruction is for our own benefit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:6:3-54:6:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:3</a>) In the first century, some individuals were being “disorderly.” They were not working at all but were getting involved in things that did not concern them. The elders tried to correct them, but they refused to change. Paul told the congregation how they should treat someone like that. He said: “Keep this one marked and stop associating with him.” They needed to stop socializing with that person but not treat him as an enemy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/53:3:11-53:3:15" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 3:11-15</a>) Elders today also try to help a person who ignores God’s standards, for example, one who dates an unbeliever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:7:39-46:7:39" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>) If the person refuses to change his behavior, the elders may decide to give a talk explaining how such behavior could cause others to speak badly about the congregation. If the elders give such a talk in your congregation, how will you react? If you know who the person is, will you avoid socializing with him? In this way, you may help him realize that his behavior is harmful to himself and displeasing to Jehovah, and he may change his attitude.<span data-enid="1" class="en"><strong><sup>[1]</sup></strong><span class="tt en" data-rel-enid="1"></span></span><wbr />—See endnote.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>God’s Word tells us what all of us should do so that we do not allow wickedness in our congregations. Consider what happened in Corinth. Paul loved the brothers and sisters there. He had helped many of them to learn the truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:1:1-46:1:2" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:1, 2</a>) So imagine how he felt when he found out that one of them was living a sexually immoral life and that the brothers had allowed this person to stay in the congregation! Paul told the elders to “hand such a man over to Satan.” They needed to remove that person from the congregation, that is, to disfellowship him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:5:1-46:5:1" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:5:5-46:5:7" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 5-7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:5:12-46:5:12" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> 12</a>) Today, the elders may decide that someone has to be disfellowshipped because he has sinned seriously and has not repented. In that case, will we treat the disfellowshipped person as the Scriptures direct us to? If we do, we help to keep the congregation clean. And we may help the person to realize that he needs to repent and ask Jehovah to forgive him.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>15. </strong>How can we keep peace in the congregation?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>There was another problem in Corinth. Some were taking their brothers to court.

So they have taken their brothers to court. But when this happens, it may cause people to speak badly about Jehovah and his people. And it may cause trouble in the congregation. God’s own Book helps us to see that we must keep peace with our brothers, even if it means that we lose money.<span data-enid="2" class="en"><strong><sup>[2]</sup></strong><span class="tt en" data-rel-enid="2"></span></span> (See endnote.)

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">WE HIGHLY value the Bible because we know it is God’s own Book. The Bible contains advice that can help us avoid problems, and it can correct us when we make mistakes. So how do we react to its advice? Think of two anointed women in the first century, Euodia and Syntyche. The Bible says that they argued, but it does not tell us why. Let us imagine what might have happened.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Perhaps Euodia invited some brothers and sisters to her home for a meal. But she did not invite Syntyche. Later, when Syntyche heard others saying how much they had enjoyed the meal, she got very upset. She may have thought: ‘I cannot believe that Euodia did not invite me! I thought we were best friends.’ Syntyche felt that Euodia did not really like her and that she was avoiding her. So Syntyche invited the same people for a meal but did <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>not invite Euodia! This situation might even have upset others in the congregation. The Bible shows that Paul corrected the two sisters and encouraged them to make peace. They may have listened to him and continued serving Jehovah happily.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:4:2-50:4:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Philippians 4:2, 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>In our congregations today, sometimes we too may have a problem with a brother or a sister. But if we follow the advice in the Bible, we can solve such problems. In fact, we can even avoid them. And when we obey what the Bible says, we show that we truly value Jehovah’s own Book.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:27:11-19:27:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 27:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>It is not always easy to control our emotions. We may feel very sad or angry if someone says something insulting to us or treats us unfairly, perhaps because of our culture, the color of our skin, or the way we look. And it may hurt us even more if the person insulting or mistreating us is our brother or sister. What advice do we find in God’s Word that can help us?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah knows what can happen when humans do not control their emotions. When we feel upset or angry, we may say or do something that we later regret. In the Bible, Jehovah instructs us to control our temper and tells us: “Do not be quick to take offense.” Just think how many problems we avoid when we obey that advice and do not get upset easily! <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:7:9-21:7:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Ecclesiastes 7:9;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:16:32-20:16:32" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> <strong>Proverbs 16:32</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>The Bible also tells us to forgive others. In fact, Jesus said that if we do not forgive others, Jehovah will not forgive us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:14-40:6:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 6:14, 15</a>) Do you need to be more patient and more willing to forgive others?</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>If we do not control our emotions, we may keep feeling angry and may even start feeling hatred for someone.

Then our brothers and sisters may stay away from us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:26:24-20:26:26" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 26:24-26</a>) The elders will use the Bible to try to help us get rid of anger and hatred and forgive others.

Introduction




Did you know that Jehovah’s Witnesses publish literature that is translated into over 750 languages?
Why do we do that? So that the Bible’s message can reach “every nation and tribe and language and people.”—Revelation 14:6, footnote.
This issue of Awake! provides a behind-the-scenes look at our translation work.

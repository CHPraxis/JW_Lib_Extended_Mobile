<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">JEHOVAH’S servants highly esteem God’s own holy book, the Bible. Being imperfect, we all receive Scriptural counsel at times. How will we respond to it? Consider the first-century Christians Euodia and Syntyche. Serious problems arose between these anointed women. What problems? The Bible does not say. But for the sake of illustration, consider the following possibility.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Suppose Euodia invited some brothers and sisters to her home for a meal and pleasant association. Syntyche was not invited, but she heard about the good time that everyone had. Syntyche may have said: ‘I cannot believe that Euodia did not invite me! I thought we were best friends.’ Feeling betrayed, Syntyche began to look at Euodia with doubt and even suspicion. So Syntyche arranged her own gathering and invited the same brothers and sisters<wbr />—but not Euodia! The problem that existed between Euodia and Syntyche could have disrupted the peace of the whole congregation. The Bible does not tell <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>us the outcome, but these sisters may have responded well to the apostle Paul’s loving counsel.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:4:2-50:4:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Phil. 4:2, 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Similar situations sometimes cause difficulties in congregations of Jehovah’s people today. However, such problems can be solved or even avoided if we apply the counsel found in God’s Word, the Bible. And if we highly esteem Jehovah’s own Book, we will live by its instructions.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:27:11-19:27:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 27:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>It is not easy to control our emotions when we feel that we have been slighted or treated unjustly. It can be devastating if we are mistreated because of our ethnic background, the color of our skin, or some other physical difference. How much greater the pain is if it is caused by a fellow Christian! Does God’s Word provide counsel to help us if we face this ugly side of imperfect human behavior?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jehovah has observed human relations since mankind’s beginning. He takes note of our emotions and actions. Thoughts, including those that are emotionally charged, can lead to words and actions we may later regret. How wise it is to apply the Bible’s counsel to control our temper and avoid being quick to take offense! <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:16:32-20:16:32" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 16:32;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:7:9-21:7:9" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> <strong>Ecclesiastes 7:9</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>No doubt all of us need to work at being less sensitive and more forgiving. Jehovah and Jesus take forgiveness very seriously. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:14-40:6:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 6:14, 15</a>) Do you need to be more forgiving or to give attention to controlling your emotions?</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>Why should we guard against bitterness?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>People who fail to control their emotions often become bitter. As a result, others may not want to be around them. A bitter individual can exert a bad influence in the congregation. He may try to disguise his bitterness or even his hatred, but negative thoughts lurking in his heart “will be exposed in the congregation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:26:24-20:26:26" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 26:24-26</a>) The elders may be able to help such individuals to see that bitterness, hatred, and the harboring of grudges are traits that have no place in God’s organization. Jehovah’s own priceless Book is very clear about this. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:19:17-3:19:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Lev. 19:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:11-45:3:18" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Rom. 3:11-18</a>) Do you agree with it?</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Some may feel that they can interpret the Bible on their own. However, Jesus has appointed the ‘faithful slave’ to be the only channel for dispensing spiritual food. Since 1919, the glorified Jesus Christ has been using that slave to help his followers understand God’s own Book and heed its directives. By obeying the instructions found in the Bible, we promote cleanness, peace, and unity in the congregation.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:97:10-19:97:10" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 97:10</a>) We refuse to join the ungodly and say: “Good is bad and bad is good.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:5:20-23:5:20" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isa. 5:20</a>) Because we want to please God, we strive to remain clean physically, morally, and spiritually.

It is a practice among certain immigrants to send their newborn babies to relatives to be cared for so that the parents can continue working and making money in their new country. Yes, this is a personal decision, but we should bear in mind that God holds us responsible for the decisions we make. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:14:12-45:14:12" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 14:12</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Would it be wise to make important decisions about our family and our livelihood without first consulting the Bible?

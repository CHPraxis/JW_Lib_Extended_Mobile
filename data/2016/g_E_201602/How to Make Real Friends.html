<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Thanks to technology, you can connect with more people<wbr />—and do so more conveniently—<wbr />than at any other time in history. Still, the relationships you have might seem rather shallow. One young man put it this way: “I feel as if my friendships could just fizzle out. On the other hand, my dad has friends he’s been close to for decades!”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Why is it such a challenge these days to enjoy enduring and meaningful friendships?</p>

<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>Technology may be partly to blame. </strong>Texting, social networking, and other social media have made it seem possible to maintain a friendship without being in someone’s presence. Meaningful conversations have been replaced by rapid-fire texts and tweets. “People are having fewer face-to-face interactions,” says the book <em>Artificial Maturity. </em>“Students spend more time in front of a screen and less time with each other.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In some cases, technology can make friendships seem closer than they really are. “Recently,” says 22-year-old Brian,<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> “I realized that by texting my friends to see how they were, I was doing a lot of the work. Then I stopped texting them to see how many of <em>them </em>would take the initiative to contact <em>me. </em>Honestly, it’s been very few. Apparently, some friends weren’t as close as I thought.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">But cannot texting and social media help you keep in touch with people and thereby <em>strengthen </em>your friendships? Yes<wbr />—especially if you also have an <em>offline </em>relationship with those people. Often, however, social media merely builds bridges to others without drawing you any closer to them.</p>

<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>Define real friendship. </strong>The Bible describes a friend as someone who “sticks closer than a brother.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:18:24-20:18:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:24</a>) Is that the kind of friend you want? Is that the kind of friend you <em>are? </em>To help you answer those questions, write down three qualities that you would want a friend to have. Then write down three qualities that <em>you </em>bring to a friendship. Ask yourself: ‘Which of my online contacts display the qualities that I value in a friend? Which qualities would those friends say <em>I </em>bring to the friendship?’<wbr />—<em>Bible principle: </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:2:4-50:2:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><em>Philippians 2:4</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><strong>Establish priorities. </strong>Online friendships are often based on a shared interest, such as a hobby. However, having common <em>values </em>is more important than having similar <em>interests. </em>“I may not have a lot of friends,” says 21-year-old Leanne, “but the ones I do have make me want to be a better person.”<wbr />—<em>Bible principle: </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:13:20-20:13:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><em>Proverbs 13:20</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>Get out and meet people. </strong>There is nothing quite the same as face-to-face conversation, where you and another person can observe the subtle nuances of voice tone, facial expression, and body language.<wbr />—<em>Bible principle: </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:2:17-52:2:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><em>1 Thessalonians 2:17</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn"><strong>Write a letter. </strong>Old-fashioned as it may seem, letter writing sends the message that you care enough about someone to give him or her your <em>undivided attention. </em>That kind of focus is rare in today’s multitasking world. For example, in her book <em>Alone Together, </em>Sherry Turkle writes of one young man who says he cannot remember ever receiving a personal letter in his life. Referring to the time when people wrote letters, he says: “I miss those days even though I wasn’t alive.” Why not make use of this ‘old technology’ to make friends?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>The bottom line: </strong>Real friendship involves more than just keeping in touch. It requires that you <em>and </em>your friend display love, empathy, patience, and forgiveness. Those qualities ultimately make a friendship rewarding. But they are difficult to display when you only talk online.</p>

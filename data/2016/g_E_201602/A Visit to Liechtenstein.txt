LANDS AND PEOPLES
A Visit to Liechtenstein









IT IS one of the smallest countries in the world, situated in the Alps between Switzerland and Austria. Over the centuries Celts, Rhaetians, Romans, and Alemanni have all lived in this region. Today about two thirds of Liechtenstein’s population are descendants of the Alemanni tribe, which settled in this region about 1,500 years ago.
German is the official language of Liechtenstein, although local dialects vary from village to village. Two of Liechtenstein’s typical dishes are Tüarka-Rebel, a specialty made of corn, and Käsknöpfle, a cheesy pasta dish.

Journeying through the country offers visitors views of snow-covered mountains, green valleys, vineyards, and a variety of vegetation. For example, in this alpine microstate can be found nearly 50 types of wild orchids. Liechtenstein also has museums, theaters, and wineries. Thus, in summer and winter alike, tourists come to visit.
Jehovah’s Witnesses have been active in Liechtenstein since the 1920’s. Currently, there are about 90 of them in the country, teaching the Bible’s message to locals and visitors.



The book What Does the Bible Really Teach? is published by Jehovah’s Witnesses in German, the official language of Liechtenstein, and is available online at www.jw.org.

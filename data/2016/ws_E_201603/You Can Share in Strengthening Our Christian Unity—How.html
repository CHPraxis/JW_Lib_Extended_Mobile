<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb">JEHOVAH and Jesus have been united from the very beginning of creation. Jehovah created Jesus before all other things. Then, Jesus worked with him and “was beside him as a master worker.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:8:30-20:8:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:30</a>) Jehovah’s servants also cooperated with one another in the work that they had to do. For example, Noah and his family built the ark together. Later, the Israelites worked together to build the tabernacle, to take it apart, and to move it from one place to another. At the temple, they sang and played musical instruments together to praise Jehovah with beautiful music. Jehovah’s people were able to do all these things because they cooperated with one another.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:14-1:6:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 6:14-16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:22-1:6:22" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:4:4-4:4:32" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Numbers 4:4-32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:25:1-13:25:8" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 1 Chronicles 25:1-8</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>In the first century, the apostle John had a vision of seven angels who were blowing trumpets. When the fifth angel blew his trumpet, John saw “a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth.” That “star” used a key to open the door to a deep, dark pit. First, thick smoke came out of the pit, and then a swarm of locusts flew out of the smoke. Instead of harming the trees or plants, these locusts attacked those who did “not have the seal of God on their foreheads.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:9:1-66:9:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 9:1-4</a>) John knew that a swarm of locusts can cause a lot of damage; they had done so in Egypt in the time of Moses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:10:12-2:10:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 10:12-15</a>) The locusts that John saw represent anointed Christians who have been preaching a powerful message against false religion. And millions of others who look forward to life on earth have joined them. Together, they are united in this preaching work. This work has helped many people to leave false religion and to be free from Satan’s control.</p>

We also offer them publications about the Bible. In fact, we have given out millions of these publications around the world. Sometimes we are asked to take part in special preaching campaigns.

They work hard to help the elders, and we are grateful for all that they do. For example, ministerial servants make sure that we have enough publications to use in the ministry, and they welcome visitors who come to our meetings. They also work hard to repair the Kingdom Hall and keep it clean. When we cooperate with these brothers, we are united and serve Jehovah in an organized way.<wbr />—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:6:3-44:6:6" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 6:3-6</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:6:14-47:6:14" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>) Yet, there are brothers and sisters who are married to someone who is not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Some learned the truth after they were married, and their mate did not become a Witness. Others may have married a servant of Jehovah, but then their husband or wife left the congregation. In these situations, Christians do all they can to keep their marriage strong by obeying counsel from the Bible. This may not always be easy. For example, Mary and her husband, David, served Jehovah together. Then, David stopped going to meetings. But Mary still tried to be a good wife and show Christian qualities. She also taught her six children about Jehovah and continued to go to meetings and conventions. Years later, when the children grew up and all left home, Mary continued to serve Jehovah even though it was much harder for her. But then, David began reading the magazines that Mary left out for him. In time, he started to go to some meetings again. His six-year-old grandson always saved a seat for him, and if David did not come, the boy would say, “I missed you at the meeting today, Grandpa.” David returned to Jehovah after 25 years, and he and his wife are happy that they now serve Jehovah together again.</p>

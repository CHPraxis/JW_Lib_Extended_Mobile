TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | ESTHER 1-5
Esther Stood Up for God’s People



Esther showed remarkable faith and courage when defending God’s people

  Appearing before the king unsummoned could have meant death. Esther had not been invited by the king in 30 days

  King Ahasuerus, who is thought to be Xerxes I, had a violent temper. Once, he ordered a man to be cut in half and displayed as a warning to others. He also removed Vashti as queen when she disobeyed him

  Esther had to reveal that she was a Jewess and convince the king that he had been tricked by his trusted adviser

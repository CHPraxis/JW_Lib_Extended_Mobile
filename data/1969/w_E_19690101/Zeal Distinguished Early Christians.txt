Zeal Distinguished Early Christians
● In the book 20 Centuries of Christianity the writers comment on the early Christians and Rome’s attitude toward them: “If Rome was willing to make an exception in the case of the Jews why was it not willing likewise to exempt Christians from spilling incense on the altars of the divine emperors? The Christians raised the problem of tolerance in a form more exasperating than the Jews ever had. The Jews were a sort of closed corporation and did no active proselyting. The Christians on the other hand were ceaseless proselyters. They were avowedly out to make Christians of the entire population.” Jehovah’s Christian witnesses today, too, put forth earnest effort to help all honest-hearted ones to learn and practice the principles of true Christian worship.

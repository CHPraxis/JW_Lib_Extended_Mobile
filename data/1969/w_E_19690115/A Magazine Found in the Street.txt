A Magazine Found in the Street
One day, in Mexico, a lady picked up a copy of The Watchtower that she found lying in the street. She began reading it, and what she read aroused her interest so much that she was moved to go to an Evangelical Temple to ask if this was the place where The Watchtower was distributed. They told her that it was not, but they mentioned that they thought it was distributed on a certain street. For two days this interested lady hunted up and down this street, asking everyone she met.
Locating the meeting place of Jehovah’s witnesses, she waited on Sunday from 11 a.m. till the meeting time came. When the meeting began she was in the audience, enjoying very much the method of Bible study carried on. Arrangements were made for her to be given personal instruction by means of a Bible study. Soon what she was learning began to move her to make changes. After learning that Jehovah God is invisible and that making images of him is really impossible, she removed the images from her home. She regularly came to the meetings prepared to participate by commenting in the Watchtower study. She legalized her marriage and stirred up her husband’s interest in God’s purposes. She told her relatives about God’s truth, and some of them came to the meetings. All this because a lover of God’s truth picked up The Watchtower lying in the street.

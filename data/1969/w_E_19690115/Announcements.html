It has become an old and trusted friend to hundreds of thousands. For almost ninety years it has guided young and old alike to happiness and security. And most beneficial of all, it has brought its readers, through God’s Word, into closer relationship with our Creator, whose wisdom and counsel never fails.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>FIELD MINISTRY</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Time really means life. And Christians value their lives. So they want to walk wisely, buying out the time for serving God during these wicked days. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:15-49:5:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 5:15, 16</a>) By observing world events, they know that the end of this system of things rapidly approaches. Hence now they have an opportunity never to be afforded again. How, then, can one buy out time to do God’s will? By taking advantage of Christian privileges at the expense of other things. Jehovah’s witnesses do that by making time in their busy schedules to direct others to God’s kingdom, that they might walk wisely in these wicked days. During January these Christian witnesses will be offering to interested persons this Bible magazine, which announces Jehovah’s kingdom. A year’s subscription for <em>The Watchtower, </em>along with three Bible booklets, will be offered for $1.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">True worship has never been popular. The Bible shows that the true followers of the Lord Jesus Christ would be hated by all nations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:9-40:24:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:9</a>) Hence faithful Christians need to answer the challenge to true worship raised by the forces of nationalism. The early Christians answered the challenge by preaching despite opposition; they said: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:29-44:5:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>) Jehovah’s witnesses answer the challenge to true worship in the same manner: They steadfastly preach the good news of God’s kingdom, obeying God as ruler. To announce Jehovah’s kingdom during March, these Christian witnesses will be offering this fine Bible-study aid, <em>The Watchtower, </em>on a subscription basis, for a year for just $1.</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
True worship has never been popular. The Bible shows that the true followers of the Lord Jesus Christ would be hated by all nations. (Matt. 24:9) Hence faithful Christians need to answer the challenge to true worship raised by the forces of nationalism. The early Christians answered the challenge by preaching despite opposition; they said: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.” (Acts 5:29) Jehovah’s witnesses answer the challenge to true worship in the same manner: They steadfastly preach the good news of God’s kingdom, obeying God as ruler. To announce Jehovah’s kingdom during March, these Christian witnesses will be offering this fine Bible-study aid, The Watchtower, on a subscription basis, for a year for just $1.
WHY BE DISCOURAGED?
The current religious unrest and the disappointments that many churchgoers have experienced recently in doctrine and church policy have not adversely affected the circulation of The Watchtower and Awake! Rather, these magazines are constantly growing in popularity. Last year each magazine added a half million copies to its regular circulation of each issue. Millions of additional copies of special issues were distributed. Ensure your own regular participation in the wealth of upbuilding and encouraging material they contain. Subscribe now and receive free six timely booklets on vital Bible subjects. One year, for both magazines, only $2.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It was the Lord Jesus Christ who put it into the hearts of his followers to expand, to spread world wide the teachings that he had heard from God. So the disciples of Jesus went out beyond the Jewish realm, and there was wonderful expansion, the good news being preached “in all creation that is under heaven.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:23-51:1:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Col. 1:23</a>) Today the good news of God’s kingdom is going to all corners of the earth, and Jehovah’s witnesses feel great urgency because of Jesus’ words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>. They know this is the time to watch oneself and one’s teaching. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:16-54:4:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:16</a>) They fully realize that they will not save themselves by being interested only in themselves; so they work in the interest of others, preaching and teaching them God’s truths. As they accomplish their ministry during September, they will be offering the book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, </em>for only 25c.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>DOES TRUTH ‘PAY OFF’?</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Truth and integrity are almost forgotten virtues. So much so, in fact, that many persons are beginning to wonder if they are practical in our modern society. It is just another reason why many discredit the Bible, like the proverb that says: “It is the lip of truth that will be firmly established forever, but the tongue of falsehood will be only as long as a moment.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:19-20:12:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 12:19</a>) How is that so today, they say, when just the opposite seems to result? But the Bible also says: “Do not be misled: God is not one to be mocked. For whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gal. 6:7</a>) What is the truth? What does it mean to you? Read the 192-page hardbound book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life</em>. Send today. It is only 25c.</p>

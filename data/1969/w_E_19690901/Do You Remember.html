<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have you read the recent issues of <em>The Watchtower </em>carefully? If so, you should recognize these important points.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>● What did Paul mean when he wrote, at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:8-46:13:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 13:8</strong></a><strong>, that ‘knowledge will be done away with’?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">He spoke of supernatural knowledge that was a miraculous gift of the holy spirit. It is not knowledge that is obtainable through experience, observation or study of books, even the Bible.—P. 287.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>● Who is the “god of fortresses” to whom the “king of the north” gives glory as spoken of at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:38-27:11:38" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Daniel 11:38</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It is modern, scientific militarism.—P. 306.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>● Why is the Bible a book that gives hope?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Because it is the word of One who cannot lie, and the things that he has promised have come to pass exactly on time. This gives us strong assurance that he will fulfill the rest of his promises and prophecies.—Pp. 358, 359.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>● When did the “oppressive wolves” that Paul warned about at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:29-44:20:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 20:29</strong></a> <strong>begin to enter the Christian flock of God?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Shortly after the death of the apostles, the last of whom died around the year 100 C.E.—P. 404.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>● The Christian who has oversight of other Christians needs to guard against what attitude?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">He needs to guard against becoming hard and abrupt with his fellow Christians; not driving them or expecting as much of them as he does of himself in his quest for efficiency.—P. 411.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>● Why can having less of this world’s goods be a blessing?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">It usually allows more of a Christian’s time, energy and thoughts to be occupied with Kingdom interests.—P. 430.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>● What sacrifices is God interested in today?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The Christian’s sacrifice of praise; also his entire dedicated life course.—P. 432.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>● Why do Christians need to guard against drunkenness?</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Because it brings Jehovah’s disapproval and leads to debauchery and death.—P. 505.</p>

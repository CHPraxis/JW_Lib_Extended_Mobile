No Evidence Against Special Creation
● It is significant that the Encyclopædia Britannica, a staunch upholder of the evolution theory, should observe: “There is, however, nothing in the study of living forms alone definitely to exclude the possibility that (as indicated by a strict interpretation of the Book of Genesis) we are part of a special, direct creation, and that, although modification of the animals thus created may occur, these modifications have been only of a minor nature, not meriting the designation of a major evolutionary process.”—1965 Edition, Volume 17, page 108.

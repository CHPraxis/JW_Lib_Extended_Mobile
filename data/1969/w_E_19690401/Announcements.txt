FIELD MINISTRY
Some nineteen hundred years ago Jesus Christ foresaw the greatest preaching work in all history. He foretold that his true followers would preach the good news of God’s kingdom “in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.” (Matt. 24:14) In 200 lands around the earth, and in 165 languages, Jehovah’s witnesses are giving this witness about the established kingdom of God. What a prophet Jesus was to foresee such earth-wide preaching! Jesus’ prophecy is really an invitation to enter the work of giving a witness worthy of the Kingdom. Will you respond? To help interested persons do so, Jehovah’s witnesses during the month of April will be offering them a year’s subscription for the magazine that announces Jehovah’s kingdom, The Watchtower, with three booklets, for just $1.
IS THERE NO “CHRISTIAN MIND?”
There are more than nine hundred million professed Christians in the world today. Why, then, would one writer lament that “there is no longer a Christian mind”? Sparing neither laity nor clergy, he states: “The idea that because a man is learned, especially in subjects pertaining to religion, he is therefore secure from the seductions of worldliness is a fallacy.” Few persons would deny this, especially when they learn so little from the clergy that equips them to know or understand the mind of Christ. Are you protecting yourself from this “secular drift”? Review your mind. Secure it firmly in God’s Word. Follow Christ’s example and “read the Holy Bible daily.” Obtain the fine complete New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. It is in modern English, and only $1. Send today.

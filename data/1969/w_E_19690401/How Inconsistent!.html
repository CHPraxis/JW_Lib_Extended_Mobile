<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The theory of evolution as taught today is based on the belief that small mutations, changes in the genetic material of organisms, built the entire world of living creatures, starting from elementary molecules in some primeval slime or ‘soup.’ Yet, <em>Science News </em>of September 21, 1968, reports this observation of a leading geneticist from the twelfth International Congress of Genetics in Tokyo, attended by 2,000 scientists from 53 nations: “The task of chief importance in the genetics of future mankind is the protection of human heredity from natural, chemical and radiation mutations.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But if mutations have really built all the marvelously complex and awe-inspiring living things on earth, then why not work to stimulate more mutations instead of seeking protection from them? Because the truth of the matter is that mutations are degenerative in nature, not evolutionary. And yet, mutations are held to be the chief agency of evolution, the cornerstone of the modern theory. How appropriate the words of the psalmist who stated: “The senseless one has said in his heart: ‘There is no Jehovah.’”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:14:1-19:14:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 14:1</a>.</p>

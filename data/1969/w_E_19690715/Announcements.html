<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">True happiness comes, not from the mere possession of material things, but rather from the worship of the true God Jehovah. Jehovah is “the happy God,” and happy are those who worship him! Said the inspired psalmist: “Happy is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he has chosen as his inheritance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:11-54:1:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:12-19:33:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 33:12</a>) Happy people like to share their happiness with others. And this is especially true with Jehovah’s people! Since the basis for happiness is spirituality, Jehovah’s witnesses will be sharing spiritual good things with their neighbors during July by offering them the fine Bible-study aid <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, </em>for only 25c.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jesus opened a new way of life to the people of his day. This made his work and teaching highly controversial—so much so, in fact, that most of them failed to respond, or actually opposed him. The Bible record reveals, though, that there were many who “heard him gladly.” These were the ones who really listened to what he had to say and who accepted it with honest hearts. Today we must be just as discerning. Do not be misled by some teaching simply because it is “popular.” Read the two books <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life </em>and <em>“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.” </em>Learn from your own Bible how the truth can change your life. Both books, only 75c.</p>

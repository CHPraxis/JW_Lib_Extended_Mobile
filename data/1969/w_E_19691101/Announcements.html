<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Would you be willing to sacrifice something that is precious to you in behalf of a friend? Likely you would. But what about those who are strangers? One of the most precious assets, time, is being sacrificed by over one million of Jehovah’s witnesses largely in behalf of those they have not previously known. They delight to do this, for it enables them to offer public declaration to God and his name, bringing praise to Him and blessings to those who listen to the Bible’s comforting message. During November they will not only spend time offering the Bible-study-aid book, <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, </em>on a contribution of 25c, but they will also conduct a free home Bible study with anyone who desires to learn about God and his provisions for salvation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>FOR A NEW UNDERSTANDING</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Psalms say of the Bible: “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:105-19:119:105" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105</a>) Do you know enough about the Bible for it to serve you in this way? You can. You should. Because the apostle Paul wrote to a young Christian: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17</a>) Now, with the book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, </em>you can open your Bible with a new understanding. This book of 192 pages takes you in logical order through the basic teachings of the Bible and gives you a real hope for the future. Get your copy at once. Send only 25c.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What would you do if you knew that your friends, loved ones and neighbors were in danger of losing their lives? You would warn them, would you not? This is what Jehovah’s witnesses are now doing in helping people to see what the Bible says about the impending destruction of this system of things and how they can enjoy God’s protection during that time. Jehovah’s witnesses are happy to assist lovers of truth by means of a free home Bible study. Throughout December they will also be offering to interested persons a copy of the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>along with a copy of the 192-page book <em>Is the Bible Really the Word of God?, </em>for $1.25.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Expansion! is the keynote of the report of results of the preaching work of Jehovah’s witnesses for the past service year. With an all-time high in number of ministers active in the field, it is significant also that meeting attendance is also increasing. While Christendom’s churches are reporting declines—in one country, “only eight out of every 100 baptized persons worship on Easter”—note the contrast: during April, with 1,322,000 reporting ministerial activity, over 2,719,000 attended the celebration of the Memorial of Jesus’ death and resurrection! Read the full account of the worldwide expansion and preaching to Jehovah’s praise in the <em>1970 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses</em>. Only 50c. Send also for the beautiful 1970 calendar.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In Papua, an international assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses was held late in October. Unable to obtain adequate facilities, the Witnesses built their own town for use during the assembly. 1,116 persons gathered from many tribes and thirty-one nations. In a country noted for tribal massacres, this peaceful assembly provided a fine example of how God’s Word changes the lives of those who heed it.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">During October the “Peace on Earth” International Assembly convened in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Australia, in addition to Papua, with a combined peak attendance of 120,403 to hear the Bible’s message of peace. At these assemblies, it was heartwarming to see 5,573 persons get baptized in symbol of their dedication to do the will of Jehovah God.</p>

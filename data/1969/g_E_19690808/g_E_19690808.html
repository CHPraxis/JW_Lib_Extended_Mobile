<p><span class="font28">W</span><span class="font22">HAT is a successful marriage? It is one in which there is peace, joy, contentment, understanding and affection. It is one in which each mate is largely able to meet the basic needs of the other and is truly concerned about doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Marriage, according to God’s Word, is monogamy, one man for one woman: “The two will be one flesh.” (Matt. 19:5) Concerning it, Dr. Popenoe, one of America’s leading marriage counselors, once said: &quot;Monogamy is so well adapted to human nature ... that it doesn’t require supermen and superwomen to succeed. Success can be obtained by almost anyone.” He also noted: “A successful marriage is a growing thing, nurtured by the give and take that continually goes on between two people who love each other and who are moved by that love to want to live together for the rest of their lives.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">In a similar vein Dr. David Mace, Chairman of the International Commission on Marriage Guidance, writes: “Marriage is, after all, the basic adult human relationship. At its best it brings together, reconciles, and unites in fruitful harmony the two different kinds of human being, male and female ... It knits two people together in an enduring comradeship.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">And the very possibilities of happiness in marriage testify to man’s having been created by God, even as lawyer Linton notes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&quot;The kindness and the infinite skill of the God who declared it was not good for a man to be a bachelor, in putting into man’s heart the love of woman and in woman’s heart the love of man, In making them mentally, physically and emotionally so alike as to be companionable and yet so unlike as to supplement and be intriguing to each other, has always stirred my gratitude and my admiration as an unequivocal evidence of creative design.” </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">—A Lawyer Examines the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Here we have three learned men, obviously speaking from much experience and observation, highly praising the marital relationship. From their testimony it would appear that success in marriage is within the reach of most persons. Yet, what do we find?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Polls show that some United States cities have one divorce for every two marriages, the national average being one out of four ending in divorce. Then again, statistics show that,some two million married couples are living apart because of not being able to get along with each other, although not divorced. Certainly all such marriages have not been successful. From other United States polls it appears that less than one-half of marriages can be considered successful. And one woman’s magazine recently stated: “Most marriages are chronic complaint societies.” </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Ladies<sup>1</sup>' Home Journal,</span><span class="font22"> October 1968.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Why should these things be? No doubt one reason is that problems arise due to human imperfection and selfishness. One veteran marriage counselor put it this way: “We have never encountered or even heard of a problem-free marriage.” It takes maturity and, in particular, unselfishness to deal with the problems that arise in marriage. According to psychiatrist Dr. Brill, the biggest factor in divorce is not liquor, not money, not in-laws, and so forth, but immaturity at the time of marriage. Immature persons view a marriage license as a guarantee of wedded bliss; but it merely gives one the legal right to work at it.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Dealing with Problems</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Among the basic keys that will help couples to cope with the problems of marriage is honesty in dealing with each other. Aptly making this point is educator F, Alexander Magoun: “It takes effort to make a success of marriage. All success comes at a price. The more worthwhile the achievement, the more one usually has to pay for it in effort.” Speaking from long observation, Dr. Paul Popenoe notes: “If each partner truly wants to come to a better understanding of the other, and isn’t just interested in proving he or she is right, the situation isn’t hopeless . . . What is necessary is that each respects the other one’s feelings, likes and dislikes.”</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19690808_files/g_E_19690808-3.png" alt="" style="width:156pt;height:113pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font22">Modern conditions have made it more difficult than ever for couples to be honest with each other. Many are the temptations to cheat in the matter of sex interest, in money matters and in how one uses one’s time. Dishonesty has a way of catching up with one and can well result in making the marriage a failure instead of a success. Well does God’s Word remind us: “There is nothing covered over that will not become uncovered, and secret that will not become known.” “God is not one to be mocked. For \yhatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.” Jesus’ words might therefore fittingly be paraphrased: ‘Also, just as you want your mate to do to you, do the same way to your mate.’—Matt. 10: 26; Gal. 6:7; Luke 6:31.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Unselfishness a Necessity</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">If honesty might be said to be the foundation for a successful marriage, unselfishness might be said to be the building itself, the superstructure. The lives of marriage partners are just too closely knitted or bound to each other for selfishness to succeed—except temporarily, Magoun exposes this folly: “The idea that it is possible to get more and more for one’s self merely by taking it from someone else has been a form of psychological stupidity and emotional illness with the human race ever since the days of Cain and Abel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Selfishness is bound to be self-defeating because it goes against God’s principles. But unselfishness is bound to be rewarding, even as God’s Word shows: “Practice giving, and people will give to you. They will pour into your laps a fine measure, pressed down, shaken together and overflowing. For with the measure that you are measuring out, they will measure out to you in return.” We cannot escape it. Like begets like. Generosity begets generosity. “The generous soul will itself be made fat, and the one freely watering others will himself also be freely watered.” How much good counsel along this line is found in God’s Word! And all of it applies with peculiar force to those in the marital relationship because of the intimacy that goes with it.—Luke 6:38; Prov. 11:25.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19690808_files/g_E_19690808-4.png" alt="" style="width:155pt;height:108pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font22">Thus the apostle Paul makes the same point in his counsel to husbands: “Husbands, continue loving your wives, just as the Christ also loved the congregation and delivered up himself for it . . . husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself, for no man ever hated his own flesh; but he feeds and cherishes it.”—Eph. 5:25-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Inherent in all such counsel is that, for marriage to succeed, more than justice is required. It cannot be governed by a fiftyfifty arrangement. Each must be willing to go more than halfway whenever the situation calls for it, even as the inspired apostle counsels when he intimates that husbands should be willing to lay down their lives for their wives, following the example of Jesus. That is going </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font22"> the way!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">And what about wives? They show their unselfishness by heeding the counsel of the apostle Peter: ‘Wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; be chaste in your conduct, with deep respect; let your adornment be that of the heart clothed with a mild and quiet disposition.’—1 Pet. 3:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Discerningly, author Klemer notes: “Successful marriages are those in which the self-needs of each partner continue to be subordinated to the self-needs of the other. .. . The real excitement in marriage comes from your own joyful anticipation of the pleasure your partner will get from what you have to give—sexually, emotionally, spiritually. In putting your own needs aside to meet the other’s there is satisfaction and there is love.” All of which might be said to underscore the words of Jesus Christ: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” Those words apply not only on the congregational level but also in the family.—Acts 20:35.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>How Unselfishness Works</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Showing unselfishness is, by and large, a matter of being considerate in little things, and it can be quite rewarding. Thus a group of travelers paused at the edge of Bryce Canyon in southern Utah. It was well along in the afternoon and the husband was concerned about getting to their destination at Zion National Park before it was too late. The wife, however, wanted to do a little exploring. When her husband noticed that this seemed to mean quite a lot to her, he yielded and so joined her and the others as they went down a trail. Before long they came upon one of the most beautiful sights they saw on their entire seven-thousand-mile trip. The late afternoon sun reflected its glory on the fantastically shaped, brightly colored peaks, presenting a sight almost unbelievably beautiful. How glad the husband was that he had not missed it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Another true-life example is furnished by a ministerial couple living in the heart of a large city. The wife saw several good reasons why an auto would be of practical value. While the husband felt they had been getting along quite well without an auto, out of consideration for his wife they bought a car. After they began using it the husband proved to be even more enthusiastic about its advantages than his wife. He found that it saved them much time, enabling them to accomplish more in their ministry. Besides, with the car they were able to be of help to others who did not have one. And at the same time it gave them a sense of security, as they were far less likely to be mugged or robbed when driving than when walking along the dark streets of the bad neighborhood that was the scene of their ministerial labors. Not, however, that the wish of a wife to have an auto is always judicious. A wife may fail to consider all the expense that the upkeep of an auto involves—taxes, license, insurance, repairs, gasoline and oil, not to say anything of work in the way of washing it, polishing it, changing tires, and so forth. Such factors often cause a husband to hesitate when it comes to buying an auto, and rightly so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Of course, wives should not conclude from these incidents that every time they have a preference their husbands should yield. On the contrary, they should be realistic and appreciate the fact that by unselfishly yielding at times to the preference of their husbands they themselves may well be similarly rewarded. Yes, a word of caution is in order, lest sentimental husbands let strong-willed wives dominate them. It seems to be a feminine foible at times, especially on the part of wives who are childless, to put their own luxuries ahead of their husband’s necessities. Logic should be mixed with sentiment, but not replaced entirely by it. Knowing when to be firm and when to be kind and yielding is an art!</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Unselfishness in Health Matters</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Husbands and wives also have an obligation toward each other in the matter of health. A devoted and conscientious husband may well kill himself with overwork if he has a wife who is ambitious or even just thoughtlessly selfish. Better it is for her to content herself with fewer material things and a healthy living husband, than to have an abundance to enjoy as a widow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Concern for her family’s health should also make the wife interested in seeing that her family gets a balanced diet, sufficient vitamins, minerals, and so forth. What follows when a wife does measure up in this regard the following true-life experience illustrates. The doctor recommended that the husband eat plenty of rolled oats, but the husband simply did not like oatmeal porridge. So what did his wife do? Give up, saying, “What’s the use!’’? No, but she used feminine ingenuity, She made oatmeal cookies with raisins, and so forth, of which he was very fond. When making Salisbury steak she used rolled oats instead of bread crumbs, and when making thickening for vegetables, she used oatmeal instead of white flour. This was but one of the ways in which she has unselfishly cared for her husband’s health. With what result? Her husband, though upward of sixty years of age, is still in excellent health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">From this experience it also is seen that unselfishness must be practical. Most good cooks like to feed their husbands plenty of rich foods, but is this always wise? Says one doctor: “Every man is in mortal danger whose wife considers herself a good cook. These good cooks equate health with obesity. In their eyes if you’re not fat you’re not healthy. . . . Early in marriage most men must learn to resist the mad desire of every woman to fatten up her husband.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Another area for unselfish concern in the matter of health is sleep. At times a wife or a husband may complain about not being able to sleep well at night. Often the other mate sleeps well. But should not the failure of the one to sleep well give genuine concern to the other? Both need to be alert to the problem and work at solving it. Recently </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font22"> carried an article giving suggestions for those faced with this problem. One couple found that giving each other a massage from head to toes helped solve the problem for the one troubled with sleeplessness. Both worked at it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">But at times the remedy may not be so simple. If the suffering one is a childless wife, the cause may well be psychosomatic. Couples who, voluntarily or due to a circumstance beyond their control, are childless must compensate for this. Usually the husband has little difficulty since the paternal instinct is not a specially strong one. But the wife may well need more affection, solicitude, attention and more of her husband’s presence if she is to thrive in spite of being denied fruition of her maternal instincts. The words of the apostle Peter are appropriate here: “You husbands, continue dwelling in like manner with [your wives] according to knowledge, assigning them honor as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one, since you are also heirs with them of the undeserved favor of life, in order for your prayers not to be hindered. Finally, all of you be likeminded, showing fellow feeling, exercising brotherly love, tenderly affectionate, humble in mind.”—1 Pet. 3:7, 8.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Rewarding Selflessness</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">In marriage each one must be alert to compensate for the weak points of the other. Yes, here too the apostle’s words apply: “We, though, who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those not strong, and not to be pleasing ourselves. Let each of us please his neighbor in what is good for his upbuilding.” (Rom. 15:1, 2) To the extent that the one errs, the other may have to be the more freely forgiving. Is one’s mate prone to be a little more selfish? Then for the sake of peace and harmony one must learn to be more unselfish, at the same time tactfully endeavoring to show the other “a surpassing way,” that of unselfish love.—1 Cor. 12:31-13:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">On the other hand, is the wife extremely dutiful, conscientious, unselfish, a model calling to mind the ideal wife described at Proverbs 31:10-31? Then it may well be that she may neglect her own health if not also her appearance and her spiritual needs. A loving husband will not be content to let her continue in this course just because it is to his advantage. Rather, he will show loving concern by sharing her burdens and seeing to it that she gets the needed rest, that she presents an appearance that is complimentary to him and that her spiritual needs are properly met. The same principle applies, of course, if the husband is letting himself be overburdened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">A good wife of a Christian minister is also keenly interested in his discourses and shows this both by not interfering with his preparing of discourses and by giving good attention when he delivers them. But the husband should be just as interested in his wife’s more humble efforts, ready to give helpful suggestions and needed encouragement. After all, each receives joy when the other does well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">No question about it, unselfishness is an important key to successful marriage. As one marriage counselor put it: “A successful marriage is not a gift; it’s an achievement.” Those who view marriage selfishly, concerned only with what they can get out of it, will most likely be doomed to frustration and failure. But those who </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font22"> into marriage with the idea of contributing to another’s happiness and well-being, as well as benefiting themselves therefrom, may well be rewarded with success, for we cannot escape it: “There IS more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”—Acts 20:35.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>’AGAINST ACCIDENTS</span></h6>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font22">44TJAUL was in his ninth week when it</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">_L happened. I had put him down on our bed when I remembered </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">something I</span><span class="font22"> had to do in the kitchen. No sooner had I reached there, when I heard a thud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“I was struck with fear until his screams seconds later told me that he was alive. When I reached the bedroom, there he was on the floor. He had rolled over to the edge of the bed and fallen off—something I never dreamed he could do on that big double bed. And he was only two months old!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“As I examined him, I was relieved to find no bones broken. Except for a small lump that developed on the side of his head, he was quite normal a short time later. Nevertheless, I put in a call to the doctor and was told he would probably be all right but should be watched for any signs of internal injuries. The next few days, I might add, were the longest of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“Fortunately, Paul had no lasting ill effects from the fall. But I still shudder to think how tragically it could have ended, And it had all happened so fast! I had left him for less than a minute. Now I realize that this is all it takes for a serious accident to happen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">This experience is only one of many that affect millions of children daily and kill more than 10,000 every year in the United States alone. In fact, more children die from accidents than from cancer, pneumonia and congenita] malformation combined. Yet, child-safety experts estimate that as many as nine out of ten accidents to children could be prevented.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>When and Wkff Accidents Occur</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Accidents do not just happen. Each one is caused by something. They can occur anywhere and anytime. When someone has been careless, an accident can happen. The question is; What can be done to avert most of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">It is helpful to know that many accidents to children occur between the hours of 4 and 8 p.m. during the week. Then mothers are usually busy preparing meals and distracted with other duties. So children may not be as closely supervised as at other times. On the weekends, the early morning hours are danger periods. Many parents sleep later on those days and the children may be free to explore and get into trouble. Parents who are aware of these trends can arrange to channel their children’s energies into constructive activities at such times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Another aid is knowing why most accidents occur. Many wonder why some children avoid them and others are repeatedly affected by them. It has been found that the accident-prone child is usually overactive, restless, impulsive and insecure. The nonaccident child is generally more timid, submissive and usually comes from a more closely united family group. It also seems that “simple” everyday events and troubles trigger most accidents: a minor illness of a family member; an overtired, anxious or distracted parent; a worried, tense or very hungry youngster. These and other incidents set the stage for many accidents.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Hazards to Infants</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">During infancy, the child is in the home most of the time, so naturally that is where accidents will occur to him. Later, as he ventures out of doors, new hazards confront him. There will be streets, cars, traffic and school. Parents who can anticipate these new dangers as the child develops will be more equipped to counteract them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">First, though, let us concentrate on what can be done to protect infants in particular, since they are completely dependent on adults.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">FALLS: Millions of young children are injured yearly by falls in and around the house. From the experience related above, you can appreciate how necessary it is to make sure an infant is never left unattended on any high place from which he could fall. Falls from adult beds account for a high percentage of serious injuries to infants, with boys being more susceptible than girls. Even cribs, although regarded as the safest place for babies, can contain hidden hazards. Does yours? Are the sides always up so that the baby cannot fall out? Are the bars to the crib rubberized to avoid head injuries, and are they spaced so that his head cannot become wedged in?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">BURNS AND DROWNINGS: Mothers first test the temperature of the baby’s bath before bathing him, and his milk before feeding him. They realize the danger of anything being too hot externally or internally. Yet some mothers, while avoiding burning their babies, expose them to drowning. Many babies are left unattended in the tub, and at an early age. There would seem to be no valid reason for leaving a baby unattended in water, even for a minute. As one mother said; “No phone call is important enough for me to leave the baby for an instant in the tub or any unsafe place. If it’s really important, they’ll call back.” To avoid any such incidents, many mothers carry their babies with them whenever they have to answer the phone or doorbell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">SUFFOCATION AND SWALLOWING FOREIGN OBJECTS: Care should be taken to avoid the baby’s being suffocated in the crib by bedclothes, plastic bags or pillows. Also, one of the first and primary functions of a baby—that of swallowing —could be dangerous. Tiny objects such as pins, beads, buttons and sharp instruments should always be kept out of the baby’s reach. No rattle or other toy should ever be smaller than his mouth. Once a baby gets his little hands on something, the next thing he will do is suck it and then swallow it if he can. Have you not put your finger toward an infant only to have him firmly grasp it and promptly draw it toward his mouth? Now, just imagine your finger being some harmful object. For good reason have infants been referred to as “human vacuum cleaners”!</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Hazards to Toddlers</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">By the time a child is about two years old, he will have reached the explorative age. He is no longer confined solely to his crib and playpen. Now he pokes his little nose into other areas of the house, and he has to be watched even more carefully than before.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19690808_files/g_E_19690808-6.png" alt="" style="width:143pt;height:201pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font22">Of course, he is still subject to bums and falls, but from different aspects. Now he can reach above his head and pull hot things down on himself. Or with the newfound springs in his little legs, he may be able to climb up on chairs and other furniture to lean out windows or inspect cupboards, medicine chests, closets, and a host of other things. Harmful products have to be stored and locked away from his prying eyes and hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Little delicate knickknacks, sprinkled throughout the house for decoration, now have to be reappraised as potential dangers and some removed for his safety. He is now at an awkward age—no longer helpless and completely dependent on you, nor old enough for you to really reason with him. Yes, this is the stage when you must keep a step ahead of him for his safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Now that he is able to follow you around from room to room, the kitchen becomes more dangerous than the bedroom. He may be sitting on the floor in the kitchen, innocently playing with pots and pans and yet be surrounded by danger. A two-year-old does not know the difference between a harmless box of dry cereal and a box that contains detergent. So while the area under the sink may seem like a good place to store strong detergents, alkalies, polish, and the like, it is NOT if you have small</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">H a rmful products need to be stored and locked away from prying little hands</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">children. A child will swallow almost anything, even things that smell or taste bad. His inborn curiosity often gets the best of him, because exploring the unknown is one way he learns. Parents who understand this natural tendency to experiment can head off trouble before it happens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Injury from burns is another threat. The misuse of fire, and matches in particular, head the list of accidents to the three-to five-year-old group. Who has not read with horror various newspaper accounts of small children who were badly burned and even killed because they played with matches? Adults know that fires can be most destructive. But to small children, the flames are fascinating to watch. And they will want to play with matches even when forbidden to do so. It is up to you— the parent—to make them aware of the dangers on a level they can understand. But even this may not be enough, so keep flammable materials, including matches, where children cannot get at them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Over one million children are treated annually in the United States for accidental poisoning. Every accidental poisoning represents a human error. It means that some adult has been careless, with the child as the victim. In the United States there are over 500 Poison Control Centers, and they receive many urgent calls every day. These centers can supply parents quickly with vital information over the phone when children have taken some poison. They can tell you just what action to take, or what antidote, for almost any kind of poison that has been swallowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Parents should analyze how many poisons their homes contain. Do you think yours is comparatively safe? Consider this: it is estimated that there are about 25,000 potential poisons available at the stores! They do not have to be labeled poisonous to be such. Of the wide variety, aspirin is among the most common, accounting for about </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">25</span><span class="font22"> percent of deaths by poisoning. Other common poisons are insecticides, bleaches, detergents and furniture polish. These are safe items when used by adults, but can be likened to TNT when handled by a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Children’s candy-type medicines have created new hazards. Children are told at times that such medicines are “candy.” Hence, when a child wants more “candy” he will naturally search for the bottle. Although the dosage for children is reduced in each pill, the results can be disastrous if a child takes too many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Of course, no mother deliberately means to be careless with poisons. Many resolve to clear out the medicine cabinet or the kitchen cupboard, but they keep putting it off. When was the last time you threw out all your old medicines, paint cans and cleaning fluids? Are you content with just throwing them in the garbage pail? A toddler will think nothing of exploring the garbage pail or even the toilet bowl when you are not looking. Medicines and liquids should be poured down the drain and flushed. Cans should be smashed if possible and disposed of quickly.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Discipline—Tool for Safety</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Discipline is a strong and effective tool that parents possess for protecting their children. When a child is taught to pick up his toys, he is learning the first essentials of child safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Another aspect of discipline is the language you use and the communication you have with your children. At times your words must be instantly obeyed for them to be fully protected. Eto your children obey you? Do you find you have to yell and scream before your words are acted upon? Perhaps you find yourself saying “no” most of the time. If “no” is used too often, it can lose its effectiveness in real emergencies. For example, when you tell your daughter not to touch the stove because it is hot and will burn her, does she touch it anyway? She should not have to learn this solely from experience. Complete obedience is necessary at times even if the child does not fully understand why at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">To achieve this goal, many parents find it helpful to avoid giving commands all the time when they can request something of the child. “Please pick up your toys” is often obeyed quicker than a harsh command. Then you can build up a command vocabulary to be used when real danger threatens. But if commands are given for every trivial thing, they may not be obeyed in dangerous situations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Whenever it is necessary to give a command, your manner should be calm but firm. The tone of your voice should unmistakably signal “DANGER,” calling for obedience, and right now! Then your actions, coupled with your words, will gain the needed attention. This may take much training, and even spankings, but in time the commands you may have to give will be more quickly obeyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">We have discussed a few of the things parents can be conscious of in their role as protectors. However, we have only scratched the surface, since we have dealt primarily with infants and toddlers. Accidents also happen to preschool and' school-age children. This will be discussed in a succeeding issue of </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font22"> magazine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">This desire to see things that really existed in Bible times prompts many sincere Christians to take advantage of a stay in one of this world’s large cities to visit a big history museum. Those visiting Paris will find much to interest them in the Louvre.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>From Fortress to Palace to Museum</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font22"> Louvre, situated at the geometrical center of Paris, on the Right Bank of the Seine, started its long career as a fortress. It was built In the early thirteenth century by King Philip n. Charles V (136480) converted this military fortress into a royal residence. The Louvre was not yet a royal palace. Francis I (1515-47) was to promote it to this rank. He had most of the old fortress demolished, but died before the palace was built. Succeeding kings finished this first palace, which later rulers eventually replaced by larger buildings, King Louis XIV building the main portions. The Louvre became the biggest palace in the world, a distinction it holds up to the present day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">During the reign of Louis XIV (16431715), the Louvre already contained a collection of well over 2,000 oil paintings. In 1682, Louis XIV left the Louvre for his new palace in Versailles. During the reign of Louis XVI (1774-92), the suggestion was made that the Louvre be transformed into a public museum, but it took the Revolution (1789) for this to become law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The Louvre became a museum officially on May 6, 1791, and it was opened to </span><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font22">public in 1793. The Revolution brought many treasures to the Louvre, after the seizure of much property belonging to the nobles who had fled the country. The Napoleonic wars further enriched the new museum, although much of this booty was recovered by its owners in 1815, after Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo. Nevertheless, private donations and the rapid growth of archaeology during the nineteenth century kept up the flow of art. treasures into the Louvre. Today, with its priceless collections of paintings (including Leonardo da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa”), its 80,000 Eastern antiquities, its 35,000 Egyptian antiquities and its 35,000 Greek and Roman antiquities, it has become one of the richest museums in the world. Some 1,500,000 visitors go through its stately galleries every year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The Louvre is open every day except Tuesday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Bags and cases have to be left at the cloakroom, so it is suggested that you visit the museum with just this magazine or a guidebook, a pocket Bible and a small notebook for jotting down interesting items. Visiting museums can be a tiring business if you do not understand what you are looking at or what to look for. So the following information will help to make your visit to the Louvre interesting and instructive.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>The Caryatid Room</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Of the six big departments in the Louvre, the one that is of the most immediate interest to the Bible student is undoubtedly the </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Departement des Antiquites Orientates</span><span class="font22"> (which, incidentally, closes each day from 12:45 to 2 p.m.). But to get to this department, you will need to pass by several items of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">If you start your visit at the Denon entrance and turn to the left, you will quickly find yourself at the foot of a wide marble staircase, at the top of which is a very beautiful winged statue called &quot;Victory.” This statue was found on Samo-thrace, a Greek island where the apostle Paul made an overnight stop during his second missionary journey. (Acts 16:11) Turn to the left at the foot of this staircase, walk down a long corridor, toward a white marble statue, the famous Venus of Milo. During your visit, you will constantly meet up with this mother goddess under varying forms (the Mesopotamian Ishtar, the Phoenician and Canaanite Astarte or Ashtoreth, and so forth).</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Retracing your steps about halfway back along this corridor, you will see a gallery leading off to the right, called the Caryatid Room. When you are about two-thirds of the way through this room, you will notice against the wall on the left a statue marked &quot;542 MARSYAS.” This is a third-century B.C.E. pagan statue. But it is of interest to the Bible student insofar as it illustrates the true sense in which the words </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">stauros</span><span class="font22"> and </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">xylon</span><span class="font22"> are used in the Greek Scriptures referring to Christ’s execution, for Marsyas is represented as being flayed alive by Apollo on a straight tree trunk, not on a cross.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Palestinian Antiquities</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">After leaving Marsyas, continue on down to the end of the Caryatid Room, through the door and down some steps to the left, into a dimly lit underground corridor with small galleries leading off to the right. This is called the Sully Crypt. The first gallery contains, on the right, a glass case showing, among other artifacts, two of the famous Tell el-Amarna tablets. These are cuneiform letters, written in Akkadian, the diplomatic language used by vassal governors in Egyptian-dominated Palestine when corresponding with the ruling pharaoh. Letter 7096 (Louvre numbering) was written by one Shuwardata, a local ruler who mentions three Bible place names: Acco (Judg. 1:31), Ach-shaph (Josh. 11:1) and Jerusalem. Letter 7098, written by Biridiya, governor of Megiddo, mentions the Bible town of Shu-nem (Josh. 19:18), the hometown of the lovely Shulammite girl of Solomon’s superlative song.—Song of Sol. 6:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">In the next gallery, three items of interest can be seen against the right-hand wall. First, there are two plaster casts. One is of the Hebrew inscription discovered on the wall of a water tunnel or conduit, evidently one cut by Hezekiah to bring water to the Upper Pool of Siloam, in Jerusalem. Written in cursive early Hebrew characters, it describes the excavation work. This inscription thus seems to relate to 2 Kings 20:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Next to this, you will find another cast, reproducing a Greek inscription from Her-</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">od’s temple. This is one of the “Gentiles Keep Out’* notices built into the low wall </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">(Soregf)</span><span class="font22"> separating the Court of the Gentiles from the inner temple area. Knowledge of the existence of this balustrade gives greater meaning to Ephesians 2:14, And these notices, threatening death to offenders, explain the pretext used by the Jews for mobbing Paul in 56 C.E.—Acts 21:27-31</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">To the left of these two casts is one of the most </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">valuable monuments preserved in </span><span class="font22">the Louvre. It is the reconstructed original of the Moabite Stone (in French, </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">La stdle de MSsa).</span><span class="font22"> The inscription on this black basalt stele contains an account of the wars and building program of Mesha, king of Moab. Not only is this one of the oldest inscriptions found in old Hebrew-Phoenician (late tenth or early ninth century B.C.E.), but it is the only pagan text that mentions Jehovah. The Tetragrammaton can clearly be seen on the original stone at the extreme right of the eighteenth line. In addition, this account mentions fourteen place names found in the Bible, and </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">coincides with 2 Kings 1:1 and 3:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Before leaving the Sully Crypt, you will be interested in seeing a clay jar similar to the ones in which the Dead Sea scrolls were found. These are in a glass case in front of the Moabite Stone.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Mesopotamian Antiquities</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Leave the Sully Crypt by a stairway leading into a series of over twenty rooms making up the Oriental Antiquities Department. Upon entering Room I (103, according to the new numbering), you will see to the right the famous Stele of the Vultures, found on the site of the ancient Sumerian city of Lagash (or Telloh). On it, King E-anna-tum commemorates his victory over the nearby city-state of Umma. One side, on which a god is depicted holding a net filled with enemies, well illustrates the language used in Habakkuk 1:14-17, referring to the ravaging Chaldeans. The other side, showing King E-anna-tum and his troops with their hair let down for war, exemplifies the words of Judges 5:2, ‘letting the hair hang loose for war,’</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Room IV (106) contains another of the Louvre’s most treasured monuments: an eight-foot-high stele of black diorite, known </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">as the Code of Hammurabi. The </span><span class="font22">upper part of the column shows Hammurabi, king of Babylon, standing before the sun-god Shamash. Then follow, in some 8,000 beautifully carved cuneiform words, first a prologue, then 282 laws and finally a long epilogue. Because this code is con-jecturally dated by archaeologists as from the early part of the second </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">millennium </span><span class="font22">B.C.E., some have claimed that Moses borrowed from Hammurabi. But this claim is rejected by serious scholars, there being no comparison between the purely civil and commercial Babylonian code, and the morally higher, essentially religious code of Israel. Any similarity indicates rather that Hammurabi codified laws and customs dating from the patriarchal system developed after the Flood by Noah and Shem, who worshiped, not Hammurabi’s pagan god Shamash, but Moses’ God, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">On the wall to the right of this stele you will see a glazed brick panel showing a ferocious-looking lion. This is one of the some 120 lions that decorated the Processional Way leading to the Great Ishtar Gate in Nebuchadnezzar’s Babylon. Such lion figures were doubtless seen by the Jewish captives, who probably remembered Jeremiah's prophecies comparing Babylon to a lion.—Jer. 4:5-7; 50:17,</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The first wall case to the right when entering Room IV contains a cuneiform</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">document, called the Esagil Tablet (3rd century B.C.E.), This gives the only detailed description yet discovered of the ziggurat in Babylon (one of several such towers) that was rebuilt by Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Before leaving Room IV, a glance at the other wall cases, exhibiting little terracotta and alabaster statues of the lewd priestesses of Babylon, will convince you that this ancient city is an appropriate symbol of the “mother of the harlots,” Babylon the Great.—Rev. 17:3-5.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Skushan the Castle</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">You will now pass into a series of rooms that re-create the decor that Mordecai and Esther knew at Susa or Shushan the castle, one of the capital cities of Persia. (Esther 1:2) Room V (107) has large glass cases in the middle of the floor, containing painted pottery from Shushan. Many pots and dishes are inscribed with crosses and even swastika designs, proving that these symbols were in use among the pagans thousands of years before Christendom and Nazism adopted them. On the walls of this room are brick panels from the palace of Shushan, depicting winged bulls and lions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">In Room VI (108), a glass case set on a stand to the right contains a bronze model of a high place dating from the twelfth century B.C.E., and called the Sit Shamshi (Sunrise). Although found in Shushan, this model is considered to be the most complete representation yet found of the type of pagan high place that existed in Canaan at the time of the Israelites. It shows two naked worshipers among sacred pillars, sacred poles, altars and other pagan representations. It well illustrates Deuteronomy 12:2, 3 and 1 Kings 14:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">In Room VII (109), you will see a massive column-capital from the palace of Darius I the Persian, the father of Xerxes or Ahasuerus, Esther’s husband. The following rooms contain a remarkable collection of enameled brick panels in green, turquoise, orange and yellow, showing processions of archer-spearmen, winged and homed lions, bulls and griffins, all of which decorated the palace where Esther risked her life to serve her God, Jehovah, and save her people. Also of interest are the collections of stamp and cylinder seals with their impressions on clay. These remind the Bible student of Esther 8:2, 10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Leaving the world of Shushan, you will go down a staircase into the Marengo Crypt. In the second alcove to the left, you will see a large black basalt coffin-shaped stone, called the Sarcophagus of Eshmuna-zar, king of Sidon. It bears an inscription of 22 lines of cuneiform writing dating from the late fourth or early third century B.C.E. This is the longest old Phoenician text, after the Moabite Stone.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Baals and Astartes</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Going up the steps leading out of the Marengo Crypt, you will find yourself confronted with images and statues of pagan gods and goddesses, such as those mentioned in Judges 10:6. Standing against the wall of Room XVI (116), to the right as you leave the staircase, is the Amrit Stele, with a low relief of Melkart, the Baal of Tyre. You will notice that he is being carried by a lion. In the glass case just to the right of this stele, there is a statuette of a naked goddess, also being carried, this time by two lions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Room XVIII (117) exhibits a large collection of Baals and Astartes found at Ras Shamra, the site of the ancient Phoenician city of Ugarit. While looking at the images of Baal and Astarte or Ashtoreth in the glass cases set up in the middle of this room, you will notice how the emphasis was placed on fertility or sex worship and on violence. Seeing these things will help you to understand the wisdom and necessity of the Bible’s condemnation of idolatry, and one of the reasons why Jehovah called these gods ‘disgusting things.’ —2 Ki. 23:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">In a flat glass case to the left are some clay tablets found in Ras Shamra. They are believed to date from the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries B.C.E., and are of interest because ■ they represent early examples of alphabetic cuneiforfn writing (as distinguished ; from syllabic writ- &quot;&nbsp;ing) and contain a detailed description of the perverted religion of Canaan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">To the left of the right-hand door leading to Room XIX (118) is a large stone stele representing Baal as the storm-god. In Room XX (120), you can see the Syrian storm-god called Hadad. His stele is to the left of this corridor-like room, and he is depicted as being carried along by a bull. Next to him is the stele of Ishtar, the Babylonian mother goddess, also being carried on an animal, a lion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Leaving the Baals and Astartes, you will next find yourself plunged into the atmosphere of the Assyrian Empire, the second world power of Bible history. In Room XXI (121) you will see, to the left, two flat glass cases containing pieces of ivory work found at the Assyrian outpost of Arslan Tash. The first one exhibits ivory work from the bed of Hazael, king of Syria, and the second shows a piece of ivory actually inscribed with the name of Hazael in Aramaean. This name “Hazael” reminds the Bible student of the account at 2 Kings chapters 8-10, 12, 13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">Your visit to the Louvre will end amid the ornaments decorating King Sargon Il’s palace at Khorsabad, northeast of Nineveh. All these artifacts are particularly interesting to the Bible student, because for years the Bible was the only known historical document that mentioned this Assyrian emperor. (Isa. 20:1) You will see, to the left, immense stone panels depicting trunks of Lebanon cedars being floated up the Phoenician coast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Sargon II was the i father of Sennacher-‘ ib, who was assassi-i nated after he was <sub>;</sub> miraculously thwart-i ed in his attempt to _| take Jerusalem. Sennacherib was succeeded by his son Esar-haddon, mentioned in 2 Kings 19:37. You can see this latter king depicted on a bronze plaque, followed by his mother Naqi’a-Zakutu. This is in a glass case to the right in Room XXI (121).</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Passing through into Room XXII (122), you will be impressed by the colossal winged bulls with human heads that decorated Sargon’s palace. Seeing these Assyrian antiquities helps one to understand why the Bible spoke of “the king of Assyria and all his glory” and prophesied to unfaithful Judah that the “outspreading of his wings must occur to fill the breadth of your land.”—Isa. 8:7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Of course, there is much more to be seen in the Louvre. The above selection represents approximately a two-hour visit. There is an exit from the museum immediately behind the stairway leading out of the nearby St. Germain l’Auxerrois Crypt. You will find yourself just opposite the Catholic church of St. Germain l’Auxerrois, the bells of which gave the signal for the horrible St. Bartholomew’s night massacre of French Protestants in 1572. But that is another story.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>t ALUMINUM *</span></h1>
<h3><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font27" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>—from curiosity to versatility</span></h3>
<p><span class="font28">I</span><span class="font22">N 1821, near the French community of</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Les Baux, a chemist picked up a hard claylike mineral, reddish in color. Named bauxite after the village, it proved to have an alumina content of 52 percent. But, you may ask, what is alumina? It is aluminum combined with oxygen, or aluminum oxide. For years this very hard substance resisted all efforts to reduce it to its components. Not until 1827 were the first tiny drops of the metal extracted by a very difficult and expensive chemical process. No wonder, then, a hundred years ago, aluminum was merely a curiosity, even though it is the third most abundant element in the earth’s crust.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Progress in Cost Reduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">At the Paris Exposition in 1855, the first solid bar of the silvery-white metal was displayed. On this occasion aluminum, or aluminium as it is known in England and European lands, emerged from the realm of metallurgical research to be recognized by the general public as a useful metal. But, oh!—its cost! At more than 5&gt;34 an ounce it was indeed a precious metal, so much so it even outranked gold in the household of Napoleon III, Emperor of France. Notwithstanding his pleasure in the costliness of aluminum at that time, being a practical man he envisioned its use in lightweight equipment for his soldiery. Consequently, the king subsidized a French scientist to search for ways to produce it in large quantities at low cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">His work was rewarded by reducing the cost to a little over one dollar per ounce. However, this was still too expensive to make a commercial venture possible. Later an American chemist worked out a process that brought it down to fifty cents. That was still too much, so the search persisted for a more economical method of processing the raw material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">In 1886 two young scientists, one in France and the other in the United States, working entirely unknown to each other, discovered the key to releasing the metal from its oxide on a large scale. The cost now fell to 12.5 cents. Immediately the door opened to extensive exploitation of bauxite deposits. As the years passed, further improvements in technique lowered processing costs to less than twenty cents per pound by the middle of the twentieth century.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>The Raw Materials</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Although bauxite is the primary material for aluminum production, yet other minerals and substances are also required. But first we will observe how bauxite is reduced to pure alumina. Open-pit mining operations using huge power shovels scoop the ore out from where it has rested for thousands of years. Two tons of ore are needed to extract one ton of alumina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Thus the ore goes through an intermediate reducing process before going to the smelters. The bauxite is treated with a hot solution of caustic soda from combined soda ash and lime. This causes the alumina to go into solution while the impurities such as silica, iron, oxide and titania settle out as red mud. The filtered liquid is allowed to settle in large precipitation tanks where the alumina, chemically combined with water, crystallizes. These crystals are passed through large rotating kilns heated to 1,100° C. to drive off the water molecules, leaving the powdery white alumina ready for shipment. From storage bins or long piles on the ground, conveyor belts move the alumina to the holds of waiting ships for transport to the smelters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">At the smelters the alumina is combined with another raw material—cryolite. This mineral, bluish white in color, the powder of which is practically invisible in water, is mined in Greenland, where the Eskimos speak of it as “the ice that will not melt in summer.” It is also produced synthetically in Germany. This was what the aforementioned scientists discovered to be the key for unlocking earth’s vast storehouse of this metal. They established that molten cryolite would dissolve the hard aluminum oxide and then, by passing a powerful electric current through the melted solution, the aluminum could be separated from the oxygen, allowing the pure metal to settle to the bottom of the vessel. Thus electrolytic aluminum-produc-ing “pots” were bom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">For large-scale smelter production of aluminum, many “pots” are required, set up in “potlines.” In the Aluminum Company of Canada smelters, some are made of inch-thick steel approximately thirty feet long, twelve feet wide and four feet deep. These are lined with carbon to become the cathode (negative pole) of the cell, while the anode (positive pole) is a mixture of petroleum coke and pitch. This compound, packed into rectangular aluminum or steel casings, is hung above the “pot.” Control equipment progressively lowers this continuous replacement type of anode into the “pot” as it is self-baked and used up in the molten solution of alumina and cryolite. Interestingly, this material is devoured at the rate of one thousand pounds for each ton of metal produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Fluorspar from Newfoundland is another important ingredient, as well as other materials from around the globe. Added up, the raw materials required to produce one ton of pure aluminum amount to seven tons, Thus uninterrupted production calls for a well-organized transportation arrangement to make sure all necessary material is on hand at the right time and in the right place. For example, materials that would fill 250 boxcars are consumed each twenty-four hours by the smelters in the Saguenay Valley of Quebec.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>The Role of Electricity</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Keep in mind that bauxite is usually mined in low-lying tropical or semitropical lands. Therefore, the most important raw material required—an abundance of cheap electrical power—is seldom found near the ore body. As a result, the alumina must be transported to the power. This is what has made Canada, with its plenteous supplies of cheap hydroelectric power, a natural location for some of the world’s largest aluminum smelters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">If you kept an ordinary 25-watt bulb continuously lit for two weeks, the electricity used would equal the amount called for to produce one pound of aluminum. The average American home would take four years to use the power needed to extract a ton of metal from the original alumina! In fact, a few years ago, inside of one year the aluminum industry on this continent used more electricity than is needed to provide power for a city comprising half a million homes for about ten years! Since that time, with constant expansion of the industry, power demands have increased by almost half as much again. What a vital part it plays!</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Fabrication</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font22"> the gleaming ingots come off the potline at the smelter the story of the metal’s versatility begins to unfold. Many processes finally transform these into objects of practical use. First they enter remelt furnaces where alloying substances are added and varied according to the final use to which the material will be put. From this process come notch-bar ingots for casting, round ingots or “billets” for extruding, and rectangular ingots or “slabs” for rolling, forging or spinning. The smelters themselves produce rods for drawing into aluminum wire. How adaptable the metal proves to be even as it is prepared for the manufacturing procedure!</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Year by year the usefulness of aluminum continues to grow. Expansion of present uses and the finding of new ones is encouraged by the industry itself. Constant metallurgical research is carried on in order to open up wider fields for utilizing its qualities of lightness, softness and yet strength. This strength is the result of pure aluminum being alloyed with other minerals. Much experimentation along this line has produced several hundred alloys all having different characteristics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">How the strength is improved is illustrated in a one-inch test bar of the pure metal breaking under a load of a little over seven tons, while a similar test bar, made of certain alloys now in common use, can be put under tension of a fortyton load without tearing apart. Such alloys are even stronger than some types of steel, thus adding to the aluminum’s versatility, because they retain the original qualities of lightness, corrosion resistance and workability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The metal’s protean nature is further enhanced by its pleasing appearance and being an efficient conductor of both heat and electricity. So, come now, observe how this interesting substance is turned into some of the useful appliances that have become so commonplace in our modern world.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>The Finished Products</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">We will first visit Rogerstone, South Wales, and its giant rolling mill. Here aluminum “slab” ingots, two tons in weight, are run back and. forth through a continuous line of hot presses that stretch out for a quarter of a mile. Coils of sheet aluminum or straight sheets emerge from this process, their thickness depending on future employment. This varies from a quarter of an inch to foil so fine it requires a stack of 1,250 sheets to achieve the same thickness! At Kingston, Ontario, a milling machine rolls out foil fifty-four inches wide at a speed of more than half a mile every minute. From plants such as these the fabricated aluminum moves out to various manufacturing plants to become the superstructure of an ocean liner or the “skin” of an intercontinental jet aircraft. As foil, you may be using it in your kitchen for innumerable purposes or peeling it off your favorite chocolate bar. But that is not all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Perhaps you are a resident of London, England, and daily ride “the underground.” Your comfortable train is made of aluminum. Or a recent trip through Spain was on the famous “ACT-Talgo” train of the Spanish Railways. Aluminum alloys contributed to your pleasant journey. In North America, railroads are more and more making use of the metal that was once a curiosity. Refrigerator cars, gondolas, box- and tank cars, all made of aluminum, hurtle by on mile-long trains. On the highways of the world the metal is used in trucks, buses, trailers and even your own automobile. Many of the soaring skyscrapers of the world’s great cities are faced or paneled with porcelain-enameled or gleaming sheet alloys of aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">In the giant argosies of the skies, now coming off the assembly lines, some parts must be constructed to carry a tremendous load. Such are forged by giant presses similar to the 50,000-ton press at the Alcoa plant in Cleveland, Ohio. After the press stamps out the part, it is “carved” to its proper size by a profile milling machine. Huge extrusion presses squeeze out the metal like toothpaste, changing round “billets’’ into everything from airplane propellers to bridge girders. A few years ago, such girders were used to build the world’s first all-aluminum highway bridge across the rapids of the beautiful Saguenay River in Quebec.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">From the equator to the poles and all around the earth more and more uses are being found for this champion lightweight metal. One hundred ounces of aluminum top the famed Washington Monument providing not only a beautiful silvery cap but also a protective lightning conductor. Portable aluminum sprinkler irrigation systems are in use on the coffee plantations of Brazil and the sugar-beet farms of southern Alberta. Seven million miles of transmission lines crisscross the countries of the world carrying vital electrical power to cities and factories through steel reinforced aluminum conductors. In many cases these are now hung from aluminum towers. Even eight-room houses with two verandas, having a total weight of only 2,300 pounds, are being prefabricated from this metal of many uses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">It would be possible to go on and on describing the products of thousands' of factories that turn out everything from hairpins to chaise longues and from beer barrels to the portable tools of the carpenter and mechanic! Yes, aluminum is no longer a curiosity but one of the most versatile metals known to man for which he should be grateful to the Grand Creator, who first locked it in the crust of the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font21">Our earth, together with the other planets and the sun that make up our solar system, travels about 43,000 miles an hour in orbit around the center of our Milky Way galaxy. In addition, the earth revolves around the sun once a year, and does this at a speed of about 66,000 miles an hour. Finally, the earth rotates on its own axis once every twenty-four hours. And how fast do you travel with the earth in this daily rotation? It depends upon where you live. If you were standing right at the very tip of the north or south pole, you would travel only a few inches an hour, for in twenty-four hours all you would do is make one complete turn. But if you lived at Nome, Alaska, you would travel about 6 miles a minute; farther south, at Vancouver, about 11% miles a minute; at New York city, nearly 13 miles a minute, and at the equator, you would speed along at about 17% miles a minute, since you would have to travel nearly 25,000 miles every twenty-four-hour day. So do you want to travel through space? You are—on the earth spaceship!</span></p>

Now the next tray of slides I’ll show you I think might have some pictures of ... ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“Oh, George!” Mabel said with some frustration, “you’re not going to show us more, are you? We’ve been looking at your pictures now for over two hours,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Does this sound familiar? It is to many. A showing of color slides all too often is a series of vaguely related and repetitive pictures with no set theme or objective and which tends to last longer than the interest of those who are asked to view them. But instead of being occasions for mild interest or pqjite tolerance, one’s color slides or photo scrapbook can be opportunities for education and enjoyment. How? By treating them as a type of photo story.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>The Photo Story</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font22"> combination of audio and visual presentation—that is, your commentary along with the slides—requires the same basic treatment that other methods of communication employ. The audio-visual presentation should have a theme and an objective. The theme is what your picture story is about, and the objective is what it is getting at. Main ideas are then determined, to develop your theme toward its objective. Of course, what the audience already knows about a subject and what their interests are should influence your objective and the main ideas you choose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">How do you determine story ideas? Wherever possible, have an outline of ideas ahead of time that you would like to have illustrated by pictures. For example, suppose you are going on a vacation trip or some outing, and you want to document it by means of color slides. Beforehand, think of what you would like to learn about and see in your selected area. Then make a tentative list of these ideas. Are there exceptional beauty spots, historical locations, exhibitions, unique customs or occupations of the local inhabitants? What about the geology and topography of the land? Are there some fine locations for viewing the wonders of creation? Questions such as these can help you to select your photo-story ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Travel and government agencies, history books, encyclopedias and acquaintances who have been there are some sources of information on what to expect in any given area to which you wish to go. Of course, you probably will encounter interesting ideas for your story when there that you did not anticipate. However, by having an outline ahead of time, there is less likelihood you will have “holes&quot; in your story through lack of planning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">In planning your presentation, then, have in mind a theme and purpose that can be developed with ideas that could be aptly illustrated on film. Consider your interests (realizing that you should want to look at them yourself more than once) and the interests of </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">others to whom you </span><span class="font22">expect to show them. With your story ideas in mind, you are in a position to turn your attention to finding picture ideas to illustrate them.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Finding Picture Ideas</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Picture ideas are suggested by the story ideas you wish to illustrate, by what you are already planning to develop, whether it be a vacation trip, weekend outing, Junior growing up, the development of some project or hobby, attendance at a convention, or whatever one finds worth while recording. Picture ideas are also suggested by what you encounter outside your already determined sphere of knowledge and interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Picture possibilities may take the form of a single photo, or series of pictures, depicting an action or idea. Let’s say in documenting your vacation trip you have found out that a certain area is noted for its </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">pottery, and you plan to include this as </span><span class="font22">part of your story. You may decide to take a number of step-by-step pictures of a potter plying his trade as he produces his various wares in demonstration for prospective customers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Although the single picture, or series of pictures, to illustrate an idea or action would probably be most commonly used by the amateur, yet do not forget to look for picture possibilities in symbolisms to convey a story idea. For instance, if you are doing a photo story on Junior growing up, you might include a few of a lamb, or tiger, to symbolize Junior’s disposition in his early years. Also, do not forget the possibility of maps or diagrams as part of your presentation, for pictures can be taken of these and interspersed throughout your story where appropriate. Three-dimensional title letters can also enhance your presentation and can be made or purchased at most camera stores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">To find picture ideas, one must learn </span><span class="font22">to think in terms of pictures, to think in terms of how ideas can be illustrated with pictures. Look for an unusual picture of the ordinary, or even an ordinary picture of the unusual. This comes with practice, but unless one thinks in terms of pictures and translates the idea of what he sees and experiences into a picture or picture sequence, many good opportunities for photos will slip by unnoticed. Be sure to keep notes and record Information relative to the pictures you take, for this provides a good basis for the audio part of your presentation. However, to have your pictures effectively arranged in a good photo story, you need to give special attention to the way you edit them.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>Edit Your Pictures</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">One observer was commenting on some slides he had seen of a trip through Europe. As he was being taken on a tour through European cities, he saw thirty-two slides of the Eiffel Tower in Paris from about thirty-two different angles, but only five slides of the rest of Paris. Now if this had been a story about the Eiffel Tower, thirty-two slides illustrating its different characteristics and aspects would certainly have been justified. But since this was a tour of European cities, just a few slides of the Eiffel Tower in this photo story would suffice to keep the account in line with its purpose. The Eiffel Tower should be just one aspect of a number of pictures that would develop the idea of Paris. Judging from the number of slides shown, though, it was not so much the Eiffel Tower in Paris, but rather Paris in the Eiffel Tower. This illustrates the need to edit your slides and cull out pictures that do not properly contribute toward the balanced development of your story idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Cull out repetitive slides too. This does not mean you should throw them away, but perhaps you could use them to develop another photo story. For instance, the person who had the slide story of European cities could keep most of his slides of the Eiffel Tower, and if he was as eager in taking pictures of other famous European landmarks as he was with the Eiffel Tower, he could develop a photo story on “Famous Landmarks of Europe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Naturally, you would not want to use poorly taken pictures that would detract from your presentation, such as something that is out of focus. It is frustrating to some viewers to see several blurs of people or things flashed on the screen and then sit there while the projectionist enters into an extended discussj^n to explain who the blurs are and whether or not we know them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Be sure to consider the length of your showing. It is not good to have your story go on so long that it tires your audience. More lengthy presentations could be divided into various parts so that one section could be shown at one time and another on a different occasion.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>Basic Picture-taking Tips</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">How many times have you had a good idea for a picture, only to find it did not look as good on the slide as it did to your eye? You can shut things out with your eye when you focus on the subject, but the camera is not so disposed. If you do not notice the fountain in the background, the camera will, and you may end up with a slide that has Uncle Harry with a spout gushing water from his head. Therefore, take note of the entire picture area. By your composition, eliminate everything possible that will detract from the focal point of your picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Fill the camera viewfinder with your subject material, keeping only the background that contributes toward the picture interest. If you are taking a picture of Aunt Mabel, for instance, let’s look at Aunt Mabel. Do not have her so far in the background that you require a round of “I Spy” to find out who it is. If you are fortunate enough to be around some fruit trees in the spring, then you may be able to enhance your picture of Aunt Mabel by including enough of a branch of apple blossoms to partially frame your shot of her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The point is to fill your picture with subject interest. Framing your subject tends to draw attention to the focal point of your picture material and will enhance the results considerably, just like framing your shot of Aunt Mabel with the apple blossoms. The objects you use for the frame are usually nearer to the camera than the focal point of attention. Hanging limbs from trees, bridges, fences, are just some things commonly employed. If you have other recognizable objects in the background, then this could add even further to the depth that your method of framing will produce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Some who have cameras that take rectangular negatives seem to think a camera is like a bowl of soup. You can hold it only by the edges and it just sits one way. Your camera may better be held by supporting it firmly in the palm of one hand and hence eliminating out-of-focus pictures because of camera movement, commonly caused by holding the camera weakly at one edge while you push down on the shutter at the other side. Do not be averse to holding your camera vertically in order to take vertical pictures. This makes for better composition in some cases as it allows you to capture more of your subject interest and eliminate wide borders of nothing that show up when you take a horizontal picture of Uncle Harry from the shoulders up. Of course, if you have a square-type negative, whether to take a vertical or horizontal picture </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">poses no problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Keep the picture simple, with one idea evident, for then it is easier to attract the eye and communicate the idea with greater impact. Use the lines of objects in a picture to convey mood. Horizontal lines carry the feeling of rest or peace while diagonal lines imply action or force.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>Know Your Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">One more thing, know what your equipment will do and learn how to use it well. Frequently when someone has taken a poor picture, he will say, “There is something wrong with my camera.” This may be true, but often it may simply be the photographer's not knowing his equipment, or his not knowing how to use it effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">For example, at the 1963 Around-the-World Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses held in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, an impressive sight was arrayed before the audience when the lights of the Rose Bowl were turned out at night and the platform and convention-theme letters stood out by special lighting effects. Then hundreds of flashbulbs could be seen popping all over the Rose Bowl by those who did not know their equipment. Some, 500 feet away, were trying to take a picture with a flashbulb that extended its effective light for about 25 feet. In fact, they were trying to light up a scene that got its special effects and attraction by turning out the lights. A time exposure with the camera held on something solid would have done the trick in a situation such as this. So as not to be disappointed, know what your equipment is designed to accomplish, and know how to use it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Many of Jehovah’s witnesses have taken their cameras to their conventions this year and may wish to make it a photo story. Instead of just showing pictures of masses of people, various photo-story themes could be developed, such as &quot;Happy Families Worship Together,” “Assemblies </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">—A Demonstration of Unity, ” </span><span class="font22">“Happy Faces with a Hopeful Future,&quot; &quot;To Listen and to Learn.” If you are going to an assembly abroad, themes relating to your Christian brothers, their ministry, missionaries, those serving where the need is great, and so forth, are just some ideas that can be developed. In every case, be courteous when taking pictures, doing so with consideration of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Good instruction books on photography are available at moderate cost for anyone wishing to master the basic art of using a camera and taking pictures. Whatever the occasion, though, the next time you embark upon a picture-taking experience, do so with some forethought and care, so that when you show your slides to others and they hear the click, click of the projector, there is no fear of its being just Mabel, Harry and Niagara Falls. Rather, make it a photo story.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awoke!<sup>1</sup>* correspondent In Puerto Rico</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font28">T</span><span class="font22">O ONE who witnessed the small beginnings of the Kingdom-preaching work by Jehovah’s witnesses in the island of Puerto Rico some thirty years ago, the expansion of that work up to this present time must appear marvelous. Zealous efforts have been made to promote genuine Bible faith among the 2,735,000 inhabitants. A large crowd of native Puerto Ricans have responded, so that today the branch office of the Watch Tower Society supervises the activities of some 5,500 active ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Until very recently the Society’s branch office was located in rather crowded premises that were acquired some twenty-three years ago. Now, to the joy of Jehovah’s people, a handsome, new two-story building has become the spacious center for Witness activities in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. It was surely time for this change. Why, last year alone over 25,000 new subscriptions for the Watch Tower Society’s magazines were received. Small groups of earnest Bible students have grown and become well organized for the preaching service. There are now over ninety such congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">What is specially happifying about this fine new structure, with its 4,000 square</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">reet on the ground floor and around 2,500 square feet on the second floor, is the fact that the actual construction was effected by dedicated servants of Jehovah. The architect was a Witness, as were most of the engineers, plumbers, electricians, masons and blocklayers. And dedicated Witnesses it was who, on August 12, 1968, began swinging their machetes in the work of clearing the construction site.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Day after day the work went steadily forward, while on weekends and holidays the work force would swell to as many as sixty. Day after day, too, local congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses shared in supplying midday meals for the workers. In the slightly more than eight months it took to complete the building, it is estimated that about 3,000 meals were served and about 10,000 hours of labor were given freely. One Witness, with many years of experience in his line of work, made a beautiful arched mahogany doorway of Spanish design for the front entrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Dedication of the building was set for Saturday, May 3, 1969. Those last few days prior to this event witnessed an amazing transformation. In place of the dirt ground around the branch building, 4,000 square feet of turf and some beautiful plants greatly enhanced the appearance of the structure. Painters, too, were busy, so that when invited guests from all over the island arrived on May 3 they truly rejoiced at what they saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">At 7 p.m. Ivan Truman, who first came to Puerto Rico in 1946 when there were but thirty-six Witnesses, stepped to the tasteful platform, with its dark-brown cork background set off by two lighter colored pillars. He reviewed the growth of the Kingdom work over the years. Next,</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Ronald Parkin, the branch servant, with the help of film, detailed the interesting highlights of the construction program. Then came the highlight of the evening as N. H. Knorr, Watch Tower Society president, spoke to the audience of 305 about the purpose of the building. ‘All must remember,’ he said, 'that only when supplemented by the activities of true worshipers could such a building be truly meaningful.’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">After closing song and prayer there was a surprise tour of the premises. From the Kingdom Hall portion of the building the visitors went to the lobby, where they saw an attractive oil painting by one of the Witnesses depicting the missionary schooner &quot;Sibia,” once very active in the Caribbean area. Then to the spacious office and on upstairs into the large, airy living room. Next the comfortable-looking bedrooms and the modern kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Sunday morning the visitors went to join some 5,440 of their fellow Witnesses who had assembled in a large auditorium to hear a special discourse by President Knorr. Timely counsel was offered on the theme “The Implanting of the Word.” Joy and satisfaction were surely the predominant emotions at this grand season of fellowship, which closed with a song of praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>The Fall of Ancient Babylon</span></p>
<p><span class="font32">D</span><span class="font21">N 539 B.C.E. ancient Babylon fell before the Medes and Persians, and the Israelite people were freed from captivity there. The Bible records a great deal in connection with this event. Ancient Greek writers also describe Babylon’s fall. The book </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Nabonidus and Belshazzar</span><span class="font21"> by R. P. Dougherty briefly summarizes the statements of the historians Herodotus, Xenophon and Berossus regarding this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&quot;Herodotus asserts that the Babylonians advanced to meet the invading army of Cyrus and that a battle was fought in which the Babylonians were defeated. The latter retreated to their city and shut themselves in, having confidence in a great store of provisions which had been gathered. ... At length Cyrus diverted the waters of the Euphrates to such an extent that the stream was shallow enough to allow his troops access to the city. The end came at a time when a festival was being celebrated with much revelry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&quot;Xenophon begins his account of the fall of Babylon by describing the maneuvers of Cyrus’ army when it first encompassed the city. . . . Cyrus withdrew his soldiers to their tents in the face of missiles from the Babylonians. The Persian king was convinced that he could not take the city by assault and hence he had a large trench dug for the purpose of deflecting part of the stream which flowed through Babylon. At the same time he built numerous watch-towers, using the trunks of palm trees for foundations. All the while the Babylonians derided these operations because they felt assured that they were capable of withstanding a siege of more than twenty years. When all preparations had been made Cyrus waited until the time of a festival which the Babylonians were in the habit of observing with drinking and revelry throughout the night Then he lowered the river by causing much of its water to flow aside and thus the city was entered. . . . AU the citadels of the city were captured and every Babylonian was forced to give up his arms. —</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&quot;Berossus states that when Cyrus ap. proached Babylon Nabonidus met him in force. In the ensuing battle Nabonidus was defeated. He thereupon fled with a small company and found refuge in Borsippa. After Cyrus had captured Babylon he ordered its walls razed. Thinking to besiege Nabonidus, he advanced against Borsippa, but Nabonidus surrendered without attempting to defend himself. Due to the mercy of Cyrus, Nabonidus suffered only deportation to Carmania, where he spent the rest of his life.”—Pages 179,180.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark73"></a>Where Did God Come From?</span></p><img src="g_E_19690808_files/g_E_19690808-12.png" alt="" style="width:155pt;height:21pt;">
<p><span class="font22">SiTVTHO made God? When was he W born?” are questions that some persons ask. Perhaps you, too, may have wondered, Where did God come from? Sincere persons who inquire about this want a logical, sensible explanation. What follows will help you to appreciate that Jehovah God, the Almighty Sovereign of the universe, never had a beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Since everything on the earth has had a beginning, some people reason that God, too, must have had a beginning. They note that whatever has come into existence has had a cause. A house has a builder; a piano, a maker; an oil painting, an artist. Whatever exists came into existence, not by itself, but by the action of someone else. Although such logical reasoning applies to the things we see about us, there is a difference in connection with God. Consider why this is so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22"><sup>1</sup> As one goes back in time he finds, that each thing produced was produced by someone that existed before it. Is it not logical, therefore, that someone in the far distant past must have started this series of causes and effects? Of course! There must have been a First Cause. Since this First Cause could not have been brought into existence by someone else, how could He have had a beginning? The Holy Bible identifies this great First Cause as God, calling him by the name Jehovah. The Bible says: “Of course, every house is constructed by someone, but he that con</span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">structed all things is God.”—Heb. 3:4; Ps. 83:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">* God’s infinite existence can be better appreciated if we consider certain examples of infinity that men of science accept. Infinite is defined as ‘lacking limits or bounds; extending beyond measure or comprehension; endless; immeasurable. ’ Men of science theorize that space is limitless. Although man peers farther and farther into space with ever more powerful telescopes, he never finds an end to it. So it is believed that space is infinite, limitless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">• Men of science also acknowledge that time is infinite. Ask yourself, When did time begin? For you it began when you were bom, but you know that it existed before that. Scientists calculate that the earth has been in existence for several thousand million years, yet when you stop and think about it, did not time exist before that? Yes, it did. No matter how far back one may go, time was always before it. Similarly, Jehovah God is infinite, having no beginning or end. In fact, his great power extends into all time and space. —1 Tim. 1:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22"><sup>fl</sup> True, we cannot fully comprehend how God could never have had a beginning. This is because we are limited and finite. We are used to seeing things that have had beginnings. Nevertheless, just because something is incomprehensible this does not mean that it cannot be accepted. We accept that time is without beginning or end even though our minds do not fully comprehend it. Also we accept the possibility of space being limitless, infinite. Should it be any more difficult to accept that God is infinite, especially when we have such powerful evidence of this fact?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22"><sup>1</sup> We should recognize that God’s ways and thoughts are much higher than ours. (Isa. 55:9) We dare not put our human limitations and weaknesses upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">With such a view it is not difficult to accept and appreciate that Jehovah is “from time indefinite to time indefinite,&quot; yes, that he is eternal, without beginning and without end.—Ps. 90:2; 93:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22"><sup>s</sup> Persons who insist that someone made God or that he had a beginning put themselves on the horns of a dilemma. Why so ? Because if someone did make God, then it could be asked, Who made that someone? Yes, Find who made the someone who made the someone who made God? As you can readily see, the argument could go on and on and never be resolved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22"><sup>8</sup> Further, the only reliable and truthful ancient written record about God is the Holy Bible. It is generally known that its moral standard is of the highest quality and that it advocates truthfulness and honesty. It is in the pages of this book that we are told that God is “from time indefinite to time indefinite,” that he had no beginning. Think now: Is it logical to believe that a book that is exemplary in truthfulness on all other matters would falsify the facts about God himself?—Gen. 1:1; Isa. 45:18.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font22"><sup>10</sup> Also consider: If God were created, then the one who created him or was responsible for his beginning would have to be much greater than he is, is that not so? Hence this one would be the one deserving our worship and praise. But the Bible shows that Jehovah is the Most High, the onlj*true God.—Isa. 43:10; 44:6-8; John 17:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font22"><sup>11</sup> Because Jehovah God is infinite, he will always remain the Sovereign of the universe and continue as the true God for all eternity. The time is near when all false gods will perish forever and will be proved to have been no gods at all. (Jer. 10:10-12) How very urgent that we all examine our lives to see that we are not following any false gods in any manner whatsoever. Why ? Because all followers of false gods will soon be destroyed forever. —Ps. 44:20, 21; Rev. 21:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font22"><sup>12</sup> To make this examination, many thousands of persons are benefiting from the free home Bible-study course being offered by Jehovah’s witnesses. Why not take advantage of this course? Logical facts will be brought to your attention that will help you to appreciate Jehovah as the First Cause and understand more about him. You will also learn that in the near future Jehovah is going to transform this earth into a paradise where you may have the privilege of living forever. The facts proving this will enable you to have the joyful hope of walking in the name of the eternal, true God, Jehovah, for all eternity.—Mic. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Witnesses Champion the Bible</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font21">The first three of the twenty-five-city &quot;Peace on Earth” In- . ternational Assemblies of Jehovah’s Witnesses opened the second week in July at Atlanta, Buffalo and New York city. In attendance on the opening day at the three assemblies was a happy crowd of 163,545 co riven ti oners. The Witnesses gathered from over 100 different lands, to hear Bible discourses and to receive instruction on how to aid others to have faith in it and apply its principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Despite a steady, chilly rain at Yankee Stadium on opening day, the convcnti oners using raincoats or umbrellas, proved themselves to be no fair-weather Christians as they packed out the stadium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Delighting the convention-ers was the hour-a nd-a-ha If program &quot;Is the Bible Really the Word of God?” Reasons were given why people ought to examine what the Bible says. It was shown that today science is being exalted, and because of the accomplishments of science, people feel they do not need the Bible. Science has produced conveniences, but it has not taught men to love one another. The Bible fulfills an urgent need by showing us how to forge strong family ties, how to live at peace with one another, yes, how to love our fellowman. This excellent program presented outstanding points of evidence upholding the Bible, such as its practicality, its historical accuracy and the fulfillment of Bible prophecy in our day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Following this program, con-ventioners heard the forceful talk &quot;Loyal Advocates of the Word of God.” Speaking on this subject at Yankee Stadium, N. H. Knorr, president of the Watch Tower Society, presented evidence that the clergy of Christendom are not loyal advocates of the Word of God. He cited examples of clergymen who downgrade the Bible as myth, and who actually have spoken out in favor of fornication, adultery and homosexuality. Who, then, are loyal advocates of the Word of God?</span></p>

<p><span class="font33" style="font-weight:bold;">72,301 in New York for opening day of “Peace on Earth” International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font21">&quot;There are hundreds of thousands of persons in all parts of the earth,” declared N. H. Knorr, who &quot;want no part with any religious organization that is disloyal to Jehovah God and his Word the</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Bible. . . . For that reason they have quit the churches, but they have not stopped worshiping God. They regularly gather for worship in the more than 25,000 congregations of Jehovah's witnesses earth wide. . . . They are glad to present to any sincere person the overwhelming evidence that the Bible truly is the Word of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">War and Peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Western Producer </span><span class="font21">printed the following item under the • caption “Little Peace&quot;: &quot;The Norwegian Academy of Sciences has calculated the frequency and severity of wars as far back as history would permit. They discovered that since 3600 B.C. the world has had only 292 years of peace. During the period investigated there were 14,531 wars, large and small, in which three billion, six hundred and forty million people were killed. The academy said that the value of destruction would pay for a golden belt around the earth 100 miles wide and 11 yards thick. ‘Since 650 B.C.,’ it said, 'there have been 1656 arms races, only 16 of which did not end in war. The remainder ended in the economic collapse of the countries concerned.’ &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Insecticide Pollutes Rhine</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt;$&gt; Millions of Rhine River fish and some ducks, during the latter part of June, were washed ashore dead from in? secticide poisoning. The Dutch Institute of Public Health, which identified the poison as an insecticide called endosulfan and marketed as Thiodan (it is a sulphurous acid ester), said that one microgram— less than one three-millionth of an ounce in a quart of water—was enough to kill most fish. Authorities still did not know how the insecticide found its way into the Rhine River. French conservationists charged, on June 25, that insecticides such as the one that has polluted the Rhine River were responsible for deaths of people as well as wildlife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Good Life”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt; A booming German economy produced in May a record total of 807,200 job vacancies. With the chance for more lucrative and prestigious factory and office jobs, German waiters, as well as hotel and other service employees, are losing their taste for their professions. Foreign workers are filling the spot in unprecedented numbers. But not even foreign workers can come fast enough. “You find me the waiters, anyone^ and I’ll hire them,” said a restaurant owner to a customer who complained about the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Pollution in Madrid</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">-$&gt; A special report from Madrid, Spain, says: “Known a decade ago for its pure air and crystal-hard skyline, Madrid is now as smoky as New York and, from an airplane, resembles a smudge left by a cheap eraser.&quot; Now there is a major antipollution campaign in the city to clear the air. Car drivers were warned that defective exhausts could result in a fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">“Bloody-Minded People&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt;$&gt; A group of scholars appointed by a presidential commission in America told Americans, on June 5, that they had become a “rather bloody-minded people.” The 13-member commission issued a 22-chapter report in which it documented in great detail a violent tradition in America, with various groups using violence to gain their ends. “The grievances and satisfactions of violence have so reinforced one another that we have become a rather bloody-minded people in both action and reaction. We are likely to remain so as long as so many of us think violence is an ultimate solution to social problems,” the report says.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Buckle Those Seat Belts</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt;$&gt; A British study of 800 auto accidents showed that a passenger’s chances of being killed are doubled if he is thrown out of the vehicle. While half of those ejected were killed, only 25 percent of those who were not ejected died. Use those seat belts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Confessional Under Fire</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt;$&gt; Roman Catholic theologians today are seriously questioning the value of or need for auricular confessions. Priest Vincent Harvey quoted a 22-year-old Montreal student as to the modern impression of confession: &quot;It's too easy. You commit sins. Then you go into a little box, tell a few stories to the priests and presto! The slate is clean. In that case why not have an automatic machine —a sort of juke-box with a little sermon and absolution.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Choosing the Right Dentist</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Choosing the right dentist is often a serious problem in this day of high costs and specialists. In the United States you can call the local dental society. It will usually recommend the names of several dentists in your vicinity. Another source of basic information is the American Dental Directory, available at public libraries. This guide lists all dentists, their schools, year graduated, age and years in practice. Some further clues: look at the waiting room, its neatness. When meeting the dentist, does he take time to discuss fully your dental problems? Does he ask whether you are seeking emergency care or if you are looking for a family dentist? Ip he willing to discuss fees frankly? Be cautious of any dentist not willing to discuss his fees at your request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Parents and Children</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">■$&gt; Dr. S. E. Rosenberg, writing for the Toronto Daily Star, May 14, said: &quot;Children are natural mimics. . . . Much more readily than they will follow parents’ advice, will children follow in their footsteps. Maturity seeks critics, but youth longs for models. What children observe in their parents’ behavior will always speak more eloquently than their words or exhortations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Russian Teen-Agers</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt; Older Russians refer to teen-agers as spoiled. They say the youths lack interest in physical work, or anything but the &quot;good life.&quot; They say the schools and homes must share the blame for this attitude. Eduard G. Kostyashkin, head of the section of theory and history of the Academy of Pedagogical Science, also a </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Pravda</span><span class="font21"> writer, said that young parents today are so interested in their own pursuits that they do not want to worry about their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">“Kill the Church&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&amp; The Roman Catholic Church was described by Jean-Paul Gignac, president of Quebec’s Sidbec steel firm, as ‘a dictatorship and a reactionary part of society.’ Roman Catholic bishop P. E. Charbonneau of Hull, Quebec, stated: &quot;Our priests appear to be stifled by the structures of the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Is it necessary to kill &nbsp;the</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">church &nbsp;so &nbsp;the &nbsp;priests &nbsp;can</span></p>

<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">A House Divided</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">For 108 years there has been a split within American Presbyterianism, On May 16, the General Assembly agreed to join in serious unity nego-. tiations with the Presbyterian' Church in the southern United States. The division began over the issue of slavery during the Civil War. In a speech Dr. J. Randolph Taylor, pastor of the Central Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, reminded the delegates that ‘‘there was a slight misunderstanding that took [place] 108 years ago, which divided the nation and with it the church.” &quot;That was a long time ago,” he said, &quot;and it is a tragedy that while the nation,. through force of arms, has been one again for more than a century, our church, even with the force of faith, has not yet been healed of that division.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Church Schools Close</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&lt;$&gt; Rising costs forced the closing of a number of Roman Catholic schools across the United States last year. A century-old parochial school system in Helena, Montana, was closed on May 28. At first glance money appears to be the problem. But a closer look shows that higher costs result from the decline in the number of young Catholics entering religious orders that would train them as classroom teachers. The economics of this is that priests and nuns are paid $1,500 a year for teaching, while lay teachers begin at $6,200 and get as much as $11,000 for the same work.

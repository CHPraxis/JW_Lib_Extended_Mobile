<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>IT’S IN YOUR BIBLE</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What did Jesus really teach? What is the meaning of his words to his disciples? What instruction did his apostles pass on to the rest of the early Christian congregation? These are vital questions. There is only one sure place to find the correct answers—in God’s Word, the Holy Bible. Do you read your Bible daily? Read it with the same force and understanding with which the disciples read it. How? By reading it in the same language you speak every day. Read the modern-English version <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</em>. A complete Bible, 1,472 pages, with appendix. Only $1. Send today and receive free the timely booklet <em>When God Is King over All the Earth</em>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>FIELD MINISTRY</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Farmers know that to get a bumper crop of good grain it is necessary to sow good seed. This is true in everything we do, is it not? We reap what we sow. The Bible says: “He who is sowing with a view to his flesh will reap corruption from his flesh.” The converse is also true: “He who is sowing with a view to the spirit will reap everlasting life from the spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:8-48:6:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gal. 6:8</a>) To know how to sow with a view to the spirit and to reap spiritually, it is necessary to know what God’s Word says and to apply its principles. Jehovah’s witnesses are interested in providing people with a Bible, as well as an understanding of it. Hence during their house-to-house ministry in June, they will be offering a copy of the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>for $1; or they may combine the Bible and a copy of the book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, </em>for $1.25.</p>

She Preached to Her Minister
A woman who began studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses became so enthusiastic over what she was learning that she was moved to tell everyone about it. Among the ones to whom she spoke was her Lutheran minister. She talked with him for three hours about what she had learned from the Bible. During the conversation she reminded him of a sermon he once gave about the Trinity. He had said: “We know the Father; we know the Son, but who knows who the Holy Ghost is? I do not. Do you?” The woman told him that she now knew the answer. She said that it is right in the Bible! It Is God’s active force, which is the holy spirit. She then left him some Watch Tower publications to read. This time it was not the minister who was doing the preaching.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">✔ Early Christians led exemplary lives. So much so that Minucius Felix, at the beginning of the third century, could reply to a pagan: “If we Christians be compared with you . . . we shall be found much better than you. For you forbid, yet commit, adulteries; we are known as men only for our own wives: you punish crimes when committed; with us, even to think of crimes is to sin: you are afraid of those who are aware of what you do; we are even afraid of our own conscience alone, without which we cannot exist; finally, from your numbers the prison boils over; but there is no Christian there, unless he is accused on account of his religion.”—<em>The Ante-Nicene Fathers, </em>Vol. 4, p. 195, The Octavius, chap. 35.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Spiritual warfare! This is the warfare for true Christians: “The weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful by God for overturning strongly entrenched things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:10:4-47:10:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 10:4</a>) Among those strongly entrenched things against which Christians wage spiritual war are Babylonish teachings of false religion. Against these Babylonish ideas, Jehovah’s witnesses wield the “sword of the spirit,” the Word of God. Also helping in maintaining the assault on false religion are the publications of the Watch Tower Society. For example, <em>Awake! </em>magazine last April featured a special issue entitled “Are the Churches Nearing Their End?” Each issue of <em>Awake!, </em>in fact, helps Christians in their spiritual warfare. As they maintain the assault on false religion during October, Jehovah’s witnesses will offer a year’s subscription for the <em>Awake! </em>magazine, with three Bible-study-aid booklets, on a contribution of $1.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Really to know God we must know what he has promised to do for us. And to have faith in those promises we must have absolute assurance that he will carry them out. The Bible contains such assurance, and the book <em>“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” </em>will help you to be convinced. Its twenty-two absorbing chapters give powerful assurance of the certainty of fulfillment of all God’s promises. It is hardbound, 416 pages, illustrated. Send only 50c.</p>

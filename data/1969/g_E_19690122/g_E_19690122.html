<h1><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font22"><a name="bookmark19"></a>&quot;pu/Uh ipMi*</span></h1>
<p><span class="font21">T</span><span class="font16">HE events of 1968 on the international scene led most observers to the same conclusion: “Nations of the world, instead of pulling together, seem to be pulling apart.” That was how 17.8. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">News £ World Report</span><span class="font16"> expressed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This report added: “The idea of a ‘United States of Europe’ is dead for now. So is the hope that the United Nations would be a global parliament and keeper of the peace. . . . What has happened? Overwhelming evidence shows that the old forces of nationalism and isolationism are re-emerging. Nations pursue their own narrow interests in foreign policy.’’</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Soviet Union Acts</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Nowhere was this more evident than in what many news analysts feel was the most ominous international event of all 1968. This was the occupation of Czechoslovakia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Late in August, troops from the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria entered Czechoslovakia in a lightning move. Some said that as many as 500,000 troops were involved, mostly Russian. While this act horrified much of the world, the swiftness and technical efficiency of the invasion surprised and awed many military experts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Why this drastic action? All year long, Czechoslovakian leaders had gradually loosened their ties to the Soviet Union and her type of communism. The Czech rulers wanted more freedom in various spheres of activity, especially in politics and economics. Yet, most world leaders felt that the Soviet Union would not take military action despite the differences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But on that late August day, at about 1:45 a.m., some inhabitants of Prague who were still awake heard the drone of a plane low over the city. One person jokingly remarked that it was probably Russian, feeling certain that the unlikelihood of this would be the point of humor. Moments later, the joke turned sour. Large formations of Russian jet fighter-bombers swept in over the city. Then, in what seemed like a never-ending stream, hundreds of giant Russian transport planes began landing at the airports outside Prague, disgorging troops and heavy equipment. By dawn, Prague was occupied, as was the rest of the nation.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Soviet Move Viewed as Ominous</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">One reason most observers felt this move was so ominous was that they thought it upset the balance, of power in Europe. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font16"> magazine said in October: “Europe is shaken and unsettled. . . . Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia . . . tipped</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">many do that very thing! Neither should indulgence in these pastimes loom up so prominently in one's life as to cause one to slight one's obligations to one’s Maker and to one’s family or fellowman.—1 Tim. 4:8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Jesus, in his parable of the sower, warned against letting the “pleasures of this life’’ choke out the seed of God’s truth, resulting in unfruitfulness. The Bible counsels: “Let your reasonableness become known to all men”; that is, be moderate, reasonable in all your activities and relations with others. Becoming unbalanced in the pursuit of such pleasures is not being reasonable.—Luke 8:14; Phil. 4:5.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Forbidden “Pleasures”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Then again, there are certain “pleasures” that should be avoided altogether, both because of the principles they violate as well as the harm in which they result. Among such is the smoking of tobacco. The tobacco habit is costly, not only in dollars and cents, but also in health. In fact, ever more and more evidence comes to light underscoring the fact that smoking is a forbidden “pleasure” to those who would be wise. Typical are the findings published in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Today’s Health,</span><span class="font16"> September 1968, under the title, “Researchers Strengthen Case Against Smoking.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">There is also the questionable pleasure of gambling. It encourages selfishness, for it is, in effect, a form of extortion. Besides, how often those who indulge in it become compulsive gamblers’ Thus in the United States alone today there are some six million compulsive gamblers, living in a fantasy world. Their </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">addiction causes </span><span class="font16">many to turn to thievery and even to suicide,—</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Science Digest,</span><span class="font16"> April 1968.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Also to be avoided are promiscuous sex relations. When we consider the venereal disease, the illegitimacy, the broken homes and other unhappiness caused by these, the wisdom of God’s Word in forbidding the “pleasures” of promiscuous </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">sex is</span><span class="font16"> obvious.—Heb. 13:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Wisdom dictates avoiding not only the “pleasures” of promiscuous sex relations but also those things that tend to lead to them, such as petting. Such pleasures God’s Word limits to those in the wedded state. (Prov. 5:15-20) The wise course is to ’make straight paths for your feet.’ This is also the loving course, as it prevents one from stumbling another.—Heb. 12:13.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Seeking Pleasures Through Drugs</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Presently the pursuit of pleasures on the part of many youths has taken the form of indulging in marijuana and, to a lesser extent, LSD and other drugs, While there are comparatively few defenders of LSD among professional people, there are many of these that argue that there is no difference between drinking wine and smoking marijuana. They see no harm in the fact that in some United States cities from 50 </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">to 75 percent of the high-school </span><span class="font16">students smoke “pot,” as it is called, and that of these an estimated one-third are habitual users. At present there is a widespread movement afoot to legalize the use of marijuana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But the committee of the American </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Medical Association dealing with such </span><span class="font16">problems has gone on record in declaring that marijuana “is a dangerous drug and as such is a public health concern.” </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(Newsweek,</span><span class="font16"> July 1, 1968) And six months previously, Massachusetts Superior Court Chief Justice G. Joseph Tauro upheld the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">ban on marijuana, saying among</span><span class="font16"> other things:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“It is my opinion, based on the evidence presented at this hearing, that marijuana is a harmful and dangerous drug. As far as I can ascertain, its only purpose is the induction of a state of Intoxication or euphoria. The drug has a great attraction for young men and women of college age or less during their formative years, when they should be gaining the education and experience upon which to build their future lives. The use of the drug allows them to avoid the resolution of their underlying problems rather than to confront them realistically, . . . The coincidence between addiction to ‘hard’ narcotics, crime and promiscuity is too great to be passed off as merely accidental.”—</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Time, </span><span class="font16">December 29, 1967.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This forthright opinion by a learned judge underscores the folly of pursuing pleasure for its own sake without taking into consideration the consequences.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Spiritual Pleasures</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Pleasures might be placed in three basic categories. There are those that are good in themselves if enjoyed in moderation. And there are those “pleasures,” ‘sensual pleasures’ and suchlike, that are to be strictly avoided as both unlawful and harmful. And there are also pleasures that should be assiduously cultivated. Cultivate pleasures? Yes, just as some people have learned to acquire a taste for olives, celery and other foods, there are pleasures, spiritual pleasures, for which a “taste” can be developed or acquired on the part of imperfect humans whose tendencies are toward earthly, selfish things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Bible tells that Jesus Christ, both before coming to earth and while on earth, received joy, pleasure, delight from doing his Father’s will. (Prov. 8:30; Ps. 40:8) Just think of the pleasure that Jesus must have derived from watching many thousands satisfy their hunger with bread and fish that he had provided miraculously! How great must have been his pleasure in restoring sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, strength of limb to the cripple and the paralytic! And what a pleasure it must have been to him to preach the Kingdom good news offering freedom from bondage and release from heavy burdens!—Matt. 11:28-30; John 8: 31, 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">While Christ’s followers today cannot perform miracles, they can enjoy spiritual pleasures of both receiving and giving, and they are urged to cultivate these. Among such is the taking in of knowledge of Jehovah God, his dealings and purposes. Thus the psalmist wrote: “I am exulting over your saying just as one does when finding much spoil.” How enjoyable it can be to take in Bible truths the Christian witnesses of Jehovah especially get to appreciate at their larger assemblies.—Ps. 119:162.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Even greater are the pleasures of generosity, of unselfishly serving or giving to others. This is not a farfetched idea at all, but in one way or other is generally recognized. For example, who does not like to entertain or play the host to a group of friends? And so as Christian ministers attend to the spiritual need of others and they find someone appreciative of their efforts and conscious of his spiritual need, they derive genuine pleasure from their activities. As one young full-time pioneer preacher put it at a recent assembly: Pioneering gives the most of the greatest pleasure there is, helping others to take their stand for Jehovah. It is even as Jesus said: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”—Acts 20:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">So take the wise view of pleasures. Avoid those that are forbidden. Be moderate in the enjoyment of mundane pleasures. And keep cultivating the spiritual pleasures, which benefit others as well as yourself and bring honor to your Maker, Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">I</span><span class="font16">S IT reasonable to think that because people live on different continents their worship of God should be different? Is difference in skin color reason for a difference in the way one worships God? Should the language one speaks affect true worship, or should a contrast in customs or dress do so?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Consider such</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font16">Gravity, for example, is universal. Long ago the Bible acknowledged the law of gravity when it said about God: “He is stretching out the north over the empty place, hanging the earth upon nothing.” (Job 26:7) The gravitational pull of the sun upon the earth is a </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">chief factor</span><span class="font16"> responsible for ‘the earth’s hanging</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">questions in the light of what the Bible says about God: “He himself gives to all persons life and breath and all things. And he made out of one man every nation of men, to dwell upon the entire surface of the earth, and he decreed the appointed seasons and the set limits of the dwelling of men, for them to seek God.”—Acts 17: 25-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">How clear it is that Jehovah God provides for all humans, regardless of race or nationality! All of mankind descended from </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the &quot;one</span><span class="font16"> man” created by God. Thus, no matter where one might live, under whatever conditions, the true worship of Jehovah does not change due to any of man’s natural conditions.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Fixed Laws of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the same way physical laws established by God to govern the universe do not change from country to country. These laws are fixed. All humans, regardless of race or nationality, are affected similarly by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">upon nothing.’ In more recent times Sir Isaac Newton expressed the law of gravity in greater detail. It is an unchangeable law established by God. Territorial boundaries, or the language or customs of people do not affect it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">From another viewpoint, any particular individual at any given spot on earth can break one of God’s natural laws and feel the adverse effects. If he eats too much, he gets sick. If he drinks intoxicating liquors to excess, certain natural laws will tell him about this regardless of his nationality or the language he speaks. There is a reaction that he cannot escape, because God’s laws govern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This is much the same with God’s laws concerning our spiritual life. They too apply earth wide. They come from God, and so they do not change. And just as when man breaks one of God's fixed natural laws he gets into trouble, so likewise with Jehovah’s laws on right worship. Break one of them, and eventually you will begin to feel the adverse effects.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Prohibition of Spiritism</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Take as an example God’s law prohibiting all forms of spiritism. His Word says: “There should not be found in you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, anyone who employs divination, a practicer of magic or anyone who looks for omens or a sorcerer, or one who binds others with a spell or anyone who consults a spirit medium or a professional foreteller of events or anyone who inquires of the dead.” (Deut. 18: 10-12) This law applies to all of God’s servants everywhere on earth. And violation of it by meddling in spiritism can only lead to adverse effects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Why is this? Because spiritism is not of God, but Satan the Devil and his demons are behind it. The aim of these wicked spirit forces is to mislead and deceive mankind, and it is through spiritistic practices that the demons are often successful in doing this. The demons actually operate through sorcerers, spirit mediums and persons of that kind, and they have been able to bring much mental and even physical sickness upon those who dabble in spiritism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">How valuable, therefore, is the counsel of God’s Word, which condemns spiritistic practices! Such practices are included among the schemes or machinations of the Devil, and the Bible urges: &quot;Stand firm against the machinations of the Devil; because we have a fight. . . against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.” (Eph. 6:11, 12) Thus, true worshipers everywhere will take a firm stand against spiritism. In every country on earth true religion will have nothing to do with spiritistic practices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Yet what do we find to be the case with religions of Christendom? Is the worship of their adherents the same everywhere?</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Not the Same Everywhere</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font16"> magazine of February 14, 1969, quoted one psychologist as saying of Brazil: &quot;Brazil is ostensibly a Catholic country, but it is not really Catholic. African rites were brought over by slaves, and the lower-class people who practice spiritism have adopted Catholic saints and some Catholic rituals. They use the Catholic icons [images] to represent their African gods.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Yes, in Brazil one can be both a Roman Catholic and a spiritist. One writer speaks of the majority of Brazilians as adhering to what he called a “synthesis of Catholicism, Africanism, and spiritism.” The Catholic Church accepts thousands and thousands of spiritists into her fold, thus mixing demonic worship and other Catholic practices.—Ps. 106:34-38; Gal. 5:19-21; Rev. 21:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">However, on learning of this, many Catholics in other Latin American countries and elsewhere are aghast. They express themselves as not understanding how the Catholic Church permits such spiritistic practices within her ranks. Certainly the worship practiced by Catholics is not the same everywhere. How, then, could it be true worship?</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Attitude Toward Bullfighting</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Consider another example. Bullfighting in Lima, Peru, is one of the principal attractions each October during the religious celebrations of the &quot;Lord of miracles.” A Lima newspaper observed: “Since 1946, for twenty-one years the celebration of the Lord of miracles is carried on where the winner [of the bullfight] is awarded the ‘escapulario’ medallion which is esteemed as one of the most important in the world of bullfighting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The world of bullfighting is closely linked with Catholic worship. Every bullring has its private chapel or altar with its Catholic saint. The toreador prays either to the patron saint of bullfighters, the virgin of Soledad, or to his own private saint, evoking protection from the bull. Then, too, there can be little question about the religion of the majority of spectators who wildly acclaim the spectacle—they are Roman Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Nevertheless, there are many Catholics who consider bullfighting to be just as cruel and barbaric as it really is. They can see how opposed it is to God’s instructions to man to exercise proper dominion over the lower animals. (Gen. 1:28) In fact, Catholic countries in South America are split over the legality of bullfighting. Some permit it; others outlaw it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Thus, from country to country the practices and religious attitudes of Roman Catholics change. They are divided on what they consider or accept as truth in their worship. They are not united in the same mind on matters. This can also be said of Protestant religious organizations that teach and practice certain things in one area and something else in another place.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Unity That Identifies True Worship</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">True worship, on the other hand, is the same everywhere. This does not mean that all true worshipers of God dress and eat alike, or are identical in other customs. Customs may change due to locality or environment. Individual tastes, likes and dislikes, induce periodic changes. But these changes or differences among true worshipers do not in any way affect their common adherence to the laws and teachings of God as found in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">True worshipers everywhere comply with this counsel of the Christian apostle Paul: “Now I exhort you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you should all speak in agreement, and that there should not be divisions among you, but that you may be fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of thought.” (1 Cor. 1:10) In what religious organization is this sameness of mind and thought everywhere evident today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is evidenced among Jehovah’s witnesses. Only one kind of religion is permitted among them. That is the religion of the Bible. (John 4:23, 24) One cannot be a witness of Jehovah and at the same time practice spiritism. Nor would a witness of Jehovah ever participate in the celebration of the “Lord of miracles” by entering a bullfighting ring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This unity among Jehovah’s witnesses is also evident by their application of God’s high moral standards everywhere? Regardless of where you might go in the earth, nowhere would you find persons permitted to remain a part of the Christian organization of Jehovah’s witnesses who practice fornication, adultery or homosexuality. Even in countries where polygamy and other abuses are common, such unbiblical practices must be eliminated from the lives of individuals before they are permitted to become a part of the Christian organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Yes, Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere practice the religion of the Bible. They speak to others about it, even as Jesus Christ did and commanded his followers to do. (Matt. 28:19, 20) As a result many persons today are being helped to put away their unscriptural practices. And they are being helped to become a part of a clean organization that </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">everywhere</span><span class="font16"> is united in the true worship of Jehovah God. Are you interested in serving God with such a united people? One of Jehovah’s witnesses would be happy to call on you free of charge and assist you to this end.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Who is to blame for these student uprisings? Many answer; ‘Why, a few irresponsible students.’ But Professor Schlesinger observed: “The very magnitude of student discontent makes it hard to blame the trouble on individual malcontents and neurotics. A society that produces such an</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Schlesinger added: “This generation has grown up in an age of chronic vio-lerice. ... For the young, the environment of violence has become normal. . . . Some have never known a time when it was safe to walk down the streets of their home city at night.” And the Institute for Strategic Studies in London notes that there have been 128 wars of various kinds since 1898! Of these, 73 have taken place in just the last twenty years!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What can the older generation, expect of the young, when it is the older generation that has produced such chaos? You reap what you sow. The older generation has sown violence, war, bloodshed. They are reaping the same, with interest—the contempt and rejection coming from their own young.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">However, a sad aspect of all this is the question: What do the young offer as a substitute? Stewart Alsop of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek </span><span class="font16">commented on October 14: “The New Left is like the emperor in the legend— it has no ideological clothes on at all. ... it offers no credible alternative to the present political and economic system. . . . it is a movement built on sand.” The Detroit </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font16"> observed on October</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I 21: “Any political or philosophical discussion among 25 kids in the Movement is sure to turn into an immediate, 25-way shambles.” Hence, the student revolt rejects the methods and values of the older generation, but does not offer a truly workable system of improvement. That is why many analysts conclude that all this world can expect in the future is more chaos, for that is 1958- l<sup>ust w</sup>^<sup>at</sup> &quot;<sup>1(</sup>' y°<sup>un</sup>8 are leam-1967' <sup>in</sup>S-</span></p>

During 1968 a wave of violent crime in the form of murder, rape, assault, in addition to skyrocketing robbery and theft, flooded city after city all over the world. Racial rioting, crippling strikes, economic disorders and other ills struck one nation after another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Among the most stunning acts of crime were the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in April and Senator Robert F. Kennedy in June. These murders shocked a world already recoiling from more disorder than it could handle.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Youth Takes the Lead</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Much of the increased disorder in the form of lawlessness came from the younger generation. The very ones who loudly denounced the standards of their elders found that their own generation was responsible for the greatest rise in the rate of crime. Many youths took the road of utter selfishness, greed, immorality, crime and disruptive antisocial behavior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When police raided an Oklahoma college party, they uncovered a vast cache of everywhere. Shelves contained books on sexual perversion and torture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Thus, when elders looked on much of the current student rebellion with disdain, it was not without reason. What too many rebellious youths offered as a substitute for the “Establishment<sup>&gt;t</sup> was sheer degeneracy, depravity, animalistic behavior. Cheating, drug usage, premarital sex relations, perversions and other disorderly behavior skyrocketed. Not surprising, then, was the U.S. Public Health Service report of a shocking increase in unwed mothers at the college level.</span></p>

Even the preparation of the dramas was international, four of them being prepared by Witnesses in Quebec, Canada, and two by Witnesses in France. Peak attendance for the French and Spanish assemblies came on Sunday, during the the issue of job security. About a million students were denied education for thirty-six of the first forty-eight days of the fall term. In December, although the city’s school strike had been settled, thousands of school students rampaged through streets protesting their having to make up the time lost due to the strike.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">The same month the largest electric and gas utility, serving 9,000,000 New Yorkers, was hit by a strike of 20,000 of its employees. Even the police and firemen threatened strikes over wages. Added to all this was the fact that welfare rolls in the city grew to the astounding total of 1,000,000 persons! One out of every eight persons in the city was on welfare. Also, the crime rate soared, the city’s choking traffic jams on the ground and over the airports worsened, the cost of living swiftly rose, and urban decay continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The New York </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font16"> of October 23 concluded: “Anyone who doubts that there is a clear and present danger of civil disorder in this country need merely look at New York City today. ... It would be hard to overestimate the seriousness of this situation.” And </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Babson’s Washington Forecast Letter</span><span class="font16"> said: “The crisis we now face is the most serious, the most dangerous, in the history of our country.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Economic Disorder</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Last year also saw disorder, yes, even panic, in the field of international finance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Because of chronic deficits in the international trade accounts of the United States and Britain in particular, a gold rush of gigantic proportions began in the middle of March, the third disturbance in just a few months. Since gold is the backing for many currencies in international trade, including the American dollar and British pound, people wanted to get rid of their paper money and obtain gold instead. Toward year’s end, the world’s finances were again at crisis stage as the French franc faltered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">How desperate the situation is can be seen in the trade balance of two leading countries, the United States and Britain. Other nations held about 32,500,000,000 United States dollars that could be redeemed in gold, but the United States had only about $10,500,000,000 in gold to back up the claims! And British reserves shrank to $2,700,000,000, less than half the amount needed to back up the British currency held by other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In almost all nations last year inflation, rising prices of goods and services, dissolved the purchasing power of people’s money. Taxes, too, hit the average worker hard. French citizens paid over 38 percent of their income for all taxes, Germans over 34 percent, Italians nearly 30 percent, the British and Americans well over one-fourth of their income!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">How serious a threat is inflation? The American Institute for Economic Research observed in September: “In the past, prolonged inflating of many currencies has brought the economies concerned to a ‘point of no return.’ From that point on to the final destruction of those currencies, neither common stocks, nor real estate, nor any other investment medium, except gold, has provided even approximate protection against loss of the currencies’ buying power. And the receiver in bankruptcy for a rotting currency usually has been a dictator. ... we find some indications that the United States is well beyond that point. . . . serious economic disorders, including a severe recession, seem highly probable within the next several years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In another field the disorder was even more pronounced. It astonished and bewildered multitudes of people. This disorder was among the orthodox religions of Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">During the assembly week, as well as a few days before and after, more than 14,000 of Jehovah’s witnesses made a tour of the Society’s Bethel Home and over 20,000 toured the printing factories.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Many Full-Time Preachers Present</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In his closing remarks at Yankee Stadium, the Society’s president stated that 1,420 missionaries were assisted financially to attend the “Peace on Earth” International Assembly somewhere in the world. Where did the help come from? From Jehovah’s people throughout the world. And at the various convention cities special missionary meetings were held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At the New York assembly, 478 missionaries met at the Society’s headquarters on Saturday morning, July 12. Brother Knorr spoke to them on the need for endurance, and about fifteen of them from early classes of the missionary school of Gilead spoke to the group, to encourage the younger missionaries to stay on in their assignments. One Witness who had served as a missionary in Italy reported that she has been privileged to help 115 persons to learn God’s truth. Following such encouraging remarks the missionaries went into the Bethel dining room for a fine meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At the New York assembly were many other full-time proclaimers of the good news. From Guadeloupe was a Witness who for twelve years has been a special pioneer, devoting 150 hours a month to preaching the “good news.” From the British Isles came an eighty-five-year-old pioneer who has been a Witness for forty years and a pioneer for seven, He expressed hope to re- ’ turn to London in time for the assembly there at Wembley Stadium. A missionary from Argentina related that 180 delegates had come to the assembly from that land; and about half of them were full-time preachers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Among the 700 Swedish delegates present was seventy-six-year-old Johan Eneroth, the Watch Tower Society’s branch servant in Sweden and fifty-one years a Witness, forty-nine of them as a full-time worker. A Swedish first lieutenant before learning God’s truth, he has since served in both Denmark and Sweden as a soldier for Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Present at the Japanese meeting were many special pioneers. Talking to these enthusiastic Christian sisters attired in their native dress was a pleasure. For instance, a special pioneer, Sister Nishigari, related that she went to a town where there were no Witnesses and formed a congregation there, and now she is here for the next class of Gilead School. Also present from Japan were the Arai family: Chie Arai, who is working in the Society’s Tokyo branch office; and her sister Hisako, ten years a pioneer and now a special pioneer who has helped form two congregations. Their mother is also a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">During the New York assembly telegrams and messages came in from all parts of the world. Why? Because of the keen interest of Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere in this assembly and their love for their Christian brothers. Here are a few examples:</span></p>

Your brothers of the congregations in: Thessalonica, Berea, Philippi, Athens, Corinth and scores of other congregations in Macedonia and Achaia, Greece.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">New York’s “Peace on Earth” International Assembly came to a close with thrilling remarks by N. H. Knorr concerning plans for further expansion of the urgent work of taking the Word of life to people in all lands, and then prayer to Jehovah, the God who gives peace. How privileged were those who attended this grand spiritual feast, an international assembly to which delegates had come from over a hundred lands!</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">M</span><span class="font16">AMMALS, from the aardvark to the zebra, are marvels in motion. They may leap with their legs, cling and climb with daws, negotiate rough terrain with hoof or nonskid heel, or simply pad along on their paws. Each moves about in a style suited to its peculiar environment. Most of the mammalian species, creatures that nourish their young with milk, are land creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But have you ever given particular attention to how each one moves about? Something common to them all is that they simply push backwards against the surface; the forward force available for movement is exactly equal to that force exerted by the. animal in pushing backwards. By use of this power, located in the extremities, mammals in motion display a great deal VMluf ffeKSy of beauty and grace. The more we study these creatures, the * more we are impressed by the practicalness of their individual gifts. Let us take a closer look at some of them, and concentrate especially on the organs of locomotion—the feet and the legs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A visit to a zoo has doubtless already impressed you with the astonishing physical variety encountered in the mammal world. But aside from color and size, shape of head and so on, have you noted their feet? Probably the most representative foot is the hoof. The horse has a full hoof, the pig has a cloven hoof, and the camel’s hoof is partial. Suppose we choose one of these and consider the value of its foot in relation to its ordinary environment and activities.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>“Ship of the Desert”</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19690122_files/g_E_19690122-6.png" alt="" style="width:165pt;height:115pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">The camel is a hardy creature that can bear up under extreme privation. Heat and cold, thirst and hunger that would kill most animals, the camel takes in its stride. Its extra built-in food and water supply permits it to travel nonstop at a uniform pace, never hurrying nor lagging behind, from daybreak till dark. It can actually be pushed to travel to the point of death with a burden of 500 pounds on its back. For any animal to hold up under such punishment for lengthy periods, it must have remarkable feet and legs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Rather than saying that the camel walks, we might say that he paces. The long front and rear legs on the same side of the body move forward in unison. This produces the rolling effect that may have given rise to the name “ship of the desert.” The feet of this “swaying ship” are made up of two toes protected by large, heavy cushioned §oles and naillike hooves. The thick, tough cushion provides traction on sand or rock. Large calluses on the leg joints and chest protect these parts from abrasion while the camel is kneeling or lying down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">With all these aids to desert survival, is there any wonder that the camel has been a valuable burden bearer throughout the centuries?</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>The Mighty Pachyderm</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The largest living land mammal is the elephant This thick-skinned creature— for that is what &quot;pachyderm” signifies— is a plant eater, despite his terrifying appearance. Elephants travel in herds, shuffling along at about seven miles per hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In an emergency they can double this speed, yes, even triple it for attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">An enraged elephant will charge up to fifty yards, raising his mighty ears menacingly, and throwing</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">the feet forward and outward in a most distinctive manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The enormous weight of this animal is supported by massive, columnlike legs that appear to be shapeless and clumsy. But surely it takes this type of leg to support the vast seven-ton body. Because of his massive weight the elephant is incapable of the slightest spring, and could not cross a seven-foot ditch even if it attained, the maximum stride of six and a half feet. The sole of the foot is covered with a soft, elastic homy layer as if of crepe rubber, with the additional advantage of a nonskid tread. All that appears of the skeletal toes are the broad nails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Since the African elephant attains a height of thirteen feet, we might expect him to be rather awkward. Despite the ponderous build, though, he can move through the bush almost as silently as any other wild creature. He moves with astonishingly little noise and is master of the art of concealment. His surefootedness, even on rough terrain, must be credited to his feet and legs.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>Paws and Claws</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Cats, all the way from the tabby to the tiger, in daily life present an amazing contrast of moods. At rest, as they purr contentedly, they are the picture of peace and relaxation. But when attacked or hunting for food they can explode into action. In the world of flesh eaters the cat has the sharpest claws. These cutting tools'are retractable to prevent blunting through contact with the hard ground. With these safely out of the way even a big cat, a tiger or a lion, can move along quietly on padded paws, often placing his hind feet In the tracks of his forefeet with proverbial softness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Look at the lion. His padded paws allow for stealth, not to speak of their use as instruments for freshening up his coat where the tongue cannot reach. The loose build of the rear legs makes possible a </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">variety </span><span class="font16">of movements: pushing himself along even when he slinks with belly to the ground; also springing through the air in a series of bounds at a speed up to thirty miles an hour. Then there are the powerful forepaws—with claws retracted, strong enough to stun with a blow; with claws unsheathed, capable of tearing even tough food to shreds.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>The Sluggish Sloth</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">One of the strangest means of mammalian locomotion is that adopted by a small hairy denizen of tropical America— the sloth. Early Spanish explorers called him “the little armored thing,&quot; but the modern name derives from the Latin expression </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">tar pities,</span><span class="font16"> meaning “slow foot.&quot; How well this describes the three-toed sloth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">No other warm-blooded creature shows such a disinclination for movement. He is so languid that green algae, which look like moss, attach to his coarse hair, adding to his camouflage as he makes snaillike progress among the treetops. So slow his movements, he reminds one of a study in slow-motion photography.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">Zoologists relate him to the anteater and the armadillo, but the sloth looks more like a cross between a monkey and a bear. He has three long, hooked, needle-sharp claws on each of his four paws. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Although </span><span class="font16">his legs and arms are incredibly muscular, the sloth is all but helpless on the ground and cannot even support his own weight. The solution to this paradox is that this slow-moving creature was built for life among the treetops—an upside-down life at that. The sharp claws are for </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">climbing, and </span><span class="font16">all his locomotion has to be in a hanging position, head down. Can you now see why his arms and legs have to be muscular?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">He can even turn his head round and round until an observer is sure his neck will snap. But no, because his neck is extremely flexible. Double-jointedness makes </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">him a veritable acrobat. Hanging by one </span><span class="font16">hind leg, the sloth can turn his body through almost 360 degrees. This is, in fact, his emergency defense. In this position he can strike out at enemies with both arms, delivering blows with amazing accuracy. But sleep is mightier than the claw, and in no time he can drift off into one of his typical fifteen- to eighteen-hour naps.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Hopper Extraordinary</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Take a look, now, at the marsupial family of mammals, which ranges in size from hopping mice all the way up to the largest relative, perhaps weighing two hundred pounds. The generic name “Macropus” means “great foot.” Yes, that huge pouched mammal, the kangaroo, comes next to our attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Eighteenth-century explorer Captain Cook asked an Australian aborigine the name of this great hopping creature. The reply, “I do not know,” sounded to Cook like “kangaroo” and the name stuck. Cook found these creatures hopping around the open plains without any fixed home. The largest grew to a height of seven feet. It looked quite ludicrous to the captain, these creatures bouncing about, but imagine his astonishment when some of these hops lengthened to thirty feet!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The kangaroo’s powerful, long hind limbs are the secret of his tremendous springboard action, while the tapered tail acts as a balancing pendulum and rudder for varying leaps and turns while traveling along at full speed. The folded legs suddenly straighten out, sending the heavy body through the air forward and upward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">So, there you have them—the camel, the elephant, the cat, the sloth, and the kangaroo, each equipped for its role in life. Surely, the Great Designer, the God of creation, is to be admired for the intricacies, for the thoughtful consideration, reflected in all his works!</span></p>

<p><span class="font21">S</span><span class="font16">HOULD blood transfusions be given children at the request of a physician in spite of the objection of parents? This is a knotty issue that frequently confronts American judges. Because of this the American “Council of Judges” met and formulated &quot;Guides to the Judge in Medical Orders Affecting Children,” which was published in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Crime and Delinquency, </span><span class="font16">April 1968.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">' This Council consists of some fifty United States judges who work with the “National Council on Crime and Delinquency.” It prepares or sponsors counsel in the form of &quot;guides” for the benefit of American judges. Among its members are some of America’s foremost judges. As far as it went, the above “Guide” gave fine-counsel on this difficult and controversial subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">For example, the Council took a dim view of the undue haste with which some judges have been influenced to act in giving legal sanction for blood transfusions. In one case an emergency was declared and a blood transfusion was ordered without first having a hearing. The doctor argued that “the child might be cold in his grave” if his receiving a blood transfusion had to wait until a hearing was held. However, a whole week passed before the child was actually given a blood transfusion. Rightly the Council stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“By granting the order upon a </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">doctor’s </span><span class="font16">certificate without a hearing, the statute, as interpreted by the Ohio court, denies the parents their right to oppose the treatment on religious and medical grounds and thus encourages arbitrary action by medical authorities. As indicated in this very case, it was possible to hold a full hearing without harming the child; the hearing should have been held.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Pinpointing the underlying principle involved, the Council went on to say: “It seems clear that ‘blue babies’ and accident victims may recover without blood transfusions and that large numbers of persons die or are infected with serum hepatitis from blood transfusions. Any medical decision that a particular procedure is necessary ... must be Justified to the court as proposing the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font16"> proper procedure in the situation. If there is a </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">choice </span><span class="font16">of procedures—if, for example, the doctor recommends a procedure which has an 80 percent chance of success but which the parents disapprove, and the parents have no abjection to a procedure which has only a 40 percent chance of success— the doctor must take the medically riskier but parentally unobjectionable course.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Among those who especially appreciated this position are those who may object to blood transfusions because of the risks involved. Without a doubt there are many cases wherein a plasma volume expander would be quite effective, and without the risks accompanying blood transfusions! According to this Council, so long as such ‘substitutes’ have some chance of success they should be resorted to if the parents object to the use of blood transfusions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">More than that, this Council further advises: “Local representatives of religious sects likely to be involved in litigation over medical treatment should be consulted by the court, as such sects frequently know of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">physicians or nonmedical </span><span class="font16">practitioners willing to treat children in emergencies in ways not offensive to parental beliefs.&quot; How reasonable! How just! It allows for differences of opinion and alternatives and acknowledges that some of these may even be found among “nonmedical practitioners.&quot;</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>Alternatives to Blood Transfusions</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Anyone following the course of modem medicine cannot help noting that there is a definite trend toward using alternatives to blood transfusions. Thus Dr. B. F. Rush, Jr., a professor of surgery, wrote: “While a number of institutions and organizations use saline solutions enthusiastically, a larger number continue to depend almost wholly on blood transfusions.&quot;—JiWi'cuf Science, May 1967, p. 62.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">That this “larger number&quot; are far behind the times is apparent from what the 1.96'9 </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">World Boole of Science Service re</span><span class="font16">ported under the heading, “The Need of Blood,” as published in the Los Angeles </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Herald-Examiner,</span><span class="font16"> February 16, 1969:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“A few deaths </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">have been attributed</span><span class="font14"> to a lack of sufficient matching blood. But why panic? . . . We are not entirely without alternatives. , . . alternatives which may prove preferable to donated blood. Except in unusual circumstances . . . most individuals can remanufacture their own red blood cells within three days of loss. . . ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Intravenous glucose solution has been the most universally used fluid. Surgeons researching for the U.S. Army have also sue. cessfully used normal </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">saline solutions on </span><span class="font14">hundreds of surgical cases, including open heart procedures. They have found the sterile solution avoids all the risks of transfusion reactions, contaminated blood, allergic reactions and serum or viral hepatitis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Dr. Stanley Dudrick of the U. of Pennsylvania, In order to hasten body rebuilding processes, enriches normal glucose with many nutrients and introduces it by means of a catheter through the jugular vein. And soon Robert Geyer of Harvard University may have the best answer. He has come closest to developing a true blood substitute by emulsifying the same fluorocarbons out of which teflon is made.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Bearing similar testimony is Dr. Rush, Jr., in his article, “Should Buffered Saline Solutions Be Used to Treat Hemorrhage and Hemorrhagic Shock?” He relates that some physicians are so enthusiastic about these solutions that they refer to them as “white blood,” and he says that some medical units in Vietnam have made saline solutions standard routine. He also tells of a hundred operations in which part or all of the stomach was removed and in which only two received blood during the operation and that thirty-four cases of major blood loss were treated with only saline solutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A key finding, he states, is that saline solutions be given in quantities three to four times that of the amount of blood lost. It appears that this is so because “shock&quot; requires the replacement of fluid not only in the blood vessels but also in the “extravascular space,” for which such solutions are especially effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Another writer shows that in “shock” due to bums alternatives to blood transfusions are superior: “Ringer’s lactate solution appears the most efficacious single agent available for the correction of shock attending burns without regard to age of patient or extent of injury.” One reason for this seems to be that diluting the bloodstream with such solutions aids the flow of blood in the capillaries.—</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Annals of Surgery,</span><span class="font16"> October 1966.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Because of the risks associated with blood transfusions authorities have urged checking on hospitals as to the number of single-unit transfusions they give because these can do so little good but may do much harm and even kill. One doctor has asked if this should not be done in regard to multiple-unit transfusions because of the greatly increased risks these entail. After describing these risks, he stated: “No transfusion should ever be given if other therapy will suffice.”—</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New York State Journal of Medicine,</span><span class="font16"> January 15, 1965.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Just how effective alternatives to blood transfusions can be in a variety of situations the following will clearly show.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>In Anemia</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Some physicians prescribe blood transfusions routinely for anemia. How ill-advised such treatment can be Dr. B. S. Leaven, Professor of Medicine and Chief of Hematology, University of Virginia, shows: “Now as for anemias due to defective blood production . . . We have some patients who did light housekeeping and got along very well till the hemoglobin got down to </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">2i</span><span class="font16"> grams ... It varies with the individual. . . This simply shows that in patients with intrinsic defects . . . there isn’t much use of transfusing them if they are surviving .,. they have reached a pretty stable situation and this patient with sickle cell anemia ... we transfused him up to normal level and in a few months he is back to where he was before.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">He also tells of a lively young businessman who had the flu and went to the hospital. “He had a mild anemia which was not investigated but he was so anxious to get out that his physician transfused him to speed his recovery. He received an entire pint of blood despite development of chills and backache during its administration ... He finally died.&quot; </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">—Uses and Misuse of Blood Transfusions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In support of the foregoing is this experience; “In 1964, I became critically ill with anemia and was transported to the hospital. The doctor said that only a blood transfusion could save me. . . . When I declined this treatment ... he began giving other treatment and marked on my card: ‘He has refused blood transfusions.’ The same day I arrived in the hospital, a man in my room died. He had had a blood transfusion a month before. A week later another man in the room was given a blood transfusion for the same sickness I had. . . . However, shortly after this the man . . . suddenly died, whereas I became well.&quot;—</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">1969 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>Brain Surgery Without Blood</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Among the most serious operations are those that involve the brain. Yet here, too, certain neurosurgeons have been willing to forgo the use of blood out of respect for the religious scruples of their patients. One such was Dr. J. Posnikoff. Writing in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">California Medicine,</span><span class="font16"> February 1967, he told of the “Cure of Intercranial Aneurysm Without Use of Blood Transfusion.” After presenting the extent of the problem (it was a large aneurysm) and describing in detail how he dealt with it by means of the two-stage technique, he observes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“It is the current opinion of most neurosurgeons that transfusion of blood is absolutely essential in operations for intercranial aneurysms. This case demonstrates, however, that each aneurysm should be considered individually. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">It therefore behooves us not to routinely deny major operation to those who may be in desperate need but who cannot morally accept blood transfusion.”</span><span class="font16"> (Italics added.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Another California neurosurgeon tells of performing a craniotomy on a nine-year-old child without using any blood. In Philadelphia a neurosurgeon consented to remove a brain tumor without use of blood, although he had previously never performed this operation without using five to six pints of blood. Not only was this operation an unqualified success but the recovery was so fast that it amazed the entire hospital staff. When asked if hd would do it again, the neurosurgeon replied: “Yes, I would be very glad to do so,&quot; and he has, since, done so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Last February in Brooklyn, New York, a two-year-old boy’s head was pierced by a part of a metal toy that went in an inch and which his parents were unable to remove. One hospital after another wanted to operate but refused to do so without blood. Finally one of New York city’s leading neurosurgeons, Dr. Matthews, was consulted, and he agreed to handle the case. In a matter of minutes he was able to extract the obstacle without even resorting to operation.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Heart Surgery</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Among the great strides that modem surgery has made is in open-heart operations. And he: a again we find some right up in front in performing them without blood transfusions while others still insist on the need of blood. Thus Dr. Denton A. Cooley states that use of a 5 percent glucose solution has been standard procedure at his hospital since 1962. Yet as late as 1967 a patient with scruples against using blood was denied open-heart surgery in Atlanta, Georgia, necessitating his flying to Houston, Texas, where open-heart surgery was performed without using any blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Another case was that of a boy named Gino, in the Bahamas. He had a heart murmur requiring surgery. The surgeon requested to use blood in case of an emergency, ‘for the lad could die any time.' The mother remained firm, however, and so the operation was performed without blood. She reports: “Of the three heart patients’ operations that day, Gino’s was the most serious, yet he was the first one they could move. The doctors would come as many as seven at a time and would marvel at his quick recovery.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Greg, a three-year-old lad living in the state of Washington, was suffering from a serious heart defect. In view of the parents’ objection to blood the medical team agreed to operate without blood, but not without first warning of the risk this involved. The operation was a success, even though during the operation it was discovered that the defect was even more serious than had first been thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In Gibraltar a woman who had been studying the Bible with one of Jehovah’s witnesses was told she needed a heart operation because of an obstructed valve. However, at the hospital the surgeon, upon learning of her scruples against blood, became so angry he sent her home. But the next day it so happened that a heart specialist from London visited the hospital and, hearing of the case, asked the woman to return. After examining her he said he would gladly operate without blood, much to the chagrin and embarrassment of the local surgeon who had refused to do so. The operation was successful in every way.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>In Accidents</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Serious accidents present a particular challenge to surgeons as they often involve much loss of blood and represent real emergencies. But even in such cases alternatives have proved effective time and again. Thus a California father while at work fell through a hole in a roof and twenty feet on to a cement floor. Rushed to the hospital, he was found to have fractured ribs, left arm and wrist and pelvic bone, as well as sustaining a brain concussion. Slipping into a coma, he kept muttering in Spanish, “Give me glucose. Give me glucose.” After five days he came out of the coma, at which time the doctors wanted to remove his spleen because of the danger of its rupturing because of his continued hemorrhaging. But they would not do so without a blood transfusion, to which neither, he nor his wife would assent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Then, as his wife tells it: “I told the doctors that if they refused to do all they could to save him without blood they would be his murderers. They answered that it was I who would be guilty. What else besides giving blood could they do? I quickly retorted: ‘Why haven’t you given him vitamin B complex, iron and liver shots? Give him vitamin K to help coagulate his blood. How can his body build blood as fast or faster than he is losing it without nourishment?’ The doctor answered that he is not a bleeder and that vitamin K could be dangerous. I explained that I know that, but he is evidently unable to stop bleeding now and a little might help. He wanted to know how I knew so much about these things, and I explained that that was what they had done for me years ago when I was rushed to the hospital hemorrhaging.” While a week later this father faced another crisis, he fully recovered and that without any blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In another case a six-year-old boy in New York State was riding his bicycle when he was run over by an auto. He suffered from skull fracture, broken left arm and leg and severe internal injuries including rupture of his intestines and his spleen. Still the surgeons successfully operated without using any blood. But when complications set in the next day and the boy’s heartbeat went up to 216 a minute, the doctors insisted on blood and threatened a court order. However, they were talked out of it and employed dextran. Within two hours his heartbeat began to slow down and in five days </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">it was normal. </span><span class="font16">Recovery was fast and the lad shortly went back to school, normal in every way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Late in 1968 a young woman had such a serious accident that the doctors held out little hope for her. However, she fully recovered without the use of blood. While she was recovering, her nurse told her she had had a similar accident and had been given blood and that she had never gotten over the effects of the blood </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">transfusion!</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>In Childbirth Cases</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">That there are alternatives to blood transfusions in childbirth cases has also been demonstrated time and, again. One such case was reported in the Tulsa, Oklahoma, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Daily World,</span><span class="font16"> August 6, 1967, under the heading </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">“Tulsan Living</span><span class="font16"> Refutation of Transfusions.” It told of a mother who had previously given birth to seven children with no more than average discomfort. But with the delivery of her eighth child, a four-pound eleven-ounce daughter, trouble developed, severe hemorrhaging set in. Doctors and nurses tried in vain to stanch the flow of blood. The report said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“The attending physician reached a decision: the only way to stop the bleeding was by surgery, but an operation was impossible in the face of such blood loss. The patient must have a blood transfusion. A member of Jehovah’s witnesses, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">[she] </span><span class="font16">refused the suggested treatment because it was against her religious belief.” When she kept refusing, he told her: “I firmly believe there is no hope; I do not see how you can live through the night.” But both wife and husband remained firm. “As the night wore on, the hemorrhaging diminished. The doctor was </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">able to keep her </span><span class="font16">veins from collapsing by transfusions of glucose and other fluid expanders.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">She “survived the night, but the count of hemoglobin . . . stood at 2.4 grams per 100 milliliters of blood. It should have been 16. Her hematocrit (relative amounts of plasma and corpuscles in the blood) was down to 7. It should have been 40. Doctors, amazed that she had survived the night, still recommended blood transfusions in view of the tremendous loss of blood. She continued steadfastly to refuse. The day passed ... On the third day her blood count slowly began to climb. When she was released from the hospital, four weeks to the day from the time she entered, her blood count stood at 10.2 and was steadily improving.” Two weeks later she </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">“was moving normally around the </span><span class="font16">house, caring for her family.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A mother in Kentucky who had a similar experience, but with her first child, tells of it in the following words: “In April 1968 I went to the hospital to have my first baby. An infection developed and I </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">hemorrhaged three times in eight days </span><span class="font16">after the child was born, making it necessary to remove my womb. My blood count was down to 3 when the operation was performed. When I woke the next morning I was told by a doctor whom I did not know that my blood count was down to 2.3 and that I would die unless I received blood transfusions. However, my own doctors worked hard to save my life and in seven days my blood count rose to 7, In another week it was up to 9.8 and I went home. Five weeks after the operation it was up to 11, and since is at 11.5, higher than it has been for years.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>Alternatives to Exchange Transfusions</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Many doctors take for granted that a newly born infant suffering from jaundice needs to have its blood exchanged, but here ^gain there are those who point to alternatives, at least in many cases. Thus Dr. P. M. Dunn, writing in The Journal of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Pediatrics,</span><span class="font16"> discusses “The Unnecessary Exchange Transfusion.” He relates that “at least half” of Rh-factor babies of a certain study did not require any exchange transfusions, and told that the risks accompanying such transfusions are greater than is generally appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Medical World News,</span><span class="font16"> February 17,1967, reported that “Charcoal Each Day Keeps Jaundice Away.” A New Jersey pediatrician is “feeding charcoal to . . . clear the jaundice and eliminate the need for full exchange transfusions.” By this method he has been able to cut down the exchange transfusions by more than 90 percent. And says he: “We’ve had no toxicity and no trouble from the charcoal.&quot; In many hospitals the death rate from exchange blood transfusions is as high as 5 percent. In this hospital it is 1 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Sixteen years ago three Rh-factor babies were born in Reading, Pennsylvania, about the same week, two boys and a girl. The two boys were given blood exchanges and both died in a matter of days. The girl was not given any because of her parents’ objection to blood transfusions. They were warned she would either die or grow up mentally retarded. Within the past year this girl was on the National Junior Honor Society for outstanding scholarly achievement Obviously the doctor was mistaken in more than one respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">More examples could be given showing that there are indeed alternatives to blood transfusions and that these deserve the notice of judges handling such cases.- That the counsel of the Council of Judges is indeed wise can be seen from the following experience:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In January 1968 a three-year-old girl suddenly came down with high fever and went into convulsions. When she was rushed to the hospital, the surgeon said that it could well be due to a malignant tumor and that in such an operation if an emergency arose he would resort to blood, and suggested a hearing before the judge. When the matter was explained to the judge, that there likely was a surgeon, who would operate without blood, he granted time to explore this possibility. Such a surgeon was located. But because of interference by an anesthesiologist, it was necessary to take the child to a third hospital, where the surgeon, the Chief of Staff, stated; “Yes, I am willing to risk the operation without blood.” The operation, which lasted two hours, was wholly successful without recourse to blood; in fact, only a few drops of blood were lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Truly it can be said that the words of the ancient wise man, “The one listening to counsel is wise,” apply to the judge who heeds the counsel of the Council of Judges in the matter of alternatives to blood transfusions,—Prov. 12:15.</span></p>

Most amazing is the complex Of vast structures that occupy the center of the area, many of which still stand. Who built them? Why, in a land usually associated with huts, were they needed? And when did all this take place? These are the questions that go through one’s mind as one stands amid these ancient ruins and views the distant circle of misty-blue mountains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Zimbabwe—for that is the name of these ruins—has been an enigma for a long time. Ancient voyagers had reported its existence several centuries ago—at the time linking the location with the land of Ophir from which Solomon obtained his supplies of gold. Then, for a long time, Zimbabwe was lost again. Nobody knew its location. Many doubted its existence. But in 1868 a hunter'of ivory stumbled upon the site. Imagine his bewilderment at finding these evidences of an ancient city in the midst of the bush! It must have been like a dream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Not much bush is left here now. In fact, there are facilities for tourists and every opportunity to examine the area at leisure. Would you not like to do just that? We can preface the tour with the information that Zimbabwe, pronounced Zim-ba'-bwe, is thought to have the meaning “the house of the chief.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>Wonder After Wonder</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">First as we approach the Great Enclosure or Temple we are faced with a wall so tall that it resembles a sheer rock cliff. It is about thirty-one feet high, fifteen feet thick at the base and tapering to around ten feet at the summit, and completely encircles the Enclosure. As we go closer, we note that it is constructed of granite stone, so cut and shaped as to render mortar unnecessary. In single file we go through one of the narrow entrances to the interior, and literally gasp to see the extensive ruins, thinly disguising a system of enclosures, platforms, passages and columns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At this point we are in what is called the Platform Enclosure, and we can soon see the remains of the raised platform from which it takes its name. Crossing the enclosure toward the platform, we gain entrance into a roughly triangular area behind it, known as the Sacred Enclosure. There in the middle stands a solid stone cone with a flat top, seventeen feet in diameter at the base and tapered masterfully. Nearby stands a second smaller truncated cone. It has been suggested that these together represent the male and female symbols of phallic worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As the Sacred Enclosure narrows toward the northeast we next enter a long, narrow passageway, over 200 feet long, and at places only wide enough for single-file progress. Looking up at the blue sky framed as in a narrow slot between these towering walls, one cannot but wonder who were the builders. The question also occurs, Did ancient priests once use this private passageway leading from the Sacred Enclosure to the north entrance of the Temple Enclosure?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Back into the open again, outside the towering outer wall, and we pause to admire the interesting chevron pattern that runs along the wall near its summit. A bus now takes us over to yet another feature of Zimbabwe, The Acropolis, a steep hill up the sides of which we can observe sections of stone wall clinging to the face some 250 feet above us. We start up and before long find that steps cut into the hillside make the going easier. But these get narrower and steeper as we proceed. How thoughtful of the park management to furnish these rest benches!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">On we go up and up, the ascent getting steeper and steeper, until we come to what looks like a crack in the rock face. It turns out to be a narrow passage between two giant boulders, just wide enough to squeeze through—and suddenly we are there. Yes, we have emerged from the cramped passageway onto a flat-topped plateau, with a marvelous view of the countryside for miles around. Inward toward the center of the hill, stone walls again rise up before us, twenty-five feet high. There is a small covered-in gateway, so low we must stoop to go through, and here we are in the midst of what remains of this hill fortress. The nagging question still is, Who built it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Here are split-level floors, stone dividing walls, winding passages, and, to our left, a fenced-off area. Many evidences there are of alterations and inferior reconstructions. It is clear that more than one people has lived here. At the end of one long passage we emerge into the Western Enclosure. Here is a grand view of the valley below and the entire Temple Enclosure we visited earlier. Steep steps descend from here. But we will move over to the Eastern Enclosure, for it is said that this was the focal point of all the religious ceremonies of the ancient inhabitants of Zimbabwe.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>Speculations</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Among those who have investigated Zimbabwe there is wide divergence of opinion as to its age and use, so much so that the whole thing is still a riddle. There are those who claim that the whole complex is no more than 500-800 years old, and that it was built by a people native to Central Africa. Others, we have seen, propose a much more ancient history, linking it with Solomon and even the Phoenicians. They point to the similarity of these constructions to those of the Carthaginians. They claim that no primitive tribe could have devised the method of heating the granite rocks, pouring cold water on them so that they might crack into thin slabs from which the stones of this fortress city are built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Proponents of the “ancient” theory point to the evidences that the original builders must have been familiar with military and defensive engineering. How else could all of the massive ramparts, traverses, screen walls, intricate passageways and hidden entrances, sunken thoroughfares and parapets have been devised? The fact that the surrounding area was and still is gold-mining country is most suggestive. Hoards of mined gold and the readying of shipments to the coast would certainly require protection in a stronghold such as Zimbabwe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In earlier times the finding of curious birds carved in soapstone in the ruins of The Acropolis gave color to the idea that the sacred hawk of Egypt, also utilized by star and sun worshipers of the East, was revered by Zimbabwe’s builders. A considerable number of phalli were also discovered among these ruins. Certainly there were indications here of something quite different from the crude nature worship of Central Africa’s tribes. Still, the whole question baffles investigators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Old crucibles for melting gold have been found among these ruins. Modern miners in the area report having found crude implements in the old mine shafts, and believe that those early miners, for lack of pumping equipment, simply had to abandon mines whenever flooding occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Not to be overlooked is the possibility that in earlier times a number of men from a more advanced civilization came into this area and managed, for a time, to hold sway over some local tribes, putting them to work to build up this fortress and its surrounding habitations as a safe center for the accumulation of gold and its export.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Reverting again to the interesting chevron pattern that fringes the top of the eastern wall of the Temple Enclosure—it is notable that it extends for only some 265 feet, or that part of the wall receiving the rays of the rising sun during the summer solstice. A coincidence? At least, it is well known in archaeological circles that the chevron pattern occurs frequently— on Egyptian monuments, on Phoenician coins, as well as among many present-day African peoples. It is known to be a hieroglyph for water, and a symbol of fertility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">That Zimbabwe was once a thriving and populous center is noted from the fact that old stone ruins are to be encountered not alone throughout the entire valley but also within a radius of several miles. Whether these represent outposts of the main fortress or living quarters for the garrison or for miners is now difficult to determine. A completely satisfactory solution to the whole question continues to elude us.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>A Place of Quiet Meditation</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In these days of bustle and hurry, here is a spot for quiet meditation. Atop The Acropolis the only sound to be heard is the slight swish of the wind in the trees overhead. There is no one to interrupt as one gazes out over the veld, broken here and there by a granite kopje or hill. Mimosa, acacia, wisteria—all have their representatives here. And wild flowers abound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But now, the sun is setting rapidly. In this latitude darkness comes suddenly. It is time to take our leave, heading back the way we came to Fort Victoria. But not quickly will we forget this strange site, with its numerous baffling clues, its immensity, the quiet and peace that now enshroud it. If the stones could talk, what a story they might tell us! But we must take our leave of Zimbabwe, the riddle of Rhodesia.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Blinking</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">• The process of closing our eyelids and opening them is blinking. What useful function does this serve? It protects the eyes from Injury; it wipes the surface of the eyes clean; it helps regulate the amount of light that comes into the eyes; and it keeps fluid over the front of the eyes. How often do we blink? Most people blink on an average of about twenty-five times a minute.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"><img src="g_E_19690122_files/g_E_19690122-10.png" alt="" style="width:199pt;height:116pt;">
<p><span class="font21">W</span><span class="font16">OULD it not be strange for someone wicked to provide a ransom for a righteous person? Surely evil-minded, selfish men would hardly consider it worth while to help others voluntarily without also benefiting themselves. It is therefore contrary to their wishes that the words of Proverbs 21:18 are fulfilled upon them: “The wicked is a ransom for the righteous one; and the one dealing treacherously takes the place of the upright ones.” But how does this happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Generally speaking, those desirous of furthering their selfish interests, regardless of the harm done to their fellowman, would never of their own accord submit to an arrangement that would mean loss to themselves and gain for others. Deliverance for the righteous can therefore come only at the expense of those who would directly or indirectly injure or destroy them. There has to be a reversal of matters, with the righteous person being preserved at the cost of the life of the wicked one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A number of Bible examples illustrate how this has occurred in the past. For instance, in the time of the Medo-Persian Empire, high officials and satraps plotted against the prophet Daniel due to his having a very prominent governmental position. They succeeded in having King Darius sign an interdict that decreed death in the lions’ pit for persons petitioning any god or man, other than the king himself, for thirty days. But Daniel continued worshiping his God, Jehovah, petitioning him three times a day as had been his practice before the law was signed. Although thrown into the lions’ pit for transgressing this unjust decree, Daniel was delivered by an angel from certain death. Then came the reversal. King Darius ordered that the wicked schemers themselves be thrown into the lions’ pit. Their death ransomed or delivered Daniel from all possible future harm that they undoubtedly would have perpetrated, against him.—Dan. 6:1-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Similarly, at a later period, the lives of all the Jews were endangered. An Agagite named Haman was exalted to the position of prime minister during the reign of Persian King Ahasuerus (considered to be Xerxes I). Angered by the Jew Mordecai’s refusal to bow down to him, Haman sought the death of Mordecai and of all the other Jews in the empire. He misrepresented them to Ahasuerus as undesirable lawbreakers and then added: &quot;If to the king it does seem good, let there be a writing that they be destroyed; and ten thousand silver talents [about $14,235,900 in modem values] I shall pay into the hands of those doing the work by bringing it into the king’s treasury,” Thereafter Ahasuerus empowered Haman to issue a decree for the annihilation of all the Jews, &quot;young man as well as old man, little ones and women.”—Esther 3:1-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But soon the tables were turned on the plotter. Queen Esther, who was also Mordecai’s cousin, appealed to her husband Ahasuerus for her life and that of her people, and identified Haman as the originator of the murderous plot against them. The enraged king commanded that Haman be hanged on the very stake he had made for hanging Mordecai. The prime ministership was then given to Mordecai, and he and Esther later received royal authorization to draw up a counterdecree for the</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Jews to defend themselves against their enemies at the time the law for their extermination went into effect on Adar 13, When that day arrived the Jews stood for their lives and slaughtered those seeking their injury.—Esther 7:3-9:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Although Daniel and, later, Mordecai and the other Jews experienced an almost immediate ransoming or deliverance at the expense of their enemies, this is not always the case. During the nearly six thousand years of human history, wicked men have killed many righteous persons. Christ Jesus even said concerning his followers: “People will deliver you up to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be objects of hatred by all the nations on account of my name.”—Matt. 24:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But does the fact that God </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">allows the </span><span class="font16">righteous to suffer entitle them to rise up in revolt, forcing their oppressors to become a ransom for them? No. Even in the case of Daniel and that of Mordecai and his fellow Jews, deliverance came by legal means. They did not become a law to themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Similarly, true Christians today subject themselves to the governments ruling over them and appeal to these for relief from injustices. Since such governments exist by God’s permission, they rightly exercise authority to punish lawbreakers and can, as did Darius and Ahasuerus, deliver law-abiding persons at the expense of lawless ones.—Rom. 13:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Illustrating this is the experience recently had by Jehovah’s witnesses in one area of Cameroon (Africa). Local officials there arrested eleven of their number and tried to force them to sign statements renouncing their religion. About four weeks later one of Jehovah’s witnesses was murdered. After governmental investigation, much to the surprise of the populace, the local </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">depute</span><span class="font16"> (a member of the legislative assembly) was arrested and taken to prison. Other important officials were also arrested. At the trial the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">depute </span><span class="font16">confessed the murder and was subsequently sentenced to death. But before the scheduled execution he committed suicide in his prison cell. Others involved in the case received long prison sentences. On the other hand, those of Jehovah’s witnesses who had been unjustly imprisoned were released and encouraged to continue their preaching activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">However, even when the governmental authority refuses to render justice and becomes a persecutor of God’s faithful servants, this gives the Christian no basis for taking matters into his own hands. A very good reason for this is the fact that Christians cannot determine whether any opposer, even the worst persecutor, will remain such. One of the most zealous first-century Christians, the apostle Paul, said of his former course of life: “I was a blasphemer and a persecutor and an insolent man.” (1 Tim. 1:13) And today many onetime persecutors are now faithfully serving Jehovah God. Therefore, were Christians to retaliate in kind, they could actually harm persons who otherwise might have changed their ways and, like Paul, contributed .much to the advancement of true worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">So, when enduring persecution and other abuses at the hands of men, true Christians appreciate that God’s merciful forbearance is giving more persons the opportunity to abandon their wicked ways. (2 Pet. 3:9) Patiently they wait upon Jehovah God to take action against the willful </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">transgressors of his righteous laws. </span><span class="font16">Thus at the cost of the lives of the wicked, God’s faithful servants will forever be ransomed or delivered from tribulation at their hands.—2 Thess. 1:6-9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">A Declaration for Peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The first three of twenty-five &quot;Peace on Earth” International Assemblies of Jehovah’s Witnesses came to a dramatic close on July 13 when 234,546 persons heard the talk &quot;The Approaching Peace of a Thousand Years.&quot; In New York city at Yankee Stadium, the largest of the three assemblies, 122,011 persons filled the grandstand, the bleachers, the playing field and the tents outside to hear the talk in three languages. The other two assemblies were held at Atlanta, Georgia, and Buffalo, New York. Almost equally as dramatic was the previous day when 197,533 persons in the three cities declared themselves for peace. “Peace with the Creator of heaven and earth, by means of his long-promised kingdom of his Messiah—this is what we hold to be the key to an enduring peace for all the world of mankind,” said President Knorr. &quot;When we keep our peace with God, we can never be at war with our neighbors who are fellow creatures of God; peace with God and peace with our feliowman go together.” The 197,533 persons endorsed the Declaration as one man with a resounding &quot;I do!” A total of 5,576 persons were immersed at the three assemblies in symbol of their dedication to do Jehovah’s will. The week-long assemblies were a source of spiritual refreshment, leaving the Witnesses with a sense of urgency and renewed determination to remain faithful to God, declaring the kingdom of God as the only hope for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Churchmen Baek Violence</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&lt;§&gt; The World Council of Churches has been urged to support violence to overthrow political and economic tyranny. The 234 member churches proposed “that all else failing, the church and churches support resistance movements, including revolutions, which are aimed at elimination of political or economic tyranny which makes racism possible.” The consultative body included about 70 churchmen, black power advocates, sociologists and conservative thinkers from six continents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Costly Race into Space</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&lt;^&gt; The United States officially launched its all-out moon program on May 25, 1961. The goal was to beat Russia to the moon in a decade. The cost was high. A staggering $24,000,000,000 went into the Apollo program alone. It adds up to $472 for every American family. Almost 500,000 persons were required, in all 50 states. It also required the combined resources of 20,000 American business firms. Yet, American technology has not gone to work on its big cities to do as good a job on its slums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">More Than a Mechanism</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&lt;$&gt; That one’s heart involves more than merely a mechanism for pumping blood is indicated by some of the results of human heart transplants. Commenting on this, the Panama City Star </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">and Herald</span><span class="font14"> drew attention to observations made by a member of the hearttransplant team at Stanford University, saying: “A psychiatrist, Dr, Lunde says that five of the 13 people who received heart transplants at Stanford last year developed severe post-operative psychosis [profound disorganization of mind, personality or behavior]. There were also less dramatic effects, such as change in selfimage, One 42-year-Old man decided he had become 20— the age of his heart donor.” The editorial went on to say: “Since medical science began to flourish in the last century, mankind has become increasingly convinced that the human body is just a mechanism. The idea of slipping in new spare parts to keep the mechanism operating is a result of this simplistic conception. ... If all men understood how miraculous is the human body they take for granted, perhaps man would have more respect for himself and for other human beings,&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">More illegitimate children are being born in New Zealand and the rate of increase is higher than in many other countries. A report says the illegitimate births formed 12.7 percent of total births in New Zealand in 1967, compared with only 8 percent five years before. Comparable figures given for other countries were: Canada, 4.8 to 7.6 percent; Britain, 6.6 to 8.4; United States, 5.9 to 8.4, and Australia, 5.4 to 7.7. Sweden showed an increase from 12.4 to 14.6 percent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">&lt;$&gt; Drilling and testing operations began on the American Falls at Niagara during the last week of June. Geologists and engineers are seeking ways to lessen the pace of erosion and to remove broken rocks from the base. A temporary dam has diverted the flow of 4,500,000 gallons of water a minute to the much larger Horseshoe Falls. Major slides in 1931 and 1954 have left more than 260,000 tons of broken rock beneath the falls. The falls are to remain waterless until December 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The Pope Is No Peter</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Roman Catholic Primate of Belgium, Leon-Joseph Cardinal Suenens, stated that “the institution of the Papacy today needs credibility, and the first step to achieve it would be for the Pope to be elected by representatives of the universal church—not only cardinals and bishops, for I would gladly see the laity adequately included among the electors.” “The Pope today does not give the general impression of being Peter’s successor,” he said, “but rather the successor of Emperors and political sovereigns,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Convents Imperiled</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The number of Roman Catholic girls entering convents in America has fallen off at an alarming rate during the past few years. One of the larger communities of nuns, the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, reported the number of novices has dropped from 61 in 1966 to six in 1968. At another large order there were 114 novices entering the convent in 1965 compared to only 35 in 1968. A former nun said the decline is due to the church changing too slowly, stating: “I felt I couldn’t wait 20 more years for the church to change.” A Catholic journalist said that if the drop-off continues at present rates, it could threaten the very structure of orders of sisters. Nationally, the number of Roman Catholic sisters has declined steadily since 1965, from 181,421 nuns to 167,167 in 1968.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Noise Can Make You Sick</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">■$&gt; Noise can make you sick both physically and mentally. Experiments have shown that unwanted sound can cause a variety of ills ranging from ulcers to hives. The fact that noise can cause </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">hearing loss </span><span class="font14">has been known for a long time. Noise has a definite detrimental effect on the mind. Listening to rock 'n' roll music raises the blood pressure so high that it is dangerous to elderly persons. Noise that interferes with sleep is a threat both physically and mentally. It lessens the body's resistance to disease and physical stress. A person who is not permitted to dream, even for only a short time, may develop psychoses, hallucinations, suicidal and homicidal impulses and nightmarish memories, according to Dr. Julius Buchwald of the State University of New York’s Downstate Medical Center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Commercial “Pilgrimages”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&lt;$&gt; A concerned Roman Catholic layman says that the piety of millions of American Catholics is being exploited cynically by hard-sell advertising. Bruce Hutchinson of California said that he was perturbed especially about what he calls “the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Pilgrimages&quot; and</span><span class="font14"> “Catholic tours” that are extensively advertised in Catholic publications. The ads that promote them, he says, are &quot;profoundly hypocritical” because “they are in fact selling a secular product, a vacation trip, by presenting it to us as a religious act, a pilgrimage.” Each pilgrimage generally has a “spiritual director,” usually a priest who gets the trip free. The idea of having a priest along suggests somehow an aura of holiness to the entire trip. &quot;It is deceiving and exploiting us, stamping a secular pursuit with the seal of the church and persuading countless good Catholics that their trip to Fatima or Glacier National Park is a response to Christ’s call for penance,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Skyscraper for Paris</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Until recently, Paris buildings were limited to 12 stories. But starting in September, a 58-story building is to be constructed on the site of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">former Montparnasse railway </span><span class="font14">station.

The journey from Dover to Boulogne takes about 35 minutes. The hovercrafts now in use carry 254 passengers and 30 cars. During the peak vacation month of August, the schedule Is to be stepped up to 50 crossings a day. The hovercraft has cut </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">by</span><span class="font14"> almost </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">two-thirds the time </span><span class="font14">taken to cross the Channel by ferry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Parents may not be obligated to provide their offspring with a secure future, states Dr. S. E. Rosenberg of Canada, “but they are surely obliged to </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">give them a secure</span><span class="font14"> foundation on which to build their future.” He then quotes the words of Dorothy Law: “If a child lives with criticism—he learns to condemn; if a child lives with hostility—he learns to fight; if a child lives with fear—he learns to be apprehensive; if a child lives with pity—he learns to be sorry for himself; if a child lives with ridicule—he learns to be shy; if a child lives with jealousy— he learns to feel guilty; if a child lives with tolerance—he learns to be patient; if a child</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Ilves with encouragement—he learns to be confident; if a child lives with praise—he learns to be appreciative; if a child lives with acceptance —he learns to love; if a child lives with recognition—he learns it is good to have a goal; if a child lives with honesty—he learns what truth is; if a child lives with security —he learns to have faith in himself and others.” The Bible says; &quot;Train up a boy according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it.”—Prov. 22:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">2,700-Percent Rise in Cost</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">If Americans are wondering why they are paying such high taxes, perhaps a quick glance at the rising costs of military hardware might provide some explanation. A Pentagon official testified on June 11 that the Minuteman 2 missile was expected to cost almost $4,000,000,000 more than was originally estimated and that the price of a rescue submarine had increased 2,700 percent. Many a taxpayer wonders why there appear to be growing sums for weapons of death , and destruction, but relatively little to combat poverty and disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Employee Drug Abuse</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">&lt;$&gt; There are published reports that say three out of every four companies with 50 or more employees may have a drug-abuse problem, according to Frank E. Bird, director of corporate safety and security for Insurance Co. of North America. Bird said that younger employees, between the ages qf 20 and 30, present the greatest drug problems. He cited a report that said 60 percent of all American soldiers with Asiatic service use drugs. Some insurance companies may require a special pre-employment physical examination to determine whether or not those who have served in the war in Vietnam use drugs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Shoplifting Losses</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Last year, 1968, stores registered record losses, estimated to be as much as $10X100,000,000. This does not include losses from fraud, systematic theft, burglary and armed robbery. These losses come from two sources: pilfering (defined as employee theft) and shoplifting. Most shoplifting is done by am ateur s—mainly teenagers. More and more store operators realize that tough action must be taken. When shoplifters are now apprehended, a greater number are arrested and charged despite their age.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Why?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">With the world torn more and more by discord and confusion, how is that possible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">With man's efforts failing on every hand to restore peace and security, with what confidence for the future?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The answer is one that brings real assurance because it is founded on the Bible. After describing the unprecedented violence and world turmoil the Bible says: “As these things start to occur, raise yourselves erect and lift your heads up, because </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">your deliverance is getting near.&quot;—</span><span class="font16">Luke 21:28.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">What can you do to make certain you will benefit?</span></p>

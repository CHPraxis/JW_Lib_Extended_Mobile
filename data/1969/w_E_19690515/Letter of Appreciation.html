<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● A congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses in Florida received this heartwarming and encouraging letter:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I just have to thank you for your kindness in the past, by stopping at my house and leaving copies of your wonderful publication for me. Your unselfishness in the giving of time for a good cause is really something rare in this world.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I do feel, however, that in order to keep your good work going, those of us who cannot give of their time must also help in some way or other. Please accept, therefore, the herewith enclosed small contribution together with my best wishes.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“And please extend my special thanks and appreciation to Miss S———— K———— for making it a point to see to it that I did receive copies of <em>The Watchtower </em>regularly.”</p>

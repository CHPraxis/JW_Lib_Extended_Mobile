WOULD YOU BELIEVE. . . ?
Would you believe that events of history over 2,500 years ago have a direct bearing on your life? They do! And they involve a city and an empire that once dominated the world, yet that now lie in ruins. These events, and others surrounding them, form the basis of much of the material of one of the least understood books of the Bible, the highly prophetical and symbolical book of Revelation, or The Apocalypse as it is sometimes called. Their modern-day importance was also foretold by the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah and Daniel. Now you can understand the significance of these events to us. Read how they involve the lives of everyone today. Send for and read the 704-page book “Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules! It is only 75c.
FIELD MINISTRY
“Give us more faith”—this is the request made at one time to Jesus Christ by his apostles. (Luke 17:5) But how can one get more faith and keep it “growing exceedingly”? (2 Thess. 1:3) Well, what is faith? It is not mere expectation but is assured expectation. The only way to get this assurance is from a study of the Word of God. By regularly feeding upon God’s Word, one’s expectation regarding all of God’s wonderful promises gets all the more certain. Jehovah’s witnesses are keenly interested in helping all persons who wish to get more faith. To do this, they offer a free home Bible-study course of six months, using as an aid for such Bible discussion the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. They will be using this book during the month of May in their house-to-house ministry, offering it for only 25c.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Does general acceptance make an idea right? Countless mistaken beliefs of the past answer No. What, then, of the current, popular view of man’s origin, the doctrine of evolution? Have you ever examined it carefully and analytically? Have you ever critically considered the evidences advanced in its favor? Or have you always accepted it in the belief there is no other explanation of man’s origin? There is another side to the question, an extremely factual and reasonable one. You owe it to yourself to investigate. Read the 192-page, hardbound book <em>Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? </em>You will be glad you did. Send only 25c.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">True worship has never been popular. The Bible shows that the true followers of the Lord Jesus Christ would be hated by all nations. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:9-40:24:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:9</a>) Hence faithful Christians need to answer the challenge to true worship raised by the forces of nationalism. The early Christians answered the challenge by preaching despite opposition; they said: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:29-44:5:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>) Jehovah’s witnesses answer the challenge to true worship in the same manner: They steadfastly preach the good news of God’s kingdom, obeying God as ruler. To announce Jehovah’s kingdom during March, these Christian witnesses will be offering this fine Bible-study aid, <em>The Watchtower, </em>on a subscription basis, for a year, for just $1.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Noting how evolutionists assert theory to be fact without evidence, the book <em>The Biblical Flood and the Ice Epoch, </em>on page 240, states: “Darwin presented his hunches about heredity as scientific findings; they were not very scientific. . . . If he is considered a propagandist rather than an educator or scientist, then his assertiveness and almost messianic self-assurance becomes understandable. With his self-assured attitude, he considered verification unnecessary. And without verification, other academic figures promoted Darwin’s ideas vigorously.”</p>

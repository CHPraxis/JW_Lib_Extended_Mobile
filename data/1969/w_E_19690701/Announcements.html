<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">True happiness comes, not from the mere possession of material things, but rather from the worship of the true God, Jehovah. Jehovah is “the happy God,” and happy are those who worship him! Said the inspired psalmist: “Happy is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he has chosen as his inheritance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:11-54:1:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:12-19:33:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 33:12</a>) Happy people like to share their happiness with others. And this is especially true of Jehovah’s people! Since the basis for happiness is spirituality, Jehovah’s witnesses will be sharing spiritual good things with their neighbors during July by offering them the fine Bible-study aid <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, </em>for only 25c.</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
True happiness comes, not from the mere possession of material things, but rather from the worship of the true God, Jehovah. Jehovah is “the happy God,” and happy are those who worship him! Said the inspired psalmist: “Happy is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he has chosen as his inheritance.” (1 Tim. 1:11; Ps. 33:12) Happy people like to share their happiness with others. And this is especially true of Jehovah’s people! Since the basis for happiness is spirituality, Jehovah’s witnesses will be sharing spiritual good things with their neighbors during July by offering them the fine Bible-study aid The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, for only 25c.
THE “ANSWER BOX”
Having a copy of the fine Bible-study aid The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life is almost like having the teacher’s “Answer Book” for a difficult school course. The difference is that every Bible student is entitled to a copy of The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. In fact, we urge you to obtain one. Difficult Bible questions are clearly answered in a way that will make the Bible seem like an open book. You will obtain an understanding of God’s purpose for this earth and why he has permitted wickedness. You will be able to see your own future in the light of Bible prophecy and what you must do to find security in the perilous times ahead. Send today. Sent postpaid for 25c.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Would you be willing to sacrifice something that is precious to you in behalf of a friend? Likely you would. But what about those who are strangers? One of the most precious assets, time, is being sacrificed by over one million of Jehovah’s witnesses largely in behalf of those they have not previously known. They delight to do this, for it enables them to offer public declaration to God and his name, bringing praise to Him and blessings to those who listen to the Bible’s comforting message. During November not only will they spend time offering the Bible-study-aid book, <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, </em>on a contribution of 25c, but they will also conduct a free home Bible study with anyone who desires to learn about God and his provisions for salvation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>INVITATION TO A NEW PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“In almost all countries throughout the world the doctrine of evolution is taught. School textbooks on biology and history present evolution as established fact. Evolutionary teaching saturates science, philosophy, history and even religion today. Whenever the subject of the origin of life and man is discussed, it is almost always presented in evolutionary terms. But what do you personally know of the evidence for or against the belief in evolution? Does it really harmonize with the facts of science? We invite your careful examination of this matter, as it has a direct bearing on your life and your future.” This foreword by the publishers of the book <em>Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? </em>is a challenge to thinking persons. Are you willing to accept this invitation? Send today. The book is sent postpaid for 25c.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What would you do if you knew that your friends, loved ones and neighbors were in danger of losing their lives? You would warn them, would you not? This is what Jehovah’s witnesses are now doing in helping people to see what the Bible says about the impending destruction of this system of things and how they can enjoy God’s protection during that time. Jehovah’s witnesses are happy to assist lovers of truth by means of a free home Bible study. Throughout December they will also be offering to interested persons a copy of <em>the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </em>along with the 192-page book <em>Is the Bible Really the Word of God?, </em>for $1.25.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>NEW UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIBLE TEXT</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If you are a person keenly interested in an accurate understanding of the Bible, you will want the new <em>Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures</em>. This fine edition of the Christian Greek Scriptures or the so-called New Testament enables you to get at the root meanings of the Greek words themselves. This is made possible by means of an interlinear word-for-word rendering of the Greek text, both of which are printed in one column on the page with the <em>New World Translation </em>opposite. Comparisons between the two readings enable you to get the full meaning of the Greek text, thus a better understanding of God’s Word. Send for your copy today. It is only $2.</p>

Employment of Early Christians
✔ In his book The Horizon History of Christianity, Roland H. Bainton tells how the early Christians were restricted with regard to employment. They did not want to get involved with idolatry or false religion in any respect. Bainton, who was Professor of Ecclesiastical History at Yale University, writes:
“Not only must the Christian not practice idolatry, he must not contribute to idolatry by assisting in any way in the making of idols. He might be a sculptor, but he must not carve images of the gods. He was restricted, therefore, to the decorative aspects of tombs or monuments, but even here might not carve a lion, a whale, or a bull—or gild any figure—if it represented a god.”—P. 64.

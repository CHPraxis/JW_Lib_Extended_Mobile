<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There is no greater comfort in the world today than that which comes from the Holy Scriptures. In fact, the Bible makes it plain that it is through the comfort and encouragement drawn from the Scriptures that true Christians have a glorious hope. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>) Having gained this hope-inspiring comfort from God’s Word, Jehovah’s witnesses unselfishly want to share it with others. They want others to come to know “the God of all comfort,” Jehovah, so that they also may gain the precious hope of life everlasting. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:3, 4</a>) During February these Christian witnesses will share the comfort from the Scriptures by offering in their house-to-house ministry a year’s subscription for <em>The Watchtower, </em>for just $1.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">On Tuesday, April 1, 1969, after 6 p.m. Standard Time, all congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses earth wide will assemble to celebrate the Lord’s Evening Meal. This they do in obedience to Jesus’ instructions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 22:19, 20</a>) All readers of <em>The Watchtower </em>are invited to be present for this most important occasion. Those of the remnant of Christ’s anointed followers will partake of the emblematic bread and wine, while those of the “other sheep” will be present as respectful and obedient observers. Your presence will enable you to benefit richly from the Scriptural matters considered at that time.</p>

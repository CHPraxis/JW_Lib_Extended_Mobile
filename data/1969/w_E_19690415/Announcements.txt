FIELD MINISTRY
Some nineteen hundred years ago Jesus Christ foresaw the greatest preaching work in all history. He foretold that his true followers would preach the good news of God’s kingdom “in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.” (Matt. 24:14) In 200 lands around the earth, and in 165 languages, Jehovah’s witnesses are giving this witness about the established kingdom of God. What a prophet Jesus was to foresee such earth-wide preaching! Jesus’ prophecy is really an invitation to enter the work of giving a witness worthy of the Kingdom. Will you respond? To help interested persons do so, Jehovah’s witnesses during the month of April will be offering them a year’s subscription for the magazine that announces Jehovah’s kingdom, The Watchtower, with three booklets, for just $1.

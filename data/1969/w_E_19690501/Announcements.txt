IF YOU VALUE TRUTH. . . !
Truth is usually controversial. Yet even in these days of extreme views, of major confrontations on almost every issue, truth is rarely used to implement an argument. That is because truth is also honest, just and impartial. Jesus said: “The truth will set you free.” If you value truth, if you want honest answers to the many questions perplexing mankind today, then you should read the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. This 192-page, hardbound, pocket-size book relies on the highest authority. It goes to the source of truth. It is based on the Bible. Send for your copy today. It is only 25c.
FIELD MINISTRY
“Give us more faith”—this is the request made at one time to Jesus Christ by his apostles. (Luke 17:5) But how can one get more faith and keep it “growing exceedingly”? (2 Thess. 1:3) Well, what is faith? It is not mere expectation but is assured expectation. The only way to get this assurance is from a study of the Word of God. By regularly feeding upon God’s Word, one’s expectation regarding all of God’s wonderful promises gets all the more certain. Jehovah’s witnesses are keenly interested in helping all persons who wish to get more faith. To do this, they offer a free home Bible-study course of six months, using as an aid for such Bible discussion the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. They will be using this book during the month of May in their house-to-house ministry, offering it for only 25c.

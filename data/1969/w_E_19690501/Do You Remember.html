<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>● What twofold fruitage should a baptized Christian seek to produce?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The fruitage of God’s spirit outlined in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>, and the fruitage of Kingdom preaching, which results in new disciples.—P. 51.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>● How are we to understand the words at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:15-54:2:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 2:15</strong></a><strong>, that women would “be kept safe through childbearing”?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Bearing children would be a safeguard in keeping women occupied with worthwhile activities about their homes. Coupled with their ministry, such would help them avoid the troubles that trap untheocratic women.—Pp. 63, 64.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Farmers know that to get a bumper crop of good grain it is necessary to sow good seed. This is true in everything we do, is it not? We reap what we sow. The Bible says: “He who is sowing with a view to his flesh will reap corruption from his flesh.” The converse is also true: “He who is sowing with a view to the spirit will reap everlasting life from the spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:8-48:6:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gal. 6:8</a>) To know how to sow with a view to the spirit and to reap spiritually, it is necessary to know what God’s Word says and to apply its principles. Jehovah’s witnesses are interested in providing people with a Bible, as well as an understanding of it. Hence in their house-to-house ministry in June, they will be offering a copy of the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>for $1; or they may combine the Bible and a copy of the book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, </em>for $1.25.</p>

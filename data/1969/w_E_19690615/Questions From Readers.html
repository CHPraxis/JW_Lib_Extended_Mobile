<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Did Jesus tell the apostle Peter to forgive seventy-seven (77) times, or seventy times seven (490)?—A. L., U.S.A.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This question is based on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:21-40:18:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 18:21, 22</a>. In the <em>New World Translation </em>those verses read: “Peter came up and said to [Jesus]: ‘Lord, how many times is my brother to sin against me and am I to forgive him? Up to seven times?’ Jesus said to him: ‘I say to you, not, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy-seven times.’”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As can be seen, in this modern and careful translation, Jesus tells Peter to forgive seventy-seven (77) times. And there are good reasons for this rendering. However, there is no need to be dogmatic as to Jesus’ answer. A noted professor of Greek, A. T. Robertson, observed: “It is not clear whether this idiom means seventy-seven or as the Revised Version has it (490 times).”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">By taking note of Jesus’ answer as found in Greek manuscripts we can appreciate the problem. <span id="page384" class="pageNum" data-no="384" data-before-text="384"></span>Christ’s reply was <em>hebdomekontakis hepta, </em>which is literally translated “seventy times seven.” The difficulty arises with the suffix <em>kis </em>added to the word for seventy, <em>hebdomekonta. </em>In Greek this suffix is used in two ways. It can be used as a multiple meaning ‘times.’ So ‘seven times seven’ (7 x 7) would be <em>heptakis hepta. </em>But <em>kis </em>can also be added as a suffix to indicate ‘times’ in the sense of occurrences or instances. For example, ‘How many times did the boy fall?’ ‘He fell seven times (<em>heptakis</em>)<em>.’ </em>Hence, the problem is whether Jesus’ answer, “seventy times seven,” should be understood as ‘seventy times (multiplied by) seven’ or ‘seventy and seven times (occurrences).’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">One reason for preferring the latter, and rendering it as in the <em>New World Translation, </em>is the form of Peter’s question. He did not use <em>posas, </em>meaning ‘how many?’ Rather, he asked <em>posakis—</em>‘how many <em>times?’ </em>Then he continued, ‘Up to <em>heptakis?’ </em>that is, ‘Up to seven <em>times?’ </em>Logically Jesus would respond in accord with Peter’s phraseology. He would answer, ‘Up to seventy-seven <em>times.’</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Lending additional weight to the rendering “seventy-seven times” is the account in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:24-1:4:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 4:24</a>. Jehovah had stated that he would avenge seven times any who harmed Cain. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:15-1:4:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 4:15</a>) Later Cain’s descendant Lamech boastfully said: “If seven times Cain is to be avenged, then Lamech seventy times <em>and </em>seven.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:24-1:4:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 4:24</a>) The Hebrew text is exact in showing this as 70 times <em>and </em>7, or 77 times. But what is an equivalent in Greek? The Greek <em>Septuagint </em>uses <em>hebdomekontakis hepta. </em>Since this is the precise expression found in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:22-40:18:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 18:22</a>, it suggests that “seventy-seven times” is the way Jesus’ reply to Peter should be rendered.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">It might be added that it is quite possible that Christ had Lamech’s threat in mind. What a fine contrast Jesus’ words would be! Instead of being a braggart threatening vengeance seventy-seven times, a Christian should be the opposite, forgiving seventy-seven times. Jesus emphasized that we should not be hesitant to forgive, but liberal and ready to forgive. He said earlier: “Happy are the merciful, since they will be shown mercy.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:7-40:5:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 5:7</a>.</p>

Bible Truth Makes Changes
● At the close of their second home Bible study with Jehovah’s witnesses, a couple accepted the invitation to attend the Bible meetings of the Witnesses. They came to the Sunday meeting and have come for eight consecutive Sundays. The wife of the interested man took the Witness aside and said to her: “I cannot get over my husband. I could never get him to church before. He would always sleep in on Sunday mornings and now he is the first one ready to come to the Kingdom Hall.”

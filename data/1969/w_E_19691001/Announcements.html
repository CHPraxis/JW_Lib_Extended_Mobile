<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Spiritual warefare! This is the warfare for true Christians: “The weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful by God for overturning strongly entrenched things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:10:4-47:10:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 10:4</a>) Among those strongly entrenched things against which Christians wage spiritual war are Babylonish teachings of false religion. Against these Babylonish ideas, Jehovah’s witnesses wield the “sword of the spirit,” the Word of God. Also helping in maintaining the assault on false religion are the publications of the Watch Tower Society. For example, <em>Awake! </em>magazine last April featured a special issue entitled “Are the Churches Nearing Their End?” Each issue of <em>Awake!, </em>in fact, helps Christians in their spiritual warfare. As they maintain the assault on false religion during October, Jehovah’s witnesses will offer a year’s subscription for the <em>Awake! </em>magazine, with three Bible-study-aid booklets, on a contribution of $1.</p>

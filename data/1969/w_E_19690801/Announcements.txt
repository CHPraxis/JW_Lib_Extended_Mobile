FIELD MINISTRY
Zeal for a cause is contagious. Those who possess such zeal stimulate others to action. The apostle Paul was such a zealous one that, when he spoke or wrote, others were stirred up to preach more actively the good news of the Kingdom. (1 Cor. 11:1) Moved by the words of Paul to imitate him even as he imitated the Lord Jesus Christ, Jehovah’s witnesses zealously preach the Kingdom good news from house to house. As they do this during the month of August, they will be presenting the fine Bible-study aid The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, for just 25c.
WILL DEATH ALWAYS BE?
Why does man have to die? From birth we know our days will be few, even as Moses wrote in a psalm over three thousand years ago: “In themselves the days of our years are seventy years; and if because of special mightiness they are eighty years, yet their insistence is on trouble and hurtful things; for it must quickly pass by, and away we fly.” (Ps. 90:10) Why is our life-span so short? with so much to learn and so much to enjoy? How could this possibly be God’s will for us? Will it always be this way? These questions have troubled serious-minded men for centuries, though the answers are in the Bible. Learn for yourself through the aid of the two valuable books The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life and Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God. Both for only 75c. Send today.

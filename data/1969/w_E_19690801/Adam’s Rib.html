<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Bible says: “Jehovah God had a deep sleep fall upon the man and, while he was sleeping, he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place. And Jehovah God proceeded to build the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman and to bring her to the man.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:21-1:2:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 2:21, 22</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Some persons have wondered whether this meant that Adam was short a rib, thus being incomplete. No, it does not mean necessarily that Adam lived his life with one less rib than he had when he was created by God. The rib bones, unlike others, can replace themselves. In a reply from the University of Berne, Professor K. Lenggenhager commented in this connection, saying:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I can inform you that a rib, that has been removed, but whose periosteum has been left, forms itself again [or grows again]. If, however, the periosteum is removed along with the rib, the bone then does not renew itself. Usually, when ribs are removed in surgery, the periosteum is preserved, except in the case of malignant rib tumor.”</p>

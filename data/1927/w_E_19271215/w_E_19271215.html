<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HIS journal is published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society for the purpose of aiding the people to understand the divine plan. It provides systematic Bible study in which all its readers may regularly engage. It gives announcement of the visits made to Bible classes by traveling speakers, announces conventions, and gives reports thereof. It announces radio programs and publishes suitable Bible instruction for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It adheres strictly to the Bible as God’s revealed Word of Truth. It stands firmly upon the great ransom sacrifice as the fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines are measured. It is free from parties, sects and creeds of men. It does not assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a careful examination of its utterances in the light of the infallible Word of God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its columns are not open to personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JEHOVAH </span><span class="font4">is the only true God, the Maker of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT </span><span class="font4">for many centuries God, through Christ, has been</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">heaven and earth, and is from everlasting to everlasting; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation; that the Logos became a man; that he is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT GOD </span><span class="font4">created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death ; that by reason of Adam’s wrongful act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JESUS </span><span class="font4">was made a human being in order that he might become the Redeemer of man ; that he gave his life a sacrifice for man and thereby produced the ransom price; that Jesus the divine arose from the dead, ascended into heaven, and presented the value of his human sacrifice as the redemptive price for man.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Some have apparently misconstrued what </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> stated about Sunday meetings. The suggestion was that the morning be given to service. All classes should arrange for a meeting on Sunday afternoon to which any one might be invited, and Sunday evening a Berean study. If some classes find it more convenient to have their study in the afternoon and the meeting in the evening, do it accordingly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;______________</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">YEAR BOOK 1928</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font4"> for 1928 is being prepared. It contains a complete report of the president to the annual meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year text for 1928 is “Sing forth the honor of his name.” (Psalm 66:2) This text is especially appropriate to selecting from amongst men the members of his church, which constitutes the body of Christ; that the mission of the church is to follow in the footsteps of her Lord Christ Jesus, grow in his likeness, give testimony to the name and plan of Jehovah God. and ultimately be glorified with Christ Jesus in his heavenly kingdom; that Christ, Head and body, constitutes the “seed of Abraham” through which all the families of the earth shall be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE WORLD HAS ENDED; </span><span class="font4">that the Lord Jesus has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations and peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE HOPE </span><span class="font4">of the peoples of earth is restoration to human perfection during the reign of Christ; that the reign of Christ will afford opportunity to every man to have a fair trial for life and those who obey will live on earth for ever in a state of happiness.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>ONE REASON FOR GOD’S VENGEANCE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Isaiah</span><span class="font5"> £4</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH has made it clear by his Word that he intends to express his vengeance against the present evil world. Many reasons may be assigned vhy God should punish the earth. At this time consideration is given to the above scripture wherein is stated: “They have broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> A covenant is properly defined as a solemn agreement to do or not to do the things therein specified. A covenant may be made by only one party, and is then called a unilateral covenant because only the one is obligated to perform the conditions named. A covenant made between two parties may be made by expressed words of agreement or by implication. Where there are two parties to the covenant it is called a bilateral covenant, because both parties are bound by the terms thereof. If one party binds himself by expressing the terms in. the covenant, and the other party accepts the benefit thereof and attempts to perform any part thereof, the latter is bound by all the terms of the covenant by reason of his course of ac.tion. It is implied from his course of action that he fully assents to the agreement or covenant. Otherwise stated, he cannot willingly accept the benefits of the covenant without being bound by every part of the covenant. These abstract rules apply to the covenant under consideration herein.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">EVERLASTING COVENANT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> The above text states: “'They have broken tne everlasting covenant.” What is that everlasting covenant? When was it made, and between whom was it made ? Is there more than one everlasting covenant mentioned in the Scriptures ? The last question may be answered with certainty that there is no one covenant mentioned in the Scriptures as the everlasting covenant to the exclusion of all other covenants mentioned. In fact there are several covenants mentioned in the Scriptures as “the everlasting covenant”. Such covenants do last for ever, because God does not change from his fixed purposes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> The Scriptural record does not disclose any specific covenant God made with Adam. He told Adam what he might eat and what he might not eat and what would be the penalty for a violation of these instructions. Later, Adam’s son Cain deliberately killed his brother. Why did not God put Cain to death for that wrongful act? The laws of God are rules of action, and his laws do not change. Subsequently in a specified statement of his law he declared: “Thou shalt not kill.” The act of Cain was surely a violation of God’s law. Cain, however, could not have known of that law until God had given expression to it. God had made no agreement with him that he should refrain from murder, and therefore had not expressed his law concerning such crime. That would seem a good reason why God permitted Cain to live on for some time after his crime, and put a mark upon him so that no other man should kill him.—Genesis 4:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> The first place in the Bible mention is made of a covenant is Genesis 6:18. There God told Noah that he would establish his covenant with him concerning the ark and that the ark should be a means of preservation of Noah and his family. Noah was the first man with whom God made an expressed covenant.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LIFE SACRED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> The flood having ended, Noah and his family came forth from the ark. Noah builded an altar and offered his burnt offerings of beasts and fowls thereupon unto the Lord. Then God blessed Noah and his sons and commanded that they should be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth. At the same time God entered into a covenant with Noah, which covenant included every living creature; and that covenant is designated by the Lord: “The everlasting covenant.” It was on that occasion that God declared his law concerning life. It is manifest from the record that Noah and his offspring have ever since claimed some of the benefits of the covenant made on that occasion, and therefore Noah and all his offspring are bound by all the terms of the covenant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> God told Noah that every living creature should be meat unto him; but that he must not eat the blood, because the life is in the blood. “And the fear of you, and the dread of you, shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that mov-cth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.” —Genesis 9 : </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Without doubt the words of verse six above quoted form a part of that covenant, and establish the everlasting rule that God is the Giver of life and that no one can with impunity take life except by authority or permission of God as his servant or executioner. Later, God gave his statutes, which are a specific expression of his law, to the Israelites. Therein it was expressly set forth: “Thou shalt not kill.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> So carefully did the law of God safeguard human life that if one killed another accidentally or unawares or unwittingly without any malice, hatred or wrongful intent, he was subject to be put to death for his act, but by fleeing to the city of refuge he would thereby be spared from death.—Numbers 35:11-28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The terms of the law expressed in the covenant with Noah plainly indicate that no one can promiscuously slay animals or any creature merely that he might gratify a whim to kill. He may properly take the life of animals for necessary food for the preservation of himself or family. Verses five and six above quoted, and which form a part of the covenant and the most important part thereof, is a solemn expression of God’s will concerning the sanctity of life. In substance God there </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">eovs</span><span class="font5"> that he made man in his own image and gave him life, and that no one can take away that life rightfully except by permission and under the direction of Jehovah as his executioner. If a man assumes the responsibility of taking human life, then God’s law is that the slayer shall be slain by man; and the slayer is called the avenger of blood or executioner.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> When God specifically gave his law to Israel he emphasized the meaning thereof by stating it in more explicit terms. He speaks of the blood that is unrighteously shed as defiling the land. “For blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.”—Numbers 35: 33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> This is exactly in accord with the statement made by the Prophet Isaiah in the text first above cited, and both of such scriptural statements relate back to the terms of the covenant which God made with Noah concerning the sanctity of human life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> In the covenant with Noah God promised that never again should there come upon the earth a flood of waters to destroy all flesh. But that is not all of the covenant. It seems that man has proceeded generally upon the theory that he can always claim benefits of this part cf the covenant without being responsible for the other part. Men and nations that have claimed the benefit of that part of the covenant with relationship to the preservation of all flesh from destruction by the flood are bound by every part of the covenant, even though many have thought that that part is all of the covenant. If to refrain from destroying all flesh by a flood of water is all the covenant, then God could keep that covenant and at the same time destroy all flesh by some other means should he deem that necessary. There would therefore not be much consolation in the promise that the earth should be preserved from a flood when there are so many other means of destruction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> The very language employed in the covenant shows that the promise that there should never again be a great flood was not the most important part of the covenant. God said: “And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.”—Genesis 9:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> The entire context must be taken here and that which is expressed as the law is necessarily a part of the covenant. Be it observed that God said: “I will establish my covenant with you,” and then shows that refraining from a flood was a part thereof.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>36</sup> The covenant also included every creature that has life. To remind man of the covenant a token thereof was given. “And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations : I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you, and every living cieature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.”-—Genesis 9 :12-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> The rainbow is the token of the covenant made and what it embraces. It is a token of the sanctity of life. Men looking upon that token and understanding it would know that it -means that life is a sacred thing and shall not be taken without just authority from Jehovah. The rainbow is the token of the entire covenant, as is plainly shown by the Lord’s words: “Thia is the token of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">covenant,</span><span class="font5"> which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.”—Genesis 9:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> It is manifest that God intended that when man looks upon the rainbow he shall call to mind that life proceeds from Jehovah, that life is a sacred thing, and that it cannot be taken with impunity. This is an everlasting covenant because God calls it the everlasting covenant and because it must stand for ever. God will never change his expressed rule concerning sanctity of life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE EARTH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>39</sup> God’s prophet says: “The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof,” and then states that one reason for its being defiled is “because they... have broken the everlasting covenant”. Symbolically, earth means the visible organization or form of government among men on the earth. World includes both heaven and earth, that is to say, both the visible and invisible part of Satan’s organization. “The inhabitants thereof” specifically refer to the people who sympathize with and support the ruling factors constituting the earth. The financial element has assumed the responsibility of ruling the people, and that element must likewise shoulder the responsibility of a proper consideration of the interests and rights of the people within the meaning of God’s law. This would especially apply to nations that claim to recognize Jehovah and Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> God has not attempted to regulate the affairs of the rulers of earth, but he holds such rulers responsible in proportion to the knowledge they have or opportunity of acquiring knowledge of the terms of his law. God’s covenant with Noah included all the living creatures on the earth. It was his official covenant because it announced his law. The breaking of the covenant time and again by the rulers and inhabitants of the earth has resulted in defiling the earth. The prophet therefore assigns the breaking of the everlasting covenant as one of the reasons of God’s wrath against the organizations of men on the earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">COVENANT-BREAKERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> Jehovah God is the great Creator and the Life-giver of creatures. He is the source of life. Every living creature has an inherent right to such measure of life as God has permitted that creature to have. Any one who deprives another of life contrary to God’s appointed way is a covenant-breaker.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> Chief among the covenant-breakers among men have been the rulers of the earth. Satan of course has induced them to take such a wrongful course. But that does not release them from responsibility. Lucifer as man’s overlord was given power of death over those who violated God’s law. Lucifer defied God, became Satan, the father of lies and a murderer. He has taken human life to suit his own whims. He has planted murder in the hearts of men and caused many murders to be committed. Satan has caused men to defy God and to become covenant-breakers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NIMROD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> It seems certain that God would have protected men from the wild beasts had men been obedient to God. God told Noah that every beast of the earth and fowl of the air should fear and dread him. Evidently that means that God would safeguard all who would be obedient to him against the assaults of wild beasts, and that would remove any excuse for killing them except for food. Early in the time of man Satan induced men to disregard God’s provision for protection and care.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> Nimrod was a grandson of Ham, one of the sons of Noah. Nimrod began to be a mighty one in the earth. (Genesis 10:8) Satan chose Nimrod as the one with whom he would begin his organization among men. Nimrod was a bloodthirsty man. Manifestly the wild beasts began to be dangerous to men on the earth. Instead of relying upon God’s promise to protect man, Nimrod disregarded God and began a manifestation of his own power by destroying the beasts. Without doubt Satan aided him in this. Then the Devil induced the people to worship Nimrod instead of God, the purpose of course being to turn the minds of the people away from God. The people then looked upon Nimrod as their protector and their god, above and superior to Jehovah. “He was a mighty hunter before [superior to] the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord.”—Genesis 10: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> Nimrod became a great man among the people, and not only disregarded God’s law concerning killing but defied God’s law. He was a very wicked man. Ha was the beginning of the covenant-breakers of the everlasting covenant God made with Noah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">EGYPT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>26</sup> Egypt became a mighty nation and the first dominant world power which Satan organized. (Exodus 1:10) Other nations existed before Egypt, but Egypt was the first dominant world power. That nation relied upon her military strength. It was a cruel and harsh government and reflected the spirit of Satan.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> God’s chosen people Israel were domiciled in Egypt. They were a peaceable people given to industry. It was noted by Pharaoh that the Israelites were multiplying rapidly, and upon the pretext that the Israelites might become a menace to the military strength of Egypt that ruler ordered all the male children of the Israelites to be killed. (Exodus 1:10-22) The earth, that is to say, organized governments on earth, there became defiled by the governing factors’ wholly disregarding God’s law and making a contrary law concerning the murdering of children. That government would have killed all the children of the Israelites had not God intervened and saved them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER WORLD POWERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Babylon and Assyria had existed as organizations before Egypt, but later became world powers. The rule adopted by each one of these nations was: “Might makes right,” which meant the weak must perish and the strong survive. The ruler of Assyria bathed his sword in human</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"><sup><a name="bookmark5"></a>874</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WATCH TOWER &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>BE00KL</sup>™’<sup>N</sup>'<sup>T</sup>-</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">blood, and then used his victories in an effort to frighten the Israelites into denying Jehovah and surrendering to the Devil’s organization. Babylon and Medo-Persia followed in the same bloody course, and all these world powers fell. Then Greece became the dominant power of earth. That nation, under the leadership of Alexander the Great, conquered by sword and fire all the nations of the earth, and then he wept because he could not spill more human gore.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> Rome followed as the next world power and reached the zenith of her strength under the Csesars. With great cruelty she broke to pieces the other nations, and human life was regarded as nothing but to satisfy the selfish lusts of her rulers. For 800 years that government specifically claimed to be a Christian nation. By her claims she acknowledged Jehovah as God, and Christ as King. Because the everlasting covenant made human life sacred, and because Christ emphasized that fact, Rome became more reprehensible than the nations that had gone before her. She wholly disregarded the Word of God. She adopted and held to the rule of acquiring territory by conquest. That rule means that the ruler of one nation might take the land of another nation or people peaceably if convenient, but take it regardless of how many human lives or how much suffering it cost to take it. Rome defiled the earth with human blood. In addition to those who died in war waged by Rome, great numbers were murdered because they professed to be Christians and would not conform to Rome’s ecclesiastical rule.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> Then Napoleon came upon the scene, the man who had no regard for God or his Word. Through him Satan attempted to establish a world power of infidelity. Satan played his game to gain, whether or not Napoleon won. If Napoleon established an infidel empire, Satan knew that it would be against God. If Napoleon failed in his effort, then the order loving people would be driven into the church systems, which Satan already controlled. Napoleon’s fall enabled Satan to get a more complete control of so-called organized Christianity than ever before. Thereafter it was easy to induce the people to believe that they must support the churches in order to safeguard themselves from another like Napoleon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> It is interesting to note that Jehovah interfered and prevented the establishment of an infidel empire. The nations that continued to claim to be Christian nations were therefore more reprehensible because of the knowledge possessed or that might easily have been acquired concerning God, his Word and his purposes. At Trafalgar Nelson broke the ships of Napoleon. (Daniel 11:30) At Waterloo Napoleon ‘came to his end, and none shall help him’. (Daniel 11:45) Napoleon drenched the land with blood, and the shedding of human blood did not cease with his fall.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> Then came to the fore the British Empire. It occupies a position distinctive over all the world powers that have preceded it. In the formation of its government it has made prominent the ecclesiastical and political elements. It has its Lords Spiritual (so-called), and its Lords Temporal; but both are chiefly interested in temporal things. While her Lords Spiritual claim to have charge of the spiritual welfare of the people, they also are large holders of lands and mines and have much to say about the policy of government. That nation claims to be Christian. It has produced the most learned men concerning the text of the Bible that have lived since the days of the apostles. The claim made to being a Christian nation and the knowledge its rulers have possessed, or might easily have acquired, have placed upon that nation great responsibility before God. How has that government treated the everlasting covenant relative to the shedding of human blood ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> With the seat of empire on a small island the rulers of that empire have pushed out to the four corners of the earth, increasing her domains and her prestige. She has not hesitated to make war with others at any time it seemed necessary to accomplish her selfish purposes. With a prayer book in one hand and a gun in the other she has gone forth with fair and sanctimonious speech and with ultra-selfishness in an attempt to satisfy her hunger for territory and power. She has sent her missionaries into every part of the earth; and wherever the missionaries have gone has also gone the greedy commercial element seeking pecuniary gain. To the Chinese she went preaching in the name of Christ. She also used her guns to force an entrance into China and at the same time to shield and guard the opium dealers who walked side by side with the missionaries. These have spread their poisonous and devastating commodity throughout that land, and have caused that people to suffer indescribable injury and sorrow. This is but a sample of her course.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> The clergy of the empire claim to represent Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace. In all the campaigns of conquest waged by the British Empire for money and territory the clergy unqualifiedly have supported the cruel commercial and military part thereof. In fact the clergy have been a part of all such unrighteous wars of conquest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> Foreknowing the course that that hypocritical nation would take, in symbolic language the Lord describes that world power as a beast with two horns like a lamb and with speech like the Devil. (Revelation 13:11) A lamb is harmless in appearance and in fact. How then could a nation look like a lamb and talk like the Devil? The speech of her rulers, including the commercial, political and ecclesiastical elements, has been suave, subtle, and diplomatic and apparently harmless, being intended to deceive and mislead others into her net and then, like the Devil, has devoured them. The Scriptures designate the Devil as a dragon or one that devours, who inveigles by fraud and deception his victims into his trap before he devours them. Politics and diplomacy are one and the same thing. The Devil is the author thereof. The British Empire stands at the head of the list in world diplomacy and is more like its father than any other world power.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>36</sup> Of all the selfish wars in which the so-called civilized nations have engaged there is none that appears to be less excusable than that of the British war against the Boers of South Africa. Those plain farmer folk desired to use their land and have their government at home as it pleased them. The British wanted their land, and not being able to acquire it by honorable and peaceable means resorted to a cruel war to get it. When Cain murdered Abel God said to that man who tried to hide his crime: “The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.” Who will deny that the blood of' the farmers of South Africa that stained the soil of their fields crieth out unto God from the ground, and that that bleed the Lord will avenge in his own due time ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>37</sup> The countries of Europe might well be likened unto a cockpit wherein selfish rulers have fought selfish rulers and where the subjects of each ruler have poured out their lifeblood. The pages of human history have been written in human blood, and the greater portion of that has been the blood of men and women who have had no desire for war.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> The responsibility for such wholesale slaughter is upon the shoulders of the rulers, made up of the commercial, political, and ecclesiastical minority that rules and which organization the Scriptures designate as the earth. Some of the responsibility of course rests upon the people, because many of them have supported their chiefs in wars of conquest and have done so willingly. The selfish commercial element, coveting the land of another nation, has provoked war as a pretext for taking the land. The political element has arranged the laws to carry on the war, and the clergy have sanctified the war, and the common people have been herded into the valley of slaughter and been compelled to shed their blood whether they wished to or not. When the wars have ended the political generals along with the clergy have had their names immortalized in portraits and in stone, while some have been knighted for leading whole armies into death.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WORLD WAR</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>89</sup> Of course the Lord foreknew the selfish and evil course the rulers of the nations would pursue. He knew the time would come when nation would rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom in a supreme struggle, and therefore he foretold the war of 1914. That war was really a competition for supremacy of power in the earth. It was extremely selfish and devilish. Germany possessed an insatiable desire to control Europe. It seemed to her necessary to destroy France in order to accomplish her purpose.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> Following the usual course indicated by the two horns of that beast, the British Empire went into the World War upon the pretext of maintaining the integrity of Belgium because that small nation had been invaded by Germany. The facts stand boldly out without the possibility of a dispute, however, that the British Empire was fully prepared for that war long before Belgium was invaded, and that disproves her claim or excuse for entering the war. The British Empire went into the World War in order to maintain her supremacy as a world power, and that she might control the financial or commercial policy of the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> The hypocritical clergy claim to represent Christ, and yet preached millions of boys into the trenches and then deliberately and falsely told them that if they died upon the battlefield they would be a part of the vicarious atonement and would go straight to heaven. In some of the church buildings of England memorial windows have been erected, illustrating how the preacher is transmitting the soul from the dying soldier into heaven. These things are mentioned to call attention to the responsibility that rests upon those who have defiled the land.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> There was no just cause or excuse for America entering the World War. There was no danger of Germany’s invading American soil. Bear in mind that the commercial interests of the British Empire and iho commercial interests of America are identical. They work hand in hand with each other. The British conducted a campaign of propaganda for several months in America to arouse public sentiment against Germany and to induce America to enter the war. American bankers worked with British financiers in that conspiracy. A number of the large daily papers was purchased and subsidized to cry out for America to enter the war. Big Business easily enlisted the clergy on the side of war, and Big Business sent forth these clergymen as their missionaries to preach war. At the behest of Big Business the political element enacted a compulsory military law and a cruel espionage law. The mouth of every peace-lover was closed while millions of American young men who tilled the soil and operated the machines of the factories were herded like cattle into the ships and hurried across the sea as targets for the shells fired by others who likewise had been forced into the war. The result was, millions of common people shed their blcod while the selfish rulers stayed behind and reaped the monetary harvest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> Because a few men and women on the earth loved the Lord, and desired to call attention to his kingdom of righteousness, the rulers of these so-called Christian nations pretended to fear that these few advocates of righteousness might interfere with their selfish schemes of war. These Christians were haled into court; and upon irrelevant and incompetent evidence, and without any real evidence, they were sentenced to long terms in prison. Others were maltreated and others killed because they insisted on honestly pursuing the course of Christians and refused to be hypocrites. These are a few things so-called Christian nations have to their credit on the record.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup> Every nation of Christendom has broken the law of the everlasting covenant concerning the sanctity of human life. Other nations of course have likewise broken it; but those nations which have claimed to be Christian proved by their course that they are wilful hypocrites and therefore reprehensible. When Jesus was on earth he restated the law of the everlasting covenant relating to the sanctity of human life. He said: “Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.”—Matthew 5: 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> Be it noted that the Decalogue, which God gave to the Jews, did not state the judgment that would be inflicted for murder. Subsequent statutes made as a part of the law covenant did so state. The Decalogue merely said: “Thou shalt not kill.” (Exodus 20:13) The judgment or penalty to be enforced for the breaking of the law concerning the sacredness of human life was stated long prior thereto by Jehovah, when he made the covenant with Noah. The law of that covenant for ever thereafter applied to Jews and Gentiles alike, because that covenant was made with Noah and applied to him and every living creature.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>46</sup> Jesus stated to the scribes and Pharisees that they were more responsible and more reprehensible before God than were others. They made pretense of long prayers and compassed the earth about to make proselytes, and at the same time devoured widows’ houses and increased the burdens of the people, and killed many innocent men, and finally were guilty of the blood of Jesus Christ. (Matthew 23:13-15) Upon the same principle the nations of Christendom so-called, and particularly the clergy, are more reprehensible and therefore more responsible before God for the breaking of the everlasting covenant concerning the sanctity of human life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DAY OF VENGEANCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>47</sup> It is written by God’s prophet Isaiah 63:4: “For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.” This prophecy refers to the time when the Lord will express his indignation against the unrighteous systems. Divine vengeance does not mean an expression of malice. God could not be malicious. The words revenge and vengeance are used in the bad sense when they have the thought of malice or hatred. Vengeance of God means due punishment inflicted for the infraction of his law. It is the vindication of his name and his law. Jehovah could not be inconsistent and therefore he could not permit his creatures to wilfully violate his law and never call them to account for it. To be sure, God awaits his own due time to express his disapproval, and he has always expressed that in such a manner that it cannot be doubted as to what is meant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> The prophet states that the curse of God shall devour the earth, and one of the reasons assigned therefor is because they have broken the everlasting covenant. The time must come for the fulfilment of that prophecy. That time will be when Jehovah will overthrow Satan’s organization and vindicate his own name. Looking to that time God caused his prophet to address the rulers of the earth and say: “For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts. Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily rear upon his habitation ; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth: for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations; he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord.”—Jeremiah 25: 29-31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>49</sup> Jesus referred to this time as being a period of tribulation such as the world has never known, and the last one. (Matthew 24: 21,22) He declared that it should follow immediately upon the completion of the proclamation of the truth to the world as a witness concerning Jehovah as God, Christ as King, and the establishment of the kingdom of heaven. Through his prophet God states that one of the reasons for this trouble is because the earth, organized governments, and the people have wholly and completely disregarded the everlasting covenant made with Noah concerning the sanctity of human life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>50</sup> If God did not take positive and direct action against the rulers and the people supporting them, then no one would be held responsible for all the cruel and unjust wars that have been fought and all the innocent blood shed. It seems certain that God will teach all of his intelligent creatures that his law cannot be ignored nor violated with impunity and his name reproached, but that in due time he will vindicate both his law and his name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NOT PAST</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>C1</sup> Some have argued that the World War and trouble incident thereto was the final trouble upon the world, and that there will be no more great trouble. Such a conclusion is founded neither in reason nor in the Scriptures. The Lord foretold the World War, but he did not cause it to be fought. He has foretold the expression of his vengeance; and he will see to it that that is carried out through his great and mighty Arm, Christ Jesus. God foreknew that the avarice, selfishness and wickedness of the rulers of Christendom would reach the bursting point in 1914, and that it would break forth in a terrible war. That marked the end of the Gentile Times and the beginning of the fall of Satan’s organization; and without doubt Satan concluded that if he could plunge all Christendom into the war, that would enable him to strengthen his power over the people; and it did. The cry went forth that the World War was to make the world “safe for democracy”. That was Satan’s hypocritical slogan. The World War served to bind the shackles tighter than ever before upon the arms of the common people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>52</sup> God halted the World War that his purposes might be accomplished; and that done, then shall follow the expression of Jehovah’s indignation against the persistent and wilful violators of the everlasting covenant with reference to the sanctity of human life. That great time of trouble expressed as, the battle of the great day of God Almighty is yet future; it is near at hand; it is impending and soon will fall upon the nations of the earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CHRISTIANS’ DUTY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>53</sup> Before that great and terrible time God’s purpose is to have the witness given to the nations and peoples of the earth that he is God, that Christ is King, and that he has placed his King upon his throne and that all the rulers and peoples of the earth shall hear and obey him. That witness must be given by the anointed ones of the Lord now on earth. Concerning those nations that disregard the Lord’s message he says: ‘He will break them with a rod of iron, and dash them to pieces.’—Psalm </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2:</span><span class="font5"> 6-12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>54</sup> Why should any one who claims to be consecrated to the Lord at this time oppose the service of the Lord by refusing to participate in the witness to his name? What reason could any one give who loves the Lord for not joyfully participating in the service work of making known God’s kingdom and his day of vengeance, as he has commanded ? Those who do oppose and who try to hinder others from taking part in the service surely are not obeying God; and at once the question arises, Are such really in the truth and the service of the Lord? Each one should remember that Jesus said: “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father.”—Matthew 7: 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>55</sup> The day of God’s vengeance is at hand. All the evidence from the Scriptures and outside thereof testifies to this fact. The forces are hastening to Armageddon. The result thereof is described by the prophet in these words: “The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly. The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.”—Isaiah 24:19,20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>56</sup> This is' a description of what shall fall upon the Devil’s organization; and one of the reasons why this shall befall the nations of Christendom especially is that these nations have broken the everlasting covenant and made the blood of man as common as the blood of beasts. Before the Lord does this he says to his anointed ones, ‘Go and tell the peoples of the world what is my purpose. Give witness that I am God, and that the day of my vengeance is at hand, and that with the fall of Satan’s wicked organization I will bring forth blessings to the people.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>57</sup> There is but a small number upon earth who are God’s witnesses. Surely then, everyone who is anointed by the Lord and who loves the Lord truly will hasten </span><span class="font4">to </span><span class="font5">finish the work committed to them and will do it with joy. Furthermore, every Christian should delight to bring comfort to the people by telling them what God will do for them when the trouble has ended. After describing how he will punish the world for evil and the wicked for their iniquity and cause the arrogance to cease, then the Lord says, “I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.” (Isaiah 13:12) This is another proof that the life of man is sacred. The rulers of the earth have made gold far more important than man, but the great and loving God will reverse the order and make the life of man precious in the eyes of others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6S</sup> It is a part of the commission of the Christian to comfort those that mourn. This can be done only by obeying the Lord’s command to serve him now by giving the message of truth to those who have ears to hear.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH chose his beloved Son, called the Logos, Jesus, and Christ, to be his great executive officer. One of the titles of his beloved One is “Priest of the Most High God”. When this beloved One came to earth he came to do the will of Jehovah, who sent him. Whatsoever he did was the act of his principal, Jehovah. The Son therefore acted as the agent or representative of Jehovah. For this reason Jesus said: “I can of mine ovn self do nothing: ... I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.” (John 5: 30) God is the Creator of all things, but he created all things by Jesus Christ. (Ephesians 3:9) All things therefore proceed from God the Creator; and all things are by the Son, the executive officer of Jehovah.—1 Corinthians 8: G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures speak of Jesus Christ as the Deliverer. (Domans 11:2G) This is one of his titles; but he is the Deliverer by virtue of the fact that he performs the work of deliverance as the officer of Jehovah God, who is the great Deliverer. Some Christians have difficulty in determining who is the Deliverer, whether God or Christ. If it i.- always borne in mind that every good and perfect thing proceeds from Jehovah, and that Jesus Christ is his chosen instrument to carry out his purposes, then it is easy to be seen that the great Deliverer is Jehovah Ged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Deliverer means savior, one who comes to the rescue of others and who defends, preserves and draws them out of a condition of danger, distress, disability or death, and places them in a condition of safety, relief, and blessing. Deliverer is one of the names that the only true and living God in the universe applies to himself in his written Word. He inspired David in the above quoted text to call him such; and the time will come when all human creatures on earth will call him such, not by being inspired to do so mechanically, but because of sincerely appreciating him as The Deliverer.—Isaiah 45: 22, 23; Romans 14:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one in all the universe is more deserving of the name Deliverer, Savior, than Jehovah is. He properly and rightfully takes the name to himself. There are those among men who have performed some deed and uho have been called deliverers for it; and even the Scriptures mention some men by that name. We read: “And when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them.” (Judges 3:9,15) All these human deliverers, whether servants of God or not, have delivered only a limited number of people from a specific case of danger. The condition of relief and safety to which they were delivered was only a temporary one, and they still remained in need of the great deliverance. That great deliverance is not of a few or a limited number of people but of all who stand in need of eternal salvation. The Almighty God alone can bring it, and he will do so. Hence he is The Deliverer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Isaiah 43:3,11 the Lord says: “For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour:... I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour.” These assertions apply especially to spiritual Israel, the new creation; but they also signify that there can be no eternal salvation for mankind either apart from Jehovah. His is the only scheme of salvation that will work and that will bring to those in need what they desire. We may be sure therefore that all schemes, no matter how brilliant or hopeful looking, that are not in full harmony with the Lord’s revealed plan are of the adversary and will never work out successfully. They are efforts on the Devil’s part to turn men’s attention and efforts away from the Lord’s way. They represent Satan’s endeavors to pamper the self-conceit of those who trust in human wisdom, “the wisdom of this world.” They manifest the “pride of life” in those who think they can do without the Lord’s way or can improve thereupon, and can bring deliverance into this earth in a speedier way than Jehovah’s plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord has permitted human wisdom to devise various methods and plans to bring relief to mankind, that men may learn from the failure of their theories that Jehovah’s way is the only way. He has likewise permitted, and still permits, self-seeking men, filled with devilish cunning and diplomacy, to “pull the wool over the eyes” of the people. These men put across schemes and arrangements which are claimed to be in the interest of human prosperity but which really play into the hands of the backers of the schemes; namely, a selfish, conscienceless, godless minority. All such human devices, whether humanitarian or selfish under the cover, are destined to fail, because they leave the true Deliverer out of consideration. They will fail, not because Jehovah with his almighty power forces them to fail, but because they are not based upon the right foundation. They do not provide the thing which is all necessary to everlasting deliverance.—Psalms 33:10; 94:11; Proverbs 21: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Deliverance is another manifestation of the unselfishness of God. The Deliverer does not deliver himself. The Lord is never in danger and never will be. It is others whose interests are endangered, and therefore God’s salvation is for others. Self-interest did not prompt him to provide a plan for human redemption. Justice did not require him to do so, because divine justice was satisfied in the carrying out of .God’s judgment against Adam and Eve. Neither was the Lord obligated to deliver the human family, inasmuch as their afflictions and dying condition could not be laid at the door of Jehovah but resulted from the deliberate disobedience of the first parent of the human family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some may claim, however, that there </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font5"> something of selfishness in the divine program. They say that by the deliverance Jehovah will vindicate his name. It is true that the deliverance will vindicate Jehovah’s name. How could it do other than this? For every person’s deeds reflect upon himself. But God’s plan is not simply a case of trying to show up the Devil and his servants as to their depravity and their inability to fight victoriously against God, that thus God’s name might stand out more brightly in contrast. God’s name would have been vindicated just as well if he had not provided for rescuing mankind from the consequences of Adam’s transgression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God could have justly slain Adam and Eve and also Satan the Devil immediately after the adversary had seduced the first human pair into their rebellion against God. Such action would have upheld the majesty of his law; it would have proven that God abides by strict justice; it would have shown his faithfulness in keeping his word; it would have demonstrated his power and authority to put to death those who violate his law and revolt against his organization; and thus the stainless name and reputation of the Most High God would have been fully vindicated or justified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such a course of action as suggested would have plunged our first parents and us, their then unborn offspring, into the blackness of darkness for ever. (Job 3:11,16) God’s purpose to have this earth inhabited (Isaiah 45:18) would not have been made void thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His power could have created another human pair, thus giving start to a human race by different parents than Adam and Eve. In that case there would have been no need of the Lord’s present plan of deliverance; and then where would you and we have been ? Also, God’s capacity as The Deliverer would not thus have had opportunity</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark8"><span class="font5">to display itself. But the permission of the reign</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark9"><span class="font5">Satan, sin and death has made room for Jehovah</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark10"><span class="font5">appear in a new role, in a new title; namely, that</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font5">Deliverer, Savior. Every one should concede then that Jehovah’s plan is utterly unselfish and solely in behalf of his needy creatures; and yet its very unselfishness serves to rebound with praise and glory to his name, making it shine forth with enhanced lustre and loveliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God saw the “other fellow’s viewpoint”, and read his heart; that is, he knew that the condemned ones, cast out of Eden and subject to the workings of death, would like to be relieved. He could read and did read the longing in the human bosom for deliverance. This longing was a spontaneous desire. It was really due to man’s being made in God’s image and likeness. For man was created with an ability to appreciate, desire and enjoy that which is good, beautiful, and pleasurable, provided it came through God’s w'ay. (Psalm 34:12) God’s love responded to this human desire for deliverance, and moved him to think out with lightning-like rapidity a perfect plan to satisfy the human heart; it moved him to take action to carry out that plan to a successful conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God realized that this human craving for restoration might be altogether a selfish one; that is, a desire to see merely self pleased and happy rather than God pleased and glorified. Such a selfish desire, even if for something that God was pleased to give and had promised to give, would be wrong. The desire in itself would be allowable, but the motive or reason behind the desire would be wrong because of selfishness. The Lord has wisely arranged for his plan to operate in such a way that all those who will ultimately receive everlasting salvation, either to heaven or to Paradise restored on earth, will be thoroughly purged of any selfishness in their desire. Their desire to live without bodily disabilities and without oppression from Satan and his servants; their desire to live in liberty, peace, prosperity, health and love amid perfect surroundings will be first of all to glorify God and to fulfil his good purposes. Their aim will be to live unto God, who loved them and who gave his only begotten Son for their sakes. God will be “all in all” to them.—1 Corinthians 15: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There can be no other means of bringing or of obtaining deliverance than the means that God chooses and appoints to be used. That is why all other schemes must and will fail. They cannot provide the means or channel of deliverance that is necessary and acceptable to God. All human beings who promote ways and means for man’s betterment and perfecting are imperfect, sinful and in ft dying state. “None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him; . . . that he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.” (Psalm 49:7,9) It is therefore beyond the power of earthlings to provide the ransom price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But suppose that there had been among the angels some or many who would have been willing to have their life transferred from heaven to earth in order to become man and provide the redemptive price; it would still have been for Jehovah to decide whether to take advantage of, or pass over, the willingness of such angels. “So then it is not of him that willeth [or is willing], nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.” (Romans 9:16) We know that Jehovah’s decision was in favor of using the Logos, “'that in all things he might have the preeminence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is beneath the dignity of Jehovah to take suggestions. He works according to the counsel of his own will. He is the Author of his plans. His counsel is sufficient unto himself. “Who hath directed the spirit of the Lord, or being his counsellor hath taught him? With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?” (Isaiah 40:13,14) This shows that self-originated schemes of men and angels are presumptuous and invite one into a dangerous course before the Lord. Take, as an example of this, the course of the angels who, evidently with the desire to uplift mankind, left their own habitation and came down and intermarried with the daughters of men.—Jude 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah may take one into his counsels, as he did with the Logos, to reveal his counsels unto him so as to enlist his cooperation. He may also permit any of his faithful creatures, who are in need, to ask what they would like to have or to say what they think would be a good course; but this he does merely to have the creature express himself and plainly show the condition of his her.it before the Lord. As illustrations of this we have the case of Abraham interceding in behalf of the city of Sodom, and the case of Jesus in Gethsemane praying that if it be possible the cup might pass away from him, nevertheless not his will but the Father’s be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But Jehovah is above the need of suggestions, as much above such need as ever he was before he created the first intelligent creature, the Logos. “0 the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God 1 how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? . . . For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.” (Romans 11:33, 34, 3G) All of these considerations should make us very cautious and careful to search out what is the plan of the Lord, and his plan only, and to keep in close harmony with that plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mankind’s deliverance requires something besides providing and paying the ransom price. Resurrection is also a vital necessity. The Lord promised to ransom and redeem mankind from death and the grave. (Hosea 13:14) However, man not only has been going down into the grave but has been going down there as a fallen creature, a sinner, out of harmony with God. Now in the case of a tree, logically whichever way the tree falls there it will lie unless acted upon by some outside force. It would therefore be inconsistent for God to raise the members of the fallen human race in any other moral condition than that in which they went down into the tomb. The consecrated, spirit-begotten ones who finish their earthly course faithfully, are resurrected instantaneously in mental, moral as well as bodily perfection; but this is not inconsistent on God’s part. For these, called saints, were while on earth justified from all sin through their faith and the blood of Jesus; and their hearts, that is, their affections and devotion toward tha Lord, were perfect before him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the dead human race awake from the tomb, they will, as pointed out above, need deliverance from all the physical, mental and moral defects due to Adam’s transgression and the downward course of mankind during the centuries. So will also the millions now living who will never enter the grave. After they have safely come through earth’s “great tribulation such as never was”, they will still be sinners, imperfect and therefore disapproved before God. No human being could accomplish the deliverance that yet remains to be accomplished for the race. Not even the faithful worthies of prechristian ages, who may be raised in physical perfection and who will be made “princes in all the earth”, can accomplish it. It is a task too big for them with their limited human powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many schemes of men have attempted such human uplift out of depravity, sin and imperfection; but naturally these schemes were destined to failure from the start. They depended upon the powers of human creatures, and fallen and imperfect ones at that, to do the work. The fallacy of depending upon human strength was forcefully illustrated by the failure of the Law Covenant which God made with the children of Israel through tha man Moses as mediator. Why did it fail? Not because God’s side of the arrangement was not perfect; for he was faithful to his part of the arrangement and also had the power to make good his promise that “the man which doeth those things shall live by them”. (Romans 10:5) But the fault was that besides the Israelites’ being weak and imperfect their mediator, Moses, was likewise weak and imperfect. He needed deliverance from the fallen state as well as they. Neither could he nor any other human being bind Satan and overthrow his wicked world order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the period of the New Covenant Moses and his fellow worthies, in spite of their bodily and mental perfection, will be under human limitations. They will have no blessings of their own to bestow upon the people, but will be only instruments used in the hand of Jehovah and his Christ to bless mankind. Thus it is easy to see that the needed deliverance of humanity will require the intervention of The Christ, primarily Jesus Christ, to whom “all power ... in heaven and in earth” has been given. Truly then any scheme of human salvation which ignores Jesus as the Ransomer and as God’s Anointed King is wrong and futile; for it leaves out God’s chosen means, the only means for bringing redemption. As the scripture saith: “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among mon, whereby we must be saved.” —Acts 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is only because Jehovah has chosen to use Jesus as his means of deliverance that Jesus is also called “Saviour”. (John 4: 42) In fact, the name Jesus itself means “salvation of Jehovah”. The saints who are to be associated with Jesus during his reign are likewise called “saviours”. (Obadiah 21) Jesus and his church, viewed as a working unit, are called “the Deliverer” in Romans 11:26, which reads: “There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.” (Isaiah 59:20) But all this does not conflict with Jehovah’s declaration that “beside me there is no saviour”, because salvation finds its authorship in him. “To us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things.”—1 Corinthians 8: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Deliverance, though longed for and striven after for centuries, cannot come before the time Jehovah has appointed for it. The Law Covenant made at Mount Sinai could not bring it at the time of its making nor at any time up to the day that Jesus declared the covenant null and void by announcing to the Jews, “Your house is left unto you desolate.” God did not intend the covenant to bring deliverance, but meant it to be illustrative. (Galatians 3:24) But all other schemes, invented by man, have been abortive as well as incomplete. They have been untimely as well as out of order. God has timed his redemptive schedule perfectly. He has not been late in carrying out any detail of his plan. He provided the means of deliverance precisely on time. “When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law.” (Galatians 4:4) He will not be tardy in actually bringing deliverance in. “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness.”—2 Peter 3: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The race of mankind was never in greater need of actual deliverance than at present. Happily, the time features and also the prophecies foretelling the portentous events and conditions of our day show that the Lord’s appointed time for ushering in the desire of all nations is now, the time of man’s direst need. God’s wide-awake and watching saints, noting this, exult with much joy, even as Jesus authorized them to do, saying, “When these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption [deliverance] draweth nigh.”—Luke 21: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is The Deliverer, beside whom there is no savior; and his is the only successful plan of deliverance. It logically follows that there could be no true message of salvation other than his message. That message is contained in his inspired Word. The Apostle Paul realized this fact. After having proclaimed the pure message of the Lord to the church in Galatia, he wrote to them: “But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.- As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.” (Galatians 1:8,9) It was not that the apostle considered himself so important that he went so far as to say that if “an angel from heaven” should come and preach something in conflict with the message which he as apostle had delivered, that angel should be considered as accursed of the Lord. But, wonderful fact! the Lord has not committed the preaching of the gospel unto angels from heaven, but unto men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle was not attaching importance to himself; for he made sure to say that if even he were to come later and preach something at variance with what he had already delivered to the church, he himself should be accursed. Paul was attaching importance to the message. He knew that it was an inspired message, for he writes: “But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man [and therefore not “after” Paul, of course]. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.” (Galatians 1:11,12) Hence it was God’s message and therefore the true and the only one; the message changes not, because God will not alter the thing that is gone forth out of his lips. (Psalm 89: 34) Therefore God’s true saints, and for that matter all who desire to please God and obtain salvation, should promptly reject all humanly originated schemes of deliverance and all organizations built around such schemes. They should also cast aside all of Christendom’s perversions of the Lord’s plan as it is laid out in his revealed Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Finally, since the Lord Jehovah is The Deliverer and since his is the only true gospel of deliverance, it must be that there is only </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font5"> message of deliverance, and only those would be proclaiming this message who are recognized of the Lord as his representatives; for to them he would reveal his message by the illuminating power of his spirit. Upon them and them alone he has laid the commission to preach the glad tidings. (Isaiah 61:1) None others could be expected to be preaching it. It becomes apparent therefore that Jehovah could have only one channel on earth for making known the tidings of coming freedom for the peoples. The Lord evidently had this channel in mind when Jesus said: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations.” This one channel is his anointed saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Facts sho .v, however, that not all the saints today are availing themselves of their privilege to preach these kingdom tidings. The word of prophecy also indicates that not all of them would do so. Nevertheless, all the saints are commissioned by their anointing to “go . . . preach the kingdom of God” (Luke 9:60), and they must answer for it if they fail or neglect to go and preach it in fulfilment of their anointing and commission. The Apostle Paul considered the consequences of failure on his part to be so serious that he exclaimed: “Woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!” (1 Corinthians 9:16) He claimed that necessity was laid upon him by reason of his commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The time is come when Jehovah will make for himself a name, and one of the names under which he will be revealed and glorified is that of The Deliverer. The time for expecting deliverance is come. (Luke 21:28) Therefore the time for proclaiming deliverance is here, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">now.</span><span class="font5"> Prophecy shows that the glorious message will surely be proclaimed, and that God will use his one channel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It may be that not all the consecrated, spirit-begotten ones will fearlessly, self-forgettingly and actively offer themselves to be used as part of that channel; but the Servant class, the “'wise and faithful servant”, will do so. The “young men” class who see the stimulating “visions” of the Lord’s present activities and his future work will do so. The Lord by his outpoured spirit gives to them the “visions” of his purposes and acts and of their part in connection therewith. Thus enlightened they joyfully and readily volunteer to serve as his witnesses now in this the day of the Lord’s power, making known the name of the Lord Jehovah as The Deliverer. The joy of the Lord is their strength. The garments of salvation, the gift of The Deliverer through their beloved Bridegroom, cover them. Songs of deliverance compass them about. (Psalm 32: 7) The promise of deliverance in the first resurrection belongs to them.</span></p>

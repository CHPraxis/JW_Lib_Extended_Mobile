<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Daedalus and Icarus Up to Date</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7">F THOSE old fellows of Greek literature, Dsedalus and Icarus, could come back and compare their mythical wax wings with the wings of a modern airplane, they would surely sit up and take notice. Some of them are now 100 feet across.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the men now in middle life were boys they can remember -when the poem ridiculing “Darius Green and His Flying Machine” was a classic, and anybody who seriously thought that men would ever fly was considered a lunatic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1709 a Brazilian priest invented an airplane, the lifting power of which was a network of iron to which large coral agates were attached. The agates were supposed to help in drawing the ship up when, through heat of the sun’s rays, they had acquired sufficient magnetic power. .Unfortunately they never got enough power, and so the scheme turned out like many others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1896 Professor S. P. Langley made extended flights of a flying machine propelled by its own power; but nobody ever flew in it until after the machine had been remodelled, subsequent to his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1901 Professor Simon Newcomb and Rear Admiral Melville of the United States Navy proved mathematically the impossibility of human flight; and so now human beings are collectively flying more than ten million miles a year, just to prove that scientific figures are not always correct. The Wright Brothers made the first successful airplane flight at Kittyhawk, N. C., December 17,1903. The engine used weighed, over fifteen pounds to each horse-power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was a slow job developing an engine that would provide 1% horse-power for every pound of metal in the engine; but it has been done, and now human beings can and do beat the birds at their own game. The swiftest bird cannot keep pace with the slowest airplane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many valuable things were learned from the birds. The Wright Brothers spent hours and hours watching them critically. The discovery that birds do relatively little actual flying, but take advantage of the air currents, has had a powerful effect on airplane 'design.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The lifting of the airplane is caused by the formation of vacuums under the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">wings. As</span><span class="font7"> the machine speeds along, the air rushes into the vacuums formed beneath the wings, and pushes the plane higher and higher. The engines of modern airplanes turn the propellers at as high as 2,600 revolutions per minute, as against 1,200 only a few years back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The World War Pushed Europe Ahead</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TYE SPITE the fact that the airplane was de-veloped in the United States, yet until very recently the United States lagged far behind most European countries in the matter of opening and maintaining air routes, and is still slow. The World War pushed Europe ahead, but the United States is now catching up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A late airplane map of Europe shows that there are thirteen air services to and from Berlin, eleven to Frankfurt, ten each to Cologne and Munich, nine to Hamburg, seven each to Paris, Amsterdam and Prague, six each to Brussels and Vienna, five each to London, Copenhagen, Basel and Danzig, four to Barcelona, three each to Geneva, Marseilles, Budapest, and Riga, two each to Venice, Moscow', Stockholm, Helsingfors, Bucharest, Sofia and Belgrade, and one each to Madrid, Rome, Constantinople, Warsaw and Oslo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The French have a line to Casablanca in Africa. The British have one to Cairo, where passengers may transfer to a plane for Karachi, India. There were fifteen air mail routes in the United States at the close of 1926. The principal one is the transcontinental one between New York and San Francisco. The Swedes operate</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the largest planes in Europe, with accommodations for twenty-five passengers, a crew of three men, a radio operator, and a lunch counter waitress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Germany 56,268 passengers were transported in 1926 without an injury, and 641 tons of freight were carried. British air imports and exports last year totalled $3,410,242 and are growing rapidly. In the United States there are 2,182 planes in service, of which 969 are commercial and 201 are air mail planes. The balance are government machines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are two routes in Brazil and one in Colombia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Pioneers </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of the Air</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font7">LL humanity is indebted to the pioneers of the air, the men who risk their lives doing the things that everybody will be doing a little ■while hence. It should not be thought that their lives are wasted, even if they fail; for as much is learned from failures as from successes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1919 the U. S. naval seaplane NC-4 crossed the Atlantic Ocean via the Azores, landing at Lisbon, Portugal. A month later the British airmen Alcock and Brown made their historic flight from St. Johns, N. F., to Clif den, Ireland. Five years later the United States airmen flew around the world, taking over six months at their dangerous task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1925 the PN9 No. 1 flew 1,700 miles from San Francisco toward Hawaii, but was forced down from lack of fuel. In the year 1927 several planes have negotiated this trip successfully, although many precious lives wore sacrificed in a vain attempt to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1926 Sir Alan J. Cobham made a number of most remarkable flights, one from London to Cape Town, South Africa, and ietu.rn, and one from London to .Melbourne and return. 2d one stage of the flight over Africa Sir Alan encountered a temperature of 118° in the shade and 160° in the sun, but despite the great heat had no engine trouble whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In J 926 Commodore R. Franco and three companions crossed from Spain to Argentina. Other distance flights were from Paris to Basra, Mesopotamia, from Paris to Omsk, Siberia, and from New York to Buenos Ayres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1927 the gallant aviator De Pinedo set out to prove that a good aviator with a good seaplane can go practically anywhere with a good degree of safety. Starting from Italy he visited, South America, Central America and North America, completing a 25,000 mile journey which, included two crossings of the Atlantic Ocean and much unexplored country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The year 1927 has been distinguished by Lindbergh’s flight to Paris, Chamberlin’s flight to Germany, Byrd’s flight to the coast of France, and many other important transoceanic flights, including one from Canada to London. Lindbergh’s flight of 3,600 miles consumed 33 hours; Chamberlin’s flight of 3,905 miles consumed 42 hours. German aviators hold the record for sustained flight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On one occasion the trip from New York to San Francisco was made by daylight. On another occasion the 2,520 miles from New York to San Diego, California, was covered in a non-stop flight of 26 hours, 50 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Speed and Height Records</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19271116_files/g_E_19271116-4.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">SIDE from the natural desire to outdo one another in making speed and height records, there are other considerations which move aviators to take an active interest in these matters. In ocean flights the distances are long, and the fliers dare not take one wink of sleep. To do so means death. Therefore the machines must be kept going at top speed, so that the billowy deep may be covered as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Speed in the air is not comparable to speed on the earth’s surface because of the absence of friction; and there seems to be no limit as to what a human being can endure in the way o£ speed, provided he keeps his liead inside the cockpit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But there is evidently some limit to what metals can enduie, and it looks as if that limit had been about reached, though perhaps not. Bu&amp; even now, when testing airplane engines, the tests are conducted in specially constructed rooms; and the tests are viewed only through, peepholes, because of the well-defined fear on the part of the makers that some weakness may develop and the engine fly into a hundred pieces®</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The landplane record at present is held by the French, at 278.48 miles an hour, while the British have the seaplane record, at 281.49 miles an hour. Unofficial speeds up to 300 miles an hour have been reported but not confirmed, Aviators sometimes find it necessary to fly al heights of two and even three miles, on account! of clouds, or dust, or heat, while military men have other motives for attaining even greater heights. Army surgeons claim that at 45,000 feet, or about 8| miles, it would be impossible ifor an aviator to live, even with oxygen and electrical heaters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Government Interest in Aviation</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">LTHOUGH aviation got its start during the World War, yet the part played by the</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19271116_files/g_E_19271116-5.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">United States government in assisting its development since that time has not been one of vhich many Americans feel proud. The European governments seem to have been much wider awake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The German government has laid down a rigid system of inspection and licensing which has resulted in almost complete elimination of accidents. Germany recognizes six requisites for safe flying, and every one of them is adhered to: A machine which is aerodynamically and structurally sound, a reliable engine of sufficient power, a competent and conservative pilot and navigator, airports and emergency landing fields sufficiently close together to insure gliding to safety, a nation-wide weather forecast which is specially adapted to the needs of fliers, and adequate charts of air routes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There has been an International Aviation Congress, held in London, at which, however, the United States was not represented. Some of the rules adopted are that planes following railroads or canals must keep to the left, and when crossing them must cross at right angles. Calls for help are the letters PAN, calls in extreme distress are SOS as heretofore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By the Air Commerce Act of 1926 the United States now maintains, as a branch of the Department of Commerce a bureau devoted to navigation of the air similar to that provided tor navigation of the water. At this writing about 1,500 personal applications for license have been filed and something over 500 licenses Sor planes. About a half-dozen prospective pilots have been rejected, some for defective vision, some for heart disease, and one because ■his nerves were gone and he was about ready for a collapse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the army service no flier is permitted to leave the ground until the weather reports are sufficiently good to justify the commanding officer of the field in clearing him. McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio, is a sort of general center of the army air service. It is here that all damaged airplanes go for salvage of such parts as are salvable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific 'American</span><span class="font7"> tells us that among young army fliers an air service officer who cannot fly is a keewee, a confused speaker is in a flat spin, the ceiling is the highest point an airplane can reach, depending on its horse-power and density, while an aircraft gun is an archie. When a plane is wrecked it is cracked up; and when a comrade has been killed, as is often the case, he is washed out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Colonel Wm. Mitchell, formerly in the Army Air Corps, in a letter to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Washington Post, </span><span class="font7">show’s how, for propaganda purposes, certain branches of the government seek notoriety in connection with aviation exploits with which they have little and sometimes no connection ■whatever :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The navy had nothing to do with Byrd’s flight to the North Pole. Byrd himself organized it, financed it, planned it out himself, irrespective of the navy. Th® navy had retired Byrd as physically unfit for duty. The money for Byrd’s expedition to the North Pole was obtained from Edsel Ford and other public-spirited citizens. The plane, christened the Josephine Ford, was built by a Dutchman, Anthony H. G. Fokker. The motors were American. The navy said little about Byrd’s trip until it had been successfully accomplished. Then they picked him as a means of propaganda in the same way that they have attempted to pick up Lindbergh. Another instance is that of Commander Rodger’s flight to the Hawaiian Islands, when he was sent out into the broad Pacific with inadequate arrangements for his rescue and without sufficient gas to even reach the islands. He floated around for nine days. The navy never found him. It ended up by Rodgers finding the navy. Then Rodgers was brought to Washington over his own protest by the navy for propaganda purposes; and although physically unsuitable for flying, due to his eyes, he was allowed to keep on flying. This resulted in this gallant officer’s death in Philadelphia, in a stall of his plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font6"> Air </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mail Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE United States air mail service has been in operation for nine years, and lias established a world record for reliability and efficiency. The flying time from coast to coast is twenty-nine hours and some minutes, taken one day with another. Some days it is as low as twenty-six hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A record day’s delivery of airplane mail from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City was 1,200 pounds, consisting of 47,000 pieces. There is air mail service now from almost any important city ofl</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font7">United States to almost any point in Sweden. lar to those they flew. These came from Ger-Between New York and Britain the mail is car- many and from Argentina, in which latter coun-i tied by steamer, but goes all the rest of the way . try there is considerable progress in aviation being made at this time.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">by </span><span class="font7">plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On April 27 of this year an air mail was dispatched from Fairbanks, Alaska, to Wiseman, Alaska, with letters which under former methods would not have reached their destination until the middle of July. As it was, they went through in one day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Had the government retained and added to its air mail service a passenger and express service, the United States would by this time be far ahead in aviation of where it is now. But the government follows the principle that Big Business should own everything and the people nothing, and with few exceptions private companies are today carrying Uncle Sain’s mail through the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Luxurious Airplanes Abroad</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19271116_files/g_E_19271116-6.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">IRPLANES abroad are getting larger and larger and more and more luxurious. The newer cars carry twenty to twenty-five passengers, and are equipped as dining-cars. Collapsible tables are fixed in front of each seat. There are toilet accommodations, wicker armchairs, wireless telephones, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Starting from London it is less than three hours to Paris, five hours to Switzerland, eight hours to Berlin, and twelve hours to Vienna. Even Moscow is only thirty-six hours away. The charges are about fifty percent per mile more than the railway fares, but the saving in hotel bills and sleeping-car and dining-car accommodations makes the net cost about one thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not an airplane line in Europe is making more than fifty percent of its expenses, and it is taken as a matter of course that the governments will help; and they do help, as do also the cities reached, and in addition public-spirited citizens of means also render assistance to keep the lines going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the United States Henry Ford has been operating an airplane freight line between Detroit and Chicago for two and one-half years. At present he is conducting experiments on a grand scale looking to the early opening of passenger traffic on a wholesale basis. Further particulars later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The flights of Lindbergh and Chamberlin led io cabled requests for quotations on planes sirni-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Exploration and other Uses</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">HpHE airplane is par excellent the modem method of exploration and is being much used for that purpose throughout Alaska and British North America. Photographs are taken of unexplored lands, and in th? hands of experts result in perfect maps instead of wild guesses and hearsays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Alaska th§ lakes are being located which may some time be utilized as sources of waterpower. In the vicinity of Hudson Bay and Hudson Straits the question is being determined whether or not they afford </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> satisfactory outlet for the grain of western Canada, enroute to Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Twenty miles from the island of Niihau, Hawaii, is the Kaulu rock, the top of an old crater, presenting sheer cliffs on all sides. An aviator flew over the rock, and took photographs which enabled lighthouse experts to determine the best place to attempt </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> landing and place a beacon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Airplanes have been used for writing signs on the sky, for dusting cotton with calcium arsenate so as to check the spread of the boll weevil, for carrying food to men marooned on Pike’s Peak and other mountain tops, for taking photographs of estates and of Death Valley and of all cities and of fires and other events of public interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lieutenant Alford Williams, of the United States Navy, commutes daily between New York and Washington. Amsterdam sends freshly picked flowers to Berlin every morning by airplane. Off Los Angeles eight aviators have been caught smuggling foreigners into the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In many cities airplanes offer sight-seeing flights, sometimes for very small sums. In New, York City a thirty-mile flight costs only $5, whereas the same trip by taxicab would cost' $6.10. At Princeton, the students forbidden to own automobiles have taken to the air. Above Berlin a double marriage ceremony took place in an airplane hired for the occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The United Cigar Stores have a giant Sikorsky airplane stocked with tobacco, safety razors, cameras, chewing gums and candies which flies from place to place, and is widely advertised as to time of arrival. It is attracting considerable attention wherever it stops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The new French liner &quot;He de France” is so designed that passengers who are in a hurry to land can be catapulted in seaplanes when off the Grand Banks, thus cutting two days off their time on shipboard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is expected that within a very few years most of the gold will be taken out of South Africa by airplane, as its transportation, by that means will be $500,000 a year cheaper than by ’rail and water. South Africa is an ideal country for flying purposes. The climate is practically perfect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Projected Airplane Flights and Routes</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font7">S IS well known, several fliers are enroute around the world, one of them a young woman. A flight is contemplated between San Francisco and Australia, via Honolulu, 2,407 miles; Pago-Pago, 2,614 miles; Suva, Fiji, 792 miles; and Sydney, 2,003 miles. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the West Indies the West Indian Aerial Express will carry passengers, mail and express between San Juan, Porto Rico; Santo Domingo; Port Au Prince, Haiti; and Santiago, Cuba. It expects to begin operation this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the United States the Banking Service Company expects to operate lines between New York and Chicago and between New York and HMiami. The Ford Motor Company has plans and specifications for a 100-passenger aerial Pullman which is expected to make its first flight some time this fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An Italian aviator is constructing a giant plane capable of operating between Rome and Boston, via Lisbon, Azores and Newfoundland, on a forty-eight-hour schedule. The ship will carry fifteen passengers besides the crew, and expects to make its initial trip this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Germans, present kings of the air, are opening a regular air service between Berlin and Peking, 6,250 miles. Making one flight a day the trial trip was made in ten days, as against seventeen days by rail and six weeks by steamship. It is believed that by flying day and night the trip can be made in three days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Hamburg-American line hopes to inaugurate a series of regular trans-Atlantic planes between Hamburg and New York, beginning ©peration next spring. The planes, which will accommodate 170 persons, Will be fitted with ten motors of 1,000 horse-power each, capable &lt;rf a speed of 200 miles an hour. Including two intermediate landings, it is expected that the entire .trip will not require more than twenty-four hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Friedrichshafen, Germany, Dornier is building a huge flying boat, made entirely ol metal, which will carry 100 passengers. 'The hulls are built with ribs, braces and partitions, forming water-tight bulkheads. The thought is that if forced to descend it can remain afloat until help comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Commander Byrd and Arctic explorer Vilh-jalmur Stefansson both, believe that the popular route between the East and West will ultimately be over the Arctic ocean. Several aviators, Amundsen and his companions, and Wilkins, forced down on the ice hundreds of miles from land, were able to make repairs and fly back to safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Flying at Night</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A LTHOUGH Germany has one night mail line, yet night flying has become more developed in the United States than elsewhere. This night flying is between Chicago and Cheyenne, a distance of a thousand miles, and also between New York and Chicago, another thousand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By the close of this year seven thousand miles of airways will have been lighted for night flying, including besides the main aerial highway between New York and San Francisco, the 1,195 mile airway between Chicago and Dallas, one between St. Louis and San Antonio, and one between Dayton and New York, via Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is considerable pleasure flying over Berlin at night, also over London. In the latter place complaints have been made that citizens have been kept awake at night by the humming of the motors, but now that the French have discovered a way of silencing airplane motors the objection will no doubt be overruled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For night flying over Berlin the planes use magnesium lights on the outer ends of the planes, which illuminate the ground brightly. The airport at Berlin, Tempelhof Field, where fifty airplanes a day arrive and leave, is the old parade ground where the Kaiser used to ’dress up in his glittering uniforms and hold his great parades. Now nobody pays aay. mors st® tention to the Kaiser than, they do to a proclamation by the Pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Items in Airplane Design</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7">N GERMANY and in the United States the school children are encouraged to participate in the construction of model airplanes. It is expected that the results will be beneficial both to the children themselves and to aviation in general. In America the winners in each of twenty events will go to Memphis, Tenn., to compete for the national championship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Guggenheim wind tunnel is a building 110 feet long, 55 feet wide, with an eight-blade aluminum propeller at one end driven by a 300 horse-power motor. This creates in the tunnel </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">wind speed of 100 miles an hour, and enables an analytical study of the behavior of different kinds of planes under approximately actual flying conditions. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other aeronautical schools have similar wind tunnels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The engines of today are believed to be nearly perfect. Some of them have been run continuously for a hundred hours, enough to drive an airplane a third of the distance around the earth. Propellers are also believed to be very nearly perfect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The use of fabrics in airplane construction is giving way to metal. It has been found difficult to get the tension of fabrics just right. If too tight, there is a strain on the framework of the plane. If too loose, the plane does not work satisfactorily. The proper loading of a plane is a matter requiring excellent judgment and experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As an illustration of the kind of work that is done in making aviation safe for the public we quote the following from that excellent British periodical, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Children’s Newspaper:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On a wide, treeless plain in the Eastern United States a number of men in uniform stood watching with glasses the speck of an aeroplane which was racing in the sky. The men -were officers of the United States Air Service; and the plane was being flown by one of their pilots in a test which, for coolly calculated daring, has never been surpassed. ... It was not to leap with a parachute from an aeroplane, for that is part of the training of U. S. Pilots, though when they do it another aeronaut is left to guide the plane. This man had gone up alone. He had volunteered for the task in order to detect a mysterious weakness in the wings of this type of plane, the cause of which no other experiment had been sufficient to disclose. His task wa to go up in tfee plane and bring it down so steeply that the wings would give wy under the strain while he watched them giving, so that he could see the cause. What he saw, calm-eyed and watchful, as he held the plane in one hand and his life in the other, was that in diving the balancing planes began to flutter. This flutter communicated itself to the main planes and set up strains sufficient to cause them to buckle in mid-air. He saved his own life by leaping with his parachute as the planes broke. He will save that of others by the facts which he obsened; for they will lead to a proper strengthening of the parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The new helicopter of Don Juan de La Cierva,-previously mentioned in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">T7ie Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> has shown that it can arise vertically for 1,000 feet and then swoop down and rise again. But the autogyro, as it is called, has not yet proven practicable for flight.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">S IN </span><span class="font7">the operation of a bicycle or automobile, some persons learn aviation much more quickly than others. A woman recently taken on as an aviation pupil was reported to have developed the '&quot;'bird sense” in twenty minutes; and yet some cannot learn it at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After an airplane is under way, and the controls set, the machine will keep on flying until the gasoline gives out. In one instance in the World War a plane landed safely with both airmen strapped to their seats. A post mortem examination proved that both of them had been dead for an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The maintenance of a true course has been greatly assisted by radio. In the flights from San Francisco to Hawaii, so long as the plane is on its true course it receives a steady stream of the letter T in its radio. If it veers to the left or right it gets a stream of the 'etter A or the letter N, as the ease may be. A recent improvement on this is a tiny electric light on the instrument board, which burns brightly or dimly, as the-machine is on the right track or off from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Without the radio, flying in a fog would be impossible, and is almost impossible anyway; yet planes have been guided into the airport at Croydon, England, in the thickest of fogs, entirely by radio direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lindbergh ascribed his ability to maintain easily a true course from New York to Paris t@ the earth inductor compass, an instrument developed by the United States Bureau of Standards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A recent device, developed by the Army Air Service, is a recording compass for airplanes which, automatically makes a permanent record of every shift in an airplane’s course, even if it executes a figure eight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The altimeter enables an aviator to know the proximity of objects in the path of his progress. A propeller-reversing device, which begins to operate the moment an airplane lands, is expected to work satisfactorily and will enable airplanes to come to a dead stop within a few yards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The weather, greatest of all problems, is being studied now as never before. At McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio, a toy balloon rises every morning to a height of seven or eight miles above the earth. There it bursts and a tiny parachute brings safely to earth a meteorgraph containing a full record of the temperature, humidity and air pressure of the upper air. Gradually a very complete record is being made of conditions as they exist at all seasons, and this is being studied closely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">fn Case </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of Accident</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">1</span><span class="font7">N<sup>T</sup> A science as new as aeronautics accidents are inevitable, although Germany has been singularly free from them. But the airplan® is a dangerous toy to the inexperienced, and dangerous enough to anybody. In the British air service there is an average of one death a week. In the United States, as a whole, there were 508 crashes in three years’ time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Late in the summer of 1927 the engine of a Curtiss biplane burst while the plane, containing three persons, was 5,000 feet In the air. As the gasoline flamed out of the broken engine the pilot dodged the flame by going into a sideslip until witliin 100 feet of the ground, when he straightened the plane and made a perfect landing with nobody even hurt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A French inventor has a device which, in such an emergency, automatically closes the gasoline outlet, cuts the spark, and by means of compressed air throws great jets of fire-extinguishing chemicals all over the machine. Another inventor has designed a plane which, in such an emergency, can be broken in half, allowing the engine to fall while the balance of the machine becomes a parachute for the safety of its occu</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">pant, an invention which sounds rather impractical. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If anything serious happens while in the air, the only hope of the occupants of the plan® 1* in parachutes; and when far out over the ocean a parachute would only postpone death for </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">few minutes. Frequently the life of a flier depends on the exact folding of his parachute. Every fold must be exactly right, so that when the string is pulled the parachute will open perfectly. The parachute, strapped to the airman’s back, is not opened until the airman is free from the plane. Then he gives one pull of a string over his left shotilder; and if the parachute has been properly folded it opens in about two seconds. A parachute is about twenty-five feet in diameter. The best ones are made of silk. They can be guided enough to steer away from a river or a small lake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Up to 1923 the scientists had it figured out that it would be useless to leap from an airplane travelling 100 or more miles an hour, as the shock would break the bones of the traveler; and then a young French woman, Mlle. Collin, made the jump and reported that her only sensation was that of being suddenly but gently suspended in the sky as her parachute opened and she floated safely down to earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is quite practical to deliver mail and express by parachute. Articles can also be picked up by using a lead line which grapples another to which the package is attached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By means of a hand generator a disabled seaplane drifting at sea can now broadcast an appeal for help. A set of quartz crystals enables it to transmit a steady signal on one of several different wave lengths.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">EFORE long, if aviation continues to grow as at present, we shall have to give some thought to those that still dwell on the earth. In the heart of Paris, just to show that he could do it, an airman suddenly swooped down and landed safely on the Place des Quinconces, among wheeled traffic and pedestrians, without occasioning any damage. But he was arrested, and he should have been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the same city a military airplane fell and tore a big hole in the roof of a house, and caused injuries to two pedestrians. There will be many more accidents of this nature shortly, in the nature of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pilotless planes, radio governed, are now an actuality. Airplane silencers are also an actuality. Poison gases of incredible lethalness are also an actuality, and so is night flying. Well! Imagine yourself safe in bed on a dark, rainy night, and some other fellow steering a silent, poison-laden, death-dealing airplane straight toward your bedroom window! Would it not make you turn uneasily in your bed if you knew he was going to make a straight shot!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Airports and Airdromes</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HERE are “in the Unite'd States 3,608 landing fields, of which 2,782 are emergency, 226 commercial, 310 municipal, 102 army, 40 navy, 66 postal; and there are 103 seaplane stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Chicago is planning a new postoffice. The roof will have a landing space 320 feet wide by 800 feet long for mail planes. New York has no airport as yet; but public sentiment is demanding that Governor’s Island, which now lies in the center of the city, and which once belonged to the city, should be used for that purpose, and not for an army prison, as now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Armstrong seadrome is still being urged as a probable solution of bridging the gap between here and Europe. Huge platforms, standing ninety feet out of the water, and supported by stilts which go far down into the water, are the basis of the plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a storm there is little horizontal movement of the water. The body of water itself goes only up and down. At a slight distance under the surface there is hardly any movement at all. The supports of the stilts will be deep down in the under water, and the landing platform far above the tops of the waves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Models of the Armstrong device have behaved perfectly; and a large-sized test model, with a platform 150 feet square, is now being given an ocean test. If the seadrome does what is hoped for it, the time will come when there will be seadromes a hundred miles or less apart over all the ocean air routes of the world. The world has just begun to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Dirigibles Still Have Friends</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE first balloon was sent up by the Montgolfiers June 5,1783, and rising to the height ®f a mile and a half surely was a great source ®f astonishment to the natives of the French village where the sons of the paper-maker tried rat their successful experiment</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Balloons have made some remarkable journeys. Captain Spelterini, king of the air, has made 570 ascensions, and taken up 1,237 passengers, all of whom came safely back to earth. He is 74, and still a balloonist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the morning of August 30th, 1927, </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">A.</span><span class="font7"> Leo Stevens, of Englewood, N. J., landed 350 miles away from home, in the Adirondacks, in a balloon so small that he could and did carry the whole outfit on his back on his way from the landing field to the railway station. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A dirigible is a balloon of improved shape, which can be steex’ed and which is provided with sources of power other than drifting winds. In 1919 the British dirigible R-34 flew from Scotland to Mineola, N. Y., 3,130 miles in 108 hours, 12 minutes, and returned to England in 74 hours, 56 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1924 the ZR-3, now the Los Angeles, flew from Friedrichshafen, Germany, to Lakehurst, N. J., 5,066 miles, in 81 hours, 17 minutes. It takes 2,400,000 cubic feet of helium to float the Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The United States is building a new dirigible of 6,500,000 cubic feet gas capacity (nearly three times the size of the Los Angeles). It will be capable of carrying five airplanes and a crew of forty-five officers and men, at a speed of eighty miles an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the Zeppelin factory in Germany the LZ-127 is now in course of construction. When completed it will circumnavigate the globe in three or four hops, and then settle dbwn to steady service between Spain and South America. It will carry 100 passengers, crew, luggage and mails. Eight large compartments will be fitted with every luxury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The gas which will be used for fuel is less inflammable than gasoline, and therefore puts no additional weight on the ship. The supporting gas will be helium, thus entirely eliminating the danger of explosion. The new framework will be constructed of duraluminum with a tensile strength twenty percent higher than that heretofore used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Edsel Ford, who has given much attention lately to aviation subjects, has expressed the opinion that the ultimate solution will be that dirigibles will be chiefly used for traversing the longer main routes of travel in all weathers, while the airplanes will be used as feeders. Perhaps he is- right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Disease and Early Grave via the Modern Kitchen</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By William Held, M, D., Director of the V. 8. Health Deague,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font7">ITH the information contained in this article the'intelligent reader should be able to draw his own conclusions. If he, after reading the facts presented herein, is set to thinking and perhaps to do some investigating on his own account, there is hope that in time and with the general dissemination of knowledge some action will follow which may set the stone orolling that in its onward move will crush th® powers which now, to the great detriment of the people, disregard and conceal most vital facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the month of February of this year at a Parent-Teachers Association banquet in Kansas City, Kansas, more than 150 persons who had partaken of the food served at the banquet, became siek. The food had been prepared and was allowed to stand in aluminum ware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. C. T. Betts, of Toledo, Ohio, who furnished much of the data used here, in the interest of public health and on the basis of much investigation and research conducted by him, urged that the authorities direct their inquiries, not only toward bacterial, but also to mineral poisoning; namely, to the investigation of th® aluminum chemistry. He offered to deposit th® sum of $500 to defray the expense of another dinner, to be cooked again in aluminum dishes, and to forfeit the money if again 150 persons were not poisoned. Apparently the doctor failed; his offer was not accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If, after presentation of Die evidence, the reader still inclines to disbelieve any other but his own experience, the following little experiment is suggested: In a clean aluminum dish boil some water for half an hour; do the same with an equal quantity of water placed in a porcelain dish. Pour each specimen, after having boiled it, into separate clean glasses, allow to stand for half an hour. Hold the two specimens against a light, and observe the clearness of the water boiled in the porcelain and the precipitate in the water of the aluminum dish. The white precipitate you will see, is aluminum hydroxide, a chemical extensively used in the treament o£ stomach diseases, such as dyspepsia, ga-s, belching, pain, ulcers and intestinal ills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Upon the time you allow the water to boil and to stand in aluminum dishes depends the amount of aluminum hydroxide you produce. If you cook food in aluminum dishes, you produce vanous aluminum compounds, I?or instance, ® you cook eggs, you manufaeture the drug known as aluminum phosphate; if salted meat, alumi-riurn chloride; and if you boil alkaline foods you will produce various aluminum compounds, always depending on what kind of food you prepare in aluminum ware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you are taking some aluminum compound as a medical prescribed by your physician for some ailment for which such drug is indicated and besides also eat food prepared in aluminum dishes, you obviously ingest more than your share of aluminum drags. But if you are not taking aluminum in medicinal doses under doctor’s direction, but eat food prepared in alumi-* num dishes, then you get the aluminum drag, whether you need it or not. And the doses you get and the kind of aluminum compound you eat, are without rhyme or reason, because there is no way of knowing dose or kind of compound when you eat several meals a day, carrying all kinds of aluminum compounds with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It has already been stated that when salted meat is boiled or prepared in aluminum dishes (even though no water is used) the compound of sodium of aluminum is produced. To understand the meaning of this I quote from Dr. Herbert Snow, who, as early as October 17, 1912, in an article published in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News </span><span class="font7">of Chicago, with reference to aluminum chloride, stated as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, that powerful narcotie</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">acid poison had obviously been generated by the chemical action of the common salt in the bacon upon the metal surface.” Dr. Snow mads this statement after having observed the mentioned drug in a mass of fat left over after bacon had been fried in an aluminum dish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have the word of eminent chemists to the effect that aluminum hydroxide, that is the drug you take into your stomach when you drink water that has been boiled or was standing in aluminum containers, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">attacks the gastric juice </span><span class="font7">in your stomach. In order to digest your food properly you </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font7"> have </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">normal</span><span class="font7"> gastric juice. But after aluminum hydroxide has mixed with, the digestive fluids of the stomach it neutralizes and absorbs the same, which is just like robbing you of this important digestive ferment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nature always tries to supply necessary demands ; and so, when your gastric juice is acted on by the aluminum drug, nature attempts to make MORE gastric juice, working overtime, as it were. But finally, since you keep on loading aluminum hydroxide into your stomach, this 'drug wins the battle and remains </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">as a poison in the, stomach.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">lor</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">This opinion was also expressed by Dr. Victor V. Vaughn, once dean of the Medical Department of the University of Michigan. Before the Federal Trade Commission, Washington, I).. C., he said: “This conclusion is that salts of aluminum are harmful in the human body,” a conclusion he had pronounced before a Senate Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. H. A. McGuigan, talking of the effects of aluminum before the Federal Trade Commission in Docket Case 540, Washington, D. C., stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When taken internally, the action is due to chemical local action on the stomach and intestines, the acid liberated upon the union of metal and protein penetrating to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">tissues with an astringent effect.</span><span class="font6"> The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">local reactions</span><span class="font6"> are loss of appetite, pain and discomfort, nausea, vomiting, purging, congestion, hemorrhages resulting from irritant and corrosive action. Ulcers may result from bacterial action on dead tissue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This opinion, which was given under oath, translated into the language of the laity means that after the aluminum compounds have raised havoc with the stomach and have reduced the resisting and fighting power of the parts, bacteria, which are always present but which could not harm the healthy organs, are now free to do their destructive work on the unprotected tissue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Assuming that the reader is a very careful person and will carefully weigh all the pros and cons before deciding to throw into the scrap pile the shining aluminum ware that now adorns his kitchen, we must present a little more evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Continuing our inquiry we learn that Harry Gideon Wells, Professor of Pathology in the University of Chicago, had something to say concerning the effects of aluminum compounds on red blood corpuscles. He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Aluminum compounds in solution, may pass into the blood stream from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">any pari</span><span class="font6"> of the intestinal tract, from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">moutJrito anus.</span><span class="font6"> The moment such compound has passed the wall of the intestines beyond the surface and entered the blood-vessels of the intestinal wall., it will come in contact with the red blood cells and cause these corpuscles to aggregate or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">clump</span><span class="font6"> and have opportunity to produce this </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">injurious</span><span class="font6"> effect exactly the same as if the aluminum compound had been </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">injected into the blood stream directly.</span><span class="font6"> The tendency to aggregate is a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">serious </span><span class="font6">matter since the aggregated corpuscles become more </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">fragile, break up,</span><span class="font6"> and lead to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">anemia</span><span class="font6"> or the reduction of the number of red blood corpuscles. It is possible for all the poison that is taken by mouth to be recovered in the discharges from the bowel </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">and yet</span><span class="font6"> produce evidence of poison in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">remote</span><span class="font6"> parts of the body. (Italics mine.—■ Held.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While treating patients for anemia the writer was in some cases chagrined and at a loss to understand the slow improvement by these patients and again to find others relapsing after some headway had been made. Noticing that other members of the patient’s family, who were also anemic, responded better to the treatment, led to inquiry; and it was revealed that these patients ate most of their meals in restaurants (where at that time aluminum dishes were seldom used), while the “stay at home” patients ate all meals in the house, where all food was prepared in aluminum containers. When these dishes were discarded, progress in the patient’s condition became satisfactory, and recovery finally resulted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Others have made the observation that patients complaining of various gastric and intestinal disorders recovered without any other treatment except the discontinuance of aluminum ware for six to eight weeks. Of course, where serious disease had developed, as for instance cancer, no improvement followed the discontinuance of aluminum ware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Amongst those who condemn the use of aluminum compounds in foods are Dr. Albert P. Matthews, professor of bio-chemistry in the College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati; William J. Gies, professor of biological chemistry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University; Dr. A. S. Loevenhart, professor of pharmacology at the University of Wisconsin; Dr. Phil. E. Hawk and Dr. Clarence A. Smith, of Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia ; Dr. Arnold K. Balls, of the University of Pennsylvania; Dr. Fred A. Hammett, of the Wistar Institute of Anatomy at Philadelphia; and many more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Opposed to the views expressed by these and many other scientists in the aluminum controversy, is the opinion of the spokesman for the medical union and the propaganda agents for the aluminum industry. Many thousand physicians have not given the matter the consideration and thought which in the interest of their patients it deserves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some have allowed themselves to be influenced by the statements of the ever watchful advertis</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ing</span><span class="font8"> agents of the medical union just as laymen rely ©n the often absolutely incorrect opinion </span><span class="font7">and advice of journalist doctors. I believe that most doctors, were they correctly informed, would without further loss of time acquaint their patients with the subject and call their attention to the risk they run while continuing to eat food prepared in aluminum ware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is it not strange that some newspapers that failed &quot;to play up” the poisoning affair of the 150 persons, mentioned before, shortly after the publicity given the matter by other papers, contained page-long advertisements of aluminum kitchen-ware? It is strange how these coincidences do happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Germany, France, Belgium, Great Britain, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Brazil prohibit the use of aluminum compounds in food stuff, including alum in baking powder. It will hardly be doubted that the named countries are progressive and have at their command the service of expert chemists, pathologists and medics who, no doubt, were consulted before the enactment of these laws which aim to protect and preserve the people’s health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What is the reason that in our own America, with its great aluminum industry, which sold o\ er </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">one hundred million dollars</span><span class="font7"> &quot;worth of aluminum in 1926, aluminum compounds in food stuff is permitted; what is the reason that all the protest of men who know the facts of aluminum poisoning, that all their warnings fall •upon deaf ears; that nothing has been done to stay the death-d°aling effect of aluminum?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But,” I imagine the reader asks, “is there any other evidence to show that disease is really connected with the use of aluminum kitchenware?” and I prepare to answer. Statistics are dry reading, but they compel attention. In 1911 aluminum for cooking utensils was very little known. In 1923 the yearly output &quot;was $41,000,000.00, and since then the annual sales have reached the hundred-million-dollar mark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1911 one would hear of an aged man or w man who here and there died of cancer. Since aluminum has become a household word, or a kitchen byword, there has been a tremendous increase in diseases of the stomach and intestines, of every kind. That increase was proportionate with the increase in the sale of aluminum kitchenware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you can reconcile it with your logic and </span><span class="font8">sound reasoning power yob. may violate your </span><span class="font7">better judgment and put this pro-rata rise, thia </span><span class="font8">keeping step of disease and aluminum use, to </span><span class="font7">mere coincident. But if you do so, you should also not pay attention to a sudden increase in any particular disease to an epidemic and not seek for reasons of such occurrences. You must then be consistent and put aU such matters to the credit of coincident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the present time, statistics inform us, that one out of every five adult deaths in the United States is due to cancer. That is an increase of 100% per thousand since the use of aluminum ware became general. When did we hear of cancer patients who are yet in their teens, as we do now, before the advent of aluminum kitchenware?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is it not a very telling condition that aluminum hydroxide </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">increases</span><span class="font7"> the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach and is it not like the “writing on the wall” that even/ cancer patient has </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font7"> an acidosis ? In other words, cancer is always preceded by the very condition which users of aluminum compounds produce in their system; namely, acidosis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pages could be written were one to attempt to quote the opinions of those who have gone on record for condemning aluminum in food stuff. But what would be the use? He who after the presentation of the above facts is not on the road to align himself with the anti-aluminum people, I fear, is beyond reasoning power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When research workers, investigators who are trained in their particular branch, representative scientists, state their findings, should it not carry much more weight than the contradictions of those who shout the loudest, yet have neither research, knowledge nor investigation to base their claims on? Should the statement of anyone who directly or indirectly is interested in the aluminum industry, be allowed to outweigh the opinion of honest, unbiased and learned scientists?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The deniers and decriers of the aluminum opposition must have a great deal of confidence in the ignorance of the masses that they challenge the opinion of the scientific world. As long as the mob is prevented from learning the real truth, business will be good for the aluminum industry and those who hitch their carts to it. It is the mob, the masses that pay, as the countless sick, invalid and dying patients</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">With Neatness and Dispatch</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE St. Louis </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> of July 25th put a lot into a few words when it said, &quot;Judge Rutherford of the International Bible Students Association is an eloquent speaker with a rare radio voice. He talked yesterday by the KSD route. His speech was remarkable in that he took off more skins of more people at one time than any orator of modern days. He disposed of chain stores, politicians, organized religions and the doctors with what might be called neatness and dispatch.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">What Else Could He Expect</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font7"> DISPATCH from Boston says: &quot;The Right Reverend Joseph G. Anderson, 62, since 1909 auxiliary bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Boston, died today at his home a few hours after receiving by cable a special blessing of Pope Pius XI.” Here is hoping that Mr. Ratti never blesses us. If he does we a^e goners, sure enough. It seems that nobody can survive that blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Blessing of Old Glory</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">IE account of the blessing of the Old Glory plane, which was lost at sea with all on board, reads: “The Vatican, on learning of the blessing of Old Glory by Father Mullen, Old Orchard, expressed great satisfaction that a religious ceremony had preceded such a momentous undertaking as the airflight from America to Rome. The Pope added that he hoped the daring enterprise would be successful, thus offering him an opportunity to impart the Apostolic-benediction to the intrepid aviators.&quot; Poor fellows! They were effectively killed without it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Princess Lowenstein’s Plane</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">F</span><span class="font7">ROM the Baltimore </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">'American</span><span class="font7"> we take the following account of the blessing of the Princess Lowenstein’s plane: “The plane was sent on its way with the blessing of the Roman Catholic Church, of which Princess Lowenstein SVertheim is a devout member. The two pilots and their passengers grouped themselves under the spreading wings of the St. Raphael; and as the Archbishop of Cardiff approached they fell to their knees. The priest with upraised hands called on heaven’s blessings upon this hazardous undertaking and sprinkled holy water on the ship.&quot; That settled it. The plane then sailed away; and all on board were lost, as a matter of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Price of Masses Doubled</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE Bishop of Madrid has just doubled the price of masses. Well! Why not? It is all clear profit, even if every last cent of it is money-obtained under false pretense; and the rule of Big Business today is to make as big a profit as you can, regardless of the injury to your fellow man. Moreover, the time to charge high prices for masses is now; for in a little while the people will wake up to the fact that the whole thing is a swindle and then they will stop paying altogether, and there will be nothing left for the clergy to do but to go to work the same as anybody else. Hurrah for high-priced masses I Get it while you can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Turn About is Fair Play</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font7">S EVERYBODY knows, the International</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bible Students Association pays its respects impartially to all ecclesiastical and religious associations of any and every sort, without fear and without favor. On August 24 last it received a telegraphic order for two copies of Judge J. F. Rutherford’s address, delivered in Toronto, July 24,1927. The telegram stated that the copies were desired immediately. Investigation showed that it came from an official of the National Council of Catholic men, Washington, D. C. Interviewed the next day the gentleman who sent it stated that he desired copies of the address to bring some of the questions raised therein before a convention of Catholic Societies in Detroit, Michigan, to be held during the week of August 28, 1927. He was very courteous, but would not discuss any questions. In a subsequent interview he claimed that the I. B. S. A. are encouraging the destruction of organized Christianity. He strongly resented statements to the effect that the Catholic system is a part of the Devil's organization. However, when proof was offered to him on this point, after a few asthma spells he quieted down sufficiently to listen to a brief outline of the divine plan, and finally took a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Co &gt;21/011</span><span class="font7"> booklet, one of Judge Butherford’s lectures, which discusses these questions. We think it quite right that our Catholic friends should look into these charges, </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font7">the Protestants, too. The quicker they look </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font7">the closer they look, the better we are satisfied. The old systems of error must all go, and the truth and only the truth can be left to stay. Every system built on the eternal torture theory is a lie, no matter under what professedly holy name it sails. All these systems must pass away. They cannot endure the light of the truth. They may hate it, but the truth alone will prevail.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Blessed Are the Fearless</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New York, by C. J. Woodworth]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">’&quot;The saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.’’—Daniel 7:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font7">UR Lord Jesus Christ was the greatest Bible Student that ever lived. Throughout His boyhood and youth He listened every sabbath to the Scriptures, and in due time became the reader of the synagogue in which He worshipped. In His perfect mind He stored up everything He had read and waited until the due time might come when Me should understand it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Over sixty years after Jesus' death he gave to ’John a Revelation which God had given unto Him, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">but there</span><span class="font7"> are still many things that wait to be revealed. But there was a time when a flood of truth was due to come to Jesus all at once, and it did come. That time v.as when Jesus reached the age of thirty and went down into 'Jordan to be baptized. Immediately the heavens were opened unto Him, and He saw and understood things never before comprehended. And immediately He went apart by Himself into the wilderness forty days to study them. But the Devil was there, attending the Bible study and prayer meeting, as is his custom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom of God Foreshadowed</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font7">E CAN only conjecture what were the matters that passed before Jesus’ mind on that occasion, but we can be sure that they concerned the establishment of God’s kingdom in the earth, to take the place of Satan’s kingdom; and it would be fair to assume that prominently before His mind was the striking picture of this transfer which occurs in the book of Daniel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus</span><span class="font7"> could </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">not have failed to recognize the </span><span class="font7">fact that the great image which Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream represented Satan’s empire. He knew that the head of gold was identified by Daniel as the Babylonian empire; he no doubt knew that the Medo-Persian empire was represented by the arms and breast of silver, and the Grecian empire by the belly and thighs of brass, and that He was then living in the days of the fourth or Roman empire, pictured in the image ' by the legs of iron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The thing that would have interested Jesus most in the account would necessarily be the end of the story, that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and smote the image upon its feet and itself became a great mountain and filled the whole earth, and that thus was pictured what would happen in the latter days; that the God of heaven would set up a kingdom that should never be destroyed, that it should break in pieces and consume all the other kingdoms of earth, and that it should stand for ever. Our Lord Jesus must have identified Himself as associated in some way with that stone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ever Fearful, Satan Schemes</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19271116_files/g_E_19271116-9.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">O DOUBT Satan recognized the thoughts that were flitting through Jesus’ mind. He 'did not wish his kingdom to be destroyed. He wished to retain it for ever, and so he sought to turn Jesus’ attention away from the Father’s plan. If J esus would fall down and worship him, and kiss his toe as King Alphonso does when he visits the pope, he would give Jesus a sort of papal blessing; and forthwith Jesus would be the first pope and ruler of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus saw through the whole empty scheme and promptly said to Satan: &quot;Get thee behind me, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.” (Luke 4: 8) Jesus saw that the kingdom would never be taken away from Satan except in God’s due time and way, and that there would inevitably be a time of trouble when the transfer would take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When, a little later, Jesus taught Ilis disciples to pray, and instructed them that, as their first petition to the Almighty, they should pray, &quot;Thy kingdom come,” He was really instructing them to pray for a change of government, and a change which He knew could not come about except by the ruin of all the other governments of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hence it follows that true Christians, looking for and praying for and -working for this new government that is to take the place of all other governments, have necessarily been out of favor with Satan and with all who hold to and uphold Satan’s kingdom and Satan’s methods, and out of favor with many of those who see that they will lose their jobs and all their influence and power when the kingdom for which the Christians pray takes the place of the particular kingdom with which their temporal interests are for the moment eonneetecL</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Desire of All Nations”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CTUALLY, though they do not know it, the Lord’s kingdom is the desire of all nations, and is as much the desire of kings and presidents as it is of the common people. Let ns glance a moment at some of the things promised in connection with the Lord’s kingdom, and see how true it is that, as human beings, all rulers really have a great interest in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Take, for example, the king of Britain. One of his titles is that of Defender of the Faith, meaning- thereby the Christian faith, the faith as laid down in God’s Word. If a sincere Christian he must long for the time when the knowledge of the glory of God shall cover the earth as the waters cover the great deep. Thai will be in the days of Christ’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He must long for the time when the earth, which is God’s footstool, shall be no longer a place of bloodshed, poverty and sorrow, but shall be a place of peace and plenty and joy. lie shall have his wish; for God says in His Word, &quot;I will make the place of my feet glorious.” That will be in the days of Christ’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He must long for the time to come when there will be no people so poor or so remote from civilization that they may not know about God s glorious arrangement for their recovery from sin and death and every evil thing. Fm shall have his wish; for God has said in His Word, &quot;So surely as I live, the whole earth shall be filled with my glory.” That will be in the days o£ Chri si’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He must earnestly wish for the lime when the divine promise shall be fulfilled that it shall no more be necessary for a man to say to his neighbor or to his brother, &quot;Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, . . . for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.” (Jeremiah 31: 34) That will be in the days of Christ’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now he and his loved ones sicken and die, and he must wish that the time were here of which the prophet speaks when he says that the people that dwell therein shall be a people whose iniquity is forgiven, and the inhabitant shall not say, “I am sick.” (Isaiah 33:24) That will be in the days of Christ’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now the king grows old and eventually dies and another takes his place. He must wish that he were living in the days of which the prophet</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">says concerning the sick that God will be gracious to them and deliver them from going down into the grave, that they shall return, to the days of their youth and their flesh shall be fresher than a child’s. That will be in the days of Christ’s kingdom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The king hag laid away some of his loved ones in the tomb, and he must wish that the time had come for their awakening out of the sleep of 'death. He must wish that the ransomed of the Lord shall return from the grave and come into the new order of things with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away. That will be in the days of Christ’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“All Rulers Shall . . . Obey Him’<sup>9</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ITT the king cannot have his kingdom and Christ’s kingdom at one and the same time.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19271116_files/g_E_19271116-11.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">The one is to take the place of the other; and whether they like it or whether they do not, all earthly rulers will have to sooner or later step aside and let earth’s Euler, Christ Jesus, have their thrones and dominions for ever and ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of them have been clever enough to see this. Such was the case vvitli the old heathen Boman emperors. There was a time when for a man to admit that he was a Christian and that he hoped for Christ’s kingdom to come and to take the place of the old bloody heathen kingdoms was equivalent to the death sentence. And some have seen the same idea since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the World War those who would not encourage their fellow Christians to kill one another were in disfavor, and the Lord knew that such would be the case. The passage is a familiar one. “Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: all these are the begin-ing of sorrows [labor pangs ushering in the new era]. But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils [Probably he meant the councils of defence; for that sis what happened.]; and in the synagogues |{ churches] ye shall be beaten [castigated with Stinging words]; and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.”—Mark 13:8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All this was fulfilled during the World War. Several of the nations of the earth then turned against all real Christians. The expression, ''Him whom the nation abhorreth,” came to have a real application to the class for whom it was intended by the Lord. The rulers could see that here was a class that was not in sympathy with their plans for exterminating one another. And yet they were the most peaceful and lawabiding, and therefore the most desirable, citizens in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Dominion for the Courageous</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font7">UE text says that “the saints of the Most</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.” (Daniel 7:18) And a little farther down in the same chapter, verse 22, the prophet says, “And the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our understanding is that the time has now come for these texts to be fulfilled. The word “take” here does not mean to reach out and grasp, but it means to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">take</span><span class="font7"> in the sense of receiving something handed to us by another. That is the exact thought. It is our heavenly Father and our Lord Jesus who are presenting the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">kingdom to</span><span class="font7"> the saints of the Most High. All they have to do is to take it when it is handed to them. But they do have to do that; and herein comes the point of our lesson, Blessed are the Fearless. It takes courage to receive this gift and to make the use of it; but this we must do if we are to be counted worthy to possess it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word possess in these texts means to make solid, as though after having received the kingdom the saints would still have to make it a solid possession; and that also is the fact. Our''’ immediate business at the present .time is to make this kingdom solid. It is already solid in our own minds. Our concern is to make it solid in the minds of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The way we make it solid, to put it pointedly, is by presenting the message of the kingdom from door to door and leaving behind us the records which will eventually convince everybody, the people, the business men, the rulers and finally even the clergy, that we have what everybody wants; namely, God’s everlasting truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Not Afraid”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">UST now there are occasions for timidity;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">and it is just now that the words of the</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19271116_files/g_E_19271116-12.png" alt="" style="width:11pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Master specially apply, ‘Tear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” (Luke 12: 32) It is very apparent that these words would not have much application to the great big flocks that boast of their millions of communicants. If they were to use this text they would have to change it and make it read something like this, ‘Fear not, Great Big Flock; it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom.’ Quality, not size, seems to be God's motto; and size, not quality, is the motto of many others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The weapons with which God's people are to make the kingdom solid as a possession for themselves and for others are not the ordinary weapons. The apostle tells us about these weapons, saying, “The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds; easting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God.”—2 Cor. 10:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In order to fight this fight God’s people need to have on the Christian’s armor. We used to hear much about this armor in the Bible Students’ conventions of years past, and in some of them w<sup>T</sup>e did not hear much else. The popular thought seemed to be that the one and only occupation of the saints should be to spend their lives buckling on first one piece and then another ; and that v’hen they had it all on, all they would need to do would be to stand still and look pretty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now it begins to be more apparent that after the armor is on comes the conflict for which the armor was intended. It becomes necessary to serve notice on Satan, and all branches of his empire, that the time has come for a change of administration, and this takes courage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;More Than Conquerors”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE apostle says, “Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.” (Ephesians 6:13) The word withstand does not mean to stand still and let somebody else hack at you, to see if he can put you out of commission. It means to fight, to withstand an attack by a counter attack. The one that does the attacking is Satan; the counter attack is against him. “Resist the devil and he will flee,” is the language of the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Weymouth’s translation puts this very well when it renders the passage: “Wherefore take anto you the whole amor of God, that ye may be able to stand your ground on the day of battle and remain victors in the field.” The battle is on: and the conflict is now, and has ever been, principally a conflict in our minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is of this conflict that the Apostle John writes, “Herein is our love made perfect, that w^ may have boldness in the dav of j idgment: because as he is. so aie we m this vorld. There is no fear |no fear of man] in love: but perfect love easteth out fear; because fear hath torment. He that foareth [mtifl, is not made perfect m love.”—1 John 4:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Il roq tired courage for Abraham to brave the ston i of criticism in his home torn and to leaw for an unknown land. It required courage for Moses to boldly walk unbidden into the presence </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font8">Pharaoh </span><span class="font7">and demand </span><span class="font8">that </span><span class="font7">he </span><span class="font8">let </span><span class="font7">God's people go. It required courage for Joshua to lead his army across Jordan, knowing they must either conquer all that was before them or be destroyed* It required courage for Gideon with three hundred men to attack an army in which he was outnumbered mom than a hundred to one. It required courage for David to face Goliath, and. it required courage for Nathan to face David with his guilt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It took courage for Elijah to taunt the 450 priests of Baal and to boldly tell Ahab that he was the cause of Israel’s troubles. It took courage for Daniel to face the lions; and for Hana-niah. Mishael and Azariah to tell Nebuchadnezzar to go ahead and do what he liked, but that they would not even consider the question of bowing down before him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It took courage for Christ to tell the scribes and Pharisees that they were hypocrites; and it took courage for Peter and John to accuse these same people of the murder of which they v°re guilty, and to refuse to heed their commands not to preach any more in the name of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It took courage for Stephen to tell the Sanhedrin esmin that they were a bunch of betrayers ami murderers. It took courage for the Ano:-tie Paul to reprove Peter beiore the church at Antioch, and for him to stand alone before Nero when all foisook him and even the church at Antioch had turned away from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It took as much courage for Daniel to stand before Belshazzar and tell him that God had numbered and finished his kingdom, that he had been weighed in the balances and found wanting, and that his kingdom was now about to bo given into the hands of the Medes and Persians, as it did to face the den of lions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It took as much courage for David to enter Saul's tent in the night and take away his spear as it did for him to slay Goliath. It took courage for Samuel to turn his back on King Saul and to refuse to have anything more to do with him to the day of his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It took courage for Ezra to refuse an escort while traveling to the land of Palestine, and it took courage for Nehemiah to reprove the Israelites for practising usury. It took courage for Moses to ask, “Who is on the Lord’s side?” and to declare war single-handed on six hundred thousand armed men. It took courage for Caleb to face the same lot of angry men, and it took courage for Gideon to destroy his father’s altar to Baal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It took courage for Pastor Russell to tell the Chief of Police of New York City, when the latter had declined to permit him to distribute a carload of tracts at the church doors, that the chief misunderstood the object of his visit; that he had merely come to say that he was going to distribute them, and to demand that the chief see to it that the distributers were not interfered with. And incidentally he got what he was after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It took courage for Judge Rutherford to tell </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">nosey representative of the Brooklyn District Attorney’s office that it was none of his business where he would be on the next four successive Sundays; and it took courage for him to tell another equally nosey policeman to get out of his house and stay out and not to come back without an order for his arrest, or he would throw him out. The possession of a uniform 'does not grant the power to make laws. The people keep that power in their own hands; and what the people have not taken away from themselves legally, cannot be taken away from them illegally.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">S WE read the Scriptures we all feel sorry for Nicodemus and those other rulers who really believed on Jesus but did not have the courage to stand up for their convictions. We feel sorry for Peter when he denied the Lord, and when he lacked the courage to stand for the right at Antioch. We feel ashamed and sorry for the church at Antioch that it could ever have fallen so low as to turn its back on the noble martyr Paul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We feel ashamed of those Ephraimites who, being armed, turned back in the day of battle; and we feel ashamed right now of those who know what the Lord’s will is in respect to the proclamation of the kingdom of Christ, that it has now actually come and is in process of being set up, and who yet, having all the means at hand for placing this literature in the hands of those who need it, lack the one thing, courage, which would accomplish it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But there is another side to this matter which should bo presented before the subject is dropped. When the Lord created the first man He gave him as part of his mental endowment the faculty of caution, and expects him to use it. If we could find a man that did not have any caution at all, we would find a man that did not have any sense at all. But the faculty must be exercised in the right way; and the right way is to exercise it upward, not downward, toward God first, last and all the time, and only to a limited extent toward man. “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of -wisdom.”—Psa. Ill: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This “fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever”. (Psalm 19:9) And only those who have this proper fear are in a condition of heart where the Lord can teach them. “What man is he that feareth the Lord? Him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.”—Psalm 25:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ones that know the most about the Lord are the ones that fear Him in the right w<sup>y</sup>ay; that is, fear to displease Him. Many people do not know what the oathbound covenant of God is. They do not know that it means the blessing of all the nations, kindreds and families of the earth. But those -who are walking closest to the Lord, are those who tremble at His Word, who known about this covenant and who know many of the details of its present and future operation. “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and. he will show them his covenant.” ■—Psalm. 25:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rewards of Godly Fear</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font7">E ALL want the protection of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is expressly promised to those that fear Him. “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.” —Psalm 34:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">David puts this matter very well. He likens himself to a little child that has trustingly put its best means of protection in the hand of its parent, saying, “I am continually with theei thou hast Mfen me by my right hand.” (Psalm 73:23) And then, in the 103rd Psalm he adds that &quot;like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We all desire the Lord’s mercy, and &quot;the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him”. (Psalm 103: 17) And when it is exercised toward us it is exercised in a most wonderful manner. &quot;For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.”-— Psalm 103:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We all have certain, natural and proper desires ; and we read that God &quot;will fulfil the desire of them that fear him.: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.” (Psalm 145:19) We want the Lord to take pleasure in us. And &quot;the Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him”.—Psalm 147:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If we have the right view of matters we have a proper and reasonable wish that we might be of the Lord’s jewels, and it is of the present time and the people of the Lord now living that Malachi writes when, he says: “Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another; and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name. And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.”—Malachi 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So, then, we are to fear Him who is able to 'destroy both soul and body, and to be not high-minded ; hut with meekness and fear, lest we might displease the One Ave seek to represent, we should go coura geously about the work vvhicli He has given us to do.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">UT as far as man is concerned, while we are to render to every man what is his due, yet we are not to be afraid of any man. “The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.” (Proverbs 29:25) A man, after all, is only a pound of solid matter wet up in seven pails of water; and who should be afraid of such </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a,</span><span class="font7"> combination as that!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Psalmist says: &quot;The Lord is my light and my salvation' whom shall I fear! The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? . . . Though, an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house oil the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple. For in the time of trouble he will hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me: he shall set me up upon a rock.”— Psalm 27:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the same strain the Prophet Isaiah says, and his words apply to the very hour in which we are living, and to the very people to whom these words are now addressed: &quot;I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass; and forgettest the Lord thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor? The captive exile hast-eneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fait But I am the Lord thy God, that di vided the sea, whose reaves roared: The Lord of hosts is his name. And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and. say unto Zion, Tbuu art my people.”—-Isaiah 51:12-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As God once spoke to Joshua so now He speaks to His people again: &quot;Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.” “Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you.” —Joshua 1: 9,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Revival of Hebrew</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">WO generations ago there Avas not a person in the world that could speak Hebrew; it was a language engraven upon tombstones and used in the study of the Bible. Today in Palestine Hebrew is the language of the home and the school; and from the kindergarten to the Hebrew University every subject is taught in Hebrew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Earth’s Greatest Empire </span><span class="font5">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New York, by Judge Rutherford]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">S</span><span class="font7">INCE the days of Eden it has been the expressed purpose of Jehovah to establish for </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">wan’</span><span class="font7">s benefit a universal empire on the earth. It is through this empire that God has promised that He will bless all the families and nations of the earth. By and through the peoples of Israel 'God organized a typical empire which foreshadowed the real and greater empire through [which the blessings shall come to mankind. Because of unfaithfulness to God He overthrew that nation of Israel, and there permitted the Gentiles to establish a world-wide empire under Nebuchadnezzar. It was at that time that God said in substance that the Gentiles would continue without interruption until ‘He whose right It is shall come; and to Him will I give the kingdom’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shortly thereafter God caused His prophet Daniel to briefly sketch the history of the world powers from the overthrow of Israel until the end of the Gentile Times. Having done this he added: “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.”—Daniel 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here is the positive statement that God intends to erect a universal kingdom or empire that shall exercise dominion for the good of mankind for ever. Further reference to the time and the establishment of that universal empire is made by the prophet when he wrote: “And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.”— Daniel 7:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a further evidence that the great King who shall reign in that empire shall rule for the benefit of man, and that the dominion thereof shall be universal, it is written: “In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth. He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the^earth.”—Psalm ^2:7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That great King is The Christ of God, the great Messiah of Jehovah. That He will have associates with Him made up of those who have been faithful to Him is evidenced by the scrip* tures: “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne” (Revelation 3: 21); “And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.”—Rev.2: 26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the outworking of the divine plan God has moved forward majestically, notwithstanding the opposition of the enemy Satan and his representatives. On this occasion we examine some of the Biblical proofs concerning the preparation for this mighty empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Empire means a vast government possessing and exercising supreme power, sovereignty, sway and control. The empire herein referred to is God’s government or kingdom, organized, possessing and exercising supreme power for the benefit of His creatures, and particularly for the benefit of man. That government or empire is delegated to His beloved Son; hence it is properly called the empire or government of Messiah. The supreme power proceeds from the God of heaven, and therefore the empire is properly called the kingdom of heaven. We must not infer that God has not always governed His obedient creatures. There is no record of the beginning of the exercise of Jehovah’s sovereign power. In fact the Scriptures speak of the priest Melchizedek, priest of the Most High God, as picturing the Executive Officer of God carrying out the divine plan at all times. There is no record of the beginning of his days nor the end of his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But here we consider God’s plan and provisions pertaining to man. God created the earth for the habitation of man. (Isaiah 45:12,18) The expressed purpose of God is to the effect that the perfect man shall have dominion or rule over the earth. Man’s first overlord, Lucifer, who committed the great crime of treason against God, induced man to turn away from God; and man thereby lost life and the right to life. Lucifer, who is now Satan the Devil, budded a great organization of his own to hold man in subjection to himself and to keep the mind ofl man turned away from Jehovah, to the end that’ Lucifer might receive the worship of man. God’a</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">plan and purpose is to 'deliver man from the power and influence of Satan and to restore him to his former condition of life and of blessings incident thereto. To this end God builds a mighty empire or kingdom, with His beloved Son as King. His arrangement is that Christ Jesus shall have associated with Him one hun-dred and forty-four thousand others who shall form a part of His empire. In building this empire God has made no haste, but has majestically progressed with it according to His good pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Both Zion and Jerusalem are names applied to God’s organization. It is out of this organization of Zion that the Deliverer must come. (Romans 11:26) Of necessity the foundation of the great empire must be laid in God’s organization. Therefore it is written: “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.” (Isaiah 28:16) This prophecy without doubt refers to Jesus Christ the beloved Son of God, to whom He has committed all power in heaven and in earth. The great empire is symbolically represented as a stone structure, the foundation stone of which is Christ. He was tried and tested, and under the most severe test proved His loyalty and faithfulness to God. It is certain that God can always trust Him. He justly earned the title, “The Faithful and True.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus is called “the precious corner stone” because He is the dearest treasure of Jehovah’s heart. He is the fairest of ten thousand and altogether lovely. “Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most Mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. . . . Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”—Psalm 45:3, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus is the “sure foundation”, the one that can never be removed; always upholding the dignity and honor and good name of Jehovah God. This foundation stone is the foundation and chief corner of the empire that shall carry into operation God’s great plan for the deliverance of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">As</span><span class="font7"> to the time of the laying of this foundation, we have the proof frpm the Scriptures that it was at the time of the consecration of Jesus at the Jordan. About that time John said of and concerning Hirns &quot;Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” (John 1:29) About this time Jesus came to the Jordan to be baptized by John; and it' was there that the prophecy written of and eoneering </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7"> was fulfilled, to wit: “Then said I, Lo, I eome: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, 0 my God: yea, thy law. is within my heart.”—Psalm 40: 7, S; Heb. 10: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus is also pictured as a lamb .-lain. From that time He was counted as slain and as the great sin-offering on behalf of man. It is written concerning Him: “The Lamb slain from th© foundation of the world.” (Revelation 13:8) Thus is fixed the time of the laying of this precious foundation; namely, at the time Jesus was baptized in the Jordan and begotten of the holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Associate Rulers</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">EFORE Jesus’ first advent God had mads</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">His plan. That plan provides that there shall be a building upon this precious foundation stone, composed of other stones that shall form a part of the mighty empire. It necessarily follows that the class of persons to be them made a part of the empire, also the manner of their selection, testing and completion, was pre* arranged according to the good pleasure of God. Hence it is written: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will * (Ephesians 1: 3-5) These words of the apostle apply to those, and to those only, who shall constitute </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> part of God’s great empire which in due time shall govern and rule all the nation® of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is of keen interest to note that those who are to be associated with Christ in His empire are not selected from amongst the angels of heaven. It is God who selects them through «to« sus Christ, acting as the representative of Most High God. He lays holds upon or ta' s them from the human race, that is to say, l‘e selects men possessing the faith of Abraham: it is written: “Besides, he does not in any way take hold of angels, but he takes hold of the seed of Abraham.”—Hebrews 2:16, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That which distinguishes Abraham above any who proceeded him is his faith in God. Trusting implicitly in Jehovah, Abraham deported himself accordingly. Such faith as exhibited by him furnishes the criterion for the selection of the members of the royal line. This is in harmony with the lesson which Jesus impressed upon His disciples as of paramount importance, namely, ‘Have faith in God.&quot; (Mark 11:22) It is clearly manifest from the Scriptures that God grants His great favor to those who implicitly rely upon His Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Much that Jesus taught His disciples they could not comprehend at the time. Much He did not teach them until after His resurrection and ascension on high. Without doubt He guided the minds of the disciples then. On the last night He was with them in the flesh He said: “I have ryet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.&quot; (Jolin 16:12) Why could not they understand at that time? The answer is, Because the holy spirit had not been given. It was essential that Jesus die, be raised from the Head and then appear in heaven, in the presence ©f Jehovah God and present the merit of His sacrifice unto Jehovah, before the holy spirit could be given. The giving of the holy spirit to (the disciples was an evidence that His sacrifice had been accepted as the great sin-offering on behalf of those for whom it was presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus had said to His disciples: “Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the comforter mil not come unto you; but if I depart, I will Bend him wto you.&quot; (John 16:7) The comforter here mentioned is the holy spirit. (John 14:26) The promise here is that when the holy spirit should be given, then the disciples would understand all that Jesus had taught them and what He should yet teach them. “Howbeit when he, the spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you Into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he Bpeak: and he will shew you things to come.”— •John 16:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The holy spirit is the invisible power of God, operating upon mind.or matter as God may will, jprior to the coming of Jesus the holy spirit, by 'God’s will, operated upon the minds of only such men as God chose for servants and as prophets. These holy men as prophets spoke as God, by His spirit, moved their minds to speak or writ®. ^-2 Peter 1:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Joel was one of the prophet's. He prophesied that the time would come when. God would pour out His spirit upon all those who would call upon His name. (Joel 2:28, 29) This prophecy of Joel had its fulfilment at Pentecost. Pentecost was the fiftieth day after the resurrection of Jesus. At the time of the ascension of Jesus into heaven He had assembled His disciples on the side of the mount of Olives. He there commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem until they had received the holy spirit, and promised them that then they should receive power and that they should become His witnesses unto the uttermost parts of the earth. —Acts 1:4-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In obedience to this command the disciples remained at Jerusalem. “And when the day o| Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them: and they were all filled with the holy spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the spirit gave them utterance.&quot; (Acts 2:14) Thus was made manifest the fulfilment of the prophecy of Joel above mentioned, as specifically stated by the apostle.—Acts 2:16-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A city is a symbol of a government or empire. It is written concerning the empire or kingdom: “And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.” (Revelation 21:14) The Lord Jesus Christ is the chief comer stone in that kingdom, and the apostles of the Lamb are the twelve foundations.—1 Peter 2: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prior to His crucifixion the Lord Jesus had promised that He would confirm in heaven what these faithful apostles did on earth. (Matthew 18:18) It was at Pentecost, and after receiving the holy spirit, that Peter testified concerning 'Jesus Christ, as follows: “This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”—Acts 4:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Jews had thought to build an empire; and they looked forward to that empire which, under the Messiah, would rule all nations of the earth. The clergy of that time especially thought that they were the builders; but when the chief corner stone was laid they rejected Him, even as the prophet had foretold they would do. (Isaiah 53: 3; John 1:11,12) The fact that the Jews rejected the chief corner stone in no way hindered or delayed the progress of the building. Now the chief corner stone and foundation of the new and glorious empire was laid, its building began and progressed according to the will of God. The holy prophet had testified that on this chief corner stone should rest the new government which should bring deliverance to the people : “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful. Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.”—Isaiah 9:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostles were also prophets because they, under inspiration from God, foretold things to come to pass in the distant future. A true prophet is one who gives testimony by divine authority. That Jesus Christ and His apostles constitute respectively the chief corner stone and foundation of the great empire, and that others are added thereto, the Apostle Paul, who also was a prophet, under inspiration testified: “Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizcns with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit.”—Ephesians 2:19-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">How Chosen</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE members of the empire are not chosen by men nor by man-made organizations. It is God who has chosen them through His beloved Son Christ Jesus. (Ephesians 1:4; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 2:4; James 2: 5; 1 Peter 2:4) Those who are chosen to be of th® royal line are called or invited by the Lord God, through His beloved Son Christ Jesus. (1 Corinthians 1:2; 7:15; Ephesians 4:4; Co-tesians 3:15; 1 Thessalonians 2:12) Cannot priest or clergyman of some church denomination call a sinner to become a part of the king, dmn of God and then choose him for tha^ purpose f Neither a priest nor any other clergyman possesses any such power or authority. The Scriptures alone must be the guide as to how these are called and chosen. The only way for sinners to come to God is through Jesus Christ, as He stated: “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” (John 14:6) The order pointed out by the Scriptures, of coming to God through Jesus Christ, is as follows 1 Knowledge, faith, consecration and justification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Faith means to know the Word of God and then to rely upon it. Therefore knowledge must precede faith. “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” (Romans 10:17) From the Word of God man learns that he was born a sinner, that there is no other name given under heaven whereby he can come again into harmony with God, except through Jesus Christ. He learns that Jesus died upon the cross, and that whosoever believes upon Him might not perish but have an opportunity for life everlasting. (John 3:16,17) Coming to a knowledge of this fact man is thereby drawn to Jesus, learns that Jesus is his Redeemer and that to please God he must follow the direction that the Lord Jesus points out. The one thus seeking the Lord God must now exercise faith; and the first thing of importance is to believe that Jehovah exists, and that he rewards those who diligently seek Him. (Hebrews 11:6) To such Jesus says: “If any man will come aftei me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.”—Matthew 16: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Self-denial means a willingness to completely, surrender oneself unto God, agreeing to do ths •will of God, while trustingin the merit of Christ Jesus’ sacrifice. This is consecration. This is what Jesus did when ITe appeared at the Jor* dan, as it is written of Him: ‘T come to do thy will, O my God.” This is an agreement that thereafter the will of the man will be exercised in harmony with the will of God, and that he wll use his mind and ascertain God’s will and then do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now the Lord Jesus presents the man who consecrates to Jehovah. It is Jehovah God who judicially determines whether or not the on® thus presented is right. Justification means made right with God, and it therefore includes the judicial determination by Jehovah that the one thus consecrating is right. The Scriptures therefore show three separate and distinct things involved in justification: (1) Faith; (2) the blood of Jesus; (3) the judicial determination by Jehovah; as it is written: “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1) j “Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath, through him” (Romans 5:9); “It is God that justifieth.” —Bomans 8:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Justification, between the time of Pentecost and the completion of the empire, is by faith and for the purpose of enabling the one thus justified to sacrifice all of his earthly hopes and prospects, particularly his right to live on earth, to the end that he might participate in the chief resurrection and reign with Christ as a member of that empire. (2 Timothy 2:11; Revelation 20:6) The justification by Jehovah therefore constitutes a call or invitation to membership in the kingdom or empire. Thereupon God begets such an one by His spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To beget means to begin; and the begetting or beginning is to a hope of life and to an inheritance incorruptible. This begetting of the spirit is a covenant that God makes with the one consecrating. God gives to such an one His Word of Truth; and then He causes His invisible power to so operate upon the one to whom He gives this Word as to begin to carry on the transformation of the one thus begotten into the liteness of the Head, Christ Jesus, the chief corner stone laid in Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is written: “Of his own vvill begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of fi.rstiruitg of his creatures.” (Janies 1:18) The cues thus begotten are addressed by the Apostle Peter in these words: ‘‘Elect according to the foreknow ledge of God the Bather, through sanctification of the spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ; Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesi's Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith, unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.”—1 Peter 1:2-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These are begotten to the divine nature. God has promised such the divine nature if they are faithful to their part of the covenant. God i® always faithful to His. “According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and -virtue: whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.”—-2 Peter 1: 3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Living Stones</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE one begotten of the holy spirit is now a new creature in Christ. (2 Corinthians 5:17) His hope of life is on the spirit plane with Christ Jesus. He is counted dead as a human being, because his right to live as a human being expired with the acceptance of his sacrifice. To him the apostle says: “Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.”—Colossians 3: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The one now addressed must be builded up as a living stone in the temple of God, if he would be of the royal line and participate in the great empire. Because he is just beginning he is spoken of as a babe newly born; and addressing such the Apostle Peter says: “As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disavowed indeed of men, but chosen of God. and precious, ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that bclieveth on him shall not be confounded. Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient; where-unto also they were appointed.”—1 Peter 2: 2-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Peter wrote this the leaders of the Jewish people in particular had rejected Jesus, the chief corner stone. The apostle adds: “He that believeth on him shall not be confounded.” To believe means to remain steadfast and faithful; we must show our faith by what we do. ‘Tinto you therefore which believe he is precious.” It is a precious thing to observe the Chief Corner Stone and to be conformed according to His way. Such are called to follow in His steps. (1 Peter 2:21) The one who is thus designated a living stone to be builded up into the building of God is anointed. To anoint means to designate to some position in the empire. “Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God.” (2 Corinthians 1: 21) These are anointed to represent Jehovah and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God having made this promise; and as His promises are never broken, He counts his anointed ones as now a part of the new kingdom or empire or nation. Hence the apostle says concerning them: “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.” (1 Peter 2:9) In order to show forth the praises of Jehovah God they must not only believe Jehovah is God but must joyfully obey His will, represent His cause, and use the faculties with which they are endowed to testify to His great name and His goodness and His purposes. To do this one could not conform himself to the evil world but must stand aloof from it and serve the Lord God. The Word of God is his guide. The Word informs him that he must not conform himself to the world, because Satan the enemy is the god of this world. Concerning such the apostle writes: “Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.”—Romans 12:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The transformation process now is carried on by the Christian, building up his mind by studying the Word of God; from it ascertaining the will of God and by it proving what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. It can be easily seen that the Lord would not make any ©ne a member of that empire unless he is in full and complete harmony with the Lord Jesus, the chief corner stone, as it is written: “For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.” </span><span class="font8">^Bomans 8:29), This means that each one who </span><span class="font7">will ultimately be a member of that empire must grow in the likeness of the Lord Jesus, being transformed day by day by virtue of the spirit of the Lord working in him to will and to do God’s good pleasure.—2 Corinthians 3:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This world means the people of this earth organized into forms of government under the supervision of their overlord, Satan the enemy. (2 Corinthians 4: 3,4) The Devil is the prince or ruler of this world. (John 14: 30) He is the enemy of the Lord Jesus Christ, the enemy of God, and the enemy of everyone who attempts to do God’s will. The one who will ultimately be of the empire of righteousness must not love the world, as it is stated by the apostle: “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love o£ the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.”-—1 John 2:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Early in the experience of the church it was manifest that those whom God will approve must be transformed into the likeness of Jesus Christ. Christ Jesus is Head over the house of sons, and aH the other members of the household must honor Jehovah as Jesus honors Jehovah. They do and must love God with a supreme 'devotion, and delight to show forth His praises and to testify that He is God. Their very course in the way of righteousness would draw against them the opposition of Satan the enemy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">FTER Jesus was put to death Satan the enemy thought that he had succeeded in destroying the heir of promise, who was promised </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">kingdom. Satan therefore reasoned that he would continue to rule the world without any successful interruption. He must have been disappointed when Jesus arose from the dead. He must have observed what transpired at Pentecost, and there noted the beginning of the building of the other living stones in conformity with the chief corner stone, Christ Jesus. It is reasonable to presume that he was familiar with the instructions given by the inspired apostles to those of the church. He would understand </span><span class="font8">that these who were united in Christ were to form part of the seed of promise, even as Paul </span><span class="font7">had testified. (Galatians 3:16,27-29) Destruction of this seed would bring reproach upon God, and now this became the objective and purpose of Satan the enemy. He saw that the Lord 'Jesus Christ, exalted to the divine nature, was now beyond the influence of his (Satan's) power. He realized that he must now do something to counteract the influence and power of those who were being brought into Christ, if he would thwart the divine plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Anticliri&amp;t moans that which is offered as a </span><span class="font8">substitute for Christ the Messiah, therefore in </span><span class="font7">opposition to the Messiah. Satan the enemy set about to organize “the mystery of iniquity”, or of lawlessness, an arrangement which would be contrary to and in opposition to Christ. Evidently he knew that John had said to the church: “It is the last time.” (1 John 2:18) The Devil would therefore reason that if he could corrupt the seed of promise and turn their minds and the minds of the people from God, he would defeat God’s purposes. He evidently saw that the development of the seed of promise would cover a long period of time; therefore he went about the preparation of the antichrist deliberately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was in the days of Enos (Genesis 4:26, margin) that Satan had adopted the hypocritical scheme of having the people call themselves by the name of the Lord while at the same time misrepresenting the Lord. He thereby mocked God and brought reproach upon His name. Early in the Christian era Satan the enemy adopted a similar scheme of hypocrisy, but on a far greater scale. He knew that man is so constituted that he must worship something; and if Satan could not get the people who call themselves Christian to directly worship him, then he would inaugurate a scheme by which he would turn away their minds from Jehovah God, and yet let them call themselves Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan saw that it would be profitable to his scheme to have the Christians become more popular; therefore the Christian religion became ostensibly the religion of his wicked world. The Devil thereafter planted amongst the Christians ambitious mon, those who had a desire to shine amongst men and who in the course of time had themselves appointed or elected to the positions of bishops and chief elders; and in due course there was established a clergy class, as ’distinguished from the laity or the common people. The clergy thus organized introduced into the church false doctrines taught by heathen philosophers, which of course were the Devil’s own doctrines. These were used to corrupt the message of the Lord God. The clergy and the rulers in the church then established theological schools wherein men were trained for the clergy, for the purpose of carrying on the work of their system now organized and in operation. In due course statements of belief or creeds were formulated and presented to the professed Christians, and any one who taught contrary to these creeds was considered a heretic and was dealt with accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">False doctrines were freely introduced end substituted for the truth. Amongst these were and are the doctrines of the trinity, immortality of all souls, eternal torture of the -wicked, the divine right of the clergy and the divine right of kings to rule. In the course of time Mary, the mother of the child Jesus, was deified; and the people called upon to worship her as the mother of God. Satan’s purpose in all this, of course, was to turn the minds of the people away from Jehovah. Crucifixes were erected, and the worship of the people was turned to these rather than to let them intelligently worship the Lord Jehovah and the Lord Jesus Christ. Beads, </span><span class="font8">so-</span><span class="font7">called holy water, and like things were used, and are still used, to blind the people. Gradually, subtly, seductively and wickedly the Devil, through willing instruments, corrupted those ■who called themselves Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Borne was then the great world power ofi ■which Satan was the god. (2 Corinthians 4: 3,4) It was in the Fourth Century that this great world power adopted Christianity as the religion of the state or government. Thereby the Devil succeeded in having the people call themselves by the name of God and of His Christ and at the same time constantly bring reproach upon the name of the Lord, and in fact represent the Devil. To show how stealthily and fraudulently the Devil overreached the people and turned their minds from the true God the following is quoted from the history “Old Roman World”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">'Tn the Second Century there are no greater names than Polycarp, Ignatius, Justin Martyr, Clement, Meli to and Apollonius, quiet bishops or intrepid martyrs, who addressed their flocks in upper chambers, and who held no worldly rank, famous only for their sanctity or simplicity of character, and only mentioned for their sufferings and faith. We read of martyrs, some of whom wrote valuable treatises and apologies; but among them we find no people of rank. It was a disgrace to be a Christian in the eye of fashion or power. The early Christian literature is chiefly apologetic, and the doctrinal character is simple and practical. There are controversies in the Church, and intense religious life, great activities, great virtues, but no outward conflicts, no secular history. They had not as yet assailed the government or the great social institutions of the empire. It was a small body of pure and blameless men, who did not aspire to control society. But they had attracted the notice of the government and were of sufficient consequence to be persecuted. They were looked upon as fanatics who sought to destroy a reverence for existing institutions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was but a short time until the enemy overreached Christianity by mixing it with politics. From that time forward polities and so-called Christianity have walked hand in hand, and with the advancing centuries ecclesiastics have become more brazen in their participation in the polities of the world. There is but one Christ and one Christian doctrine. Notwithstanding this there have sprung up numerous denominational systems taking the name of Christ. The evident purpose of Satan in engineering this was to confuse the people and turn them away from the true God and the preparation of His kingdom for the blessing of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The true followers of Christ Jesus have never been popular. They are now very unpopular, especially amongst the denominational systems called Christian. He who faithfully represents the Lord must keep himself aloof from alliances with any part of the Devil’s organization; and this of course makes him unpopular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are many sincere people in the earth who desire to know the truth concerning God’s great empire for the blessing of mankind. The time has c<sup>n</sup>me for them to know it. In order to know and understand it is likewise necessary to have a clear understanding of Satan’s organization and how he has used it to becloud the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In my next lecture I shall consider further this point of Satan’s opposition and how the Lord brings to a completion this great empire which He foreordained centuries ago and which is now being established. This matter is of greatest interest, convenience and public necessity and of greatest importance, because it has to do with the general welfare of all the peoples of earth. We may be sure that the great God of the universe will afford ample opportunity for the people to receive such things. It becomes a great privilege for anyone then who knows of God’s kingdom and its preparation to make known these truths to his fellows, and that without money and without charge. For this reason this radio station from time to time broadcasts information concerning earth’s greatest empiie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What a True Scientist Expects</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">D</span><span class="font7">R. Michael I. Pupin, Professor of Electro</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mechanics in Columbia University, and a believer in Almighty God, says interestingly: &quot;The scientific man does not believe that all physical realities have been revealed. Just as science was not aware of the physical reality of electricity in motion not longer ago than 200 years, so in 200 years more we may discover another physical reality just as far reaching as the physical reality of electricity in motion. Nobody can tell today how many physical realities await us in the course of the coming centuries. The scientist believes that the few physical realities which have been revealed during the last 400 years are only a few grains of sand on the endless shore of the still unexplored universe. An endless number of granules of sand are still waiting for us to pick them up. The scientist is also aware that there is a spiritual world filled with spiritual realities and that their ultimate origin is probably different from the origin of physical realities.” This statement is in absolute accord with what Bible Students hold to be the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The Price of Rebellion, Stubbornness and Disobedience</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[A Juvenile Bibi® story rafitoeast from Static® WORD, Chicago, by O. D. Nicholson.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7">T WAS understood by aH that Jehovah, was the real Ruler and King over Israel, and that the people of Israel were His subjects. All recognized that the various leaders, judges, etc^ v<sup>r</sup>ere appointed by the Lord, and that two special qualifications were required of each leader or judge. One was the ability to perform the necessary services, and the other was loyalty and faithfulness to the Lord in obeying His commands and carrying out His instructions with reference to the people. Leaders and judges of this kind served the people of Israel for nearly four hundred years after they had left Egypt. The last of these judges vras Samuel, of whom we learned considerable in our last lesson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Samuel was a good man, but he was not without faults. The only criticism we could justly make of him is in reference to his sons, who grew up to manhood under their father’s care and teaching but who failed to manifest an upright 'disposition or character like his. Samuel must have known this; but regardless of their lack of proper qualifications, he gave two of his sons positions as judges over a certain section of Israel. The sons soon became corrupt politicians, greedy for money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now this abominable practice was very discouraging for the Israelites who were trying to do that which was right; and naturally it led to discontentment and dissatisfaction, and finally to a just endeavor on their part to find a remedy for the unhappy condition created by Samuel’s two dishonest sons. The elders of Israel gathered together and drew up a solemn request that Samuel appoint some one to be king over Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Samuel was disturbed, because he knew that many difficulties would be brought upon the peo</span><span class="font8">ple </span><span class="font7">by an earthly ruler; and his conclusions showed wisdom and foresight. The people heard all that Samuel had to say, but refused to obey Ins voice of warning and said, “Nay, but we will have a king over us; that we also may be like all the nations [round about us].” So the Lord agreed to send a man for Samuel to anoint as king; and the method which He chose for bringing Saul, who was to become Israel’s first king, to Samuel was a most peculiar one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Saul was both bashful and backward, and naturally felt his lack of fitness for such, a prominent position; and all this, together with the suddenness of the whole situation, made him very reluctant to accept the proffered honor of being the Israelites’ first king. In view of Saul’s later life and activities, many people have wondered why he was chosen to fill the position of Israel’s first king; hut it is doubtful if any person better qualified for the place could have been found anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some years after Saul had been inaugurated in office, it became necessary for the Israelites to go to war against their enemies. It </span><span class="font8">was </span><span class="font7">the custom of the Israelites to make a burnt offering to the Lord before entering into </span><span class="font8">battle. Of </span><span class="font7">course these offerings were made by the priest, or special representative of the Lord, who at this time was Samuel. Samuel was aw<sup>T</sup>ay on a journey. Saul waited about seven days for Samuel to return; then, becoming impatient, he took the liberty of offering the sacrifice to the Lord. Before the fire under the sacrifice had cooled, Samuel appeared on the scene and severely rebuked King Saul for taking upon himself the right to be the sacrificing or religious ruler of the people as well as their civil ruler. Then it was that Saul’s troubles began. Very soon war broke out; it was war, war, war, day after day, and year after year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Finally through the Prophet Samuel the Lord sent a message to Saul that he should go down against the Amalekites and slay them all, both the human beings and all their animals. The battle was fought and the victory won; but instead of killing-all the animals, Saul saved some of the best ones alive and killed only the lame and weak ones. Instead of all the Amalekites being slain, the king of Amalek was saved alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the battle was over, Samuel appeared on the scene; and Saul came to him, telling of the wonderful victory which they had gamed. But Samuel knew something was wrong and replied, “What means this bleating of the sheep and the lowing of the cattle which I hear?” Of course Saul thought he had a good excuse, and said that they w<sup>T</sup>ere to be sacrificed to the Lord. To this Samuel replied, “Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat ofl rams. . . . Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king.” Then Samuel returned to his home in</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ramah, and never visited Saul again. Saul continued to serve as king for a good many years; but the Lord was no longer with him. Finally, in the face of utter defeat at the hands of the Philistines, he died by falling on his own sword, committing suicide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bible Questions and Answers</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font7"> Are the books of the Maccabees a part of the inspired writings of the Bible, and if not why not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7"> The books of the Maccabees are not </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">part of the inspired writings of the Bible. There are several reasons why they are not. One reason is that they are not a part of the original 'Jewish Bible, now known to us as the Old Testament. Another reason is that they do not form any part of the quoted passages of the New Testament. All of the books of the Old Testament which were inspired are quoted from in the New Testament by Christ and the apostles. Christ and the apostles were inspired by the spirit of Jehovah, and their quotations from the Old Testament books are proof of the original inspiration of the Old Testament books composing the King James Version. The Maccabees are quoted in no place of the New Testament, and as </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">result they do not form a part of the quoted and inspired books of the Old Testament. Another reason is that the books of the Maccabees deal with historical matters which could have been written by any historian acquainted with the activities of the nations of his day; they do not bear evidence of inspiration. History is not necessarily a part of the inspired Word of God unless it is so authorized by God. One might just as well call the history of the Jewish people written by Josephus a part of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Question</span><span class="font7">: Is there a time coming when sorrow will vanish from the earth ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Amswer:</span><span class="font7"> Yes. The Lord has so stated in His Word. In the time of the resurrection of the dead, thousands of hearts will be made glad which have heretofore been broken. It will be the kingdom time when those ransomed by the Lord Jesus will come forth from the tombs. In Isaiah 35:10 we read, “And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.&quot; As mankind will gradually learn obedience under the kingdom the cause of suffering and death will gradually vanish from the human race. In Revelation 21:4, 5 we read, “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words &quot;are true and faithful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font7"> When the dead are awakened will they come from heaven, eternal torment, or the graves ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7"> The Bible holds that the dead will come forth from the graves in the earth. Jesus said as is recorded in John 5:28,29, “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice [the voice of Jesus] and shall come forth.” Speaking of the resurrection time the Prophet Daniel says in Daniel 12:2, “And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font7"> Why is it that you Bible Students are explaining the prophecies and make the Bible harmonious by what apparently is new truth; but the ministers are still holding to creeds formulated centuries ago?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7"> The Lord indicated that in the end of the age in which we are now living there would be prophecies understood by His people for the first time. Not even the prophets themselves understood what they were writing about; and the Lord told them definitely that the understanding would be sealed up until the end of the age. Even the Prophet Daniel recorded these words found in Daniel 12:8-10, “And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, 0 my Lord, what shall be the end of these things? And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. . . . None of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">’’Pattern et Circenses^</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">P</span><span class="font4">ANEM ET CIRCENSES, “Brpad and the Circus,” was tne cry of the Roman populace of old. They wanted but two things, food for their stomachs and palliatives for their minds. They did not want real food for their minds. They did not want truth, they wanted excitement—to see men and animals engaged in killing’ one another. And it has 'been ever thus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today the world is sports mad. The apostle prophesied that in the last days men would be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, and if it is not true now it never will be true. Because certain sports occupy so large a place _in the public jnind, we give some sjiace in this is</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">. sue</span><span class="font4"> to items about them,. Judging from the space which they occupy in the public press, sports and crime are the two subjects which principally engage the attention of the people today- * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>a o</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As far as the people are concerned, their interest in sport is mostly mental. They do not personally participate in the games. They merely see them or read about them. They get little more exercise out of a football game than they ; 'do from a game of Mah Jongg, a cross-word jraole, or the eight pages of so-called comics for which most people buy the Sunday paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ So well did the Greeks understand the demand of the people for excitement that they vir-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘ tually ruled the country for seventeen hundred ’ years by means of the quadrennial Olympic games, the principal band which held the conn</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">; ■ try together. These games, after 1500 years of <sup>:</sup> discontinuance, were revived and made inteww ; tional In character in 1896. The last one was , held in Paris in 1924. The next one will be held ; in Amsterdam in 1928.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">, The modem Olympic games make &amp;&nbsp;strong 5 play upon the imagination. Forty-five nations J sent contestants to the last one. The United ’ States had 320 performers, France had 180 and ‘ Great Britain IM Altogether 2,000 athletes ’ &gt;ere arrayed in competition. It was alleged that the revival of these games would promote international peace; but jealousies, quarrels and general ill-feeling seem to have been promoted instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some idea of the hold that the American pastime of prize fighting has en the minds of many' was revealed by the Dempsey-Tunney fight in Philadelphia, when about 200,000 people paid approximately $2,500,000 to sit in a pouring rain and watch one plug-ugly beat up another. It is said that about 700 newspaper men circled the ring, every quarter of the globe being represented. On this point the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Americs* </span><span class="font4">said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The late Ur. Barnum w entirely too moderate in liis calculations that one fa bom every minute. The birthrate fa at least one a second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Athletic* and Gymnastic*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font4">HE ancient Greek gymnast was a trainer of professional athletes and was also one himself, Ancient Greek cities had large public buildings and grounds set apart for the training of youth in athletic exercises. During the middle ages young men were given a thorough training in running, leaping and throwing of weights, so that they might learn to wear the heavy armor of the period and do something worth while after they got into it</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gymnastics and athletics develop courage, prompt decision, self-control, judgment, self-reliance and fortitude. No person can be &amp;&nbsp;great athlete and devoted to any form of immorality; nevertheless, as any good thing can be overdone and made an injury, so with athletics. Moderate recreation in the open air is the best fdftn of exercise. ’ \</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Marathon Race, and other forms of exercise which make a great strain upon the heart, should be abandoned. Properly mankind remembers the original Marathon runner, who ran the twenty-six miles from Marathon to</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Athens, and saved the city by telling the route by which the Persians were coming. But it should not be forgotten that when he had told his story he fell dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Great athletes go to pieces at an early age. They concentrate upon their hearts and lungs in a brief period of time the strains which should be extended over many years. Generally, when they should he in their prime, they are fat, flaVby and feeble. Especially are the young injured by the overstraining of their immature hearts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Probably the strongest of modern men'was Sandow. As a child he was a weakling, but by the study of anatomy and the scientific development of his museles-he demonstrated repeatedly his ability to support thirty-two people on his back. Burglars who Woke into his house in London recognized him asleep and fled in fright, leaving al behind them. Sandow burst a blood vessel in his brain as a result of lifting an auto-mqpla single-handed from a ditch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;There are four secrete to lifting heavy weights without injury: (1) Keeping the weight cluse to the body; (2) making use of the leg musetes to do the lifting; (3) dividing and balancing the weight; (W) trying to get the weight above or on top of one^s own. The strongest musd.es in the body are the heavy thigh muscles and the shoulder muscles, not those of the beck; and this fact should be ridered always in lifting. It is better to bend _ the knees than to break the back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&lt; Measurements of an all-around athlete are: Height, 5 feet 10 indies; weight, 155 pounds; chest, 39 inches; waist, 29 inches; hips, 37 inches; thighs, 22 inches; calves, 14*4 inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A surgeon points out that the great majority of surgical operations reveal ptosis (drooping of the muscles) of the contents of the abdominal cavity, and that many operations could be avoided if all persons would periodically scrub ' floors, walk on all fours, or turn a dozen somer-&gt; saults a month. In lieu of all these a good shak-’ tag on® a month is helpftfl.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">in the fields. The chasing of a golf ball around is merely an item that leads to the pleasure of the pastime. Golf has been played in Scotland 'for four hundred years, and in America since September, 1796.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Walking is the one form of exercise that best meets the requirements of the body. It is mild, can be easily regulated, and requires no external apparatus. It strengthens the muscles, expands the chest, arouses the appetite, improves the digestion, reduces superflous weight and accelerates the elimination of waste products. A smart walk in winter air is a tonic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Walking employs the largest muscles in the body. Place your hand upon the muscles in the small of your back, then take a few steps, and you will see how walking works the important muscles of the back. Curiously enough, walking is said to be the best cure for fallen arches, Mail carriers, who must walk in the open air constantly, seldom have any trouble with fallen arches, .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Walking in a crowded city street and dodging automobiles is good sport In congested dis* tricts the walker can make almost as good time as a car. Statistics show that walkers average 8.7 miles an hour, surf a® ears 4.1 miles an hour, motor buses 4,5 miles an hourund private auto* mobiles 5.7 miles an hour, in crowded district*</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1922 au English lad ten years of age,. Master G« O. Edwards, distinguished himself by walking fromLontkm id Brighton, a dhton® of fifty miles; and to December, 1905 a society woman athlete won a wager by walking 44 miles from Providence to her home in Boston in exactly 11 hours and 5 minutes. She stood the trip better than the two men who accompanied her as escort</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">O ONE has ever claimed that there is anything refined about football; but it is considered good training for a young man, if he survives it. He learns to sink his desires for personal glory out of sight in the interests of his team, to obey orders promptly and implicitly, and to take without whining the blows and braises which he is apt to get He learns team work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The crowds that gather to witness foofbal games grow ever and ever larger. In the United States they often run to thirty, sixty, eighty and even to one hundred and ten thousand. In London three years ago a thousand persons were injured in the effort to crowd into the Wembley</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Stadium at the close of the football season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It used to be said that colleges looked with indulgence upon football games because they advertised the colleges. But now the colleges are running over with students, and yet the football program is more extensive and expensive than ever. In many colleges there are hired football players; and a trained and efficient cheer leader is more appreciated by the students than a suitable president of the institution itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">President J. B. Angell, of Yale University, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many parents who sead boys to college would rather that a son of theirs he captain of the fcolball team than that he he the highest stand man in his class. Kot only is the fame of the former far more widely heralded, but there is. also an impression, quite unfounded on any facts known to me, that a football player, regardless of his seMarlj qualities, is more apt to prove a valuable citizen, achieving in after life leadership of a high sad important social character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Oddly enough, elephants play football in the jungles of Africa, forming the ball out of the earth taken from an anthill. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">ASEBALL is said to be of Indian origin, but took its present form in New York about eighty years ago. At present there are 75,000 post offices in the United States; but there are perhaps double that number of ball clubs. Baseball, as played in the big leagues, is purely a business proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In all the large cities there are steel and concrete structures which cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. It is expensive to maintain these buildings and to care for the grounds about them. The players themselves are the biggest item. The Detroit Club pays Ty Cobb $60,000 a year; the New York Club pays Babe Buth $50,000 a year, Many other players enjoy salaries as high as $20,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sale of baseball players as commodities eventually led some of the players to yield to the same kind of temptation and selling themselves. Certain Chicago players were accused of selling out in the championship baseball series of 1919. Thereupon Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis was elected supreme dictator of baseball for seven years, at a total salary of $297,000, to reestablish public confidence; and the judge also retains Ms place and salary as a</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Federal Judge in the meantime. This shows the great importance that big business attaches to keeping the mind of the common man active on-non-essentials. When thinking of baseball his mind is off from public utilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>;</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Notwithstanding the periodic baseball “scan*] dais,” enthusiasm in the main has been marvelously sustained. Every season some city goes wild over its baseball heroes. In Pittsburgh, in 1925 the 600 prisoners in the county jail became so enthusiastic when Pittsburgh won that they disobeyed a rule against demonstrations and lost their radio privileges for a time. In Washington, D. C., a year earlier, dignified statesmen wept for joy, police assisted motorists to break traffic rules, autos stood in safety zones and pedestrians in the street, women assumed male garb and men assumed female garb, and all together acted insane. St. Louis had its time of delirium in 1926. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The baseball fever has spread to Bradl, where it is now all the rage; and to Yucatan, where the government has introduced it in th® hope of bettering the minds and bodies of the Indians transported there from Northwestern Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The father of professional baseball was Harry Wright, a great British cricket player, who came to America to teach cricket but succumbed to the lure of the then comparatively new American game.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* Great progress has been made in recent years in the perfection of baseball equipment. It is said that it often takes a critical examination of an entire earload of ash wood to find the right kind of piece for one first-class baseball bat.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">O</span><span class="font4">NLY eight persons haw ever succeeded in swimming that terbulent body of water, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">English Channel; although 3,000 have made the attempt. The distance is only twenty miles, but currents change so often that only a rare combination of good weather, skOl. strength, determination and endurance males it possible. The first to succeed was Captain Matthew Webb, in 1875, who swam across in 21 hours and 45 minutes. William Burgess succeeded only on his twenty-third attempt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1926 Gertrude Ederle of New York City swam across, under adverse conditions, in 14 hours and 31 nmutes—the first woman rar</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">perform the fash. X few days later another American woman, Mrs. Clendngton Corson, the mother of two children, accomplished the same feat in 15 hours rnd 28 minutes. Both of these women crossed in less time than did any of the five men who had preceded them; but a few days later Ernst Vierkoetter crossed in the record time of J 2 hours and 45 minutes. He stTuM at night and had an unusually calm sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">G i Miss Ecierie’s return to New Fork she re-ceiwd the gi’edieist ovation md-esded to any person that ever entered the city. Mrs. Corson on her return also received an ovation, at which time she summed up her view of her own experience with the teinark, <sup>K</sup>J had to make Su re i wney fen my kids; mt I would not do it ag &lt;&nbsp;o An a million dollars.'” fine ’water in the Chax xiel is bitterly cold the irritates the eyes, and even in good weather a swimmer is liable to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">get</span><span class="font4"> nausea after a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three years ago a Cleveland man swam across Lake Erie, making the thirty-three milra from Point Pelce to Lorain In 20 hours and 15 minutes. His legs were partially and temporarily paralyzed by the feat. In September, 1926, a boy of seventeen and h<sup>;</sup>s sister of sixteen, off Ocean City, saved their father and six other men by swimming a three-mile race to summon aid for an overturned fishing boat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Berlin has projected or completed an arfficial swimming pool 125 by 330 feet, with an artificial beach 48 feet in width, wanned by hot air conduits beneath the sand. Palms, poll al plants and fountains aid the illusion of nature. The whole is covered with glass, and v<sup>r</sup>annod. On bright days the natural sun floods the place with light.

<p><span class="font4">/XNCE popular is Greece and Rome, the bull-fight is alleged to have been introduced into Spain by the Moors; but the Moors themselves deny this, and point to their fondness for their animals as proof that they could never have been responsible for such an inhuman sport.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many Spaniards disapprove of the bullfight; but the arenas whkh seat 13,000 people and upwards are never unfilled, in Madrid, Barcelona or Seville. The Muira balls of Seville, famous for their ferocity, are most in demand.

<p><span class="font4">The torturing and killing of each bull takes about fifteen minutes. From eight to fifteen bulls constitute an afieraooris “onteitafmnenffi Occasionally a bull squares the account with his tormentors, so that the average length of a bullfighter’s career does not exceed five years. The blindfolded horses of the picadores are often gored to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bullfighting is as well established in Meris© as in Spain. In Mexico City there are Img® amphitheatres constructed of iron, which represent as large an investment as .New York’s largest auditorium, and built especially for bullfighting. In Vera Cruz, when scores were dying of starvation every day, the people were always able to find means to keep the bullfights going on Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are occasional bullfights in Italy and in France, representing the desire of certain Spaniards to extend their national sport elsewhere. There have been strenuous attempts to arrange a bullfight in New York, but New York is too highly civilized and too much interested in human prize fighting to permit it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sports that are Passing</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270223_files/g_E_19270223-5.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">

<p><span class="font4">HE canoe is an invention of the North American Indian, and was a vehicle ideally adapted to his wild life. With the passing of the Indian there was great interest in canoeing for a time, along about 1870, in both Europe and America; but the interest has largely died out. Archery also flared up and died out at about the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hunting is dying out, partly due to the killing off of the wild game and partly due to the killing off of the hunters themselves. In the United States in one year there have been as many as 1,300 fatal accidents to hunters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1923 there died in Great Britain an English peer who between 1867 and 1913 had slain 11. tigers, 12 buffaloes, 2 rhiuoceri, 222,976 pheasants, 112,598 partridges. 79,320 grouse, 3,452 wild duck, 34,118 rabbits and 30,280 hares. This man, who took the life of half a million living creatures, did it for fun. He had nothing doe to do. Men like him. have destroyed the immensely interesting wild life of the world. The British &quot;nobility” still practise the barbarism of fox hunting. What they can see interesting in releasing from captivity a frightened fox or hare, and racing after it to see it torn to pieces by hounds, is a problem. The shooting of live pigeons at Monte Carlo has been abandoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is occasionally a recrudescence of cockfighting. In 1922 eighty-one men were arrested near Springfield, Mass., and fined $1,215, for staging a three-ring cocking main in a tobacco barn. In 1926, in the Peak district of Derbyshire, England, cockfighting was being carried on in great secrecy, but with all the old-time cruelties—the natural spurs of the birds being replaced with steel spurs sharpened to a dagger point. Some of the game birds fought for as much as an hour and a half before being destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* Horse-racing has largely, but not altogether, passed away in the United States; indeed, the horse itself has largely passed. In its heyday horse racing was a paradise for gamblers, crooks and the lowest and worst elements of society. It still has some standing in England, but that is only because it is old. Anything that is old in England is reverenced there because of age—not because of any virtues it may have. That is the only reason why England tolerates its mock nobility and mock ecclesiasticisin. And, by the way, these arc two other games that are passing. The noble and the dominie are passing out together, and the world will be well rid of them both.</span></p>

Moreover, new and even more stringent clergy regulations are under way, limiting the number of clergy that may serve in any locality.

<p><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark11"></a>What Will the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River-to-Ocean Project Mean ?</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>By Mel D. Shaw</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font4">HE Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Biver-to Atlantic Ocean project is an international undertaking between the United States and the Dominion of Canada, Though it is for the use of these two countries in particular, the world at large will also benefit by it,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will bring the markets of the world to Lake Erip (Ohio’s front door), and to all the Groat Lakes ports, wherever ocean-going vessels of large dead weight tonnage, drawing thirty feet of water, could land. The Welland Canal connecting Lake Erie and Lake Ontario below Niagara Falls, now under construction and two-thirds completed by the Canadian government, and thirty-three miles of contraction work in the St. Lawrence River, agreed upon by the International Joint Commission Engineers, will, when completed, admit ocean vessels and convert Cleveland, Sandusky, Toledo, Detroit, Chicago, Milwaukee, Duluth and all other Great Lakes ports into world markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This project will also relieve the most congested railroad traffic sections in the United States. Ohio is from 650 to DOO miles from the Atlantic seaports, and as practically all western , traffic must cross Ohio by trank line railways '' to the Atlantic coast, freights are often so congested that it causes many days delay and excessive freight rates. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This shows the necessity of drastic measures to relieve the congestion. The fundamental difficulty ties in the phenomenal growth of population and manufacturing industries throughout the Middle West and western states, a growth which the railroads have failed to keep pace with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The solution of the problem lies in the utilization of every practical means of transportation. Here is this wonderful natural waterway, the St. Lawrence River and Great Lakes, extending from the Atlantic Ocean into the very heart of the continent; and the development of such a system of cooperation between the railways and waterways would bring the load the railroads have to carry within practicable limits and would give the West an additional route for its foreign and coastwise trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">la this connection note the report issued recently by the Port Authority of New York which discloses the high transportation costs now imposed by the transfer of freight in New York harbor: “It costs more to carry a sack of potatoes ten miles in New York,” says the report, “than to ’haul it 1,100 miles from Michigan.” This situation can be relieved by the aforementioned project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The bulk of the world’s shipping business is done by boats ranging from 3000 up to 8000 tons cargo capacity. Even a small boat can swallow up the load carried by six capacity-loaded freight trains, but a large boat is a veritable bottomless pit for freight That is why water rates are lower than rail. Although it is 11,000 miles from Melbourne, Australia, to Liverpool, England, the ruling wheat market of the world, yet the transportation rate on wheat is but forty cents a hundredweight. That means that you can move by water 100 pounds 275 miles for one cent!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The St. Lawrence and Great Lakes route would afford a material saving over any existing routes, between points in the territory economically tributary and points overseas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cincinnati is a sizable city in the Ohio valley. It used to be the center of the wheat industry, and still is a city of many interests and a good point from which to reckon rates. It taps the rich fam lands of Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky; and its rates measure their distance from the sea— from the world’s great markets. Using the New York-Liverpool yardstick (counting distance by freight rates), Cipcmnati is now as much as 7000 miles away s‘rov&lt; u? nemert seaport, Baltimore. This Greet L&amp;S (H^an Route would furnish a far eheapn outlet f.u her and would develop the gi.ckd a^wM-ral, mineral and industrial produriog dirirk: the world that is now marooned by th*-' d'M <sup>:</sup>.frvests of New York and CLktogo.</span></p>

Think of the annual saving in freight on this vast exportation, when the Great Lakes route to Europe is Opened up!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The coal reserves of the world consist of 7,685,000,000,000 tons, of which the United States alone holds better than forty-five percent. By far the larger share of this lies within the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence economic area, and now awaits the opening of the St. Lawrence seaway before it can be developed to the best advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tv only one states in the Mid West, marooned by tlie bigh cost of transportation, consume 2,746.000 tons of sugar annually. Estimating the excess cost of transportation on this product alone at $4 a ton, the St. Lawrence Ship Channel could save to the Mid West over $10,000,000 annually on this one item.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The 45,000,000 people living in the mid western area of the United States—the marooned section—consume each year approximately 300,000 tons ot coffee. If diis coffee were distributed from the Great Lakes ports instead of by rail from the Atlantic coast there would be an indicated saving to mid-western distributors and users amounting to $750,000 annually. The St. Lawrence seaway would make similar savings possible on all imports and exports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the Census of Manufactures, 19:23, published by the Bureau of the Census, the value of the products of the states of Ohio, Indiana. Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota amounted to $18,784,468,715. These six stalos accounted for thirty one percent of the total value of products of the United States, which was $60,555,998,200—and the St Lawrence waterway will allow ocean steamers to enter the harbors of these six great states. Will there be inland cargoes available for these ocean vi ssels? Fil say so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Less than one percent of our corn crop was exported in the year 1924, due to excessive transportation costs from the mid-western corn belts. If the St. Lawrence Ship Channel were in operation corn could be loaded and shipped direct to Europe at a saving of approximately ten cents per bushel over tte present cost of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn,</span><span class="font0"> N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">transportation. This would enable the cornbelt producer to market his product abroad in competition with the feed grains of western Europe and South America, and would take off the American market the surplus that so often brings loss to the grower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the entire fiscal year ending June 30, 1925, the traffic between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts passing through the Panama Canal amounted to 7,596,687 tons. This was only 1,389,699 tons more than even the present inadequate fourteen-foot St. Lawrence Canals were called upon to handle during their navigation season of only 234 days. And in 1924 the Great Lakes foreign traffic exceeded 13,711,000 tons— nearly 15 percent, in volume, of our total foreign trade in that year. This shows the necessity of put lung ahead vith the project of expanding the St. Lawrence-Great Lakes waterway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three things are essential to the success of any ship canal—water, ships and commerce. The St. Lawrence has the water; the Gieat Balms and the Atlantic have the ships and the commerce. Simply connect the two by a channel only thirty-three miles long, and you have a main ocean-going highway direct from the European continent into the very heart of America. Why not dig the ditch ? Cut the freight cost to the American farmer by ten or twelve cents a bushel and you increase his net profits anywhere from 25 to 100 percent. Dig the ditch! We dug the Panama Canal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">St. Lawrence Canals handled the greatest tonnage in their histories during the navigation season of 1925. The traffic of the Welland Canal amounted to 5,640,298 tons, and the St. Lawrence Canals to 6,206,988 tons. These figures show an increase over 1924 of 602,866 tons for the former and 670,614 tons for the latter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1925 the St. Lawrence Canal, wfilh a depth of only fourteen feet and a navigation season of only 234 days, handled 325,297 tons more than did the Manchester Ship Canal, with a depth of twenty-eight feet and an open season during the entii'e year. The Manchester Ship Canal has been a great success. Does it seem reasonable to believe that the coming St. Lawrence waterway will be less successful?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The obstacles to the undertaking of the St. Lawrence waterway are being removed. The political opposition that centers in the city and harbor of Buffalo, in the city and harbor of New York, and in the Barge Canal political interests of the State of New York, has been out in the open, fighting for a reversal of the report of the special board of Army Engineers, and demanding that a report favorable to the proposed ship canal across the State of New York bo adopted. Anticipating failure in this they demanded, through Congressman Dempsey of New York, another survey of the Now York route, leading to New York harbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Very good to make a waterway from Lake Ontario to New York City, if it is feasible and practical But there have been since 1836 no less than twelve surveys of the New York route, made by the Board of Army Engineers, and they are all practically in accord; they agree that a ship canal could be built from Lake Ontario to the Hudson River, but they do not agree that such a route would be practicable. The St. Lawrence route is the one which nature chose to connect the Great Lakes with the Atlantic, and it is quite feasible to expand it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is the position taken by the Special Board, and is the object of attack by the rail interests and the politicians of New York. There are engineering facts in plenty. We need no more surveys. We must have no more delay!

<p><span class="font4">The total wealth of our country increased from 65 billions in 1890 to 320 billions in 1922; and as the workers didn’t get the difference, the rich must have. Here is what they admit having got, in their income tax statements, during four years 1921-1924. The number of fortunate ones who got more than $300,000 a year income increased from 246 to 773. The number of those with incomes between $100,000 and $300,000 increased from 2,106 to 4,921. The number with incomes between $25,000 and $100,000 increased from 37,663 to 62,158.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You take $350 in greenbacks and put them in 'the bank, and under our banking laws the banker can deposit those greenbacks with the Federal Reserve Bank, and receive a credit of $1,000; and then on the basis of that $1,000 he is legally permitted to lend out sums amounting to about $10,000 to other customers of the bank, In other words, $350 deposited by a customer becomes the basis of bank-loans, not merely of that $350, but of $9,650 additional, created by our legalized counterfeiter? The outstanding amount of greenbacks, about a third of a billion dollars, thus becomes the basis of ten billions of dollars of banker-created money—and this for the national banks alone, without counting all the state banks and private banks </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The headquarters of this greatest graft of all the ages is Wall Street. The money from all the little banks pours in here, and likewise the insurance money which our people put up to insure the safety of‘ their wives and children. It is all at the service of tlie big banker-speculators, to be used inmanwulatingmarkets, driving prices up and dovn, so that the insiders can buy while securities aie low and sell 'while they are-high. Here is concentrated the collective greed of all America, and men become frenzied with visions of sudden gain; they sell the goods they hope to have, and bay with the profits they expect to make, and the fires of avarice are fanned white hot, until the whole thing bursts like a crucible in a steel mill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The financial history of America is the record of a series of great panics, coming at intervals of from seven to ten years. In these crises the bankers used to suffer as well as the rest of us; but this was intolerable to them, and so they put their experts to work. To save yourself in a panic you must have money—a great deal of money in a hurry; and where can such money be got? Where, but from our good old Uncle Sam! So the bankers devised a wonderful new scheme, the Federal Reserve System; a chain of twelve regional banks with a directing head, a bankerboard, having for its function to watch over our money system in the interest of the bankers, to lend money freely when they want it to be cheap, and to call in loans when they are ready for a killing; above everything else, to watch out for panics, and when these come, to issue credit to the big insiders, so that they can keep afloat while the rest of us drown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our Federal Reserve notes, which make up most of our paper money, no longer carry the promise to pay in gold, or in anything—-look at one and see.

<p><span class="font4">In the spring the farmer went to the bank and arranged for a loan of $200. Out of his necessity he was compelled to pay 55% interest charge. Unable to meet the note at maturity, he had to agree to 100% interest m order to get the renewal. The next renewal forced him. up to 425%. For four years the thing went on, and all the drudgery of the father and the mother and the six children could never keep down the terrible interest or wipe out the principal. As a finish, the bank swooped down and sold him out; the wretched man, barefoot and. hungry, went to work clearing a swamp, eaught pneumonia and died; the county buried him, and neighbors raised a purse to send the widow and children back to friends in Arkansas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And what do the banks make out of such exploitation? Well, take one ease; the great First National Bank of New York earned 140% on its capital in 1925; its stock has gone up to $2950 for a share having a par value of $100. According to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Financial Age,</span><span class="font4"> a Wall Street paper, &lt;9 New York banks averaged 50% dividends in 1925. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It happened that in 1917 our country went to war “to make the world safe for democracy”; and that was surely a time for patriotic sacrifices on the part of these beneficiaries of protection! From a report of the Secretary of the Treasury I take a few figures concerning the profits they made in that year. One woolen mill, hiding behind the carefully constructed tariff wall, made 1770% on its capital stock; and in case that Wall Street method of figuring should puzzle you, Judd, I put it into your kind of figures; you build a house for $1,000, and sell it for $18,700.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Seventeen woolen mills in 1919 reported profits of over 100% on their capital stock—that is, the stockholders got back in one year’s profit the total amount of their investment, The great American Woolen Company, with its capital stock of $60,00©,000, made a net profit ofi|lB8,-560,342. Canners of fruits and vegetables, tariff protected, made as high as 2032%. Clothing and dry goods stores, tariff protected, made a profit of 9826%. One steel mill, tariff protected, made as high as 290,999%. This, you will say, must be a joke: but I am quoting the figures of Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo; the capital stock of the concern was $5,000, and the net profits were $14,549,952. The great steel trust, our billion dollar infant, made in two years &amp;&nbsp;net profit exceeding its capital stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Or again, take aluminum, used in making our kitehan utensils. This trust was organized in 1888, with a paid up capital of $20,000. Not one dollar more of real money has ever been put into it; but it has a tariff protection of 7 cents a pound, and in 1923 the concern paid a profit of 1000% on the original investment! The company’s circular now claims assets of $110,000,000, and last year a report of the Federal Trade Commission declared the company a monopoly which “threatened competitors with extermination unless obedient to the company’s will”. The United States Attorney-General declared, in February, 1925, that this company had violated provisions of the dissolution decree and had “shmm.itself indifferent to the provisions of the decree”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And what did President Coolidge do about that? The answer is easy-—he always does the same thing, which is nothing. And why? The Aluminum Company of America is another name for the Mellon family; and the head, of this family, the third richest man in America, is President Coolidge’s Secretary of the Treasury, the man who determines the financial policy of our country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Take the Standard Oil Company of New York. I recall how, before the war, this concern’s stock was quoted on the market at $700 a share, or seven times its par value. What did that mean? It meant that the Rockefellers were old-fashioned, and afraid of the new corporation tricks; they kept their concern at its old capitalization of $15,000,000, while its profits were 70% on that amount. But the time came when the public clamor got so intense that the Rockefdlers had to hide like the rest; and what did they do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Well, in 1913, the Standard Oil Company of &lt;&nbsp;New York dedared a “stock dividend” of 400%;, that is, it gave its stockholders four additional shares for each one they already had; so the company now had a capitalization of $75,000,- , 000, where formerly it had $15,000,000. Natural- <sup>s </sup>ly, then, its profits didn’t look so Mg; they had to be divided among five times as many shares. { And then again, in 1922, the capital was multiplied by three, becoming $225,000,000. The company now pqys 14%, and that seems bad' enough; but what would you say if you figured cm the old capitafigation and knew it was paying 210% every year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the- old days of the Tweed ring, the politicians used to steal our money outright; but that is over now, because every politician knows, just as every business man knows, that it jg ® much better to ^nake” money than to steal it; you can “make’ so much more, and there is no laager of being seat to jail So nowadays the rule of our politics is “honest graft”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The chiefs of Tammany Hall do not loot the treasury; what they do is to receive blocks of stock in paving companies and construction companies, which do the work for the oily at enormous profits; they own stock in the banks which handle the city’s funds; they are in on all the Big traction deals; they get up little pet companies, to do this or that service for the public service corporations—to furnish them with ink erasers, or time-clocks, or chewing gum, at several times the market price; and all that is perfectly safe and regular, and instead of sending them to jail we envy them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In their battle the rich have had four lines of defense: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">First<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font4"> the elections; they put up the money, and subsidize a political party, and carry on a campaign of falsehood and abuse, and buy votes and stuff ballot-boxes, and so defeat the poor at the polls. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Second^</span><span class="font4"> assuming they fail in this, comes the legislative line of defense; they sow discord in the ranks of their opponente, they buy up some of their representatives, they delay action and confuse the public and plant “jokers” in the bills which are passed. And then comes the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">third</span><span class="font4"> Hne, the courts; the rich have named as judges their own retainers and corporation attorneys, their fellow dub-mwnbers and table-companions, thoroughly trained in reverence for property; and these judges discover the “jokers” in the law, and declare them unconstitutional, null and void. FmrA, assuming that these three lines fail, the rich simply defy the laws, resting upon the certainty that their government will not punish them; and it does not &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It happens that I once knew intimately a vary “big” judge. He was &amp;&nbsp;member of the Court of Appeals of the State of New Jersey; which is to say, he was one of the five highest judges in a state which was extremely important, because many of our biggest corporations were formed under its safe and easy laws. At the same time the “big” judge was a “big” eorporation lawyer on the other side of the Hudson Hiver, in New York state; in fact, he was the highest paid ©orpomtion lawyer in the city, which was surely going some. He was the author of “Dill on Cor-jEKxmtimm”, the standard text-book in every lawschool in the country. I have sat in James B. Dill’s library many an evening, and watched him smoke big black cigars, and listened to him pour out his souk I will tell you the first story of his career, and then X will toll you the last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A young law-graduate, he got a job in the law department of a big railroad, I think he said the New York Central; he was to defend accident suite, and the lawyer who took him in charge pulled open a drawer in his desk and took out a list of the judges of the state. “You will notice that some of these names are checked,” said the man. ‘‘When we have cases, get them before one of those judges. These are oar judges.” Said Dill to me: “That ws a young man’s first introduction to the lawf’ I asked: “Is it as bad as that now!” Ite answered, “There are twenty-two judges of the supreme court in New York' state, and nineteen of them are crooked. I can say to each one, T know whose man you are/ and not one will dare contradict me.<sup>M</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And then the tat story. Dill had just been appointed to his high post in New Jersey: and the day after the news was published, one of Ms old college friends came to see him, and brought him an offer from E. H. Harriman, railroad magnate, to retain his services in New York for fifty thousand dollars a year, “and you needrft do any work.® Dill said to his friend, “What ease has Harriman got before the Jersey courts F The friend replied that it was just general principles, the great magnate liked to have friends on the bench. Dill answered, “Yon tell Harriman—being a fisherman you can explain what I mean—that a fat trout does nut rise to a fly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Consider war. Women bear children with' muWpain, and raise them with loving care; and then send then out, at the very prime of their lives, to be blown to pieces by shot and shell. Other men in factories, who might be making the means of human happiness—automobiles and radio sets and books and music—these men are malting explosives to wipe out whole cities, and gases to poison the inhabitants. In the late war we destroyed 30,000,000 human beings and $300,000,000,000 worth of treasure, toe product of a whole generation of useful toil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They promised us that this war was to be the last, but what are the prospects f In 1912 our government spent for defense nearly a quarter of a billion dollars, and our 1926 budget for ths same purpose was more than three times that amount. In 1920 the Bureau of Standards analyzed our budget and found that expenses for wars, past and future, composed 93 percent thereof. Think of it, Judd, a great government spending one dollar to save life and property, and thirteen dollars to destroy it! Of course, the military men Mill say that the thirteen dollars are to prevent other nations from destroying us; but the obvious fact is that when we spend this money on armaments we cause other nations to do the same, so we might as well do our own destruction and have it over with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Or consider child labor. We take a million children out of school and put them into factories and mines, thus stunting them in body and spirit; and when they </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">grove up into</span><span class="font4"> cripples, defectives, criminals and grafters, we pay ten or a hundred times what we got out of their childhood labor I Or consider crime, which is caused by the presence of extreme poverty alongside extreme wealth. Including criminals and those who catch them, this factor of waste keeps more than 700,000 persons out of productive work. Or take prostitution, caused by poverty and low wages of women in industry. There are over a quarter of a million women in our country who live by spreading vice and disease, and the American Social Hygiene Association estimates that this costs us $628,000,000 every year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Or consider adulteration, the putting of worthless goods and poisonous foods upon the market; all for profits, of course. Or the wastes of advertising—-the seekers of profits spending a billion and a quarter dollars a year, and keeping more than 660,000 people busy all the time, in order to persuade us to stop buying the worthy products of Jones and to buy the unworthy products of Smith. This is civil war within our industry ; and one of its weapons is fashion, the making of imbecile changes in our goods ©very season in order that we may be ashamed to wear our perfectly good clothes after the first year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Or take the wastgg. of mismanagement of industry. The so-called^Hoover Committee” of the American Engineering Societies made an elaborate study of this field, and it is interesting to notice that this cxsployerT body attributes 50 percent of the blame to management and only 25 percent to labor. They estimate the percentage of waste in a few great industries: Metal trades, 28 percent; boots and shoes, 40 percent; textiles, 49 percent; building, 53 percent; print* ing, 57 percent; men’s clothing, 63 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I could tell the hilarious story of how Britain and Germany went to war to take away from each other the chance to sell shirts to Chinamen, —and to Hindoos and Persians and Arabs and Turks, of course. When they had destroyed 30,-000,000 human lives and $300,(MX),000,000 worth of goods you might think they would have cured their &quot;over-production” for quite a while; but they had made a miscalculation, and fought too long, and borrowed too much money from us, and so their governments are burdened with enormous fixed charges, and there fa chronic unemployment in both Britain and Germany, and almost a collapse in France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And how about us? We have that &quot;favorable balance of trade”, so ardently desired by the prosperity boosters; indeed, we have got such a bellyful of it that for the first time we are forced to realize that it is nothing but wind. Europe owes us, in one form or another, some $19,000,-000,000, and can’t even pay the interest; they made no pretense of trying—until they had to borrow some more! Italy came, bowing low and grinning behind its cap, agreeing to pay several billions in the course of 65 years—on condition that we lend another $200,000,000 right off! Germany did the same thing, and France will be doing it, probably before these words see the light of day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our great financiers accept these paper pledges, for the reason that they are stuck with $19,000,000,000 of them already, and can’t contemplate what will happen when the whole thing turns out to be wind. We go on adding about a billion a year, because the only way we can keep ouj factories going is to ship our surplus goods abroad—and take nothing back, because that ‘“would stop the factories!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We promised our people Prosperity % you remember, if only they would vote for Coolidge; and they did so, good, patient souls; so now we have to deliver it. The way to “prosperity” is to keep them working to feed and clothe Frenchmen and’ Germans and Italians and Chinamen and Guatemalans and Haytians—•anybody who will send us a beautiful engraved sheet of paper promising to pay us 65 years from now!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To be exact, Judd, they don’t even have to engrave the paper; we do that in Wall Street, and they just send us &amp;&nbsp;“mission” of white or yettow or Wack gentlemen in frock coats, to sign opposite the red seal. So here, Judd, you have this wonderful jazz system in its final, delirium stage—our whole people starving themselves on half wages, and sending the surplus abroad, so that our rich men may fill their vaults with pieces of paper which they dare not permit to be redeemed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The New York Central Kailroad crosses a bridge near Albany, and a private concern owns that bridge; and the railroad pays one cent for every passenger—that is, they add that much to every ticket sold—a small fortune every year. Our whole industrial system is a tangle of grafts such as that; the railroads are plundered by right-of-way companies, sleeping-car companies, refrigerator-car companies; industrial concerns are plundered by private railway lines, owned by “insiders&quot;, or by companies having a “cinch” on repairs or materials or accessories. Just the bookkeeping on such rights is a vast industry, and the adjusting of them supplies a living for thousands of lawyers and their clerks. No wonder the revolutionary spirit is abroad in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In some countries—America, England,Fr ance, Germany, Austria—the middleclass takes charge of the revolutions; but in Russia there was practically no middle class, it was the workers or chaos. And they took over a busted machine, a country in collapse after three years of modern war, the most destructive of all things known this side of hell. Then they had to face years of invasion from 'Europe, America and Japan, fighting on 26 fronts at onee; and at the same time civil war, and a blockade, and financial boycott, and world propaganda, besides two successive years of famine—something which comes every so often in Russia, caused by drought and not by revolutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ijj spite of all this, Soviet Russia confronts its world of enemies, nine years young, and proud and confident. It has restored its agriculture to the pre-war standard, and its industry to nearly 80 percent of this standard, with the certainty of passing it in 1927 if peace is maintained. It has turned one-sixth of the earth's surface from a militarist empire into a federated group of commonwealths, governed under a new system, in which the voters are classified according to their occupations. It has trained a new generation of young workers, and taken some five hundred thousand of them, into its governing party. It has taught millions of men and women to read and write, including everybody in its army, and nearly everybody in its industries. It would seem that all this entitles tbe new system to study, and to fair play in the field of thought</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I once spent two years reading the history of the period prior to the Civil War, and I know what the moral forces of America are. I know how long they wait, and how slow they seem to be in getting into motion; nevertheless, they are there, and I make my appeal to them, and I expect to hear it answered. I am taking care of my health, with the idea of living to sing once more the Battle Hymn of the Republic: “Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Fascism A Begas Pyramid</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">F</span><span class="font4">OR fifty years Bible Students have been teaching that -when God's plan is completed, at the end of the Millennial Age, it will be well represented by a pyramid, of which Christ will be the head, the spiritual classes next, and finally, at the base, the common, people. This idea, in another form, seems now to have occurred to others. Thus we have an Italian diplomat at Tokio reported as saying to some Japanese students;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">She organisation of Fas&amp;eism is like that of a powerful structure such as a pyramid. The base is the foundation., the largest part, and this is the bulk of the people who support the apex, which is represented by the Prime Minister. The brain of such a pyramid may only be at the top, just as a head may guide the body and not the fret, which have only the task of supporting the body. Thus, you see, fascism is not a reactionary movement, but merely in control of the people and order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This diplomat went on to say that Mussolini is only forty years of age, and his Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs is but thirty-three.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">[Radiocast from Station WEBB on s wave length of 416.4 meters by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A</span><span class="font4"> MORNING such as this is one for meditation. The farmers and mechanics have laid down their tools and turned aside for a day’s rest from their labors. The business men have closed their offices and shops that they might have a day’s rest with their families. The wintry blasts and falling snow cause the parent to consider what provision he is making for his dependent ones to protect them from the storms of life. His children are growing up and soon they must go out into the cold world to battle for their bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We see that in every part of the land the burdens of taxation are increasing, and without a reasonable or just cause. Many who are this morning indulging in silent meditation are saying, &quot;Shall we ever have a government that will look well to the interests of all the people that all may have a reasonable opportunity to live and be happy? What can w© do for the betterment of our governmental conditions that will safeguard the interests of our children and dur children’s children F</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You thoughtful men and women who have tuned in on WBBR this morning, lend me your ears, if you will, while I tell you of God’s gracious provision for a government of the people in righteousness, one ■which will protect the interests of yourself and your children and your children’s children for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A government of the people, that exercises its powers and functions unselfishly in behalf of the general welfare of all the people, has long been the desire of man. Every form of government has been tried; and none has been found satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More than a fourth of the twentieth century has now passed. It has been marked by the greatest material improvement ever known to man. Great advancement in science, invention, and general information has been made; but doubtless there has never been a time when the people were so discontented with their rulers and with their governments as now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The British Empire is doubtless the most powerful nation on earth. A few rule the masses, who are seething with discontent; and the oppressed are crying for relief. Germany’s rulers are entirely unsatisfactory, and constant tarmoil crista. Mussolim, who came so rapidly to the front in Italy and who attracted the at-* tention of the world, is quite unsatisfactory and is threatened with downfall. France has pushed aside some of her brightest minds, and advanced the more radical element into power. Spain is ruled by a dictator, cruel and relentless, who is looking well to the selfish interest of the few. This may be said of many other nations and rulers. The peoples are anxious for relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In every country known under the sun there is a cry of discontent. The people are groaning and travailing in pain, hoping for something better but not knowing to whom to look. There never was such an opportunity as now to call attention of the people to a new order of things that wall bring blessings to them. The men who are missing this opportunity are the theological professors and the clergymen, who stand before the people as sponsors for righteousness and truth. These, however, are repudiating the inspiration of the Scriptures, and have entirely lost sight of God’s plan to establish a kingdom of righteousness and peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Intelligent Studg of Bible Needed</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font4">HE purpose of the International Bible Students is not to get converts but to turn the minds of the people to the Bible, which not only holds the remedy for the ills of nations of earth but points clearly to the way, so that all people may understand how these ills will be overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why do not the people, without regard to creed or denomination, turn their minds to a careful and honest consideration of the Holy Scriptures, which are given to man for his instruction in righteousness and to ^»int him to the way that will bring the desire of every honest heart! Surely, since the great desire of mankind is for a government that will look well to their interests, insure them freedom of speech, liberty to do what is right, full and complete opportunity to pursue a course of happiness and to reap the blessings of eternal life, every honest person should want to aid them to find out just how these blessings are going to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the most prominent themes of the Bible is that of the kingdom of God. Jehovah, through His prophet .Daniel, referring to th® distressing condition which we now we upon the earth, and to the perplexity amongst the people and their dissatisfaction with their raters, said: &quot;And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which stall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not b® left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever? “Daniel 2:44.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2">Ml</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">ft is manifest from this language that Jehovah purposes to establish a kingdom ; that He will not call upon selfish men to tell Him how to run it, but will establish it in His own way and see that the powers thereof are -exercised for the general welfare, peace and happiness of all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">About 4,000 years ago Jehovah made a promise to Abraham, and bound it with His oath, in which lie said: 'In thy seed shall all the nations of earth be blessed.&quot; Abraham understood that his seed would constitute the king or ruler of the earth, would establish a righteous government, and that through it the blessings would flow out to the people. God did not tell Abraham when tliis promise would be fulfilled. Abraham died, not having received the promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then the promise was renewed to his son Isaac, who pleased Jehovah; and later it was again renewed to the grandson of Abraham, Jacob. Jacob died; and God selected from his dfepring twelve tribes and organized these into a nation, to which nation God renewed again the promise. To them He said: &quot;If ye will obey ray voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people; for all the earth is mine: and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an My uatfon?’—Exodus 19:5,6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">AHL was the first lung </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4"> this typical nation of Jehovah’s, and he proved unsatisfactory to the people. Later the son of Jesse, David, was selected to be king and was anointed to that office. God’s promise to establish in the interest of mankind a kingdom that should bless all the peoples, was narrowed down to David’s house. The people of Israel thought that David would become a universal ruler. Ilis life was stormy, and the promised blessings did not come to the people. His son Solomon succeeded him, whose reign was marked by wealth, wisdom, peace and prosperity. Solomon’s reign, however, did not bring a fulfilment of the promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">. All the holy prophets of God taught concerning the coming kingdom of the Lord, which He would establish for the blessing of mankind. They uttered many wise sayings, which they did not understand, but which were spoken prophetically concerning that kingdom. Some of these sayings concerning the Bnler are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, . . . The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end?* —Isaiah 9:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">*TIe shall have dominion also from sea to sea?* His kingdom shall bring peace to the people. &quot;De shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.&quot;—Psahn 72:8,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Belying upon these promises of God’s prophets, yet not understanding them, the nation of Israel expected that there would come from amongst them one who would be the Ruler of the whole earth, and who would set up an earthly kingdom, through which the blessings would be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Jesus of Nazareth came to Israel, only a few believed Him to be sent from God; and the nation rejected Him. Those who did accept Him, He taught to pray for the coming of the kingdom which God had promised. The chief portion of His teaching to His followers was concerning that kingdom. Jesus was crucified, arose from the dead; and thereafter His disciples were instructed of the Lord, understood God’s purposes, and proelaamed the kingdom. They taught the people according to Jesus’ words, that in a time future the promised kingdom would be established and the blessings that Jehovah had promised would come to all the nations.</span></p>

Then for many centuries good, honest Christians taught that the kingdom of God is a heavenly kingdom only, and that all who will ever have any whatever must die and go to heaven.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">seal professors and teachers has taken over all ecclesiastical affairs; and they refer to the early teachings of the prophets, the Lord and the apostles as “primitive religion” They disregard the Scriptures as God’s inspired Word; they deny that much of the Bible is the Word of God. Consequently there is a famine in the land for the understanding of what the Bible really means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Apostle Peter, under inspiration, described the conditions that we now see prevailing in the world, and called attention to the heavens being on fire, the elements melting with fervent heat. Then he said: “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.”—2 Peter 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The heavens represent the invisible part, while the earth represents the visible part All Christians understand, and believe that Jesus Christ is a spirit; that he is not visible to man, and will not be; and that the faithful, overcoming Christians, who participate with Mina in the first resurrection and reign with Him in glory, shall also be invisible to man; that no man will ever behold a divine spirit being and live, because that is God’s rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Scriptures abundantly leach that there will be a visible representation of God’s kingdom. God formed the earth to be inhabited; He made it not in vain. He promised that the earth shall abide for ever, and that it shall be a habitation for man. Since He so abundantly promises a. righteous government we may be sure that He Mb an arrangement by whitri earth’s rulers shall be righteous men, men who will look well to the general welfare and interest of the people; and this is what constitutes the new earth; meaning thereby that society will be organized upon a righteous basis, in which selfishness will not be permitted to manifest itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Who then in all the earth could fill the requirements to rule in righteousness? There is not a man living on the earth today, in any nation, whom all tire people would be willing to risk as their governor and ruler. The Lord is equal to the occasion, however, and will provide rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Doubtless many of you have heard that the Jews shall again rule the earth. This has been nwh misunderstood. Not every man who is a Be it known once and for aH that those profiteering, eonsdenoeiess, selfish men who sail themselves Jews, and who control the greater portion of the finances of the world and the business of the world, will never be the rulers in this new earth. God would, not risk such selfish men with such an important position.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">T ET us now examine the Scriptures and find ■*“1 how God purposes to place in the earth righteous rulers. Bemember that the Apostle Paul, like the other apostles, wrote under inspiration of the holy spirit. In the 11th chapter of Hebrews the apostle enumerates a list of men, covering a period from Abel down, to John the Baptist</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“City” is used in the Scriptures as a symbol of government It represents the civis affairs of mem Discussing the course of these men the apostle says in that chapter that they looked for a city (government) which will have foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God. Then he adds: “These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. . . . But now they desire a better country [government], that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for lie hath prepared for them a city [government] /—Hebrews 11:13,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After naming such as Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, and others, th® apostle continues: “And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae, of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets: who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of .lions, quenched the violence of fir®, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the Biens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: and others had trial of cruel Blockings and scourgings, yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment: they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were elain with <sub>x</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goat: kins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.”—Hebrews 11: 32, 38. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why should men undergo such great hardship, persecution, and faithfully endure it unto death? The answer is, They had faith in God's promise; they fully trusted Him, that in His due time He would establish a kingdom of righteousness; and they believed that they v»ould be resurrected from the dead and have some part in this new government; for, says the apostle, they thus endured that “they might obtain a better resurrection&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Ser. 'lures abound with proof that when the heawrh '-.pcdoni is established and in full operation, the resurrection of the dead shall begin; and that these faithful men of old, who died, shall be the first that shall be resurrected on earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">M</span><span class="font4">ANY Christians have believed and taught</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">that these faithful men, from Abel to John the Baptist, all died and went to heaven; but that cannot possibly be true. Long after all of them had died, and even after the beheading of John the °^nt:st, Jesus of Nwareth, who spoke with abs'Tv^ authority, said: “No man hath ascended to her ven, but he that came down from herA .

<p><span class="font4">Referring again to Hebrews 11, concerning these men the Apostle Paul said: “And these all,hav‘n &lt;&nbsp;obtained a good report through faith, received i ot the promise; God having provided some b t er thing for us [the church], that they without us should not be made perfect.”—Hebrews 11:39,40.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">D</span><span class="font4">URING the whole period of Israel’s history these faithful men were called the fathers in Israel; and from then till now Christians have spoken of them as the fathers in Israel, as indeed they were. From the words of the apostle just mentioned, they without the Christ could not be made perfect It is manifest that when the invisible part of Christ’s kingdom, the heavenly, is completed, these faithful men of old would be perfected. We have, then, the clear statement of the prophet as to what shall be their position. He says; “Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou [the Christ] mavest make princes in all the earth.”-—Psalm 45:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A prince is a ruler. These men, when raised from the dead, perfect in body, perfect in the sense of justice, having no selfish interests to serve, and being the direct representatives of the Lord, shall constitute the rulers of the earth. The word “children” means offspring, or ones who get their life from a common father. Christ will grant life to them under the terms of the new covenant, and then they will indeed be the children of the Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They will receive their instruction from the Lord, and will carry it out in the earth. The new heavens will be the new spiritual ruling powers, Christ and His bride, the church invisible, directing th® affairs of tike earth; where* as the new earth Mill he a new order of society, managed and directed by these faith Lui men of old, resurrected as perfect human beings. Upon these the people can rely and trust absolutely to look well to their interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the people have absolute confidence in the honesty, integrity and the pover foi good of their rulers, then they will settle down and be quiet and pursue a course that will lead to happiness. The affairs of earth Mill become stable, and gradually selfishness M’lll fade aw’ay.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Q</span><span class="font4">UESTION: Do you believe in infant baptism?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: No. The real baptism is the burial or planting of an individual into Christ Jesus by the heavenly Father, Jehovah God. This must be preceded by a full consecration of the individual to do God’s holy will. The symbolic baptism is the complete immersion of the individual into water, which pictures the real baptism into Christ. Since the individual’s will and consent are involved to make baptism possible, it would be ridiculous to baptize infants. Infants have net the capacity to determine to do the win of the heavenly Father. Furthermore, to do the will of God implies that the individual has knowledge of that will, Infants are unable to understand the will of God as expressed in the Bible. Not only is infant baptism improper, but there are very few adults who have any conception of the real baptiam as stated in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question: Why did the perfect man Jesus have to die to redeem Adam and the human family </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Amswb : Jesus had to die as a perfect human being to furnish the price of the penalty that was placed upon Adam for disobedience. God told Adam plainly that the penally for disobedience would be death, according to Genesis 2: 17. Adam was a perfect man beforetoe sinned. The penalty required the death of a perfect man. Adam, paid the penally when he went down into death. There was absolutely no hope for Adam to come up out of death unless some other person should come and pay a ransom, and that required the death of &amp;&nbsp;perfect man. Jesus came </span><span class="font4">into the M’orld as a perfect man, and HU death and resurrection provided a guarantee th i not only Adam but Adam’s progeny might obtain life through Him. In Bomans 5:12 we read, &quot;By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” The hopeful passage pointing to Jesus as the Life-giver is 1 Corinthians 15:22, &quot;For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">TN HISTORY we have a picture of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The more complete the record the clearer the picture. By it we are able to compare ourselves with our ancestors, and by it we fall heir to whatever they have left for us in the way of knowledge and experience. It is regrettable that we do not have more accurate and complete records, but our present lack will be fully made up when all those now in their graves are brought to life again. Every one will then be able to write his own history of his previous life on earth, and the whole will form a complete record of the human race. That will be interesting reading for some of our evolutionist friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At present the further back we trace our ancestry the more uncertain and indefinite it becomes, until, with one exception, the trail is lost in the swamps of tradition and fables. For this reason many believe that if we could follow the trail far enough we could find the origin of man in the tadpole or in protoplasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have, however, one reliable record, giving the history of man from the beginning. This record traces the genealogy from the first man, by name and age, for 2000 years, and then by connecting links 1500 years further, making direct connection with reliable secular history at the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia. It records the first divisions of mankind into tribes and nations, and specifies the territories where each located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This record claims to be God-given, and its internal evidence and the external facts testify to th a claim. Considerable of the history of several nations, and that of a number of notable persons, was told in advance. Reliable historians have verified many of these prophecies. Surely such a record has the stamp of divine authorship, and is well worthy of our earnest consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If God can pre-write history He must foreknow what the end will be. In corroboration of this the Apostle Paul says, in Romans 15:4, “Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning,&quot;’ and also in 1 Corinthians 10:11 he adds, “Now all these things happened unto them [the children of Israel] for types, and they were written, for our admonition.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This being true, it is evident that Jehovah has overruled the history and experiences of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">8«</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">the Jews and their leaders to form pictures of the future. The Bible also mentions others v hom Jehovah raised up for special purposes. Pharaoh, king of Egypt; Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon; Cyrus, king of Persia, whom Isaiah named 100 years before Cyrus was born; Augustus Caesar, Napoleon and others are easily recognized by their descriptions in the Bible. No one could claim that these men were noted for their righteousness, piety or nobility of heart, yet Jehovah used them to shadow forth greater things to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nebuchadnezzar was used to picture one feature of the Devil and his kingdoms of this world. Pharaoh and Egypt were used to give a different view of the Devil and his empire. Napoleon was foretold as the one who would break the religious slavery under Papacy, and open the prison doors and liberate the minds fettered during the dark ages. The Bible even gave the exact date, 1799 A. D. History proves the prophecy true, and since 1799 A. D. the world has experienced the greatest mental rebound known in history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If we eonld imagine ourselves in a grand reviewing stand, watching the procession of the ages go by, we would notice the throng as a whole, with here and there a great leader standing out very prominently above all the rest If their influence were to be indicated by physical stature, some would be ten feel tall, some twenty, some fifty and a few even one hundred foot in height. Some one has well said that the history of the human race is summed up in the biography of a few men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of these leaders were bora to their positions ; some rose to their eminence by force of cireomstonces and their own ability. Others, because of their love for righteousness, were exalted by Jehovah to prominent positions in His work. One of the most notable characters used by Jehovah is spoken of in the Bible, as “Moses, the man of God&quot;. Why was this name given! Because, as the apostle testifies in Hebrews 315, “Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to come later.&quot; The last forty years of his life are so closely related to that of the children of Israel that one writer says, “The history of Moses is the history of Israel for forty years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Moses the Mm</span><span class="font5"> of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">M</span><span class="font4">OSES could never have attained his preeminence by his own ability. It was Jehovah who raised him to his prominence, by overruling his life's experiences to the end that they might picture a greater than Moses to come, to do for the whole world what Moses did for Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">His parents were slaves to the king of Egypt. Because the Israeliti.es were increasing rapidly, the king feared that they might eventually outnumber the Egyptians, and thus become a menace to the throne. He therefore issued the heartless edict that every male child born to the Hebrews should be slain at birth, Because of their faith in God, and in His promises to their father Abraham, the parents of Moses ignored the command of Pharaoh, and hid the child for three months. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The record of his early life reads like a fairy tale. At the end of three months he could no longer be hidden from the watchful eyes of the spies of the king. His mother made a little ark of bulrushes and laid the child in it, and placed the tiny boat among the flags along the bank of the Biver Nile, near by where the king’s daughter was accustomed to come with her maids daily to bathe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Apparently the king’s daughter wm a childless wife and longed for motherhood. She saw the little ark, which may have slowly drifted with the water from its hiding place, and sent a maid to fetch it On opening it she saw the face of a beautiful child. Its cry touched the mother heart of the princess, and she wished it were her own. But she could net nurse it, so she called fox- a eukc from the Hebrew women and hired her to rare for it until it should be old enough for her to adopt as her own sen. The nurse was the babe’s own mother, Who could haw nursed and eared for it more tenderly? !At the age of four or fiv^years the mother took the lad to the palace, and he became the son of Pharaoh’s daughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus Jehovah overruled so that one whom the king had commanded should be slain was adopted as his own grandchild, reared in the royal palace, and educated in all the wisdom of Bgypt—th® then aetaowledged center of learning of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Though reared in th® lap of luxury, this son of Hebrew slaves had not forgotten Hie lessons taught him at his mother’s knee regarding the true God and His promises to Abraham—that the Hebrews 'were to become a mighty nation and inherit Ihe land of promise. Tradition credits Moses with being the general of the Egyptian army, and of hewing saved the kingdom from slavery to another nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Though holding so prominent a place in the kingdom, ihe apostle «ays that 'because of his faith in God, Moses vLen he was come to mature years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, eboosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season’. The world would say, What a foolish choice ’ Yet, the results prove that it was a very wise one. Forty years he spent in the courts of Egypt, forty years in the mountains of Arabia earing for sheep, and forty years leading the Israelites from bondage to national liberty,</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">E SHALL lose the point of this picture unless we keep in mind that the actors were but foreshadowing greater things to come. Pharaoh and Egypt typified Satan and his kingdom, from one point of fiew. The Hebrews typified the people of the world, held in bondage by Satan and his court of associateddemtms. The Hebrews were powerless to liberate themselves; the world is powerless to free itself. Moses was sent by Jehovah to do several things: First, to show up the unrighteousness and deceit cf Pharaoh and his court; second, to demonstrate the inability of the gods of the Egyptians to withstand the Ged of the Hebrews; third, to bring to naught Wth Pharaoh, and his kingdom; fourth, to liberate the Hebrews and take them to their promised land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was a battle between Moses as the leader of the Lord’s people, on one side, and. Pharaoh and all the powers of his Ifmgdom arrayed on the other side. It is a miniature picture of the battle between Christ the antitypical Moses leading the hosts of Jehovah, &lt;m one side, and Satan the Devil leading his mighty forces on the other side, as sjanbolieaHy stated in the 19th of Bevelation, With this outline in mind let us more closely examine the type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Moses was sent to demand that Pharaoh release the Hebrews. Pharaoh insolently replied, ’Who is Jehovah God that I should take a»x</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark29"></a>w</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">orders Com him!’ Moses’ answer was the manifestation of the power of the God of the Hebrews in such a way that Pharaoh and all Egypt never forgot. AU the nations trembled at the mention of the name Jehovah God, and the Israelites realized as never before the power and resources of the God they worshiped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pharaoh was a good pupil of his prototype the Devil. He could lie as fast as he could talk. No promise was worth keeping if it suited him better to break it. When he refused to let the Hebrews go, Moses, through the power of God, brought eight great plagues upon the Egyptians, each succeeding one being of still greater severity. While under the pressure of each plague Pharaoh would make promises to Moses, but the minute the pressure was released he would refuse. After the eighth plague Pharaoh’s servants said to him, &quot;How long shall this man be a snare unto us? Let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God; knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?”—Exodus 10:</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pharaoh was obstinate, and Moses brought the ninth plague. Pharaoh repented, but as soon as the plague of darkness was removed he again refused. Then God sent the tenth, wherein all the first-born of Egypt, from the first-bora of the king to that of the slave at the mill, died. There was a mourning such as Egypt had. never known. Pharaoh and the Egyptians were so crushed and humbled that they thrust the Hebrews out, loaded with the riches of Egypt, while the Egyptians remained to mourn and bury their dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, as soon as they had had time to bury their dead, and the king began to think of his humiliation and the loss of his slaves, he became madder than ever, and determined to follow them and bring them tack or destroy them. Assembling all his army and his chariots of war, including his six. hundred royal chariots, he pursued, the Hebrews to the shores of the Bed sea. Pharaoh had apparently forgotten that he was fighting the God of the Hebrews and not the Hebrews themselves. God. opened the sea and His people passed over on dry land, but when the Egyptian army attempted to follow them it was swallowed up and annihilated. If Pharaoh himself escaped, he doubtless returned to his palace a thoroughly humbled and beaten Msg. His country was ruined and impoverished, his entire army destroyed, his few remaining</span></p>

We read: “Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that it shall no more be said, Jehovah liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, but [this is what they shall say] Jehovah liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them into their own land which I gave to their fathers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This work began in 1914, when the antifypical plagues began upon the kingdom of Satan, the great antitype of Pharaoh. The Jews are already beginning to return to Canaan, and their complete return will follow shortly. Concerning the destruction of Satan’s army we read, in the 46th Psalm, “Come, behold the works of Jehovah, what desolations he hath mad® in all the earth. He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cut-teth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. Be still and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the heathen; I will be exalted in the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The difficulties which confronted Moses as he led the people to Canaan are well expressed by Dr. S. M. Melamed in a recent issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New Palestine.</span><span class="font4"> We quote a few sentences:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The inner development of the Jewish people consequent upon the exodus from Egypt is highly symbolic of the development of our nation on the eve of its redemption, . . . After all this display of patience and endurance [on the part of Moses] the generation of the &lt;&nbsp;wilderness, a wild generation indeed, had to die out ere the Jewish people could enter the promised land. Ona ■ could not build a state with a wild, nationally nndis-ciplined generation. The building of 8 state requires ; discipline, obedience, patience and a devotion for tha cause bordering on religion. A people that has heea Jiving for centuries in oppression and political and economic slaveiy must become alienated from its great national traditions and is not fit for statehood. It must first go through a certain purgatory and acquire a calmness of mmd. That it did in the wilderness with its monotony of life, with its wido open spaces, with the stillness prevailing in the expanse of the desert. When it thus became pathologically fit for the realization of the great act of national redemption, it entered the promised land of which its leaders spoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Moses lived over 3500 years ago, yet the code of Taws which he left to the Israelites is still a model for humanity in its justice between man and man, and in man's true relationship toward Jehovah. He was the leader and organizer of one of the most noted .nations of history, which people are still in existence, and revere him as their authority on religion and are looking toward the fulfilment of his prophecies regarding their future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Moses wrote of CTirist, ‘‘The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">like unto me;</span><span class="font4"> unto him shall ye hearken.” (Deuteronomy 18:15) Isaiah also (9:6,7) wrote of Christ, “For unto us a child is bom, unto us a son is given; and the government shall he upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful, The mighty Ood, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What then mav wo expect of Christ? From the pictures given of Moses in delivering Israel, overthrowing Pharaoh and leading the Hebrews to their promised land, we are to expect that Christ will overthrow, spoil and destroy the kingdom of Satan, liberate all the slaves of sin and unrighteousness, and lead the motley throng of earth’s billions to the promised land of Paradise restored. They will not be fit to enter the land at once, but will need much training, disciplining, educating and experience. This Christ h ?s arranged for by His kingdom of 1000 years, which is for that very purpose. At the close of that time those vho will have proved faithful will be led into the land of everlasting life, where justice and righteousness shall flourish for evermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All the wilfully wicked will have perished in the way, even as the wilfully disobedient of the Israelites died in the wilderness. Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth, and re joice in the abundance of peace.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">3S. Our heavenly Esther is sometimes spoken of as Jehovah God, or sometimes just the word God is used when He is referred to. That is one ©£ His names, of course; but then the wojd God, of itself, may be used to name any powerful being. The word god means rater, or mighty one. The heavenly Father’s name is Jehovah God, and none other in heaven or earth can bear that name. It means &quot;God of gods, Almighty One”.</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font4">41. Jehovah God Himself is, of course, the first.

<p><span class="font4"><sup>Sste</sup> All must come to a knowledge of the truth; and those obeying h will have their sins and iniquities wiped out for ever. Thus says the prophet: &quot;They shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more ” (Jeremiah 31:34) When the Lord remembers their iniquities and sins no more, then it must be that they are restored. When John the Baptist announced the approach of Jesus, he exclaimed: &quot;Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.® When the sin of the world is gone, when there is a world without sin, then it must be a world with perfect people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>898</sup> That the people will be brought to a condition of health and be cured of their sickness the Lord assures us through His prophet &quot;Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.® (Jeremiah 33:6) &quot;And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.”—Isaiah 33:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>393</sup> The restoration means the bringing back to earth of the Edenic condition for man’s benefit. Some may think there will be not sufficient room upon the earth for all the restored ones. According to the best authority, there have lived and died about 20,000,000,000 people. There are now on earth approximately 1,700,000,000 persons. This is a total of 21,700,(MX),000. In order to be liberal, let us suppose that ail the human race will total 504)00.000,000. As a suggestion that there will be room for all on earth, let one take his pencil and divide the area of the state of Texas by 50,000,000,000; and he will find that that number cf people could be placed in the state of Texas alone, giving each one about 146 square feet of land upon which to stand. Of course it is not to he expected that the earth Will be crowded thus; but when we remember that only a small portion of the earth’s surface •is now inhabited, that a great portion of it is desert, and when this desert shall become productive and all parts of the earth habitable, then we may see that 5O,OO0,0OOjXX) of people could comfortably be taken care of in the earth and have plenty of room to spare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>w</sup>But will the earth produce sufficiently to feed this multitude? The Scriptures answer: &quot;The wilderness and the solitary ptace shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and staging j the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Cannel and Sharon: they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God. , . , And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water.” (Isaiah 35:1,2,7) &quot;The desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate to tha sight of all that passed by. And they shall «ay, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.”—Ezekiel 36:34,35, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>

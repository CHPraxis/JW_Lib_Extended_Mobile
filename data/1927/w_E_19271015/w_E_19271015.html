<p><span class="font5">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font4">HIS journal is published by the Watch Towes Bible and Tract Society for the purpose of aiding the people to understand the divineplan. It provides systematic Bible study in which all its readers may regularly engage. It gives announcement of the visits made to Bible classes by traveling speakers, announces conventions, and gives the reports thereof. The International Sunday School lessons are treated in harmony with the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It adheres strictly to the Bible as God’s revealed Word of Truth. It stands firmly upon the great ransom sacrifice as the fundamental doctrine by which all doctrines are measured. It is free from parties, sects, and creeds of men. It does not assume a dogmatic attitude, but confidently invites a careful examination of its utterances in the light of the infallible Word of God. It does not indulge in controversies, and its columns are not open to personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JEHOVAH </span><span class="font4">is the only true God, the Maker of heaven and earth, and is from everlasting to everlasting; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation; that the Logos became a man; that he is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT GOD </span><span class="font4">created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrongful act all men are bom sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT </span><span class="font4">JESUS was made a human being in order that he might become the Redeemer of man; that he gave his life a sacrifice for man and thereby produced the ransom price; that Jesus the divine arose from the dead, ascended into heaven, and presented the value of his human sacrifice as the redemptive price for man.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE WORLD HAS ENDED; </span><span class="font4">that the Lord Jesus has returned and is now present; that Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus upon his throne and now commands all nations and peoples to hear and obey him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ANNUAL BUSINESS MEETING AND CONVENTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pursuant to the provision of law and the charter of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society,</span><span class="font4"> the annual business meeting of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Society</span><span class="font4"> will be held in the Carnegie Music Hall, Federal and Ohio Streets, Pittsburgh (North Side), Pa., at 10 o’clock a. m., Monday, October 31, 1927.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Arrangements have been made to hold a three-day local convention, beginning Saturday, October 29. Saturday sessions will be held in the Carnegie Musie Hall, and the Sunday sessions in the Garden Theatre, Federal Street and North Avenue. A period for field service will be announced at the opening of the convention. For further particulars address Charles H. Stewart, Sec’y, 317 Grace Street, Mount Washington Station, Pittsburgh, Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IMPORTANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Time and again we have called the attention of our readers not to remit currency in unregistered envelopes. It is a temptation to men to steal. A man who has been in the Postal service forty-two years has been arrested and will doubtless go to prison because he opened our mail and was caught at it by the officials. Not only is it a temptation to weak men, but you lose your money and then cannot understand why you do not hear from us. Please observe what we have said time and again: Remit by post office money order or New York draft. Do not send personal checks on any bank outside of New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIO</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord has clearly demonstrated that it is his will that the message of the kingdom shall be proclaimed by radio. There is not a radio station in the immediate vicinity of every class. If a class residing in a city where there is a radio station can make arrangements for the use of said station, other classes in nearby towns or cities Should cooperate in arranging and putting on programs. Cooperation can be either by communicating with the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Society</span><span class="font4"> at Brooklyn, Radio Department, or by writing the class that has made the contract for the broadcasting and arranging with them to share the expenses and the other burdens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We also make this suggestion: If a radio discourse is put on Sunday afternoon or evening, then on the following Sunday morning let canvassing parties go out in the vicinity and canvass the people for the books. This will afford an opportunity for all members of the class to have a part in the preaching of the gospeL The friends who have tried this have been wonderfully blessed. This is an indication that the Lord wishes it to be done.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font5">politicians and that said unholy alliance constitutes the governing powers that rule the peoples; that the masses of the peoples, acting under a misapprehension of the true facts, have borne up, carried, supported and maintained “organized Christianity”; and that without the support of the common people the unholy alliance constituting “organized Christianity” could not long exist.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> THIRD: That for centuries the privileges enjoyed by men have been wholly unequal and unfair. The multitudes have produced the wealth of the world, but have been unjustly deprived of the fruits of their labors. That the leaders of “Christendom” instead of teaching the ch.1-dren of men the doctrines of Christ, whom they claim to follow, teach them to murder their fellow creatures; and that now the rulers are amalgamating the common people with the military, in order to make all the peoples a part of and subject to their great war machine; that by unjust laws the common people, contrary to their own wishes, have been compelled to go to war against each other, resulting in great sorrow and suffering, multitudes of broken hearts and millions of untimely graves; that “organized Christianity” has turned a deaf ear to the petitions and entreaties of the people for relief, and now the cries of the oppressed people have entered into the ears of Jehovah God, and his time is at hand to give the peoples deliverance and freedom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> FOURTH: That Jehovah is the only true God, the Friend and Benefactor of the peoples. He has now set his beloved Son Christ Jesus upon his throne and bids all the peoples of earth to hear and to obey him who is earth’s rightful King.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> FIFTH: That the kings and rulers of the earth, to wit: those constituting the said unholy alliance, have been duly notified that God has set his King upon his throne and that his kingdom is at hand; but they refuse to understand or to take heed, and they walk on in darkness. Therefore God has decreed and declared that there shall come upon the world a time of tribulation such as never was known and that during that trouble “Christendom” or “organized Christianity”, so-called, and all of Satan’s organization shall be destroyed; and that Christ Jesus, the righteous King, will assume complete authority and control and will bless the peoples of earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> SIXTH: That it must be now apparent to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font5">thoughtful peopies that relief, comfort and blessings </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font5">much desired by them can never come from the unrighteous system of “Christendom” or “organized Christianity”, and that there is no reason to give further support 307</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font5">T THE international convention of the Bible Students, held at Toronto, Canada, July 18-25, on Sunday the 24th of July the public meeting was held. At that meeting the speaker first read before the convention a resolution and thereafter spoke in favor of the resolution. Both the resolution and the speech in support thereof follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RESOLUTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TO THE PEOPLES OF CHRISTENDOM:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> The International Bible Students in general convention assembled send greetings:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> As Christians and witnesses to the Name of Jehovah God we deem it our privilege and duty to call your attention to the following vital facts:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> FIRST: That God made of one blood all peoples and nations of men to dwell on the earth, and granted to all peoples equal rights. There is therefore no just cause or excuse for one nation to make war against another nation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> SECOND: That the foremost nations of the earth claim to be Christian nations and, taken collectively, they constitute “Christendom” or “organiged Christianity”, socalled; that the men chiefly responsible for the claim that these are Christian nations are the clergymen of the various religious denominations who call themselves by the name of Christ but who in fact have denied him; that their purpose of claiming that these nations are Christian is to induce the peoples to believe that said nations, although military and cruel, are the representatives of God and his Christ on earth; that such claim is fraudulent and false and has turned the minds of millions of honest people away from the true God and from his Christ; that the invisible ruler of the nations of “Christendom”, or “organized Christianity” so-called, is Satan the Devil, who has fathered the scheme of forming “organized Christianity” to deceive the people and to keep them in subjection to himself and his agencies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> That the masses of the peoples of the nations are entitled to self-government exercised by the people for the general welfare of all; but instead of enjoying such rights a small minority rules; that the money power of the world has been concentrated into the hands of a few men called high financiers, and these in turn have corrupted the men who make and execute the laws of the nations, and the faithless clergy have voluntarily joined forces with the high financiers and professional</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">to that hypocritical and oppressive system. In this hour of perplexity Jehovah God bids the peoples to abandon and for ever forsake “Christendom” or “organized Christianity” and to turn completely away from it, because it is the Devil’s organization, and to give it no support whatsoever; and that the peoples give their heart’s devotion and allegiance wholly to Jehovah God and to his King and kingdom and receive full freedom and the blessings God has in store for them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> SEVENTH: For four thousand years, the cherished desire of Jews has been God’s Messianic kingdom. For nineteen centuries that kingdom has been the hope of real Christians. It is now at hand. True to his promise God by and through the reign of Christ will lift the burdens of the peoples, free them from war, fraud and oppression, from sickness, suffering and death and give to them a righteous government and the blessings of everlasting peace, prosperity, life, and happiness.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">QUESTIONS FOR BEREAN STUDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why is there no just excuse for war? What nations are chiefly responsible for war? Why have these nations considered themselves to be Christian? What effect has this claim had upon millions of honest-hearted people? Who has been the invisible ruler of “Christendom”? What form of government has he instituted the world over? Name the three factors which constitute the governing element of the world, fl 1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What part have the masses of mankind had in world affairs? What have they been trained to do? What is meant by the phrase “war machine”? What great effort is now being made to subject the peoples to the war machine? From, what source alone can the peoples secure relief? What measures are now being taken to bring that relief? U 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What warning has been given to those responsible for present conditions? What effect has it produced? What is to be the result? What message is now due to go to tlie peoples of the world? What is meant by the phrase “Messianic kingdom”? What blessings will it bring to the peoples? fl 8-10.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>FREEDOM FOR</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">G</span><span class="font5">OD made of one blood all nations of men to dwell upon the earth and gave to them equal rights. Foreknowing the evil influence that would be exercised over all governments of men, God foretold that a small minority would rule and oppress the great majority ; that during that period of oppression and suffering the peoples would desire freedom and a righteous government administered for the general welfare of all; that they would be disappointed and suffer; that the cries of the peoples would ascend unto God and in his due time he would hear them; that he would deliver the peoples from the oppressor into full freedom and give to them a government of righteousness under which they shall enjoy peace, prosperity, and the blessings of life. Therefore he caused his prophets to write concerning the present time these words: that “the Lord . . . hath prepared his throne for judgment: and he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness. The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble” (Psalm 9: 7-9); and “a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment”.—Isaiah 32:1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Only by the Lord’s arrangement can freedom come to the peoples. God’s due time has now come when the peoples of earth must know the truth concerning the cause of suffering and the remedy for relief. All true Christians are doing their part to tell these facts to the peoples, that God’s name might be glorified and that the peoples might know that their freedom is near.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“CHRISTENDOM”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> The foremost nations of the world jointly call themselves “Christendom”. The rulers by this, term claim that they are Christians, having and exercising faith in God and in Christ, and that their combined governments constitute “organized Christianity”. The claim is not</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>THE PEOPLES</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">only untrue, but it is fraudulent and hypocritical. By such false and hypocritical claim the multitudes of peoples have long been held in bondage and have been deprived of their just rights and privileges. God’s due time has come for “organized Christianity”, so-called, to be placed before the people in the proper light.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> There is a true Christianity composed of faithful men and women who unselfishly follow in the footsteps of Christ. There is an organized system called “Christianity” or “Christendom” which is false and is the instrument of oppression wielded by the hand of the Devil. Jehovah through Christ established true Christianity on the earth, and in the days of the apostles it progressed. A few ambitious men, influenced and directed by Satan, defiled true Christianity; and their fraudulent course has made Christianity as it is generally understood a stench in the nostrils of honest men. This exact condition God foretold through his prophet Jeremiah (2: 20), who wrote concerning professed Christianity: “Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed; how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?”—Jeremiah 2: 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> “Organized Christianity” or “Christendom” today is Satan’s organization fraudulently parading under the name of Christ. Early in the history of man the Devil caused men to call themselves by the name of the Lord and to thereby bring reproach upon God. That same Devil has caused ambitious and selfish men to organize and carry on what is now called “organized Christianity”. The purpose is to deceive the peoples, turn them away from the true God, and to keep them in subjection to a selfish and unrighteous system of government of which Satan is the invisible overlord. (2 Corinthians 4: 3, 4) A government that oppresses the multitudes of the common people, and shows special favors to the wealthy, is an unrighteous government and therefore an ungodly nation. Such could not in truth be called Christ’s kingdom or Christendom. It is therefore apparent that when the name of Christ is given to an un-righeous and oppressive government that name is fraudulently so used and for a wrongful purpose.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO RULES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> The kings and presidents of the nations are not in fact the rulers. They are ordinary men filling their respective places and are mere symbols of rulership. The ruling power behind the seat of authority that shapes the course of the nations of “Christendom” is Satan the Devil. He is the opponent of God and the enemy and oppressor of men. Satan’s invisible instruments are those selfish men who combine and form a system of government which rules and controls the peoples. The three classes of men that make up these ruling powers are, to wit, high financiers, called “big business”; professional politicians, called “statesmen”; and the orthodox clergy, called “religious leaders”, who manufacture and dispense religion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> These three classes in combination constitute the small minority that rules. Disregarding the obligations laid upon them the selfish men composing the ruling minority have lived wantonly and recklessly for their own pleasure and at the expense of the multitudes. For a long time the peoples have borne them up and supported them and thereby endured great suffering and sorrow. And now I submit the testimony of their own witness which proves beyond a doubt that “organized Christianity” so-called is a fraud and deception, a great system of oppression, and a menace to the general welfare of the peoples.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HIGH FINANCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> The multitudes, in the sweat of their faces, produce the wealth of the world. High financiers are few in number but great in power. They produce no wealth, but obtain it through fraud and deceit practised upon the peoples and then use it for their own wicked pleasure and to oppress the multitudes and to keep them under control. High finance fixes the price at which the producer must sell his products to the distributer, and also fixes an exorbitant price which the consumer must pay to the distributer. High finance has established chain stores all over “Christendom”; and the producer must sell to these stores at a ridiculously- low price or not sell at all; and the stores in turn sell to the consumer at exorbitantly high prices, which the consumer must pay or starve. The producer gets but little; the consumer pays much; and the high financiers, that produce nothing, reap enormous and unreasonable profits. The result is that the small merchant is pushed to the wall, and the chain stores do the business, and the peoples pay the bills.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> The financial records in the United States Treasury’s office disclose that in one year (1919) seventeen woolen mills made a clear profit of 100 percent on their capital stock; that corporations operating canning factories that can the fruit and vegetables produced by the hard labor of others in one year made a profit of 2932 percent; that clothing stores made a profit in one year of 9826 percent; that the aluminum trust with a capital of only $20,000 in one year (1923) made a profit of 1000 percent.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The wealth of America is constantly on the increase but today in that land there are 524 banks less in number than there were six years ago. The large ones are swallowing up the smaller ones. “Big Finance” is taking possession of all. Kirby Page is authority for the statement that 20,000 men control practically every bank, trust company, and business enterprise in America. From Samuel Untermeyer, the distinguished American lawyer who for a long time represented “Big Business”, I quote:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> There has been greater concentration of the Money Power In the past five or ten years . . . than In the preceding fifty years. The process of absorption is likely to continue until a few groups absolutely... dominate the financial situation of the country. ... It has come to pass that less than a doz; n men in the City of New York are for all practical purposes in control of the direction of at least 75 percent of the deposits of the leading trust companies and banks in the city and of allied institutions in various parts of the country.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> The Federal Trade Commission in America in 1922 reported that six corporations then controlled one-third of the American water power, eight corporations controlled more than three-fourths of the anthracite coal fields, and two corporations controlled the greater portion of the iron-ore reserve.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> These heartless corporations profit in the lives of human beings. To them the life of man is nothing except to be used for their selfish purpose. Recently it was disclosed that forty percent of the milk sold in New York City is adulterated, and that with the connivance of the Public Board of Health. It is then sold at a large profit to the poor, and the babes and the sick and the afflicted suffer by reason thereof.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> These facts and figures I am giving as they relate to 'America. Other nations of “Christendom”, or “organized Christianity”, are equally as bad and many of them much worse. In every nation of “Christendom” the minority is favored and the great majority oppressed and suffer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">STATESMEN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> The so-called statesmen of the nations are those who hold the offices and feed at the public trough upon the fat of the land, and of course produce nothing. Their jobs depend upon obedience to high finance. In fact high finance is the bulwark of “organized Christianity” so-called, and its power and influence has corrupted the politicians of every nation. The politicians are the men that make and enforce the laws.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Before the last American Congress a bill was pending to build a great dam at Boulder Canyon, in the Colorado River, for the purposes of reclaiming millions of acres of arid lands and to produce electric power for the benefit of the public. Josiah T. Newcomb, solicitor for Big Business that opposed the bill, declared:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">I represent an investment of nine billion dollars, and we do not propose to let the government enter Into the power business at Boulder. The bill has no chance to pass. It will not pass as it is.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> It did not pass. More than 120 million American cannot reclaim the arid lands of the desert and produce electric power for their own use without the consent of a few heartless men who are known as “Big Business”. This gang of highwaymen are a part of “organized Christianity” so-called.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> The corrupting hand of “Big Business” has been laid upon men in high political positions and corrupted every department of every government of “Christendom”. Senator Reed, of the United States Senate, recently declared in a public address: “The time has come when the people should rise up and drive out the leprosy of corruption which has spread through the nation’s capital.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>la</sup> The peoples go through a form of election supposedly to select their public servants. But most of these political statesmen are elected and controlled by the defiling influence of “Big Business”. From Mr. Justice Ford, long in public life and who speaks with authority, I quote:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> In my experience I have found the public service corporations, the street railroad, the telephone, the lighting companies in particular, to be the most prolific source of political corruption in the state. They are more directly dependent upon governmental favors than any others, and Indeed the profits of their business flow from the special privileges which they procure and hold from the government, both state and municipal. In my day at Albany these corporations plied their nefarious business of corrupting the people’s representatives so openly that a blind deaf-mute could learn what was going on. Not that legal evidence could be found against them. They were too shrewd for that. But every public man there was morally certain as to what was going on, and in private conversation it was freely talked about. These public service corporations pollute the very fountains of public virtue; they debauch our public servants; they subsidize party organizations for their own purposes. All the powers of government are subverted to their base ends; and government of the people, by the people, for the people, is made a mockery.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> Even the courts are corrupted by “Big Business”. When “Big Business” is pitted against the common people, the people have no show in the courts. The words of Mr. Untermeyer are pertinent on this point:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> Nowhere is our social fabric is the discrimination between the rich and the poor so emphasized to the average citizen as at the bar of justice. Nowhere should it be less. . . . Money secures the ablest and most adroit counsel. . . . Evidence can be gathered from every source. The poor must be content to forego all these advantages.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2S</sup> When “Big Business” desires to increase its holdings and war seems to be advantageous to its selfish interests, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font5">does not hesitate to provoke war between the peoples </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">different nations. At the bidding of “Big Finance” tile politicians enact the necessary conscription laws which compel the common people from all parts of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Christendom” to </span><span class="font5">kill each other, while the repr^senta-tives of “Big Business” and their allies hide in their holes. When the war is over millions of the common people sleep in the dust of the earth, and within the brief period of blood and carnage there has been born another crop of millionaires, and then there follows greater lawlessness amongst the politicians than ever before. Upon this point a member of the United States Senate, Mr. Norris, is quoted:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> The millions of our youth who went into that orgy of murder were promised a new and better order of things. Here, ten years later, they can see special privilege and the power of money more securely enthroned than ever in the seats of the mighty. For the thousands of our young men killed, for our billions spent, for the countless millions of heartaches, we have what? We have political corruption such as was never dreamed of before.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> These conscienceless politicians defiled by “Big Business” and the oppressors of the people constitute a part of “organized Christianity”, or “Christendom” so-called, that rule and control the peoples.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE CLERGY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>26</sup> Who are the responsible ones for naming the harsh, cruel and paternalistic governments “Christendom” or “organized Christianity”? I answer: The clergy of the various denominations. Ambitious for the approval and plaudits of men and with a desire to live in ease and comfort they have joined affinity with “Big Business” and professional politicians. The clergy pose before the peoples as representatives of God and of his Christ, and hypocritically induce the peoples to believe that they are Christians, and at the same time go exactly contrary to the Word of God. Jesus declared that Satan the Devil is the prince or ruler of this world and that he is the opponent of God. (John 14: 30) Again in 2 Corinthians 4:3,4 it is written that Satan is the god of this evil world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> The world means organized forms of government under the supervision of the invisible overlord, Satan the Devil. In God’s Word it is written (James 4:4) that he who is a friend of the world is the enemy of God. The clergy have voluntarily become a part of the world and friends thereof, and therefore the enemies of God and of Christ and the enemies and oppressors of the common peoples. They call themselves and their allies “Big Business” and professional politicians “organized Christianity” or “Christendom”, and have the effrontery to claim that these rule by divine right.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2S</sup> In God’s Word true religion is defined in these words: “to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.” Contrary to this plain statement of the Word of God the clergy not only fail to comfort the widows and orphans but they advocate war, preach men into the trenches to die, and thereby make millions of widows and more millions of fatherless children. Instead of keeping themselves unspotted from the world they are literally spotted all over by the world, because they are a part of it. In the recent World War their church edifices were recruiting stations and almost every clergyman advocated the shedding of human blood. For this reason God, through his prophet, says of and concerning them now: “Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents; I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.” (Jeremiah </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2:</span><span class="font5"> 34) What class of men wear skirts except the preachers or clergy? They are the guilty ones.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> Upon this point I submit the following indisputable facts: Admiral Fiske during the World War said: “The Christian religion is at this moment being made to exert a powerful influence, not toward peace but toward war.” Secretary of War Lane said: “The war could not have been won without the churches.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> Christ, whose name these clergymen have fraudulently assumed and by which they have named their “organized Christianity”, said: “Thou shalt not kill.” But the clergymen are the most ardent advocates of war and the most vehement and vindictive in their expressions against their fellow men. Before America entered the World War an election for mayor in the City of New York was being held. One candidate was opposed to America entering the war. The distinguished clergyman, Doctor van Dyke, on that occasion said: “I’d hang everyone, whether or not he be a candidate for mayor, who lifts his voice against America entering the war.” And this is a sample of the dispensers of religion from “organized Christianity”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> Rev. Chas. Gauster from his American pulpit “advocated the organization of an association to murder those persons who do not stand up when the Star Spangled Banner is played”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> The clergymen of Germany told the people that they represented the same God and the same Christ that the clergymen of England and America represented. Although Christ is the Prince of Peace, and declares against killing, the clergymen of Germany urged their people to kill in the most fiendish manner the common people of the allied armies of Britain. Likewise the clergymen of the British and their allies urged the killing of the German people and her allies, and the clergymen of both sides tried to induce the people to believe that they are Christians. In proof that the clergymen are a part of the world and the allies of “Big Business”, that makes war, I read the testimony of the Rev. George Parkin Atwater, to wit:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> The complete representative of the American Church in France is the United States Army overseas. Yes, an army, with its cannon and rifles and machine-guns, and its instruments of destruction. The Church militant, sent, morally equipped, strengthened and encouraged, approved and blessed, by the Church at home. The army is the Church in action, transforming the will of the Church into deeds, expressing the moral judgment of the Church in smashing blows. Its worship has its vigil In the trenches, and its fasts and feasts; Its prayers are in acts, and Its choir is the crash of cannon and the thrilling ripple of machine guns.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> Doctor Newell Dwight Hillis, pastor of Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, was one of the most vehement advocates of America entering the World War. Did he act upon the authority of Christ? No; not Hillis. The American Bankers Association commissioned him as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">missionary to Europe. He did the bidding of that heartless and cruel financial association. He prepared the sermons which hundreds of thousands of other pastors throughout America delivered, advocating war, urging the young men into the trenches, and the people to buy bonds.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> Doctor Hillis was not content with urging men into the jaws of death by which he earned and drew his pay from the American Bankers Association, but went to the extreme in expressing his malice. When the war had ended, instead of visiting the widows and the fatherless and bringing them comfort, as Christ had commanded, Hillis still breathing vengeance of blood against an unfortunate and helpless people wrote:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>36</sup> Society has organized itself against the rattlesnake and the yellow fever. Shepherds have entered into a conspiracy to exterminate the wolves. The Boards of Health are planning to wipe out typhoid, cholera and the black plague. Not otherwise, lovers of their fellow man have Anally become perfectly hopeless with reference to the German people. They have no more relation to the civilization of 1918 than an orang-outang, a gorilla, a Judas, a hyena, a thumbscrew, or a scalping knife in the hands of a savage. These brutes must be cast out of society, . . . There will shortly be held a meeting of surgeons in this country. A copy of the preliminary call lies before me. The plan to be discussed is based upon the Indiana State law. That law authorizes a State Board of Surgeons to use upon the person of confirmed criminals and hopeless idiots the new painless method of sterilizing the men. These surgeons are preparing to advocate the calling of a world conference to consider the sterilization of 10,000,000 German soldiers and the segregation of their women, that when this generation of Germans goes, civilized cities, states and races may be rid of this awful cancer that must be cut clean out of the body of society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>37</sup> No general, no man in the army nor any war lord ever gave utterance to such diabolical and wicked words as those written by Hillis.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> These clergymen are the ones who, with pious faces and sanctimonious words, tell the peoples that their organized system of oppression and murder represents Christ on earth, and therefore constitutes “organized Christianity” or “Christendom”. They have been defaming the name of God and of Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>39</sup> A </span><span class="font5">few ultra-selfish men constitute “Big Business”, and they control the commerce of the world. They do it by the power of money unjustly wrung from the hands of the multitudes of toilers. They control the elections because the politicians elected to office enact and enforce such laws as they want. They own and control the public press, and publish only what they desire the peoples to read. This lecture I am now giving will not be published by them, because they do not want the peoples to hear it. The radio, which God has brought to light for the benefit of the peoples, the same selfish interest is now seeking to control.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> The same power controls the clergy and uses them for selfi.h purposes. In time of war they use the clergy as recruiting officers to hurry men into the jaws of death. This is the unholy alliance that hypocritically calls itself by the name of Christ and has induced the peoples to believe that it is the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth. On the contrary the Scriptures declare this unholy alliance to be a part of Babylon and of the Devil’s organization. All nations have been made blind drunk by its false representations and teachings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup> Now the unholy alliance is pursuing a systematic campaign to amalgamate the common people of all “Christendom” into great military organizations. The false slogan of the World War was, that it would “make the world safe for democracy”. Every sane man knows that it destroyed democracy. “Big Business” and its allies now hope to hold the common people in subjection by making them a part of the harsh and cruel war machine. Succeeding in this the Devil, in his ghoulish glee, and to the reproach of God and Christ, would say: “This is Christendom, or organized Christianity.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BURDEN BEARERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> The unholy alliance called “Christendom”, or “organized Christianity”, for its support and maintenance depends upon the multitudes of the common peoples. It holds up the peoples and robs them of their-just rights and the fruits of their honest labors. Without the consent of the multitudes of peoples the poor are forced to fight and to kill their fellow man without a just cause or excuse. This “organized Christianity”, fraudulently so-called, has caused the common peoples to bear great burdens of unjust taxation in order that the few might live wantonly and recklessly. It has caused the peoples to bear the burdens of war that a few might gratify their selfish desires.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> The multitudes of suffering ones, with bent bodies and broken hearts, have gone into untimely graves. Those not supporting the unholy alliance are told by the clergy that to them death is but the opening of the gates of a burning hell wherein their torture will never end.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HOPE1.ESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup> The great desire of the peoples is for peace and prosperity and life in a state of happiness. It is now apparent that there is no hope of the people’s realizing their desires by anything that “organized Christianity” can give them. “Organized Christianity” or “Christendom” instead of being the friend and benefactor of the multitudes is the enemy and oppressor of the common peoples. With great pomp and glory that unholy system rides upon the backs of the peoples. Without the support of the common peoples that wicked system called “Christendom” could not survive. When the peoples withdraw their support therefrom “organized Christianity”, which is a part of Babylon or the Devil’s organization, will fall like a great millstone into the sea.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GOD THE PEOPLES’ FRIEND</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> There is one' true and Almighty God. Jehovah of Hosts is his name. He is the Friend and Benefactor of man. Through his Christ and his kingdom of righteousness he will grant to the honest peoples of earth their heart’s desire.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> God created the first man perfect. Because man violated God’s law he was sentenced to death. Thereafter his children were born; hence they were born sinners and imperfect and without the right to life. (Romans 5:12; Psalm 51:5) God in his loving kindness promised to produce a seed through which all the nations of the earth shall be blessed. (Genesis 22:18-22) Then he made it clear that Christ is that promised “seed” and that there is no other name whereby men can be saved. ■—Galatians 3 : 16-19 ; Acts 4:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>47</sup> God so loved the world of mankind that he sent his beloved Son to earth and permitted him to die that man might have an opportunity to live. (John 3: 16) Jesus Christ died for all men, and all men must know that fact in God’s due time.—Hebrews 2: 9 ; 1 Tim. 2: 3-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> Christ means the Anointed One of God, the Messiah, the One appointed by Jehovah through whom the promised blessings must come to the peoples. For the purpose of deceiving the peoples and turning their minds away from God and his gracious provision for their blessings, Satan the Devil organized the false and wicked system made up of “Big Business”, professional politicians, and faithless preachers, and calls it by the name of “organized Christianity” or “Christendom”. That wicked system now controls and for a long time has controlled and oppressed the common peoples of the nations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>49</sup> By his Word God discloses that he would not interfere with Satan’s nefarious work until the end of the world, at which time Christ Jesus, his beloved Son and earth’s rightful King, should come into possession of the affairs of man and rule and bless the peoples of the earth. That world ended with 1914, and according to the Lord’s prophecy was marked by the World War, famine, pestilence, revolutions, return of the Jews to Palestine, and by general distress and perplexity now existing on earth. (Matthew 24: 3-22; Luke 21:10-26) A period of time elapses from the beginning of sorrows, which marks the end of the world, until the final end thereof, during which the message of the kingdom must be proclaimed to the peoples.—Matthew 24: 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>50</sup> Now God has set his Son Christ upon his throne, as foretold by his prophet in the Second Psalm, and bids all the nations and peoples of earth to hear and obey him. The old world has ended, and God’s kingdom is at hand. The rulers of the earth were duly served with notice of this fact a year ago. The unholy alliance has received due notice thereof. But instead of heeding the message from the Word of God the rulers of the world, to wit, those constituting the unholy alliance, walk on in dark ness and continue to oppress the peoples. The doom of “organized Christianity” or Babylon is sealed! The groans and cries of the peoples oppressed by that wicked system have ascended up to the God of heaven. To the oppressors composing that evil system the great Jehovah now says:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>51</sup> “Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.”—James 5:1-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>52</sup> The day of Ged’s vengeance is at hand, and he will punish that wicked system calling itself “organized Christianity” because it has oppressed the common peoples.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>53</sup> A city is a symbol of an organization. The unholy organization called “Christendom”, or “organized Christianity”, in the Scriptures is called a “city”. To that wicked city God now says: “For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts. ... A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth: for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations; he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, ra th the Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind [of trouble] shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried: they shall be dung upon the ground. Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished: and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.”—Jeremiah 25:29, 31-35.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">“The World War stopped in 1918 in order that notice might be given to the peoples of earth concerning the name of Jehovah God and his purposes toward men. That witness has been in progress during the past eight years. Notice has been served upon the world powers, and now notice is being served upon all the common peoples. Jesus declared that when this witness is done, and because the ruling powers will not heed the same, there shall come upon the world the greatest time of trouble ever known and it shall be the last.—Matthew 24:14, 21, 22.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>65</sup> Millions of honest people who are now held in subjection to “organized Christianity”, but who are meek and willing to be taught, are asking, What shall we do ? To such Jehovah now says: “Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment: seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.”—Zephaniah 2: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>66</sup> The Word of God and the physical facts prove that “organized Christianity” or “Christendom” is a failure. She is even worse than that. She is a menace to peace and prosperity. She is an instrument of Satan the Devil. Abandon her, and flee from her as rats flee from a sinking ship. She is sinking into oblivion, never again to rise. She is going down in a time of trouble such as never before was known. To the people the Lord now says therefore: “Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.”—Revelation 18:4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE BLESSINGS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>57</sup> The ruins of Satan’s false system cleared away, there shall arise a new heaven and new earth wherein dwells righteousness, according to God’s promise. (2 Peter 3: 13) That righteous government shall rest upon the shoulder of Christ Jesus, the Prince of Peace. His name shall be called by the people Wonderful Counsellor because he will guide them in the right way; he shall be called the Everlasting Father because he will give life to the peoples. And of his peace and blessings there shall be no end.—Isaiah 9: 6, 7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WARS TO CEASE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>58</sup> The curse that war has laid upon the peoples will then be lifted for ever. Never again shall there be war between the peoples of the nations. Under the reign of the righteous Messiah the peoples of the nations shall beat their instruments of war into farming implements, and nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.—Isaiah 2: 2-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>59</sup> A lion is a symbol of the Devil, and a ravenous beast is a symbol of the Devil’s organization on earth, made up of the cruel “Big Business”, big politicians, and big preachers. God, through his prophet, promises that in the kingdom of Messiah there shall be no lion or ravenous beast, because the Devil will not be permitted to operate. He will have no cruel financiers, nor professional politicians, nor any hypocritical preachers to do his bidding. The people shall dwell together in safety and follow that which is right.—Isaiah 35: 9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>60</sup> The poor will no longer be oppressed. In the courts they will have fair and equitable consideration; because it is written that “with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth”.—Isaiah 11:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>61</sup> Under the righteous reign of Messiah no cruel corporation can own the houses in which the people dwell, nor compel them to pay exorbitant rents. The people shall build their own houses and live in them and plant their own vineyards and eat the fruit thereof, and no one shall make them afraid.—Micah 4: 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>62</sup> Now the poor cry for bread, and the rulers give them a stone; they cry for a fish, and the clergy give them a fiery serpent. Under the righteous reign of Messiah there shall be a great feast of fat things spread for all the people, and they shall eat and rejoice. No hypocritical preachers will be permitted then to operate with bootleggers and take away from the people the proper use of win&amp;and themselves use it unlawfully.—Isa. 25: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>63</sup> Under the righteous reign of Messiah clergymen will no more be permitted to frighten the people and keep them in ignorance of the truth. Then the knowledge of the glory of the Lord shall fill the whole earth as the waters now fill the sea; and every man will know the Lord and his righteous way, from the least to the greatest; and that knowledge will be free.—Habakkuk 2: 14; Jeremiah 31: 34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>64</sup> In that righteous government here on earth no more can men called doctors practise on the people and hide their mistakes in the graveyard, because then the Lord will lead the people in the right way and bring unto them peace and health and cure them of all their ailments until no more shall any man say, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font5"> am sick.”—Jeremiah 33:6; Isaiah 33: 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>65</sup> It shall then be if a man who has been wicked shall turn away from his wickedness and do right and obey the Lord he shall live and shall never die. ( EzeLh'l 18: 27, 28) That is the time of which Jesus spoke when he said: “If a man keep my saying, he shall never sec death” (John 8: 51); “Whosoever liveth, and believeth in me, shall never die.”—John 11: 26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>(1</sup> ° In that time old men shall return to the days of their youth, and their flesh shall become fresher than that of a child. (Job 33:25) Then God will restore to perfection of body and mind all the obedient ones on the earth until the earth is filled with a happy, joyful and vigorous people.—Acts 3:19-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>07</sup> Seeing that God has in store these marvelous blessings for the people through the kingdom of Christ it is easy to see why the Devil has orgonized a false system called “Christendom” or “organized Christianity”, by which system hypocritically he deceives the people and turns their minds away from God’s provision.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>68</sup> God’s kingdom of righteousness is at hand. The evidence shows that the day of restitution has come in which the obedient ones of mankind shall be granted full freedom and restored to the perfection of body enjoyed in Eden. Therefore with confidence it can now be stated that millions of people now on the earth will never die.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>69</sup> The people desire peace, freedom, prosperity, life and happiness. All thinking persons must now see these can come only from God’s kingdom through Christ. They can never be realized by or through the false system called “organized Christianity”. The hypocritical and evil course of “Christendom” is an insult to God and to Christ. It is the deceiver and oppressor of the people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">It is completely under the control of Satan the Devil. It depends for its support and maintenance upon the multitude of peoples, while at the same time it continues to defraud and oppress the people. Let the multitudes of peoples completely and entirely withdraw all support morally, financially, and otherwise from “Christendom” or “organized Christianity” so-called. Let them give their heart’s devotion and allegiance entirely to God and to Christ, the Prince of Peace, who is now earth’s rightful King. Let them dwell together in peace, and do good to each other, and be ready to receive the blessings which God has in reservation for those who love and obey him. The day of complete freedom is at hand !</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>70</sup> The peoples should therefore for ever abandon and forsake “organized Christianity” called “Christendom” and turn their hearts and minds and their allegiance wholly to God and his Christ for the following reasons, to wit:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>71</sup> (1) Because “Christendom” is the Devil’s organization operated by him to keep the people in subjection.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>72</sup> (2) Because it is an instrument of oppression which has been used to make the burdens of men grievous to be borne.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>73</sup> (3) Because it is false, hypocritical, and wicked, and against the interests of the multitudes of the peoples.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>74</sup> (4) Because it holds out absolutely no hope for the betterment of the peoples.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>75</sup> (5) Because God’s time has come when that evil and hypocritical system shall be destroyed in the greatest time of trouble the world has ever known.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>76</sup> (6) Because God commands all the peoples who love him to flee from that unrighteous system of so-called “organized Christianity” and thereby escape the dire calamities that shortly shall befall her.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>77</sup> (7) Because God has set his anointed King, Christ Jesus the Messiah, upon his throne, and bids all the peoples of earth to hear and obey him; and those who so do shall receive and for ever enjoy the blessings of complete freedom, everlasting peace, prosperity, life, liberty and happiness.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark11"></a>MICAH CHAMPIONS THE OPPRESSED</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">----November</span><span class="font5"> 20—</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Micah, chapters </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2,</span><span class="font5"> 3, 6, 7:1-6----</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“He hath showed thee, 0 man, what is good; and what doth Jehovah require of thee, hut to do justly, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with thy God?”—Micah 6: 8, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font5">S OUR previous studies have shown, the Prophet Micah was a messenger of Jehovah to Samaria and Jerusalem, that is, to both the northern and southern kingdoms, during the days of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. He was therefore a contemporary of Isaiah; but, unlike Isaiah, whose work was in Jerusalem, Micah’s was more general in that it was addressed to Samaria as well as Jerusalem.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> This prophet addresses both houses of Israel as children of Jacob because both were in covenant relationship with God. In this respect his prophecy is closely related to Isaiah’s prophecies in the second part of his book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Micah begins his prophecy as Isaiah begins his. He calls all the people to listen; he lifts his voice and bids the earth, and all that therein is, to hearken. He declares that the Lord God is witness against his people. Also like Isaiah after his vision of the Lord in the temple (See Isaiah, chapter 6.) Micah speaks of the Lord witnessing from his temple. He sees Jehovah coming forth out of his place of judgment, stepping on the high places of the earth, and the mountains melting under him and pouring forth into the valleys as waters that are poured down a steep place. The cause of this action on Jehovah’s part is the transgression of Jacob and the sins of the house of Israel. Jehovah comes to judgment to stop the unrighteousness which is destroying his people. Micah foretells the desolation of Samaria, a desolation of the northern kingdom which should come even unto the gate of Jerusalem.—Micah 1:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">* The moral condition of the people at this time was so bad that Micah says of them, “They covet fields and take them by violence. . . . They defraud a man of his house, even a man of his heritage.” Micah says that the people “devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand”. He therefore speaks unto them as a message from Jehovah, “Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily : for this time is evil.” If the people devise evil, seeking how they can get gain to themselves at another’s expense, by force or by craftiness, the Lord will answer by a similar action; and the prophet presents Jehovah as devising evil against them.—Micah 2:1-3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> The sadness of the situation in Israel, whether of the northern or the southern kingdom, at that time was that they were making so much profession of rev^-erc-’ for Jehovah. The Prophet Amos had been raised up this same period to denounce the sinfulness of the worship of the golden calf at Bethel; and Jerusalem was so filled with profession of service for Jehovah that, through Isaiah, Jehovah said of the sacrifices offered that he was weary to bear them.—Isaiah 1:11,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Also, like Isaiah, Micah tells the people that they cannot approach Jehovah to be acceptable to him by means of multiplying their sacrifices; the more they multiplied them the further they got from truth and righteousness. Micah asks the question, “Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God ? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?” (Micah 6: 6, 7) He answers the question which he has put into the mouths of those who ask him how they may approach God to be accepted of him: “He hath showed thee, 0 man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God ?”—Micah 6: 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> The sacrifices of Israel were ordered by the Lord. Why then should sacrificing become so obnoxious to him? The answer is that the Israelites greatly multiplied their sacrifices, making profession thereby of adoration to Jehovah; but they did it for outward show, and such could not be other than obnoxious. To do this was using God’s own method and taking advantage of him by it. Today an ever increasing number of professed Christians consider the sacrifices which Jehovah himself ordained in Israel as obnoxious. They deride the idea that the sacrifices of the Old Testament could have been instituted by the God they profess to worship; the idea of sacrifice, they say, is Jewish and crude. But this is of necessity as obnoxious to Jehovah as Israel’s multiplication was. Israel’s sacrifices were hypocrisy; Christendom’s lack is another form of pride.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Micah’s reference to the giving of the firstborn for transgression, in order to appease an angry God or make supplication to an indifferent one, is probably taken from the terrible incident when the king of Moab offered his firstborn to supplicate his god at the time when the Israelites under Jehoram and Amaziah were pressing him sorely in warfare. (2 Kings 3:27) That which God will have is not sacrifice, as such, however valuable may be the animal sacrificed or at whatever cost to oneself the sacrifice is made, even though it were as if a firstborn son were offered. That which God will have is righteousness as between man and man, and humility as between men and God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> In the standard which men set in their philosophies, the conduct which commends itself to them is, “To do justly and love mercy”; to be just and compassionate. But man of himself will not take in Micah’s third word, “Walk humbly with thy God.” No man of himself can reach to Micah’s standard; for it is the standard of perfection. Nor can there be any possibility of anyone’s reaching it except by accepting the fact that man of himself cannot approach God; that it was necessary for God to make one great sacrifice for sin in order that a way of reconciliation might be made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> It is only after Christ came that Micah’s word could begin to be truly fulfilled. Then the holy spirit came as a power in the hearts and minds of those who consecrated themselves to God through Jesus Christ, and the spirit of truth worked in them. The same will happen in a different way, and to a different end, when the reign of Christ has begun, and men are taught to do justly, and love mercy, and to walk humbly in the way of salvation, which will be walking with God, because they will want tobeinharmony with their Creator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Micah addresses the leaders of the people. He says, “Hear, I pray you, 0 heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel.” He denounces them for the wrong that they have done to his people. He further addresses those who have spoken to the people as if they were prophets of Jehovah. He says, “Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth and cry, Peace”; and he says of these that those of the people “that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him”, because of this, night shall come upon them and they not have a vision. Everything will be dark to them. He says, “The sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them. Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners be confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.” It is a terrible denunciation. The leaders of the people have erred, but the people themselves are to blame for allowing such a condition to obtain. Of himself he declares, “But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the Lord, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.”—Micah 3:1, 5-8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> These strong words of denunciation have an application again in the present day, and they are specially so intended. They are exactly suited to the conditions which now obtain in Christendom in ecclesiastical circles. These things in Israel did not “just happen”. The truth is, of course, that God arranged his people, and allowed these circumstances in Israel to develop that there might be in them pictures of the far greater things which were to happen in these days when Christendom is bringing forth its fruits so that God might have a witness to himself, and that his people might know what to do. Now these words of Scripture are put into their mouths as God originally put them in the mouths of his prophets. Those who by the holy spirit read, that is, understand the words of the prophets, have a commission of Jehovah to speak in this their day as Micah and the other prophets had in their days.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> Like all the other holy prophets Micah is a prophet of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">restitution. In</span><span class="font5"> the earlier phrases of the 4th chapter he quotes from Isaiah, telling how in the last days the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established; how the nations will see the house of Jacob restored, and they themselves will learn to care for each other. Micah tells that then the people shall sit every man under his vine and fig-tree, and none shall make them afraid.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Again like Isaiah, for it is evident that it was the purpose of God through the holy spirit to have these two prophets helping each other in their work and giving the united testimony to Israel, Micah tells of God gathering a remnant out of Israel. The remnant passes through a period of pain and labor, but the Lord brings it forth into strength and activity. Addressing these as a new-born people Micah says, “Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.” The enemies of the Lord’s servants intend to do them damage; they want to see Zion scattered and desolated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> But the Lord has gathered these people together who oppose him, in order that he might do a work upon them. Now comes the word of the Lord to the Zion class through Micah, “Arise, and thresh, 0 daughter of Zion; for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thine hoofs brass; and thou shalt beat in pieces many people; and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Mieah 4:11-13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Micah ends his prophecy on a very comforting note. Looking back over the failings of Israel, and their many transgressions and their sins, and his word applies not only to the house of Israel and to Judah to whom he spoke, but to all God’s people at this time, for whom indeed his message of prophecy is specially intended, he says, “Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage?” (Micah 7:18) Micah sees in vision God’s Israel gathered to him, and his truth to Jacob, and the me^cy promised to Abraham fulfilled.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> Here is a picture of God gathering his Israel to himself. In these days he is sending his truth abroad fbr this expressed purpose, and is proving before the world that his truth made known concerning the setting up of his kingdom does gather a people to him. Then as soon as this present work is done there is his ancient people Israel according to the flesh to be gathered; and so the Abrahamic promise as it relates to the selection of a seed for the purpose of blessing all the families of the earth will be made good.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">QUESTIONS FOR BEREAN STUDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When and where did the Prophet Micah live? To whom did he prophesy? What other prophet was his contemporary? How did their prophecies differ? fl 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whom did Micah address as “the children of Jacob”? Why? Compare and contrast Micah 1st chapter with Isaiah 6. 11 2, 3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">What made the sacrifices offered at that time especially obnoxious to Jehovah? Show how some in our day are equally obnoxious to God. Explain Micah’s reference to the first-born given for transgression. What is more acceptable to God than any sacrifice which man can offer? fl 7, 8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HE Prophet Isaiah is said to be the- son of Amoz. He prophesied in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, successive kings of Judah. His ministry must therefore have lasted a long time, probably for sixty years or more. A Jewish tradition says Amoz was the brother of Amaziah, king of Judah, in which case Isaiah would be close to those kings of Judah in whose reigns he was a special messenger for Jehovah. His writings disclose that he was intimate with the inner councils of the king, and was apparently influential at the court during those days. But another tradition says that Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, caused him to be sawn asunder; and it is thought that the words in the book of Hebrews that some were sawn asunder (Hebrews 11:37) are intended to refer to Isaiah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Isaiah was not the first of the writing prophets; but his long continuous ministry, the many things which he was caused to write, the greatness and the loftiness of his writings make him, if not the first in point of time, yet as if he were the father of the prophets of Israel. In this he corresponds with Abraham’s loftiness of faith and life as father of the patriarchs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Isaiah may be said to be specially used of God as the prophet of restitution; for though all the holy prophets since the world began foretold the times of restitution (See Acts 3:19-31.), yet Isaiah tells more than any other prophet of the work of the kingdom of righteousness which will bring its blessings to earth, when all men shall know the Lord; “for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.”— Isaiah 11: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> In Isaiah’s days Israel had grown richer than at any time save in the days of Solomon; but probably the wealth was more generally diffused amongst the people than in Solomon’s time. But the wealth had brought its dangers, both within and from without. The people grew lax or became hypocritical in their worship of Jehovah; and their prosperity drew the attention of the then great robber empire of Assyria, which ere long became God’s instrument of punishment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> In Hezekiah’s days the northern kingdom was fast hastening to that destruction which overtook it at the hand of Assyria. As the northern kingdom which had carried the name and sentiment of Israel was falling away from all respect to its covenant relationship with Jehovah, the Lord directed attention to the southern kingdom, which carried the traditions of David’s family and had in their midst the temple of Jehovah, and which henceforth was to be brought into more special prominence.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> The narrative shows that the southern kingdom, having the Davidic representative on the throne and having the temple of Jehovah with the Levites as priests, had presumed upon these things. God had taken from them the name of Israel, having given that to the northern kingdom; but Judah considered themselves as being greatly superior to their brothers of the northern tribes. The ten tribes fell into gross neglect of their covenant with Jehovah, and such sins as really broke the relationship between God and them; the southern kingdom, professing to hold ardently to their relationship with God, had become full of pride, and hypocrisy its close relation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> In the case of Israel open disrespect of the covenant took them from God and from the shelter of his covenant, even to the extent that he had them carried away from the land that he had given to their fathers, as if they were a dishonor to his name while yet they remained in that land.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Judah’s sin was of pride and hypocrisy, no less hurtful and dangerous to them. In these things we may see a reason why God makes two types, one by the northern kingdom, the other by the southern; one to show that open neglect of the covenant leads to death and destruction, the other to show that professed adherence to the covenant leads to pride, hypocrisy, and rottenness of heart, which is as destructive as open and flagrant disobedience.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> The long reign of Uzziah had brought prosperity to Judah, and apparently the service of the temple had become a very important item in the life of the people. There was exhibited in Judah then that which has been the constant experience of men, that a priesthood given liberty will magnify itself and become one of the most powerful and most dangerous factors in the life of any community. Probably it was because Uzziah thought that the priests were presuming on his prerogatives which started him in the terrible mistake of assuming his own right to minister in the temple, a mistake which left him a leper, a lasting mark of God’s displeasure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> It was at such a time that Isaiah, who would then be quite a young man, heard the voice of the Lord calling him, and received a message from Jehovah. It is contrary both to the apparent intent of Scripture and to its direct statements to say that men such as Isaiah spoke because they saw wrongness in the life of the people and, feeling strongly, declared that they spoke in the name of Jehovah. Even some Fundamentalists are now giving up the declarations of Scripture. To the critics the words of their prophecies are simply their own, which they thought would be what God would say if he spoke. There is no meeting point between these two positions: If the prophets spoke as other good men have spoken, theirs was not the word of Jehovah; and no authority can be accorded to their words.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Isaiah’s opening word is one of a vision wherein he heard Jehovah speaking, a word which according to the correspondency of the Scriptures indicates that the prophecy is not for Judah and Israel only, but for all the earth, as God shall make it apply. Jehovah calls heaven and earth to hear what he has to say. Speaking concerning his people Jehovah said, “I have nourished and brought up children, and they have have rebelled against me.” They had not even had that respect which in instinct makes the ox know his owner, and the ass his master’s crib. Israel whom he had nourished did not know him, nor had they any heart. He said, “Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.” There is a cause for this. Isaiah still speaking the words of Jehovah says, “Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil doers, children that are corrupters! they have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.”—Isaiah 1:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> Israel had not gained by their neglect of Jehovah. Though apparently prosperous and self-satisfied, the land was not prospering as it would have done had they been faithful to their covenant. The terrible picture of desolation described in verses 5 to 9 may not be understood as having special reference to the state of the kingdom of Judah at the time when Isaiah began his prophecies; but the people had suffered, for they had realized the ravages of desolating warfare, as when the northern kingdom under Joash had wrought much havoc in Judah (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font5"> Chronicles 25:13, 23.), and as when fhe Syrians had come against Judah and had done them much damage.—See 2 Chronicles 24: 23,24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> The words of Isaiah, however, should be taken as a prophecy of what the result of Israel’s sin would bring. The description, “The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it” (Isaiah 1:5, 6), should not be read as being a description of personal moral evil. The words are intended to describe the condition of the people and the land. God would have the people know that with all their much service they had not drawn nigh to him; and that unless he himself looked after his own interests, preserving to himself a remnant, their sins would have called for such retribution that God would have had to do with them as he had done with Sodom and Gomorrah, namely, blot them from the face of the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> As if the thought of the desolation of Sodom and Gomorrah quickened Isaiah’s mind, now he addressed his people abruptly; he says, “Ye rulers of Sodom; give ear ... ye people of Gomorrah.” (Isaiah 1:10) It was a terrible name for Israel; for Sodom and Gomorrah are set as outstanding examples of those who viciously seek self-indulgence; and Jude, using the Scriptural picture says that Sodom and Gomorrah are set forth for an example of those who suffer the vengeance of eternal fire, that is, of absolute destruction as unworthy of life. —Jude 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> Judah’s sin was in hypocrisy, making much profession, when at heart they were far from God. The prophet tells them from Jehovah that they spread forth their hands in vain, that he will hide his face from them. He will not hear their prayers. They must wash themselves and put away the evil of their doings. They must cease to do evil and learn righteousness. By caring for their poorer neighbors they will prove they love God. He bids them, therefore, to keep the law by relieving the oppressed, by judging the fatherless, and by pleading for the widow. Then, when they have thus proved that they would serve God with all their heart, and love their neighbors as themselves, they may come to him, and though their sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow. Failing this they shall be devoured.—Isa. 1:16-20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> All this is not only intended for the Israel of Isaiah’s day, but is written also for the time to come. Isaiah represents those who, in the days when God is bringing his judgment to pass, represent him, who are used as his servants. Judah and Israel represent the great masses of Christendom who, with the example of Israel according to the flesh before them, have fallen into hypocrisy deeper than they. The Christian world today has a reputation as a system of hypocrisy and shams.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> It has been commonly accepted by a very considerable section of the non-conformist clergy that they have a standing before the people similar to that of the prophets of Israel, and many of “their people” have accepted this claim to authority. Because of this they have thought it proper for them to enter the political fields and become ardent politicians. They have urged the people to vote for a measure which they have considered would conduce to good and wise legislation; and in local affairs they have tried to get municipal authorities to see to the welfare of the localities over which they are supposed to exercise some care.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> But all this is a mistake. The relationship of the clergy to the people is one assumed by them. The only thing which would allow them to begin to think this might be in harmony with the will of God would be if the peoples were in covenant relationship with God as Israel was. They are not. Israel was the only nation which ever enjoyed such a privilege. The spiritual nation composed of the true disciples of Jesus is no nation seen by men, and it has no connection with the government of earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>19</sup> The truth of the matter is that the words of rebuke and exhortation to repentance are addressed to God’s covenanted people, and in the correspondency they are addressed to the people who support Christendom. It is this great system of professed religion which is covered with sorbs from head to foot, and of which it is said that unless God had sought a remnant for himself the whole would have been swept away as Sodom and Gomorrah. God is getting his remnant class; and these are serving him as Isaiah did; and by this and through them God will be vindicated before the eyes of the world.</span></p></li></ul>

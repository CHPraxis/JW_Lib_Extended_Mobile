<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Militarism in the Land of Tarshish</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">THE Spanish &quot;Cavalier” has been and is the glory and the ruin of Spain. War, glory and ruin are the natural opposites of peace, happiness and prosperity. Militarism and eeclesiasticism, when combined, make the ideal form of misgovernment; and Spain has been blessed with all three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is apparent that Spain remained unoccupied until a few centuries prior to the beginning of the Christian era. Spanish history may be said to date only from the time of the Carthaginian invasion in 238 B. C. Prior to that time the Phoenicians had visited it for ore and had founded some settlements there, connected with the mining industry. Its name was then Tar-tessus or Tarshish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bomans occupied two hundred years in subjugating the country, completing the task about the time of the birth of our Lord. Constantine planted the Roman Catholic religion there. With the fall of the Roman Empire Spain was overrun with the Vandals, who named the southern part of Spain Vandalusia, now Andalusia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Vandals were in turn conquered by the Goths, who founded Gothalauia, now Catalonia, the most progressive and intelligent part of the whole Spanish peninsula. The Moors conquered Spain in the year 711 and for seven and a half centuries gave Spain the best government it has ever enjoyed. The Moors were driven out the year before the Spanish Jew, Columbus, crossed the Atlantic in search of the land discovered by Leif Ericson 500 years before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While the Moors ruled Spain the Christian religion was tolerated; and the Moslem cities of Cordova, Saragossa, Toledo, Valencia and Seville, became centers of education and culture. <sub>—</sub> The Moslem universities were the most advanced “ in Europe and attracted students of all faiths from all parts of the continent</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although the Moorish architecture of Spain is considered by many architects to be the finest in the world, representing the very highest grade of workmanship known, yet the presence of these intelligent Moslems was offensive to the popes; and year after year and century after century they urged on a war of extermination against them, which finally succeeded.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>The Rewards of Intolerance</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font7">HE rewards of intolerance have been what might have been expected. When the Moors were driven out, and with them the Jews, the best brains in the country disappeared; and &quot;There were left only the militarists, priests, aristocrats and other loafers who never, in any country, have been anything but a curse and a burden to the real citizens of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It followed naturally that cavorting around in armor, spear in hand, became the principal business of Spaniards; and in a modified form it is so today. Workers in any line, tradesmen, merchants, etc., were looked down upon. Butchers like Cortez and Pizarro became the heroes of the populace, and bullfights became the national pastime. Progress stopped dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another curious effect of the intolerance practised in the expulsion of the Jews, in July, 1493, is that a million Jews, unable to flee, accept the Roman Catholic religion; and today n&gt;\ <sup>l</sup>v percent of the Spanish people are so tho; ghly Jewish in appearance as to be readily mistaken for them. The dreaded Spanish Inquisition, intended to destroy the Jews, has / turned its authors into Jews themselves, at * least Jews in appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The crushing of Moors and Jews was the destruction. of Spain. The discoveries in the Western Hemisphere made Spain the mother of twenty nations; but she was unable to- hold them, because unable to give them a proper gov-</span><span class="font8">©rnment. The landslide of all Spanish America Siy </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">from</span><span class="font8"> the mother country took place in the t twenty-five years of the nineteenth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Triiddad, Uruguay, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Honduras, Costa Biea, Guatemala, Yuca</span><span class="font7">tan, San Salvador, Argentine, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Panama and Bolivia fought themselves free one after the other ;-and in 1819 Florida had to be sold to the United States. Since then Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines have broken away or been absorbed by Uncle Sam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tfte Latest JforoccaB JPar</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font7">N THE minds of the Moors, and of the Spaniards, too, the account which was opened in the year 711 A. D. is not yet settled. There are scores of Moorish families who still cherish the deeds to properties which were taken away from their ancestors over four hundred years ago. They fondly hope that sometime they will get those properties back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As far as the Spaniards are concerned they are still haunted with the thought that it is their business to make the Roman Catholic religion dominant over the Mohammedan faith; and inasmuch as Morocco has rich agricultural lands, besides immensely rich iron ore and phosphate deposits, this zeal for godliness is considerably augmented over what it would be if Morocco were all desert land. War is business, religion is business, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">business</span><span class="font7"> is business most of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Taking the apostle’s famous expression to the Corinthians, and modifying it to suit Christendom’s present standards, we might say, ‘Now abideth these three, politician, priest and profiteer, and these three are one, but the greatest of these is the profiteer.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Curious as it may seem, the Moroccans are averse to being swallowed alive, and have no fancy for Spanish misrule; hence every twenty-five years they make another strike for liberty; and although Abd El Krim is now safe in exile </span><span class="font8">on </span><span class="font7">an island in the Indian Ocean, yet another Will arise in his place, as a matter of course, in the philosophy of the Mohammedan Moor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So fearful were the rulers of Spain of the prowess of Moorish fighters that Queen Isabella, four hundred years ago, left as her dying request an urgent message to all who might follow hw, that they should mvw ©ease to rmder-tohe toe wnptete mtbjqgattoR of the Moors, as otherwise Spain would never be safe from recapture by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That Quben Isabella was not such a bad judge is shown by the fact that for many years Spate has had two-thirds of its large amy oomstimtiy </span><span class="font7">in Morocco; and although her army actually on Moroccan shores outnumbered the Moroeean forces seven to one, yet only the cooperation of the immensely powerful French prevented the Moors from driving the Spanish armies into the Mediterranean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">American, Cuban and English soldiers of the World War who subsequently enlisted for service with Spain against the Moors reported horrible experiences, brutal officers, bad food, worse quarters, scant medical attention, insanitary hospitals, no blankets, shirts or underwear, with wages of sixty cents a day out of which they were expected to buy uniforms, food, arms, ammunition and washing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">MONG the poor of Spain there is a story or fable current which shows how they feel about the government. The patron saint of Spain is supposed to have asked for Spain that it might have sunny skies, fruits, flowers and pretty women. Then, remembering another important item, he went back to heaven and also asked that Spain might have a good government, but was told that he was too late, as Spain already had received its share of favors. The poor used to tell this story and laugh. Now they omit the laugh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For generations Spain has been governed locally by </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">caciques</span><span class="font7"> or political bosses under the domination of thedoeal priest. The only policy of these </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">caciques</span><span class="font7"> has been to buy or order votes, ruin opponents, dispense privileges, sell government documents and protection, and make sure to flop toward whatever system is for the moment in power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This has brought about what is called the “rotativista” system by which one bunch of politicians run things as long as they dare and then resign, and another crowd will take up the reins where they left off and do the same things all over again. There are no political parties. The way this works out has resulted in as many as twenty premiers in six years, with mdy teto budget approved by toe ps&amp;mwt It wffi titerefm be mb tost though Spm te a wistttetowil</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">gKinwKKB 21, J »27 </span><span class="font7">monarchy the part which the people play in the government is a very small one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For several decades Spain has been the one place in the world where an international swindle. the Spanish prisoner scheme, could be worked. The triri&lt; consists of writing; letters abroad, supposedly from a prison, saying that a convict had Lid&quot; in a certain place a trunk which contains a fortune, and that its hiding place would he revealed in response to a cash remittance of a specified amount, trillions of dollars were made by this hoary old swindle.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Bis Most Catholic Majesty, Alphonso</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270921_files/g_E_19270921-3.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">LPHONSO, King of Spain, is a posthumous child: and as he had no older brothers, he was literally born a king. Ho is the only monarch in the world who bears the papal title of ASost Catholic Majesty. This is because Spain is Today the last monarchical stronghold of the papacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Alphonso goes to Romo to see the pope . he receives honors accorded to no other ruler. By the papal throne are two smaller thrones, one for Alphonso and one for Victoria his wife. . Both Alphonso and Victoria bend the knee before the pope, then kneel on the steps of his - _ throne and kiss his toe and hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Alphonso is a past master in the art of polities. He is for whichever side wins, as all good politicians are; and yet he has a certain kind of courage which all must admire. When invited to Barcelona, capital of Catalonia, the center of republican sentiment in Spain, and when it was supposed that the invitation was a trap, he surprised everybody and gained favor all around by accepting the invitation and walking the streets there with no visible means of protection. On this occasion he attended two banquets, one by the labor muons, supposed to be his enemies, and another given by capitalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Alphonso has done many tyrannical things. He has suppressed the Catalan language and local parliament and has abolished the jury system of trials all over Spain; yet he professes willingness to run for the office of first President of Spain, if they want a republic; and at the aamu time he contrived to have all Spain elect himself and his queen as honorary Mayor and | Mayoress of every city and town in Spain, and </span><span class="font8">to request </span><span class="font7">him to maintain the present dicta</span><span class="font8">torship for three years more. If that does not </span><span class="font7">show the work of a clever politician won’t somebody point out what would be ?</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Too Many Priests</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;OTITHIX the past few years the number of * « American visitors to Spain has increased from about 6.000 a year to 50,000. One of these </span><span class="font8">visiting </span><span class="font7">Toledo, and writing in the Minnesota </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font7"> says that a Spanish professor told him there are entirely too many priests in Spain and that his guide expressed the same idea. One. in the whole world, and on a desert island, would be plenty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The man himself says that the Spanish priests are distinctly voluptuous in appearance, that they look anything but spiritual as they waddle along the streets holding some yards of cassocks over their shoulders, but that they are everywhere, crowding the railway compartments and the best hotels, and openly flaunting their women in the streets and cafes. Lotteries and gambling are popular. Few people attend church in Spain, except on festive days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If there were a spark of manhood in these priests, let alone religion, they would certainly wish to render some real service to their fellow men. They have plenty of opportunity. There are five thousand towns and villages in Spain without roads, and they could work off some of their excess fat in road work. Tn the Las Hur-des region of Estreniadura are thousands of people living in caves and holes, sickly, degenerate and forsaken, like the savages of the Congo or the Niger. Surplus priestly energy could be used in building houses for these unfortunates. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Ajanguiz, near Bilboa, in 1923, the people tiring of excessive funeral costs, organized a cooperative movement of undertakers, coffin makers, grave diggers and hm-kmen, and purposely left the priest out because his charges were too high. A shoemaker died, the first to pass away after the cooperative movenment was formed. The village priest invaded the death chamber, seized the corpse and started with it toward his church. A crowd gathered, chased the priest away, took the corpse to the cemetery and buried it in so-called consecrated ground, while the village blacksmith preached the funeral sermon. Now the priest has left town and the cardinal refuses to send another, and the people are in luck until he does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the command of the papacy Spain recently withdrew from the League of Nations, because Protestant Germany was granted a place on the permanent Council which was denied to Catholic Spain.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Education and Transportation</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font7">LTHOUGH there has been &quot;compulsory” education in Spain for seventy years, yet today forty-five percent of the Spanish people cannot even read. Seville, a city of 150,000 people, is reported to have 500 wine shops and one book store. A constant censorship of the press is maintained. Many who are well informed of her difficulties think that Spain would take an immediate jump forward if this censorship could be dropped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Spanish Socialists have made efforts to get the bullfights suppressed. They think, and rightly, that the attention of the people should be directed toward the real problems of life. They cannot afford sufficient schools, and yet they spend large sums to see the bullfights. The Spanish people mourn more over the death of a favorite bullfighter than they do over the death of their pope or king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A ridiculous improvement in bullfighting is the proposed encasement of the horses in an armor made out of old automobile tires, so that the bulls will not gore them to death. When the people begin to see the savagery and foolishness ©f the whole thing it means the end of that so-called sport.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Spain is slowly awmkening. Automobiles contest the right of way with the bull carts. Fifty-five percent of these, autos come from the United States. Spanish aviators have no superiors. Nobel prizes for literature and for medicine have been awarded to Spaniards. Spanish music is most entrancing. Bobbed hair has carried the women by storm. The end of Old Spain is here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In architecture Spain has none to excel her. Her tapestries are the most valuable in existence, and while the Boman Catholic church stedfastly presses against the introduction of any education except what she approves, which is none at all, yet by one means or another it is coming in. The message of present truth is Sweeping over the country and will carry all before it, in God’s due time. Spain hopes, by means of a great exposition, to put herself in a position of leadership among Spaniah-speak-ing countries of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Spain was the last country in Europe to build railroads, and has the worst and slowest ones. The fastest trains run only thirty miles an hour, and most of them make only about half that. Stations are unheated and unlighted. Travelers in the wildest parts of Spain must expect much discomfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An important transportation project which Is under way, in the hands of a private firm, is the canalization of the Guadalquiver River from Seville to Cordoba, The State is contributing to the work, which it is expected will require twenty years to complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Climate and Products</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">S</span><span class="font7">PAIN is, next to Switzerland, the most mountainous country in Europe. It may be said to be surrounded by mountains, and in addition there are two chains going through the country east to west. These mountains, once well timbered but now mostly denuded of forests, are rich in gold, silver, quicksilver, copper, lead, iron, iron pyrites, zinc, gypsum, marl, chalk, limestone, sandstone, serpentine and granite. Fifty-five percent of Europe’s copper comes from Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are great extremes of climate at differ- -ent seasons and in different parts of Spain. The winters are unusually severe and the summers unusually hot, considering the latitude. In the northwest the severe winters make it impossible to raise olives and other southern fruits. In the southeast, about Valencia, the climate is eternal spring. In the.summer time the southwest is insufferably hot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The great diversity of climate has given rise to an equally great diversity of plant and animal life. In the vicinity of Madrid butterfly collectors have found 350 species, many of them not seen elsewhere. Spain leads the world as a producer of olives and corks, She has important textile plants, and produces considerable paper, glass, sugar, wine and pottery. Her Malaga grapes and raisins are famous everywhere, except in California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Spanish People and their Possessions</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">B</span><span class="font7">UT for the twin curses of Roman Catholicism and militarism Spain would today be the foremost country in Europe. It has within itself everything necessary to make an empire. and one of the grandest mixtures of racial strains on the planet. Basques, Celts, Vandals, Goths, Suevi, Alans, Visigoths, Jews and Irish have invaded the land one after another and left their indelible impress upon posterity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Romans made such an impression that Spanish is today nearest to pure Latin of any living language. A number of famous Romans were born in Spain—-Seneca, Martial, Lucan, Quintilian, for example. As a rule Spanish men and women have good physiques. They are naturally brilliant, and under favorable circumstances are capable of great exploits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Spain, as everywhere else, those who do nothing have the best of everything and plenty of it, while those who do everything have nothing. Lazy, useless pets of the church have great estates, which they cannot cultivate and will not allow’ others to cultivate. Hence there is nothing for the sons of the poor to do but to emigrate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cuba, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay are supplied with a never-ending stream of Spanish immigrants, and as workers they have no superiors; but, like the Italians, they do not emigrate permanently. Forty percent of them manage to spend their last days in the old home town, which always remains to them the most delightful spot on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Most Spanish girls who are educated prefer poverty rather than the disgrace of earning money by doing anything useful. These girls never go out without chaperones. They are usually dressed in black, owing to the custom of wearing mourning for every distant relative that dies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Business men and men of the Tippah elawses’ lunch at two o’clock, take a nap and return to business at four. At present there is a none too friendly rivalry between Spain and Italy, to see which will wield the predominant influence in South America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Spain is approximately six hundred miles Square. Besides the mainland it still controls the Balearic Isles in the Mediterranean, with their major (Majorca) and minor (Minorca) islands. The name Balearic, from the Greek </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">iallein,</span><span class="font7"> to throw, has reference to the ancient skill of the slingers in Hannibal’s army, who came from these beautiful islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another valuable possession still remaining to Spain is the Canary group of islands, 150 miles off the West Coast of Africa, where are found 420 species of flowering plants not found elsewhere. There are thirteen islands in the group, some of considerable size.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font7">HE total population of Spain is 22,000,(MX).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Madrid and Barcelona each have three-fourths of a million; Valencia and Seville each have a quarter of a million. Seville is considered the most interesting city, architecturally speaking. It has many magnificent Moorish buildings, notably the Alcazar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cadiz is interesting because the narrowness of the land-approach prevents its capture by a military force. It has one of the finest harbors in the world, and is said to have kept its unbroken position as a great city from an earlier time than any other city in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Madrid, in the geographical center of the country, has bitterly cold winters and terribly hot summers. The outstanding architectural feature is the royal palace, made of white granite, 470 feet square and 100 feet high. In general the architecture of Madrid is considered inferior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gibraltar rock is two miles long and three-fourths of a mile wide, and has an elevation of 1,439 feet. The name, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gebel-al-Tarik,</span><span class="font7"> means the height or rock of Tarik. Tarik was the name of the Moorish general who landed his troops there at the time of the invasion of Spain in 711 A. D. There is a number of remarkable caves in this rock, all very difficult of access. The British had no natural right to this rock; but they took it because they wanted it, and have kept it for the same reason. They have made of it the strongest fortress in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Chiefest of all architectural treasures of Spain or of the world is the Alhambra, at Granada, the ancient palace of the Moorish monarch. A writer says of this palace:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The walls are covered with delicate stucco work; the ceiling is inlaid with diversified work of white, blue and gold, imitating stars set in the heavens. So wondrously are marble, brick and stucco fashioned and put together that, seen from the end of a vista, the combination of pillars, arehe«, windows and walls has the appearance of lace curtains hung and looped in graceful fashion* Doorways, arches, domes, colonnades, fountains, filigre® work, ticllised windows, blue, brown, red and gold colorings, sparkling fountains, soft couches and the lightness and grace of it all, make the Alhambra a veritable fairyland that stands unapproached in the history of architecture. It is a magic group of palaces, possible only to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">game order of minds that created the Arabian Nights’ entertainments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Most Progressive City</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270921_files/g_E_19270921-4.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">HE most progressive city in Spain is Barcelona, Catalonia. It has more factories than all the other big cities put together; and the province, of which it is the center, pays in taxes eighty percent of the national expenditures; yet this city, because its inhabitants speak the Catalan language, is the special object of wrath and repression by the Spanish rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Catalan professors are dismissed, Catalan leaders are assassinated, and hundreds of her workers are executed, imprisoned or exiled, all because they dare to think. Naturally, the inhabitants want relief from the oppressions of the Roman Catholic system of misgovernment, and the more earnest their desire for relief the more the screws of intolerance and force are applied. Catalonia feeds the Spanish government and gets whipped for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Catalonia lies next to France and was for centuries an independent country. Periodically it united, now with Spain and now with France, but always sought independence; and was in a fair way to got it when the dictatorship was established. It had a separate legislature, but this was taken from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What the Catalonians want is not so much actual separation from Spain as the right to use their own laws and their own language in their courts. But the Castilians of Madrid want everybody in Spain to think the same way on every subject, and that is to think as the pope thinks, or thinks he thinks. Tn order to save expenses it has been the custom for Spanish secret service mon to shoot in cold blood any Catalan they desired to get rid of. No later than 1926 nine prominent lawyers of Barcelona were banished for daring to use the Catalan language in court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Present Dictatorship</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font7">HE present dictatorship of Spain is no worse than any other would be in a country like Spain. Prisons have been filled without the prisoners being given a trial; discontented workmen have been pitched out of prison windows into the sea; others have been shot </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">in </span><span class="font7">large numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">General Primero de Rivera was military governor of Barcelona when he decided to annex Spain. In his army of 311,000 men he has 369 generals and 20,000 staff officers. However, the army is to be cut in half. General Rivera is a hard-working man; he does not seem to be moved by personal ambitions but to be really doing the best he can to govern the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Unlike Mussolini, he is trying to find a way out of his dictatorship by establishing a so-called Patriotic Union; but a dictatorship is a dictatorship, no matter by what name it is called, and if the political party in power has no genuine opposition it is in effect a dictatorship. No doubt the people of Spain would prefer a military dictatorship rather than one managed by politicians or priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The vote of the directorate to have confidence in themselves should not be taken seriously. The voting was controlled by soldiers. Those who wanted to vote in favor of continuing the dictatorship did so; those who objected to it knew that the wise thing to do was to remain away from the polls, and did so. Anybody ought to be able to get up a vote in favor of himself when he controls everybody in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of the various attempts from without and within Spain to overthrow the power of the military it seems necessary to say but little. Spain is governed by a military soviet; and until that soviet falls out among its own members, or until the Lord takes a hand and definitely ousts it, there does not seem any great likelihood of its being set aside. Power is power, and in the hands of the military it has weapons behind it which unarmed men cannot meet. The day when a few men could get together a lot of old muskets and upset a powerful government, backed by military force, is not so likely; to happen now as it was once.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">TpVERY Jew was compelled by God’s law to</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">take three vacations a- year. At Passover time, at Pentecost and at the Feast of Tabernacles, namely, spring, summer and fall, every male Jew was compelled to appear before the Lord in the court of the temple at Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was a good idea. It gave a little rest from toil, a journey, an opportunity for the exchange of ideas, an occasion for worship, and a return home with fellow travelers all imbued with the same hopes and aims. These occasions were for one week each. The women often but not always went along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a growing idea that vacations are a necessity, and so they are. The legislature of Brazil has passed a law making it compulsory for employers to give and for employes to take fifteen days of paid vacation each year. This is in addition to 120 Sundays and holidays, wherein the bulk of the people of that hot country do little or ffo work,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Daniel Guggenheim, principal builder of the great smelting industries which bear his name, is reported to have in substance, that a man who works all the time, year in and year out, is only half a man; and it is so. Constant work at high tension without an opportunity to jest unfits a man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Lancashire, England, mill districts, the annual vacation or holiday, or “wake”, as it is called, is so much of a function that on an ordinary Saturday morning in mid-August as many as sixty-two special trains have been observed coming into Blackpool by the Sea, bringing mill workers for their wake. These workers save for this throughout the year, a certain amount every pay-day. „</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Americans until a generation ago were a vacationless people; but now they are beginning to learn that vacations really pay, in the renewed vitality and spirit of cheerfulness and industry which they bring. It is being urged upon the large employers of labor that they give paid vacations to all workers; as, for most workers, a vacation which is not paid for is no vacation at all</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In the enterprising state of California there are three hundred municipal auto camps. Many of them are entirely free, and include besides free parking and camping, hot and cold water, shower baths, cabins, tables and tableware. When a charge is made it is seldom over fifty cents a day. The city or town that does not have a &quot;Welcome” sign at each end of the main street is a rarity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From the United States Public Health Department Bulletins and other sources of information we gather that prospective automobile campers and vacationists should have in their outfits, for use in emergencies, a strong hand-ax, a short-handled spade, a tow-rope, a mosquito wash consisting of two parts each of citronella and spirits of camphor and one part cedar oil, and a little chloride of lime for treating drinking water suspected of harboring possible evils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same bulletins advise a thorough washing of the hands with soap and water immediately after touching poison ivy, and then a relathering and letting the lather dry on. Bathing with sea water is also advised. Another application is a teaspoonful of boric acid in a glass of hot water, applied when cool. Another is bicarbonate of soda made into a very thin paste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For a trip across the continent the advice is to use a closed car and the least possible amount of baggage, a wet sponge and chamois for wiping windshields and windows, colored spectacles for persons with sensitive eyes, regular meals for everybody and fruit juices for drinks instead of water. Also it is good to carry one or two pillows for varying the back rests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The whole country is being traversed now by automobile bus lines, some of which are over a thousand miles in length. These provide interesting trips for those who wish to travel by automobile but cannot afford to operate private cars. Owners of private cars may now take them to Europe, with very little extra expense and bother. They go as excess baggage.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">npiHS scheme of civilization under which we live is cursed with a system of enforced, va</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">cations for those who can least afford it; i. e.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">common laborers. These common laborers, used Bow in the construction of railroads, tunnels, highways, and bridges, again in harvesting wheat, again in lumbering or ice gathering or a “ hundred other like occupations, are important factors in our civilization; yet they have no permanent work and hence no permanent homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is easy enough to refer to these unfortunates when out of work as hoboes, and even to do it with a sneer: but they are a legitimate product of this brain age and whoever sneers at them is sneering at something that represents himself, for he helped to make them. These men are called hoboes</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is astonishing how quickly people get out of sympathy with a man that has the misfortune to be out of work, and that through no fault of his own. A wealthy man who frequently visits New York has a hobby of dressing up like a laborer and going about asking for work. In more than half of the cities where he has tried this he was arrested, although not even once suspected of crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pittsburgh has a district, Homestead Street, where men of this type gather, looking for jobs. If they insist on union wages, as is their right, and refuse to take any job offered them, no matter what the pay, they may and often do get thirty days in jail as vagrants. Is there anything fair about that? New York and Buffalo have municipal lodging houses where such men can go, bathe, sleep, get a good breakfast and go out looking for honest work without feeling that society has done them injury.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">HHHE wilful vacationists are those who do not want work and who work only when forced to it, and yet love to travel. An expert calls such men tramps. A hobo will work all the time, if he can get the work to do. A tramp will work only when he must. A bum works not at all and travels not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Naseher, specialist in geriatrics, tells us that there is a disease, ergophobia, usually permanent hut sometimes spasmodic. He narrates </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">case of this kind where an efficient worker when under the influence of an attack would </span><span class="font8">’drop his </span><span class="font7">tools and for several days would lie idle.

<p><span class="font7">The same physician refers to another form of mania oppressing some of the workers of all classes, claustrophobia, a morbid distress or fear when in a room or closed space, a kind of mania which impels a man to travel even when ho cannot afford to and ought not to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A little boy of Muskogee, Oklahoma, has this wanderlust so implanted in his organism, and so developed, that by the time he was nine years old he had run away from home thirty times, his father claiming that at that age lie had then not been at home more than three months in the past three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A young man apologized to a young lady for not proposing to her, on the ground that he knew he had this wanderlust in his blood </span><span class="font8">too </span><span class="font7">deeply implanted for him ever to maintain an ordeily home in one place; another offered marriage to a maid iffliie hope that it would cure him of wanderlust to </span><span class="font8">assume </span><span class="font7">the responsibilities of a family, but a. sudden attack a few days before the date set fdtTme wedding found him far away when the date arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Should we put a commuter into this class? Where else does he belong? A resident of Bea-_^. eon, New York, travels 130 miles each day to and from his work in New York City, a total of thirty hours a week and 39,000 miles a year. He has kept this up for twenty-five years, making altogether about a million miles thus far, and is still going, at last reports. He must like to travel; but as he works regularly and pays his own way, whose business is it? Others have commuted from, longer distances; some make 200 miles or more a day.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>The Language of Tramps</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CHHE </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World Tomorrow</span><span class="font7"> contained some years ago an interesting article on tramps which gave some of their signs, by which they guide their fellows. The article, written by an expert on the subject, stated that this sign language is now largely a thing of the past but once was widely used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These signs take the form of crosses, triangles or squares and are quite onintelKgible to the uninformed. Some of them, however, </span><span class="font8">have | </span><span class="font7">a basis of interpretation. Thus, </span><span class="font8">a cross may </span><span class="font7">iwn “Be pious here”. A eat means, *Only wo-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">bb to toe house.” A sledge-hammer means, *lbu must work for what you get” A rooster masns, *There is an alarm dock here* Jagged paxdtel lines suggest the teeth of a bad dog. to vertical chain or scrawl signifies, “Pass on: nothing doing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When tramps travel in packs, as they often So, and have a headquarters, called a “Jungle”, toeir custom is to send out the youngest member of the gang to collect the food. This is on the Basis that most mothers will feed a hungry boy. The boy’s excuse for not eating on the premises M that his poor old father, who is sick, is waiting for him down the track. He goes on from place to place, getting one hand-out at each three homes visited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Twenty hand-outs are considered a “feed” for ten men. An expert can even collect dessert by asking some motherly soul to please exchange toe bread and butter which he has just received for a piece of pie. Result, he gets the pie and keeps the bread and butter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some women, however, are too smart for them. One ex-tramp, now a member of the Chicago Health Department, states that on one occasion when he had started to address a lady by saying, “Lady, will you please?” she interrupted him by saying, “Get out of here, you dirty bum. It is only tramps that call me lady’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a certain amount of what might be called “tramp baggage”. This is baggage which to never daimed. Some of it is left because the accumulated charges for storage are considered worth more than the package. Some contain liquid refreshments which the owners are fearful to claim. Some contain samples of merchan</span><span class="font8">dise </span><span class="font7">which have been abandoned by commercial men because the particular side-line did not pay. Some baggage is lost through sheer carelessness of servants in overlooking one item of some wealthy traveler’s paraphernalia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The trfpsjf </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Business</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A MONG all races the gypsies are one of the most interesting, and useless. Like the preachers and priests and monks and nuns, many of them have no useful work to do in the world; but instead of preying on the minds of too credulous to support them in idleness, working along the lines of fear, they accomplish the ime malts by working along the lines of fraperwtoHon and clairvoyance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In other words, the devotees of &lt;tanta^ are promised that if they will be good, and if they will pay, they can have good htok when they die, while those who come to toe gypsy not have to be good. AU they have to do to to pay, and they can get the good luck while they live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the relatives of the gypsy seeker do not have to continue to pay for the rest of their lives to make sure that their deceased one gets his good luck after his charring season, to over. The gypsy only holds out his or her hand once and then hikes on, to look for some other dupe. The two lines of business are the same in that they are both under the influence of demons, governed by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gypsies have a language of their own, Romany, which in three hundred years of their history in England has not been corrupted by the admission of a single English word. While their traditions are that they sprang from Egypt, yet their language shows that they came from India. The fact that they make their living telling fortunes indicates also that they came from India, the World’s center of demonism and witchcraft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gypsies have their own kings. The principal business of a modern gypsy king is to keep his tribe out of trouble with toe police. At stated intervals hundreds of them gather at a certain fortified church that rears itself out of toe arid salt marshes and sand dunes of a desert-like stretch of the Mediterranean coast of France. There, away from all other peoples, they talk over their common interests, transact intertribal business and worship their common saint and ancestor, a Negress named Sarah, supposed to have been a servant of Mary, toe mother of our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The gypsies have suffered much. At one time they were banished from England under pain of death. In 1725 all the gypsies in Prussia were put to death by order of Frederick William of Prussia. In 1802 the gypsy conference in toe south of France was raided, and all the delegates were put on shipboard and landed on a desolate part of toe African coast. In 1772, in Hungary, forty-five gypsies were tried and executed for cannibalism. A subsequent investigation by Emperor Joseph II disclosed that toe person alleged to have been murdered and eaten had never even existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Gfpsies </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in America</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TN. </span><span class="font7">AMERICA nobody interferes much with gypsies, except that the school authorities compel the children to attend school, much to their sorrow. They cannot understand why they should have to be indoors with their feet in tight shoes, when they might be outdoors among the birds and trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tn New York City, much to their disgust, and to their real physical injury, the gypsies were compelled to move from their tents into vacant stores. The gypsy clJldren do not thrive under these conditions. On the contrary, they soon become emaciated, losing their ruddy, outdoor appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">.Most gypsies are honest, as honest as others. Some are industrious, the women making has-kets, and the men working as coppersmiths, blacksmiths, harvest hands, etc. Hungarian gypsies are accredited by Liszt with being the founders of Hungarian national music. Gypsy girls rarely bob their hair. If they do, they are punished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gypsies have a post-office clearing house for their mail at Fort Smith, Ark., where an adopted gypsy and his wife keep an accurate record of the movements of the tribes, forward their mail, handle their bequests and other legal business. They are great traders, the men having become as expert in swapping flivvers as they once were in swapping horses. Modern gypsies travel exclusively by automobile, the horse having passed out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are said to be 20.000 gypsies in the British Isles, 50,000 in Spain, 280,000 in Hungary, 46,000 in Serbia, 52,000 in Bulgaria. 15,000 in Poland, 300,000 in Rumania, 16,000 in Czechoslovakia, 10,000 in Lithuania, 1,551 in Finland and 50,000 in Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The penal code of Rumania provides that gypsies serve but half the sentences of others in prison, on the ground that because of their wandering habits and outdoor life they are punished more severely by six months than other people are by a year within walls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The true gypsies hate and despise the spurious gypsies who camp along the road, who steal fruit and chickens and who dress up like real gypsies only to beg, steal and bootleg. Most American gypsies are fairly well-to-do. Some of them have farms which they work every sum-mw, hitting the pike again as soon as the crops are gathered. The mother is the real boss of the gypsy family. She controls the property and manages the children and the pocketbook. </span><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font7">gypsies have the belief that God has kept them separate in blood all these generations for some high destiny. And it may be true. Who knows?</span></p>

Until recently Uncle Sam penalized his citizens who wished to travel abroad, by charging $10 for viseing the passports of tluwe who desired to see America. This foolish charge worked hardships two ways.

<p><span class="font7">In 1924 all the principal steamship companies inaugurated what is variously called college cabin, student third cabin or tourist third cabin rates to Europe. These rates were designed to give good accommodations to students, teachers, artists, authors and others who desired to visit Europe but could not afford expensive accommodations. In three years the number of persons carried in these accommodations increased from 5,000 to 45,000. Third-class tours around the world are now obtainable. These tourists accommodations are considerably better than the ordinary steerage.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Trip Should Be Carefully Planned</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TRIP to Europe should be carefully planned in advance, and in detail. May and June are the best months to visit the British Isles. Midsummer is best for northern France, Switzerland, Germany, Scandinavia, Austria and the Balkans. Southern France, the Riviera, southern Italy, Sicily, Greece and the shores of the Mediterranean are best in the spring and fall. The Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands are pleasant the year around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Miles vary in different countries. The American mile is 5,280 feet, the Italian 5,298 feet, the Turkish 5,478, the Arab 6.429, the Prussian 24,711, the Danish 24,732, the Flemish 20,607, the Viennese 24,807, and the Swiss mile is 27,-405 feet, or considerably over five of our miles. Most tourists now travel in Europe either second-class or third-class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wales contains some of the most charming scenery in the British Isles, and is a country not much visited. Perhaps that is on account of its names of places, which are so forbidding. Wales boasts the longest named post office in the world. The name means, in Welsh, “Church of St. Mary in a hollow of white hazel, near to a rapid whirlpool and to St. Tysdio’s church, near to a red eave.’’ The Welsh have shortened all this and boiled it doivn into their one little word LLan-f airpw llgwngyllgogerychwyrndrolm llllandysili-ogogogoch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why France should be such a Mecca for American tourists, when the French, are so eager to borrow American money, and are so loath to repay it, and yet so quick to show their hostility to those who have been their friends in a military and financial way, is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> problem we will not attempt to solve. At present there are 3,000 penniless Americans in Paris, without work and without money to get home. Their lot is a most unhappy one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All citizens of foreign countries entering France must obtain vises or be arrested. The reason for this is that there is now considerable unemployment there. A nuisance of travel in France is that besides the regular tips which must be made to all classes of hotel employes ten percent is added to the regular hotel bill as a “service” charge, on the theory that it will relieve the patrons of the very tips which they are forced to give. This was intended to be </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">blessing but worked out reversely. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. The French complain that the Americans of today are more thrifty than they were before the war. They stay at first-class hotels but get their meals at fixed price restaurants for only five or six francs, which at present rates of exchange mates a very, cheap meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people of European countries value their art treasures. When a tourist in Athens complained of the $5 fee required for visiting the Parthenon lie was plainly told that all the gold of America assembled together would not be Sufficient to purchase the fortune Greece has in her antiquities and that the charge is just. Nevertheless it seems like a hold-up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will be a long time before mankind exhaust® the interesting things to be found on this terres-' trial ball. An engineer returned from Malaya after a stay of six years in the densest jungle in the world reports that while there he saw full-grown deer which he could put into his pocket, fish that elimbed trees and gaaed at the passers-by, other fish that could be bounced like a rubber ball, frogs provided with parachutes and birds that could be heard flying a mile away. At least two of these items are credible, the diminutive deer and climbing fishes having been reported by others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Events in Canada </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By onr Canadian Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">U</span><span class="font7">NDER the caption “War Debts in Vancouver'<sup>5</sup> the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily Province</span><span class="font7"> has an interesting editorial on the economic outcome of forcing Germany to pay war debts. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The City Council divided, four to three, yesterday, on the proposal to purchase cheaper goods in Germany rather than dearer goods in Scotland. Whether or not that division, with the decision in favor of ths German goods which came of it, accurately represents public opinion in the matter, it is hard to say. What there is no doubt about is that the discu«ion about it in the council did faithfully represent that tangle of crosspurposes and contradictions and blind alleys involved in the ‘problem of international war debt«. And while, in itself, the action of the council in buying fifty-one German water valves for $7500, rather than pay $11,000 for the same number of Scotch water valves is nothing for anybody io get excited or angry about, and is indeed hardly worth discussion, it is worth discussion for the local light it throws upon a state of affairs which is profoundly affecting the economic welfare of all the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was sentiment on both, sides of the council yesterday, and there was also on both sides what the speakers themselves, and probably most of the rest of would honestly describe as hard business sense. Thus, the majority in view was that the war was over; that if Germany was to pay her war debts, the only way she could do it was by selling us her goods; that if you were going to debar German goods for sentimental reasons, you were practically going to cut off your own nose to spite Germany’s face. _</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The minority view was that a public British body should not trade with the Germans on any consideration. It was true that Vancouver could save $3500 on this contract by giving it to a German firm. But the Ger-mani'were &quot;cutting the throat of everybody in the world,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">'i</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">even yet”. It «as not for us to worry about how they were to pay their war debts. And however they paid them, it should not he with “Vancouver money”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The point is, of course, that there is truth here on both sides. It is true that if Germany is to pay her war debt’-', the only way she can do it is to sell goods to the creditor nations. And it is also true that the only „ way Germany can sell goods at all to her creditors and late enemies is to sell Cheaper goods.** And that means however little we like the sound of it, “cutting the throat-*** of evert body in the world.” It is economic conditions imposed upon Gmuany by the victor nations which enable Germany to turn out water valves for Vancouver for sixty percent of the price that those valves can be made in Scotland. And if those economic conditions prescribe longer hour<sub>h</sub> and shorter pay for German workers than for Scottish workers, well, Germany seems quite prepared to swallow the pill and bide her time. For the international trade which we have virtually forced upon Germany at the point of our Allied bayonets will remain when the debts are settled; or, at least, that is ” the way Germany looks at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The last irony of this situation was illustrated by the Labor member of the council, and there is some irony in that, too, who said that Germany had been admitted to the society of respectable nations in the League of Nations, and there was no reason why Vancouver should take this so seriously as to throw away three or four thousand dollars. And so we go on in this vicious circle, demanding that Germany shall pay her war debts, forcing Germany to sell us cheap goods in order to pay them, throwing British workmen out of employment in the process, and then finding ourselves so hard up that wa do not see how we can remit the German debt, anyhow. Of all the sorry chickens of an evil brood that have come home to roost with us since the war, there is none</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">WA msta worse eempKoy fox us than the policy of W debts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That another government-owned railway is paying its way is reflected in a statement of the Treasurer of Ontario, wherein, replying to a statement in the Legislation recently, he said that $999,065 was the total revenue received in the last fiscal year by the Government from the mining lands of Northern Ontario. The total revenue received from the lands and forests of Northern Ontario, other than mining lands, was $4,016^00. The total net operating profits of the Timiskaming &amp;&nbsp;Northern Ontario Railway (government-owned) in the last fiscal year amounted to $982,963.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Labrador boundary ease leaves no doubt as to the ownership of the vast water powers on the Hamilton River.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Both the Muskrat Falls and the Grand Falls </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font7"> to Newfoundland and there will be no appeal on the part of Canada. The Grand Falls are 302 feet high, and constitute one of the most wonderful cataracts in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Newfoundland, by the decision, gets an area of 112,000 square miles, or a territory greater in extent than England, Scotland and Wales combined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ontario will now move faster by reason of Moyal assent having recently been given in the Ontario Legislature to bills affecting the Highway Traffic Act whereby a new thirty-five-mile limit per hour became effective on highways outside of cities, towns and villages in place of twenty-five miles an hour, formerly the limit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Apart from undeveloped natural resources the national wealth of Canada is officially estimated at twenty-two billion dollars, which works out at $2,525 per head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are no accurate figures available showing what the national wealth was at Confederation, sixty years ago, but it is estimated at less than one and a half billions and as the population at that time was about. 3,400,000, the average wealth was but slightly over $400.00. The average Canadian is therefore worth six times what he was sixty years ago. It should be remembered though that the dollar today has not the same purchasing power of the dollar of 1867.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Agriculture makes up about eight billions of the present total wealth; urban real estate almost six billions; the railway over two billions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By provinces Canada’s national wealth is as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font7">T THE Episcopal convention in San Francisco a New York Reverend delicately admitted his superiority to the apostles, and another reverend gent, also a rector, from Ann Arbor, Michigan, advocated unmarried unions, the so-called companionate marriage. It is surely great business putting such gents at teaching the young and teaching religion to everybody. These men are real anarchists, the chosen boon companions of Big Business and Big Politicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They are at all times bitterly opposed to anybody except themselves undertaking to explain Ose Scriptures to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font7">T THE same convention in San Francisco at which the two reverend gents last mentioned illuminated the sky line by their remarks on the inspiration of the Scriptures and on trial or convenience marriages a layman got tired of the performance, strode to the platform and said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You of the clergy have a job of your own to perform. Have you done it so well you can afford to spend your time in settling political and industrial matters? Or is that the layman’s job? I thought that the job of the clergy, by which they are oath-bound, was to give us of the laity spiritual sustenance so that we can execute our ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">npiIE conceptions of the sabbath entertained </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">-*• by</span><span class="font7"> the people of Christendom today are so many and varied that it is almost impossible to treat this subject from the standpoint of a lecture, Therefore instead of treating it as a lecture this evening, I am going to take it up from the standpoint of questions and answers; and in this manner I trust we shall be able to bring out the various divergent beliefs and measure them against that great touchstone, the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In approaching this subject, the first question that naturally arises is, What is the meaning of the sabbath?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word sabbath means intermission or rest. It is taken from a root word meaning to repose, to desist from exertion. This is also the manner in which the word is used in the Bible. It describes the rest of man and of beast and of the land. A correct understanding of the meaning of the word is essential to a proper understanding of the subject. There are many people who claim that this word means a rest from certain prohibited things, but that it permits certain other things. There is nothing in the Bible to support such a conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The next question is, Does the Bible refer to more than one sabbath?</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Three Sabbaths Specifically Referred To</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">HTHERE are three sabbaths referred to speei-fically in the Bible. In Leviticus 25:1-12 we read of two sabbaths not generally understood or observed in Christendom. Each seventh year from the time the children of Israel entered the land of Canaan vas to be observed as a sabbath year, during which the land was to receive its sabbath or rest. They were not to ■ sow’ the field, nor prune the vineyard; and that which grew of its own accord was not to be reaped. This was to be a year of rest unto the : land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They were then commanded to count seven of these seven-year cycles, making forty-nine years • in all, and the following or fiftieth year was-to he a sabbath also, which was called the jubilee ' year. The same restrictions applied to the ju- <sup>! </sup>bilee year that applied to the seventh-year sabbath, with certain added commands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the jubilee year, in addition to letting the &lt;&nbsp;land rest, every Israelite who had some of his : 816</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">brethren as servants, had to abolish that servitude and sot them free. And if any of them happened to acquire the property of their brethren, it could only be held until the year of jubilee. At that time it had to be returned to the original family that received it when the children of Israel entered the land of Canaan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These were sabbaths of rest and deliverance. It is noiovorthy that the deliverance did not come through the efforts of any human being or agency, but because of the provisions the Lord had made. This in itself is very significant when properly understood, although wc may not have an opportunity to treat it today. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These two sabbaths are generally understood by the great church systems to apply to the children of Israel only; therefore they ignore them to a great extent. We cannot agree that they are correct in this, but must insist that all scripture given by the inspiration of God is profitable, in fact absolutely essential, that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped to know and serve the Lord, today as well as in the past. We will, however, have to postpone considering these two sabbaths until some future occasion, and center our study particular'v upon the other sabbath mentioned in the Bii y the sabbath day, dealt with in the fourth commandment.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>The Sabbath of the Fourth Commandment</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font7">HE fourth commandment reads as follows: “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Six days shall thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God; in. it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manser-’V vant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is vithin thy gates.'’—Exodus 20:8-10.“</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The application of this commandment has been abused by both Jews and Christians. There have been burdens placed upon the people by the ecclesiastical leaders of both the Jewish and Christian eras which have violated the spirit and purpose of the commandment</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the time of our Lord’s first advent the Jewish religionists had become to a considerable degree formalists, and greater stress was laid upon the literal commandments than on their</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I real spirit and purpose. Jesus reproved this on several occasions, saying to the scribes and Pharisees and doctors of the law, “Ye bind heavy burdens upon the people.” For instance, to hunt for a flea on the sabbath was considered a violation of the fourth commandment, a breakjug of the sabbath. It was claimed that a man who did this, was hunting just as truly as though he was hunting a bear, a lion or a buffalo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A similar instance is called to our attention fey O'Ur Lord in the second chapter of Mark. Fault was found with our Loid’« d’.st p Us because, when passing through a vlmat field, they rubbed out some of the grains with their hands and ate them. This was construed as a violation of the sabbath, because, it was claimed, they wore threshing and winnowing, whether the amount be small or groat. On that occasion Jesus pointed out how nonsensical their conception of t'm sabbath was; and cited the ease of David, who when he was pursued by Saul entered the tabernacle and took of the shewbread, which was lawful only for the priests to eat. The Lord Jehovah, who instituted the sabbath, never condemned David for doing this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">-Jesus did not violate the sabbath, ^either did He teach anyone else to do so. He was a Jew &quot;&nbsp;and hound to keep the Sabbath law in full, and </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">_</span><span class="font7"> TJjfMlid keep it absolutely and completely. But He did object to such nonsensical misconceptions of it as I have just cited. He showed that the sabbath was ordained for man; and that it was a mistake to suppose, as some then and others now seem to suppose, that God made man simply to keep the sabbath. One day of rest to six days of work was intended for man’s comfort and protection and blessing, and at the same time to symbolize certain great lessons.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">ISTORY is repeating itself today. Our present-day ecclesiastics have to a great</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">extent gone in for formalism, and overlook entirely the spirit and purpose of the Lord’s Word. A few days ago I read a letter telling of a lady in one of'our southern cities whoso husband had boon sick and .in bed for two months. Slie had three small children crying for bread, and her husband required medicine; hut she had no money to buy either. On Sunday she was offered employment at which she could earn one dollar and she accepted. The following Wednesday her minister camo to her home and threatened to put her out of the church because she had worked on Sunday. This same minister refused to serve his congregation until he had received his salary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As I read of this sad experience, the words of Jesus occurred to my mind, “Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath day, or evil, so save life, or to killThe Pharisees on that occasion held their peace when Ue looked around on them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of </span><span class="font8">their hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The facts demonstrate that in it groat many eases the real spirit and purpose oE the sabbath is abused today as well as in the past, .lotions such as these committed by our ministers drive more people away from the church and the Bible than all the infidels could ever Lope io do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The sabbath was never intended to become a hindrance to man, but a blessing. Jesus himself tells us that He is the Lord of the sabbath; therefore His interpretation of the sabbath, its purpose and application must be accepted as </span><span class="font8">final.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Has the Sabbath Been Changed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font7">HE next question is, Ilas the sabbath been changed from the seventh to the first day of the week?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For two reasons we totally dissent from the view generally held in the great denominational churches of the present, .which claim that th© sabbath has been changed from the seventh day to the first day of the week:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">First, if we are under the law of which the sabbath observance was a part, then the day mentioned in that command is not the day that they observe. They observe the first, while the fourth commandment designated the seventh day. If the fourth commandment is binding at all, it as well as the other commandments is binding as stated, and cannot be changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Second, if we are bound to the Mosaic law, the keeping of the sabbath in any other way than the way outlined in the fourth commandment is inconsistent. If the commandment is binding upon us, the manner of its observance in every detail is no less binding; and if we find that strict observance of it has passed away, surely whatever destroyed the strict observance of this day destroyed the command entirely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Therefore let us face the real facts of this issue. If this day is to be observed at all, it should be observed with all its former strictness, and it should be observed on the day then prescribed. The only proper reason for a less strict observance of this day, or for the substitution of another day for the one originally stated, would be an order from God Himself to that effect Men have no right to alter or in any wise amend the laws of God. No; not even if an angel from heaven were to sanction the change.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>God Did Not Change the Law</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font16">G</span><span class="font7">OD did not change that law. It stands exactly as it was given, and applies only to those to whom it was given. If, as is claimed by some, it was altered to any degree, or made applicable' peror Constantine (about 321 A. I)) to any other people than the people of Israel, the evidence of such a change should be no less dear and positive than that of its original giving at Mt. Sinai. But no such evidence of a change to another day or to any other people exists, neither any relaxation of its original strictness.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Neither our Lord nor His apostles authorized any such change. They declared that the Jewish law (which included the command relative to the seventh day) was superseded by a new and more comprehensive law, summed up in the one word love; supreme love toward God and love toward one another. Matthew 22:36-40 is to the point: “Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shah love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again, Jesus speaking to the Christian saidt “A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some claim that the first-day sabbath was introduced by an edict of Pope Gregory. And .this is a mistake. The observance of the first day of .the week had its beginning in the fact that it was on that day that our Lord arose from the dead, and that on that day and evening He met with His disciples, and expounded the Scriptures to them, until their hearts burned within them. What wonder that, without any command to do so, they thereafter loved to meet together frequently on that day, to repeat the simple meal, the giving of thanks and the breaking of bread | recounting one with another the gracious promises of God through the prophets and the explanation of some of these given by the Lord Himself I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For a time both days were observed by Christians ; the seventh day from Jewish custom, and because it furnished the disciples their best opportunity for reaching devout Hebrews with the Gospel messages, and the first day of the week in commemoration of our Lord’s resurrection.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">HE earliest record of the observance of Sunday as a legal duty is the constitution of Em-enacting</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">that all courts of justice, inhabitants of towns and workshops were to be at rest on Sunday, with an exception in favor of those engaged in agricultural pursuits. Therefore it is a misstatement to say that Pope Gregory was responsible for the decree changing the observance of the seventh day to the first day in the week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The decretals of Gregory to enjoin Sunday-koeping say, “We decree that all Sundays te observed, from vespers to vespers, and that all unlawful work be abstained from,” must have been issued after Gregory became pope; and he did not become pope until 590 A. D., whey^s Constantine’s decree was issued about 321 A. D., or 270 years before Gregory became pope. Christians had been meeting habitually on Sunday for over 550 years before that event, not as a command but because of the precious memories that day held for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman Catholic Church doos not now, and never did, as far as I am aWare (and I was a member of that church for some twenty-five years), insist upon strict observance of Sunday. In Catholic countries today both priests and people attend service in the forenoon, and give up the afternoon to various forms of pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is, therefore, no Scriptural basis for the belief that the sabbath was changed from the seventh day to the first day of the week, either by our Lord or by His disciples. It could not have been and was not changed by any pope. It stands today as it was originally given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Next question: If the sabbath was not changed to the first day of the week, is the seventh day binding upon Christiansf</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Is t&amp;e </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Seventh Dag Binding Upon Christians?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font7">IOSE of us who are not Jews by nature are not under the Law Covenant, and never were under it; therefore we are not bound by its limitations. Neither Jesus nor His apostles ever placed the Christian under the Law Covenant. They tell us that those under the Law were a house of servants of whom Moses was the head, and as such were in bondage to the law. But of the Christians they teach that they are a house of sons if they stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made them free. —Hebrews 3:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This does not mean liberty to do wrong; bur since Christians are not limited to the Law Covenant, and not bound by its letter, it leaves them free to follow the spirit of the law rather than its letter. This is true of the entire ten commandments as well as of the fourth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The heavenly Father does not address His spirit-begotten children with commandments not to kill, not to steal, etc.; because such commandments to them would be unnecessary. Begotten of God's holy spirit, they love God and reverence Him alone; and they would not think of homag-<sup>r</sup> ing images, nor of profaning His holy name, . nor of doing injury to their neighbor or brother. Any who would do such things would not have the spirit of the Lord, and consequently would be none of His.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the contrary the true Christians<sup>5</sup> love for God would lead them to honor God's name, and serve His cause. And their love for their neighbors as for themselves would prompt them to render them service, doing good unto all men as they have opportunity, especially to the household of faith.—Galatians 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This love the apostle assures us is the fulfil-ing of the law, so far as the Christian is concerned. This is termed the fulfilling of the spirit of the law, by them that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. &quot;For ye are not under the law, but under grace,” the same apostle assures us in Bomans 6:14 and Galatians 5:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If then </span><span class="font7">the seventh </span><span class="font8">day </span><span class="font7">is not binding upon </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font7">Christian, and it was not changed to the </span><span class="font8">।first day of the week, </span><span class="font7">has the Christian no sab-</span><span class="font8">“bath which he is to keep! Yes, indeed; a sabbath that far exceeds these.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>The Purpose of Israel’s Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TN ORDER to appreciate the Christian sabbath, it is necessary to understand the fundamental purpose of Israel’s law, of which the sabbath day was a part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Apostle Paul tells us in Hebrews 10:1 that “the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.” The apostle is here telling us that the law with its rites and sacrifices was only a shadow or a picture, but not the reality, which was still future. This law of itself could never make those who accepted it perfect. Note his words in Romans 8:3, also: “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might he fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The thought here is that Jehovah told Israel, when He made the Law Covenant with them, that if they did the things contained in the law they would live by them. For centuries the nation of Israel individually and collectively tried to get life by keeping the law. But the apostle says that the law could not give them life. Why not? What was wrong with the law? There was nothing wrong with the law. It was perfect, but, says the apostle, “it ivas weak through the flesh.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This does not mean that the law, as a law, was weak. But it does mean that the law was weak in accomplishing its purpose of giving life to the Israelites, not because of itself, but because of the sinfulness of the people of Israel. Because of their fallen and depraved condition they could not keep its perfect requirements. Therefore, instead of their receiving life from it, it only made manifest their imperfections and inability to live up to the perfect standard set by God for those who will receive life from Him. Therefore, because of their hopeless condition thus made manifest (and what was true of the Israelites would be true of any other people ; for if the Israelites could not keep the law perfectly, neither could the Egyptians, Babylonians or Greeks), God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, that He might condemn sin in the flesh. Jesus condemned sin in the flesh by keeping the law of God perfectly, thus manifesting that the law could be kept, by </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">perfect human being who desired to serve God faithfully. This of course also showed that the reason the Israelites could not keep the law was because of their sinful condition. Thus sin in the flesh was condemned as being responsible for keeping man from the blessing that God had offered to the Israelites.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Jesus Opened a New Way to Life</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270921_files/g_E_19270921-10.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Y KEEPING the law in every detail Jesus demonstrated His perfection, and that He had a right to life according to Gods perfect standard. For He did those things that guaranteed Him life. It was this perfect human life to which Jesus had every right that He freely offered as a ransom for all and redeeming them from the condemnation. The Scriptures say He brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel. He opened up a new and living way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Israelites thought when they accepted the terms of the Law Covenant that they had the way to life opened up to them. But the subsequent facts demonstrated that instead of its being a way to life for them, it only manifested that they came short of the divine standards and had. no right to life. Instead of its being a way to life it was a way to condemnation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But Jesus opened up a new way to life, one which they could keep. A new<sup>7</sup> way means a different way. The way that Jesus opened up is different from the way of the law in this, that it provides for the removing of man’s infirmity, which handicapped him under the law. The ransom price provided the necessary merit to cover the deficiencies of those who were willing to come to God through Jesus, through faith in His blood; not faith in their own works by keeping the law, but realizing their inability to keep the law’s perfect requirements, and availing themselves of the divinely provided remedy through the death of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who accept these conditions are free from the law’s requirements. In Colossians 2: 16,17, we read: &quot;Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect to an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days, which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Odst&quot; In other words, these things of the law were only shadows or pictures, but the reality is of Christ. Naturally then, when one sees and has an opportunity to accept the substance of the reality, he would not continue to be satisfied with the shadow.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">0 HAVING in mind the work He was about to do, Jesus issued that wonderful invitation recorded in the 11th chapter of Matthew: &quot;Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” In order to get the proper focus on this text, we must keep in mind the setting. Jesus was speaking to the Jews who, as a people, had been under the Law Covenant for over 1500 years. During all that time they tried to get rest, peace, and life under the Law Covenant, and failed. Now Jesus was saying to them in substance: You have not received life from the law; you have not received even the incidental blessings that the law<sup>7</sup> promised, because you were unable to live up to its requirements. You have not received any real rest, peace or life.’ Now He says, “Come unto me, . . . and I will give you rest.” Yea, He says further, “And ye shall find rest unto your souls.” Jesus was showing them how they could have a real sabbath or rest by accepting the op- I portunity He there opened up. They could cease from, their own works, or labor, and depend on the completed work of Christ in their behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is what the Apostle Paul means in Hebrews 4:3 when he says: “We which have believed do enter into rest.” We have rested from depending on our own efforts to justify ourselves in God’s sight, and are at rest in Christ The Christian does not enter into this rest for one day only, be it the seventh or the first day. His rest is complete in Christ every day and for all time. From the moment they thus enter into their rest of faith by dedicating themselves to the service of Jehovah through Christ, the apostle tells us that there is now no more condemnation to them w’ho are in Christ Jesus*— Romans 8:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again in Romans 5:1: “Being justified by faith [not by works of the law or any other works but by faith], we have peace with God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” They are resting on these promises, and have the peaee of God which passeth all understanding ritiwg in jg their hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Therefore answering our question, “Whieh is the True Sabbath!” we find that the true sabbath of Christians is a rest of faith in the finished work of Christ in their behalf, which enables them to have peace with God, because their disability is removed by His merit, enabling them to render acceptable service to Jehovah. Not that these works which they do. in any sense justifies them in God’s sight. They merely enable them to show their faith and love and loyalty to God for Ills wonderful mercy manifested in their behalf.</span></p>

All who are in the grave will then come forth into His kingdom of peace, where nothing shall hurt or destroy. All -will then realize that their best efforts will have been in vain, and will gladly embrace the opportunity that will be theirs at that time. They will rest from their own works (striving to obtain fife independent of God, and according to their own selfish efforts), and accept the completed work of Christ in their behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is what was pictured in the jubilee-year deliverance of the children of Israel. They were then delivered from their servitude and reestablished in their original God-given inheritance. So, in the kingdom of Christ, the world will be delivered from its bondage to sin and death and slavery to Satan the Devil, and reestablished in that original God-given inheritance which Jehovah gave to father Adam when He said: ‘&quot;Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over it.” Everyone will have a real rest, and peace and life when each sees, and avails himself of, the glorious sabbath arrangement that Jehovah has for His intelligent creatures.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Pittsburgh:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here the Almighty caused two great waterways, draining divergent sections of a richly endowed country, to taect and form another and greater water highway, leading to an entirely different and greater section of a vast undeveloped territory. Then Tie seemingly led to this section the great railroads builders, and pointed out to them the &quot;Gateway to the West”, that vast uncharted, unknown, and unexplored land that was to add so much to the great wealth of a new nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here the Creator had endowed the land with natural resources from which mankind was to fashion this great wealth and the necessities, comforts and luxuries of life that8o rapidly advance civilization. Here, almost within «ound of my voice, and seemingly preparing the way for this great achievement, He placed the vast deposits of Coal, that later were to play go prominent a part in the Aewlopmot of the steel industry in this locality. Within easy access, too, were placed the limestone deposits, rjuasrito and mines of this mineral now being worked in almost every one of the twenty-seven counties of Western Pennsylvania; silica sand that was the founda-tion the glass industry, vast forests of lumber of all ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wonderful watersheds that replenished the swift-</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">And then, to develop these natural resources to the advantage of humanity, men, strong men, men endowed with an indomitable courage, were raised up and led into the &quot;Promised Land”, men of Irish, Scotch and Weigh, ancestry, the Celt and the Anglo-Saxon, whose hearts had been stirred with a restlessness begot of religious and political oppression. These men with hearts of oak and the strong grip of the lion’s paw were led here to raise high the banner of freedom and liberty in the name of Him who had prepared the way. Jt is to these men, it is to this ancestry, that Pittsburgh looks for the spirit that has made it what it is today.</span></p>

In His wisdom God has permitted that period to be lengthened that mankind might see and appreciate the value of righteousness. God promised that He would provide one who would be the Deliverer of mankind from all suffering and oppression and bring to the people lasting blessings of peace and prosperity. That promise was first made to Abraham, and later to Isaac and Jacob. Then came Moses, and the Lord dedared that Moses and the work he did foreshadowed the great Deliverer and the work He should do. The promise of God and the pictures made by those whom He used foretold the birth of a child who should be the Emancipator and Blesser of the human race. Of course the child must be born and grow to manhood’s estate. Then He must provide the ransom price, and later set up God’s kingdom through which the blessing must come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This has required a long period of time. This morning we will consider the birth of the child who becomes the Mighty One, and the attempt </span><span class="font8">of Satan </span><span class="font7">to destroy the Deliverer and prevent </span><span class="font8">mankind </span><span class="font7">from receiving the blessings intended. </span><span class="font8">These </span><span class="font7">facte should enable all to better under</span><span class="font8">stand </span><span class="font7">why there is today so much opposition to </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font7">proclamation of God’s truth, and why Satan and his agencies are employing every possible means to keep the people in the dark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For more than 4000 years the hope of real Jews has been centered in the Messianic kingdom. For nearly 2000 years Christians have based their hope upon the same thing. It is of the greatest importance that the people now understand these facts in order that they may appreciate what is daily happening in the world. The chief purpose of this radio station is to aid the people to acquire such knowledge and to receive this service without monetary consideration. It is easy to understand then why Satan would oppose this station and its message.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In the city of Nazareth in the land of Galilee there dwelt a virgin named Mary, She WM a direct descendant of Nathan, one of the sons of David, therefore of the house of David and of the tribe of Judah. At the time she was espoused to Joseph, who was also of the tribe of Judah, of the house of David and a descendant of Solomon. Unto this humble Hebrew woman the Lord God sent His angel Gabriel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manlier of salutation this should be. And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel answered and said unto her, The holy spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.&quot; —Luke 1:28-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan, having access to heaven and watching the movements of the righteous messengers of God, would be on the alert to learn anything concerning the “seed of promise”. He must have known of this mighty angel coming from the courts of heaven to visit the virgin of Galilee. He must have heard the announcement to her that she was to conceive and give birth to a son and that this son would be the “seed of promise&quot; which in due time would destroy the Devil and his works. In keeping with his wickedness Satan began to lay his plans to have the babe destroyed. Mark the subtle and wicked way that he went about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under the law a woman guilty of adultery was subject to be stoned to death. (Leviticus 20:10) Being espoused to Joseph Mary was, under the Jewish arrangement, then to all intents and purposes his wife and subject to the law, Satan sought to have Joseph make a pub</span><span class="font8">lic </span><span class="font7">exhibition of her, which would have meant that she would have been publicly executed; and </span><span class="font8">by </span><span class="font7">so doing the unborn child would have been killed. But the Lord God thwarted Satan’s pur</span><span class="font8">poses. </span><span class="font7">Joseph, being a just man, had no desire to make a public example of Mary by having her brought before the executors and stoned to death, but had determined in his own mind to privately rid himself of her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“'Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the holy spirit. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privately. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the holy spirit. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.”—Matthew 1:18-21.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">(Daniel 12:4) The radio and airships are amongst the marvels of the age. Imagine the curtains of night having been drawn and silence brooding like a silent spirit over the earth. In </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font7">quietness of his bedchamber a man rests, </span><span class="font8">but </span><span class="font7">sleep is gone from his eyes. Stretching out </span><span class="font8">his </span><span class="font7">arm he touches the dial of his receiving set and turns it.

His heart responds in gladness. Then suddenly </span><span class="font8">through </span><span class="font7">the thick darkness there also bursts a flood of light, and he beholds in the canopy </span><span class="font8">above him a </span><span class="font7">great fleet of airships illuminated </span><span class="font8">with </span><span class="font7">myriads of lights and carrying a multitude of swqet singers.

It pales into insignificance when compared with what transpired on the </span><span class="font8">night of </span><span class="font7">the birth of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Four thousand years had sped by since the tragedy in Eden. Two thousand years had gone since God had called to Abraham and said: “I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sands upon the sea shore; ... in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” (Genesis 22:17,18) During all that period of time the peoples of earth had groaned in pain and travailed in suffering, waiting for the time of deliverance. Throughout that period the angels of heaven, in harmony with God, had been watching for the birth of him who would be the Savior of the world. The time drew on when this great event was to transpire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The earthly preparation was simple and is told in a few words. No amount of preparation that man could have made would have added any dignity or honor to that occasion. The Lord God saw to it that not one of the Devil’s earthly representatives was permitted to witness the birth of his beloved One. The Pharisees and other ecclesiastics of that day posed before the people as the representatives of God, even as the clergy do now; but not one of these was called to witness the birth of the Redeemer of man. On the contrary God selected a few plain and honest watchmen of sheep to he the witnesses to this unparalleled event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In heaven the preparation was on a more elaborate scale. To Gabriel had been assigned the honorable duty of journeying from the courts of Jehovah as bearer of the message to the virgin ’Mary (hat she should bear a son who would deliver the peoples from their enemies and restore the obedient ones to full fellowship with God. Nine months had elapsed since the delivery of that all-important message. In the meantime Gabriel had returned to heaven and doubtless communed with many others of the holy angels of heaven, advising them of his commission to earth. There are millions of such glorious creatures before the throne of God. (Daniel 7:10) The great Jehovah would issue the order for the organization of a multitude of the heavenly host to act as a guard of honor to accompany the special messenger to earth, there to testify to the birth of His beloved Son. There* must have been tremendous rejoicing in heaven and songs of boundless praise to God v’hen this mighty throng began its journey to earth. Probably some few days would be required to make the journey from the Pleiades to the earth; and while the heavenly messengers proneeded on their way the stage on earth was being set</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Joseph and Mary, responding to the decree of Csesar to report for the purpose of being taxed, were on their way to Bethlehem. Joseph was a man of small means, but honest; and above all he served Jehovah God. He would not have a great retinue of servants with him, nor would the populace hail him by the way and bow before him or kiss his toe. How unlike men of the present time who think they are charged with some exalted duty and privilege! With his virgin wife seated upon an ass, and with staff in hand, he trudged by her side over the hills and through the valleys, unaccompanied by visible attendants. Satan knew where this blessed man and woman were going, and the reason why; and without a doubt he would have slain them by the way had not God prevented him. It is equally certain that some of the holy angels of heaven were delegated to walk by the side of Joseph and his bride, and when they stopped to rest these messengers would encamp about them and guard them from the assaults of the enemy and save them from all harm.-—Psa. 34: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After a few days of hard journeying they arrived at Bethlehem, late in the evening, and found all the available space in the lodging houses occupied. From place to place they went and applied; and each time being turned away they finally found a place to rest where the cattle were usually housed. What a fit place for the Savior of the world to be born!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was night time. The shepherds had gathered their flocks into the corral and were keeping watch lest the wild beasts should carry some away. These were plain, humble but kindly men; otherwise the Lord would not have used them. They were familiar with the promises God had made to their forefathers. It is not unreasonable to think that even at that very time they were recounting to each other these promises and discussing the future, that some day the Lord should send to them a King who would deliver them from the Roman yoke. They would be familiar with the prophecies concerning the coming of the King and Deliverer; and with no light by which they might read, and while they must be awake and watching, they would sit and talk about the things dear to their hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The hour had now come. The heavenly throng was due. God does everything on time. In the van of this marching heavenly host was one mighty angel of God, to whom had been delegated the authority to announce the birth of the beloved Son. Probably this angel was Gabriel, because he had been sent on the previous mission to Mary, As they came near to Bethlehem, doubtless the multitude halted while the leader of that heavenly company advanced and made announcement to the humble men who were to be the witnesses of the birth of Jesus. The shepherds watched their flocks, waiting for the dawn of day. “And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.”—Luke 2: 9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The glory of the Lord shone round about these shepherds; and that glory must have been a great light in the heavens, because usually the glory of the Lord appeared, unto witnesses in this manner. (Acts 9:3) That was a far more wonderful and beautiful light than all the illuminated fleets of airplanes that could fly over cities in modern times. Then there fell upon the ears of that shepherd company sweet strains of music such as no mortal ear had ever heard. It was a song of the mighty host of angels that had accompanied this special one from heaven. This chief messenger who had made the announcement was now joined by a multitude of the heavenly host singing praises to God; and this is what the shepherds heard: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”-—Luke 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not only was that a sweet and melodious soilg but it was a prophecy that He who was born at that hour in the city of David would in God’s due time vindicate the name of His Father, bring peace on earth and establish good will between and toward all men. This song of the multitude of angels must have been wafted back to heaven and there joined in by all the holy, ones before the throne of the Almighty Godl As the sweet anthem thundered on through space the very stars and planets would dance for joy and join in the song of praise. We are told that they did this very thing when God laid the foundation of the earth as a place for the habitation of perfect man. (Job 38:7) How much more must they have sang the songs of praise when He was born who would save mankind and </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">make</span><span class="font7"> earth a fit place in which to live!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Who was this One now born in the manger at Bethlehem, and whence had He come? The record of God is that in the beginning He was the Logos. He was the first and only direct creation of God. Thereafter He was the active agent of Jehovah in creating all tilings that were created. In obedience to the will of Almighty God His life was now transferred from the spirit to the human plane. The Logos was ‘made flesh and dwelt amongst men<sup>5</sup>, that He might take away the sin of the world.—John 1:1-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God had foretold through His prophet that the mighty Euler and Deliverer should be born in the city of Bethlehem. (Micah 5:2) In due time and at the proper place this prophecy had been fulfilled, and nothing Satan could do could in any wise interfere with the progression of the divine plan. Of course Satan would know about the birth and about the announcement of the birth made by the holy angels of heaven. We may even be sure that another company of mighty angels of God would keep Satan and his l^^wicked angels back from interfering with the |^®»irth of the Savior. This wonderful event and this marvelous manifestation of the power of ' God should have served to convince all those angels who had fallen away with Satan that Jehovah God is all-powerful, that nothing can prevent Him from carrying out His plan, and that their hope of eternal life and blessing would be for ever Hasted by their continuing to follow Satan. It should have been sufficient to even induce Satan to cease his wrongful course. But Satan, doubtless totally depraved and fatally bent on continuing in wickedness, still pursued his nefarious course and drew along with him a host of evil ones as his assistants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">S</span><span class="font7">ATAN the enemy began to devise ways and means for the destruction of the babe Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Homans were in control of Palestine; and Herod acted as a petty ruler and king under the supervision and control of the Romans. He was &amp;&nbsp;very wicked man and a willing instrument in the DeviFs hands. He would not hesitate to de-0fetroy anyone who he thought might interfere with his occupancy of the office of king. He was ®» of those eonsmnceless and wicked politicians who would resort to any mean and wrongful act, and stop at nothing to accomplish his purposes. Yielding to the influence of Satan he had put himself in this position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the same time there dwelt in Persia savants or wise men, so-called. They were sorcerers and magicians who worshiped the stars and other objects, which is proof conclusive that they were isolators and worshiped the Devil. (1 Corinthians 10:20) Magicians or men of this kind were employed by the various rulers of the Devil’s organization, as advisers. These &quot;wise men” were mediums, through whom the adversary operated. Satan used such as his visible instruments at various times. (Exodus 7:11) Many of them may have been sincere men, but they had been overreached by the Devil and had turned away from the true and living God to worship anything except the Lord Jehovah. Being tools in the hands of the enemy Satan, he could use them to carry out his wicked schemes, the details of which they would not even understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These so-called wise men of the east were astrologers who believed that a star is assigned for each creature when born into the world, according to his relative importance. There are many incidents showing that Satan and his wicked angels have power to produce lights and to cause them to move through space and to make them appear like stars. We know, however, that stars do not move in this way. Satan caused a light to appear to these astrologers, which had the appearance of a star; and he induced them to believe that this was the star of the child born to be King of the Jew’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The enemy’s scheme was to bring these wise men to Herod and have them inquire of the king, “Where is the one born to be King of the Jew’s?’ That information would immediately start the thought of murder in the heart of Herod, and he would seach out the babe and have it murdered lest it should interfere with his kingdom. The Lord God let the enemy Satan carry out Ills scheme until the danger point, then held him back. Subsequent facts show that it must have been between one and two years after the birth of Jesus that the Devil attempted to carry out his conspiracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Joseph and Mary were then living in a house at Bethlehem. These astrologers or wise men appeared before Herod and said: “Where is he that is born King of the Jews ? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.” (Matthew 2:2) The information which they brought Herod upon this occasion troubled him and his official family. The first thing he thought of was his clergy allies, the priests and Pharisees. He sent a messenger and gathered them in before him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Without a doubt the Devil was invisibly present, directing each move of Herod; in fact, moving all parties to the conspiracy like as a player moves his pawns upon a chess board. When the clergy appeared before the king he demanded of them to tell him where Christ should be born. (Matthew 2:4-6) Then Herod, directed by his superlprd the Devil, next arranged a private audience with the &quot;wise men” and got all the information possible from them concerning the “star” that they had seen. Without doubt Satan engineered this in such a way that Herod would think that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font7"> was carrying out the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then lierod gave the order that these men should be sent to Bethlehem. (Matthew 2:8) Here is another glaring ease of hypocrisy. We recall how hypocrisy had its first appearance. The Devil sees to it that it crops out always at the proper time for his purposes. Little would Herod worship the Lord God or His beloved Son when He was found. He had no thought of so doing. His purpose was to locate the babe that he might murder Him. The astrologers started on their way to Bethlehem; and the Devil saw to it that the light, supposed to be a star, went before them. Let it here be noted that stars do not move first from east to west and then from south to north, nor in any other direction at the suggestion or whims of men nor for the purpose of guiding men. This of itself is proof that the light was not a star, even though these men doubtless thought it was a star. It was a light produced by the Devil, as one of the means for carrying out his wicked conspiracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The three astrologers arrived at Bethlehem. “And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.” (Matthew 2:11) The babe was. now located, and Satan thought he was about at the point where he would soon have the child destroyed. But God interfered;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child, to destroy him. When he arose, he took, the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son. Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.”—Matthew 2:12-16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fact that Herod caused all the children of two years and under to be slain is proof that it was more than a year after the birth of Jesus that this conspiracy was carried out. To thwart the wicked designs of the enemy and to preserv^ His beloved Son God moved Him into Egy^^ and there kept Him until Herod’s death. (Matthew 2:19-21) Later Joseph and Mary refurrfefih* to their native city of Nazareth, and there the lad was subject to Joseph and His mother until He attained the age of His majority.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">(John 18:37) When He readied His legal majority at- thirty years of age He began His miu-istry, that the purposes of God might be accomplished. His first act was to report to John at the Jordan, asidng to be baptized. He was a perfect man. Why should He be baptized? Baptism or water immersion is a symbol of being buried or put to death. The baptism of Jesus ■was a symbolic representation of the fact that Jesus, at a great sacrifice to Himself, had yielded unto His Father to do His Father's will, no matter what that will might be, even unto death. (Matthew 3:15-17) John, in putting Jesus under the water and raising Him up out the water, represented Jehovah; and symbolically this act declared: Jesus is in ths hands ot</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Father to do His Father’s will, to lem-jdbh His Father’s purposes, and this will lead to Hb death; but the Father will raise Him up out (rf death. Here at the Jordan He fulfilled What the prophet had before said for Him: “Lo, I eojne: ... to do thy will, 0 my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.”—Psalm 40:7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the </span><span class="font7">time of Jesus’ baptism in the Jordan </span><span class="font8">it is </span><span class="font7">written concerning Him that “the heavens </span><span class="font8">were </span><span class="font7">opened unto him, and he saw the spirit of </span><span class="font8">God </span><span class="font7">descending like a dove, and lighting upon </span><span class="font8">him: </span><span class="font7">and, io, a voice from heaven, saying, This </span><span class="font8">is </span><span class="font7">my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”; tons giving an outward demonstration to John aS a witness that this was God’s beloved Son, born to be the Deliverer of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan </span><span class="font7">the enemy did not miss so important an occasion as this. No doubt he heard these </span><span class="font8">words of approval </span><span class="font7">spoken concerning Jesus. He immediately began to devise ways and means for the destruction of Jesus. He knew that the </span><span class="font8">life of Jesus depended </span><span class="font7">upon His being loyal </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font7">faithful unto God His Father. Satan was egotistical enough to believe chat he could induce Je</span><span class="font8">ws to </span><span class="font7">he unfaithful to Jehovah and thereby </span><span class="font8">bring </span><span class="font7">about self-destruction. Jesus had been </span><span class="font8">Jforty </span><span class="font7">days and nights in the barren mountain without food and, of course, would be hungry at </span><span class="font8">the end of </span><span class="font7">that long fast. Satan seized the opportunity to present to Him a temptation, ap</span><span class="font8">pealing to His </span><span class="font7">fleshly wants and needs, which temptation on the face of it seemed innocent; </span><span class="font8">and yet, </span><span class="font7">if yielded to, Satan knew it would lead </span><span class="font8">to the </span><span class="font7">death of Jesus. He said to Jesus: “If thou be th? Son of God, command that these stones </span><span class="font8">be </span><span class="font7">made bread.” (Matthew 4: 3) He thought of </span><span class="font8">that Jesus would say: I will make myself sw bread and satisfy my hunger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To be loyal means to be obedient to the letter </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font7">spirit of the divine law. The law of God is His expressed will, particularly that which is </span><span class="font8">written </span><span class="font7">in the Scriptures. To be faithful means </span><span class="font8">io be </span><span class="font7">uncompromisingly devoted to the Lord at </span><span class="font8">all times, and never </span><span class="font7">at any time to render alle</span><span class="font8">giance to </span><span class="font7">another or to even sympathize with a </span><span class="font8">course-</span><span class="font7">contrary to that of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Doubtless Jesus possessed the power to chaage the stones into bread and by that means to satisfy His hunger. The argument might be wtwmtod: What harm will result to any one from making bread of those stones? The anew is, God had not commanded Him so to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It ww the will of God that Jess* shook! be gov-. erned by God’s expressed will, and to await tha Father’s due time to direct Him in what coarse He should take. Being faithful to the Father He refused to yield to this temptation, and responded to Satan: “It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that </span><span class="font7">proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” (Matthew 4:4) Otherwise stated, bread may be needed for the natural requirements of the body, but such will not sustain life except temporarily. Life is a gift from God, and he who possesses life must abide by the word that proceeds from the mouth of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then the Devil tried another method. He knew that Jesus was born to be King of the Jews. “If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.” (Matthew 4: 6) Paraphrasing Satan’s words, he said to Jesus something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“You have come for the purpose of setting up a kingdom, to be King of the Jews. You are going about it in a poor way. Your conduct is that of a meek and lowly one of heart By pursuing this course you will have great difficulty in convincing the people that you are King. There is a lot of rich men in this country, and there are associated with them scheming politicians ; and of cot rse the priests are with them, likewise the scribes and Pharisees. They are men of great influence, to whom the people look for advice. Before you can accomplish anything you will have to do something to overshadow their greatness and thereby convince the people that you are sent from heaven. Why not demonstrate to them that you are sent of God? No man has ever gone upon that temple spire and jumped off. You now .go up to the top of the temple and jump down into the valley below. You being the Son of God, your Father will see to it that you are not injured; and then the people will say, Surely you are sent from God and are not a man; and they will make you king immediately. In proof of what I say’, that God will not let you be injured, it is written that h«* shall give His angels charge concerning you and in their hands they shall bear you up test at any time you dash your foot against a stone.”—• Psalm 91:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This was a subtle and wily temptation, but it did not induce the Lord Jesus to be disloyal to God. For the Lord Jesus to yield to this would be to tempt His Father and suffer destruction. Therefore Jesus replied to Satan: “It is written again, Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God.&quot; (Matthew 4:7) .Again tl:«e Devil. bed failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ard now Satan must try one more &lt;wbome to Sf'O if he could not accomplMi his pnryoM God nu de Ldeifcr overlord ef the world, and when he b' came Z'Utm this commission oad rot boo a tok-m an ay from him. He was at that time the god </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I..&quot;</span><span class="font7"> the wboh- world. Paul so states in 2 Cor. 4:3,4. Jesus always recognized Satan as the “■ linen of this world&quot;, and did not deny Lis title. (Jo’m 12: A.) Ami now Satan laid be.ore Jesu-' a mbtlo temptation. To paraphrase Lis language, he said: “All the kingdoms of this world are mine and ad the glory of them. Yim recognize That I am the prince and rider of this world. Ykm have come for the purpose of being king. In order for you. to be king of the world vou will have to oirnt me. But I will surrender to yon now. I will give you all the kingdoms of this wo?Id; and T will ask but one thing of you, and that is: If you will fall down and worship me.” —Matthew 4: 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan at that time again manifested his insatiable desire to be worshiped. He knew, also, that if the Lord Jesus should worship him for one minute, then Jehovah God would take away from Jesus all His rights and privileges. Yet Satan was egotistical enough and presumptuous enough to believe that he could induce Jesus to take that course. lie was maliciously bent, on Jesus’ destruction. The reply of Jesus showed His utter eontesn.pt of the tempter and the temptation. fie said: “Get thee hence, Satori: tor it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy Ged, and him only shalt thou serve.” (Matthew </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font7">:10) Here was positive testimony that every creature in the universe at some time must choose between the worship of God and the worship of evil, and that in God’s due time sufficient knowledge will In brought to every man that he v ill have an opportunity thus to choose. Satan had lltitod in this temptation. The Lord Jesus had won the victory, and it is written: “Then the devil maveth him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">S.-.fan did not cease his persecution of Jesus, but continued it as long as Jesus was on the earth. Satan Las opposed and persecuted every tw■ and horeit follower of Christ Jesus from th:,t time till now. There is today a great or-gau'zs'tion on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font7"> arih called Christendom or or-ganizid ChrGtiaiiiiy.

In modern times Satan has caused hypocrites to call themselves by God's name and their company has organized Christianity in order to deceive the people. In these lectures I shall continue to point out these facts leading up to the present time, that the people may be able to see and understand why a crisis is approaching and why there is a groat change just at hand and that the change will be tor the betterment of manlund.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Bible Questions and Answers</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font7">WAS taught in the Roman Catholic Church that there are two judgments: One at death, When one goes to heaven, hell, or purgatory; </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font7">the other judgment at the general resurrection. I am beginning to think that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I am</span><span class="font7"> on the wrong track.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: We wish to compliment this listener on the fact that he is beginning to do his own thinking; and we can say if he keeps on thinking according to the Bible and seeks to live pleasing to the Lord he will soon be on the right track. The Bible in no place teaches that an individual is judged two times, once al death and another time at the resurrection. Neither is there probation or purgatory between death and the resurrection. The final judgment of the individual who has come to a knowledge of the truth and walks according to the truth is at death. In Revelation 2:10 we read, ‘‘Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.” There are very few people who are on trial now for eternal life, and these are the individuals who have come to a knowledge of the truth as contained in the Bible. The world of mankind in general, including all the heathen, .have not had their first chance yet; they will be on trial during the kingdom time. These individuals, coming forth from the graves, will learn of the Lord’s truth in the kingdom, and as a result they will there be placed on trial. It is written concerning Christ Jesus that He comes to judge the quick and the dead. This means that those living when He returns will be placed pn trial in the kingdom, and that billions of the heathen will be called from the tombs of death and he placed on trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">UESTION: You say that the dead do not know anything. I believe that is correct.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270921_files/g_E_19270921-16.png" alt="" style="width:16pt;height:22pt;">

<p><span class="font7">Does it not follow that although one were dead several centuries he would not be aware of it until the resurrection, and the long period of time would not seem long to the one awakened at all!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: That is the correct thought. One who is dead and entirely unconscious, according fo the Scriptures could not realize the lapse of time. Although dead for several centuries the individual, upon awakening from the tomb </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font7">the resurrection, will believe that he had been asleep but a short time. It will only be after he has learned of the long time that has elapsed that he will be aware of the period of his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To many the instant of awakening will be connected up only with the instant of becoming unconscious. It will be much like the experience in a New York hospital. A certain individual undergoing an operation became unconscious in the midst of speaking a sentence; and several days later, when becoming conscious, the same individual immediately completed the sentence, not realizing the time that had elapsed. That the dead are unconscious is abundantly borne out by the Scriptures. In Ecclesiastes 9:5 we read, “The living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing.” In Ecclesiastes 9: .10 we read, “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.” Jesus lias promised that the dead will be resurrected by first being awakened from the tombs of death. In John 5:28, 29 we read, “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his [the voice of the Son of man] voice, and shall come forth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question : Please explain Hebrews 6:4-6, “For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, ... if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: inis passage relates to a class of individuals whose sin will not be forgiven. If an individual was once enlightened by the truth and recognized what it is, and has been begotten by the holy spirit of God, then turns away from the truth and refuses to be guided by the Bible, such an one cannot return to God through repentance. Such an individual, having learned of the good things which the Lord has in reservation for His children, by renouncing the truth ■would not show appreciation for the love of God. Such an individual quenches and kills the influence of the holy spirit by his conduct, and he ceases to be a member in the body of Christ. An evidence of those once enlightened by the truth and who have committed this unpardonable sin is that they persist in teaching error which is contrary to the plain teaching of the Bible, and persecute those who speak the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God’s Covenant with Israel</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">IA</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font7">M CONSIDERING the Lord's dealings with the children of Israel we have noticed that the Lord never talked directly with the people, and that the people did not talk directly to Jehovah. God spoke to Moses who, in turn, declared His message to the people. There are two very good reasons why the Lord did not talk directly to the Israelites, and every girl and hoy should know them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first reason is that God has nothing to do with wicked people, sinners. God listens to and answers only the righteous. The second reason is that He was making a great picture for our benefit. The Israelites pictured the vhole world of mankind steeped in sin and wickedness; and Moses represented Christ, who is to ho the great Mediator between God and man in bringing the blessings of life, peace and happiness to all mankind in God’s due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The children of Israel camped around Mt. Sinai for nearly a year. On one occasion Moses took seventy of the elders of Israel, and Aaron, with his two sons, and Joshua to the foot of the mountain to worship Jehovah; and there the Lord appeared to them and told Moses to come on up to the top of the mountain and receive the law which the finger of God had written on two tables of stone. Moses spent more than a month on the mountain; and the people became very impatient and thought surely that Moses had simply run away and left them, and that the Lord had deserted them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The nations who were living in the land of Canaan at this time all worshiped idols, just as did the people of Egypt. The Israelites demanded of Aaron that he make them an idol which they could see and worship. The Lord heard the noise made by the people worshiping their imitation god; and He became so angry that he threatened to come down and destroy them. Moses was very considerate of the people and defended them in an eloquent manner before Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the Lord had agreed to spare the people, He delivered to Moses the two tables of the law, and instructed him to go down and destroy the golden ealf which the people had made. Moses started down the mountainside with the two tables of the law, and was later joined by Joshua, who had been waiting for him Im the </span><span class="font8">mountain for all these forty days.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">J</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As they neared the camp of the Israelites and beheld the people dancing and worshiping the golden ealf, Moses became so angry that Me threw the two tables of the law to the ground, and they were broken to pieces. When he arrived at the camp, he had the golden ealf ground to powder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While Moses was in the mountain the Lord had given him careful details concerning the construction of a special tabernacle with its pieces of furniture. The material with which to build the tabernacle and all of its furnishings was to be supplied by the people, willingly. The tabernacle was constructed and properly dedicated to the service of Jehovah by Moses and Aaron. Then the same fiery cloud which the people had seen on Jit. Sinai appeared and settled directly over the tabernacle, showing the Lord's presence with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">More than this, the people agreed to perform everything which Jehovah had asked of Muses while he was in the mountain. Moses reported this to the Lord, and De renewed His promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Moses was again called to the top of Mt. tsinai by the Lord, and instructed to come alone and^ to see that no other person or beast was on or near the mountain. Moses was instructed io bring two tables of stone which he was to hew out and to finish with a smooth surface. When everything was in readiness the Lord dictated the Ten Commandments and the words of the covenant between Himself and the people, white Moses wrote them on the tables of stone. It will be remembered that the Lord himself wrote the first law on tables; but when Moses in his anger threw them to the ground and broke them, it was necessary that he himself should rewrite the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This also is a valuable picture to us, showing how God wrote His law in the heart of father Adam, which law Adam deliberately broke in the garden of Eden by disobeying God. Six thousand years of sin and death have almost destroyed this law in the hearts of men, and now the world is filled with wickedness. When Christ’s kingdom is established the law is to be rewritten in men’s hearts; and every man will be taught to love his neighbor as himself, and to do unto others as he would have them do wato^ him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">171. God loved His only Son very much. But , He loved the world, too, and was willing to have His Son come to the earth, as a perfect man, and Sie, so that Adam’s life might be paid for, or mfcemed, and thus everybody has the chance Jo live always and always and never die at all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">172. God invites us to reason with Him. He </span><span class="font8">wants us to </span><span class="font7">see </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font7"> He does things. He tells us: “Come now, and let us reason together, </span><span class="font8">saith the </span><span class="font7">Lord.” When we see the reason why </span><span class="font8">the Logos </span><span class="font7">was made a man, and why He was a perfect man while on earth, then we are very </span><span class="font8">, happy </span><span class="font7">and thankful to our loving heavenly r Father, aren’t we?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">173. We know that before Jesus came to earth, He was the Logos, the Creator of everything, Under God’s direction. He was a very great and beautiful being, all glorious like God Himself. When God sent Him to earth, He became a man, a real man; and they called Him Jesus, for He .Was humble and gentle. He was a perfect man, ’ and God allowed the people to kill Him so that the life which Adam had lost might be regained </span><span class="font8">for </span><span class="font7">everyone. But after Jesus died, what hap-<sub>t</sub> pened to Him? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">174. God raised Jesus from the state of death, ^^^and gave Him a wonderful spirit nature, or ~ body, again, which He will keep for ever and &quot;&nbsp;fever. The Bible says: “For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God: being put to death in the flesh, but quickened [made alive] in the spirit”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">175. In another place it says that Jesus, the Lord, is placed in heaven far above the angels, and that he “sitteth on the right hand of God”. I Surely that is the very greatest honor anyone ■n hare, isn’t it?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">F176. Yes, indeed! The Bible tells us that ■hrist, the Son of God, will return to the earth »r a very special purpose. We shall find out st what this purpose is, a littlfe later. At</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">i ’ we want to know just how Jesus will</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">177. God is so wise that He has caused parts </span><span class="font8">of the </span><span class="font7">Bible to be written in such a way that </span><span class="font8">they act as </span><span class="font7">calendars; and by comparing these </span><span class="font8">parts of </span><span class="font7">His Word with history, and with events </span><span class="font8">that are </span><span class="font7">happening right now, we can see that </span><span class="font8">K it is time </span><span class="font7">for certain things to happen which </span><span class="font8"><sup>j</sup>wre foretold many, many years ago. One of </span><span class="font7">these things is the return of our great Redeemer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">178. God tells us that Christ </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">wiU</span><span class="font7"> return to the earth; so we know for certain that this will surely happen at some time, for what our heavenly Father says must and will happen. But we want to know when and how Jesus, the Logos, will return.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">179. Now just see the great and wonderful wisdom of God! He tells us that at the time of Christ’s return, certain signs would be present in the earth. These signs were, among others, a world war, great famines (seasons of high prices), terrible sickness, and also an increase of knowledge; that is, men would have a greater knowledge of many things at that time than ever before.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">180. By this means people who study the Word of God have learned to watch for these signs. And now at last we see that they have come; for during the last forty or fifty years men have learned a whole lot more about many things than ever before, and surely of late there have been more wars and troubles in the earth than in all its previous history.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Questions on Study Twenty-Three</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">IE enemy has attempted to induce the people to believe that the International Bible Students Association is another religious sect operated for selfish purposes. If this representation is not true, then what is the International Bible Students Association? The representation is not true. The International Bible Students Association is an aggregation or association of Christian people who are performing their part of the divinely-given commission as set forth by the prophet of God in the above text. A more detailed explanation seems proper at this time; hence it is given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jesus was on earth he began to fulfil the commission above mentioned by the Prophet Isaiah. He specifically applied it to himself. When he had finished his earthly course, he sent forth his disciples and told them that they must carry on the work which he had begun, and that he would be with them to the end. The apostles did as they were commanded. They told the good news of God’s great provision for the redemption and deliverance of the peoples of earth. By and through Christ Jesus and his apostles God planted his church “a noble vine, wholly a right seed”. (Jeremiah 2: 21) Then within a short time thereafter Satan the enemy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">planted the false seed amongst the true. — Matthew 13: 28, 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Diplomatically and hypocritically selfish men entered the church and used that organization for their own personal aggrandizement. Posing as representatives of the Lord, and calling themselves by the name of the Lord, they became and were the representatives of the world, which is the Devil’s organization. The apostles had warned the church against this very subtle course of the enemy. “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God ? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.”—James 4: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The proof of the fulfilment of these prophetic utterances is found in the records of secular history, a part of which is quoted, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy, ambitious and worldly, sought rank and distinction. They even thronged the courts of princes and aspired to temporal honors. They were no longer supported by the voluntary contributions of the faithful, but by revenues supplied by government, or property inherited from the old [pagan] temples. Great legacies were made to the Church by the rich, and these the clergy controlled. These bequests became sources of inexhaustible wealth. As wealth increased and was intrusted to the clergy, they became in-diiferent to the wants of the people—no longer supported by them. They became lazy, arrogant and independent. The people were shut out of the government of the Church. The bishop became a grand personage who controlled and appointed his clergy. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Church teas allied with the State, </span><span class="font6">and religious dogmas were enforced by the sword of the magistrate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">AN IMPOSING HIERARCHY WAS ESTABLISHED, OF VARIOUS GRADES, WHICH CULMINATED IN THE BISHOP OF ROME.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Emperor decided points of faith, and the clergy were exempted from the burdens of the state. There was a great flocking to the priestly offices when the clergy wielded so much power and became so rich; and men were elevated to great sees [bishoprics], not because of their piety or talents, but their influence with the great. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The mission of the Church was lost sight of in a degrading alliance with the State.</span><span class="font6"> Christianity was a pageant, a ritualism, an arm of the State, a vain philosophy, a superstition, a formula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Catholic system, organized in the name of the Lord, soon became a mighty component part of the Devil’s organization. The true worship of God was forgotten, and there was substituted formalism instead, and the Devil’s organization paraded in the name of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the course of time the Reformation was started. Luther made a bold stroke for religious freedom. Much good was done toward turning the minds of the people back to the true worship of God. But soon the Lutheran organization was captured by the enemy and made a part of the earthly organization. Many good, honest Christians were held in bondage both to the Catholic and to the Lutheran organizations, not knowing a better place to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In due course the Calvinistie system was organized with many good Christians within its ranks; and it also contained many hypocrites. This organization in turn was overreached by the enemy and became a part of Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Added to this list is the Episcopalian, or Church of England; then came the Wesleyan, the Baptists, the Methodists, the Campbellites and many other organizations. Every one of these contained some true Christians and a greater number of diplomatic agents of Satan the enemy. All of these so-called church organizations combined and affiliated with the political part of Satan’s organization, and there properly applies to them the name of Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During all the period of 1500 years and more errors and ceremonial forms crowded out the truth. Many of the great fundamental truths taught by Jesus and the disciples were hidden under the debris and traditions of false teachers. Many of these truths were never known by truly consecrated ones, because they were hidden before many Christians had heard of the Lord. During all that period of time some true Christians walked along in the same way and in the same organization with the false ones. The true Christians were not happy with the course taken by the organizations. They were at all times looking and praying for the second coming of Christ when he, according to his promise, would completely deliver them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even these true Christians had become so blinded to the truth that they understood that the only means of salvation for man was to join some church organization and in due time go to heaven. From time to time the Lord used some good and faithful ones to hold up what truth was understood and to earnestly contend for the faith as far as they did understand it. Jesus had stated that the true and the false should walk side by side until God’s due time to separate them in the harvest and that this would be done at the end of the age. (Matthew 13:30) Uppermost in the mind of each truly consecrated child of the Lord was the second coming of Christ, and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Amongst those who were looking forward and hoping for the coming of the Lord was Charles Taze Russell, a young man residing in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, who had fully consecrated himself to the Lord. While studying the Lord’s Word, and it being due time for it to begin to be understood, the Lord opened his mind to a dearer understanding; and about 1878 he began to preach these truths to a small congregation of Christians at Allegheny, Pennsylvania. The Lord continued to feed his mind; and from time to time the light upon the Scriptures increased, even as the Lord had promised it should to those who honestly walked before him.—• Proverbs 4:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among some of the great truths that the Lord made clear to this consecrated man was that Adam the first man was created perfect, fell because of sin, died and went to hell but not to eternal torment; that hell means the grave or condition of death; that the great ransom sacrifice provided by the death and resurrection of our</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord shall in </span><span class="font6">due time result beneficially to all mankind; that the church, the body of Christ, must be first </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">taken out </span><span class="font6">from amongst men, and that then the peoples </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">earth will all have an opportunity to know of and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">believe upon </span><span class="font6">the Lord, obey him and receive life; that the promise God made to Abraham, “In thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed,” means what it says and means that the seed according to the promise is Christ Jesus and the faithful members of his body; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font6">when the church is completed, the Lord’s kingdom then being put into full operation, all men shall be brought to a knowledge of the truth and the obedient ones restored to human perfection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These great truths now brought to light thrilled with joy the hearts of the Christians that understood them, particularly the restoration hope that God held out for the millions that are dead and for the other millions still alive. The joy of these Christians now brought out </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Babylon is expressed by the prophet in these words: “When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the nations, The Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.”—Psalm 126:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These true saints of God’s organization were in captivity to the false church systems, to which the name of Babylon properly applies. As they began to see these great truths they broke away from Babylon. The Lord turned their captivity into freedom, and they rejoiced in the knowledge that he had given them and delighted to spread this good news to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In all the denominations, Catholic and Protestant, there were some truly consecrated Christians; and now the Lord began to gather these together who were his. By the Lord’s grace the young man, Charles Taze Hassell, took the lead in proclaiming the message </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">truth. He preached to others; and the consecrated ones in various denominations heard with gladness the message of truth. God now began to gather together his saints even as he had foretold through the words of the prophet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Through his holy prophet God had foretold that he would have a day of preparation and that then the Messenger of the covenant (Christ) would suddenly come to his temple. (Malachi 3:1) He otherwise identified this day of preparation by bringing to light great inventions. (Nahum 2:3; Daniel 12:4) Real activity of consecrated Christians “in the day of God’s preparation” seems to date particularly from about 1878. The year following, publication of Zion’s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence, was begun. It was edited and published by Charles Taze Russell. Later the name of the publication was changed to The Watch Tower, and it is published to this day. It has been the means of publication used to convey to earnest workers in the Lord’s harvest field meat in due season provided for them from the Lord’s table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is believed by Christians that the work which the Lord has carried on during his “day of preparation” was foreshadowed by the experiences of Elijah the prophet, which experiences are recorded in the Scriptures. Jesus said: “Elijah truly shall first come, and restore all things.” (Matthew 17: 11) During the period of “God’s preparation” through his beloved Son God did restore to the church the great fundamental truths which had been given to the early church and which for a long time had been taken away by false teachers, influenced and controlled by Satan’s organization. The man whom the Lord used above all others to bring these truths to light and to the attention of other consecrated ones was Charles Taze Russell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The truth concerning the creation and fall of man, the state of the dead, concerning hell, spiritism, the great ransom sacrifice, the mystery, the resurrection and the restoration of the human race, were restored to God’s people during that period of “the day of preparation”. Charles Taze Russell then was elected as pastor of many congregations of Christians, and came to he known generally amongst Christian people throughout the earth as Pastor Russell. Other sincere ones joined him in the work. That which was made prominent during the day of the Lord’s preparation was the fact of the Lord’s second presence and the gathering together of God’s people who had made a covenant with the Lord. Seldom did Pastor Russell preach a discourse to the interested without using the words of the prophet: “Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”—Psalm 50: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order that the work might be carried on in an orderly way, and that title to property necessary to be had and held in the carrying on of the work, and that the work might continue without interruption, a corporation was formed in 1884 under the name and style of Zion’s Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. The original incorporators were Charles Taze Russell and others. In 1896, at the instance of Brother Russell, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">petition was filed in the court of common pleas or Allegheny, Pennsylvania, and an order of court obtained, changing the corporate name to that of Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. Brother Russell was elected president of the Society at the time of its organization and held that office until his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work of the consecrated continued with zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. By means of tracts, papers, booklets and books, and oral proclamation the message of truth was spread far and wide. Many consecrated Christians came from different denominations and gathered themselves together for mutual fellowship and study of the Word of the Lord. As the truth spread to countries aside from America it became apparent that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">more suitable location should be had for the general headquarters of the Society and its work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font6">the year 1909 the Society, at the instance, of Brother Russell, moved its offices to Brooklyn, New York. It became necessary, under the law of the State of New York, for a corporation to be formed in that state to hold title to property and to conduct the work; and Brother Russell caused to be organized the Peoples Pulpit Association, which is a membership corporation created and organized under the Membership Corporation Law of the State of New York. Of course the organization of this corporation in no wise changed or affected the work of spreading the gospel message. The Peoples Pulpit Association, a coordinate corporation with The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, merely acts as a local agent in the State of New York for the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society to meet the necessary demands and to conduct the work. Brother Russell was elected president of that corporation, which office he held until his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It seemed necessary to have a corporation in England in order that the work might be handled there more efficiently and with less difficulty. At the instance of Brother Russell a corporation was created and organized under the laws of England in the year 1914 under the name and title of International Bible Students Association. Brother Russell was elected president of that corporation, and held that office as long as he was on earth. That corporation in no wise changed the work begun with the “day of God’s preparation”, but was merely an added means of carrying it on. The three corporations above named have always been practically one and each was organized for the purpose hereinbefore stated. The name International Bible Students Association had been applied to the Society or Association of Bible Students long before the above corporation under that name was created and organized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This brief history of the corporations and the reason for their organization is here given in order that no one may have occasion to misunderstand why there are three corporations and why the work has been thus carried on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The body of associated Christians supporting and carrying on the work through the above organizations is generally spoken of under the title The Society. The thought intended to be conveyed by those who understand the truth of the matter is this: That the Society, or The International Bible Students Association, consists of all of those truly consecrated Christians who believe the present truth and who are loyally and faithfully supporting the work of carrying the message of Gods kingdom to the people in obedience to his command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The officers of all three of these corporations are practically the same. These men are not the Society. They are members of the Society and servants thereof. Their duties are defined, and the obligation upon them is to carry on the work of spreading the message of the kingdom under the Lord’s supervision and direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible Students believe that it is now the will of God that the gospel of his kingdom shall be preached to all the nations as a witness before the final end, and that it is the duty and privilege of every truly consecrated Christian to participate therein. All who are earnestly and zealously and harmoniously working together to accomplish this end and purpose are counted as a part of the Society, or part of the International Bible Students Association. Election of officers in the various corporations is provided for by law and as set forth in the terms of the charter and the bylaw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On October 31st, 1916, Brother Russell finished his earthly course. It can truly be said that he was faithful unto death. He literally laid down his life in the Lord’s service, and without a doubt the Lord took him to his everlasting reward. His faithfulness to the Lord stands as an everlasting monument. There could be no greater monument erected to man than that of faithfulness to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The charter of the Peoples Pulpit Association provides that the president shall hold office for life. The other corporations of the Society make provision for the election of officers at stated intervals. In January, 1917, election was held as provided by the charters of these corporations respectively, and officers were chosen. In November, 1917, the consecrated throughout the land voted their choice of the officers of the Society and by an overwhelming vote confirmed the votes that had been cast by the shareholders of the corporation and as is provided by the terms of the charter. The work of the Lord proceeded. Without a corporation organized there might have been much difficulty. It seems clear that the organization of these corporations for the handling of the work was done under the supervision and according to the will of the Lord. We therefore conclude that it has pleased the Lord to have the organization which we commonly call The Society, as his instrument for the carrying on of his work and that all who earnestly, zealously, loyally and faithfully support that work constitute The Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During his ministry Pastor Russell had written and published six volumes of Studies in the Scriptures. In 1917 the Society published the Seventh Volume of that series. The World War was then on, and the United States had entered the war. The Bible Students continued faithfully to represent the Lord as best they could. The war furnished the occasion for the enemy, through his earthly representatives, to bring persecution upon the faithful Christians. The publication of the Seventh Volume above mentioned, with other things, furnished a pretext for the indictment against the officers of the Society, which was returned in the spring of the year 1918, charging a violation of the Espionage Act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A trial, under the indictment, was had in the southern district of the United States Court at Brooklyn in the spring of 1918. It hardly seems appropriate to dignify the proceeding as an orderly, judicial hearing. It was jargely a farce, notwithstanding it served the purpose. Excitement was running high on account of the war. While the case was in progress, and while the jury was considering it, with brass bands playing martial music shouting mobs marched through the streets near the court house and within hearing of those inside. The judge of the court instructed the jury to convict. A verdict accordingly followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The conviction was on four counts and the sentence of the court was that the officers of the Society be required to serve a term of imprisonment for eighty years. Bail was denied, and these convicted Bible Students were hurried away to prison; and for nine months they lingered behind prison bars, in utter violation of the Constitution of the United States. At the end of that time they were admitted to bail, the case was heard by the Court of Appeals, the judgment of the lower court reversed, and the case remanded. The government then dismissed the case and fully released the prisoners. Thus the Bible Students stood vindicated before the law of Satan’s organization, which had unrighteously sought to imprison and destroy them. The Lord had graciously delivered them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the period of time from the spring of 1918 until the latter part of 1919 there was very little done in spreading the gospel of God’s kingdom. In fact little could be done. The home office at Brooklyn had been dismantled and removed to Pittsburgh, the branch offices in the foreign countries were completely severed from the home office, and there was practically a cessation of the work. The persecution of Bible Students had spread to almost all of the nations engaged in the war, and many were intimidated and prevented from telling anything about the Lord’s kingdom. Then after the war had ended there was great difficulty for a time in starting the work afresh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1919 the proclamation of the message of the kingdom began to take on renewed activity. It was about that time that the Lord permitted his people to see that the work of the church during the “day of his preparation” had been foreshadowed by the experiences of Elijah; and that now the work of the church, and from that time forward, was foreshadowed by the Prophet Elisha. They saw that the Lord was dealing with the church collectively as members of the body of Christ; that Elijah had foreshadowed the work up until the great trouble came in 1918; that the period of inactivity from 1918 to 1919 was well pictured by the period of waiting of Elisha by the river Jordan; and that Elisha’s activity, when it did begin, represented the activity of the church from 1919 forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some time later the Lord made it known to the faithful students of his Word that “the day of his preparation” ended and the Lord came to his temple in 1918. Even as the Lord had promised, now greater light began to shine upon the Word of Truth and the minds of the consecrated began to be more clearly illuminated. (Revelation 11:19) Not that the fundamental doctrines were changed; not that there were new doctrines advanced nor that some one had discovered new light, but the truth became clearer and the Lord gave his people a clearer vision of his plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This increased light quickened the brethren and increased their zeal and devotion. Since then the truly consecrated have appreciated the fact that no man is responsible for this increased light; that the truth is not man’s truth but the Lord’s; that the Lord has not invited anyone to follow man but to follow Christ; and that it is the privilege of the consecrated to earnestly seek for the will of the Lord God and to do that will. The truth is the Lord God’s, the light is his, and he causes it to shine on his truth in his own due time, and all of the consecrated who are in proper condition of mind and heart to receive it do receive and rejoice in the light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bible Students have come to see that the prophecies of the Lord can be understood when fulfilled or while in the course of fulfilment, and that the Lord himself makes known these truths to his people in his own due time. As the truth is unfolded more and more, as the church advances toward the perfect day, greater has been the joy of the consecrated. These have entered into the joy of the Lord; and with zeal and devotion to his cause they have advanced to the proclamation of the truth in obedience to his command.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark2"></a>The Kingdom</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Aside from the great ransom sacrifice provided for man’s redemption that which is set forth most prominently in the Bible is the kingdom of God. That kingdom will undo all the evil that has been done and place the name of Jehovah where it belongs, far above all creation. When the work thereof is completed toward man every creature in heaven and on earth, yea, everything that has breath, will praise God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Adam was expelled from Eden he lost his right to the kingdom on earth arid peace and life everlasting. From that time forward man has sought to work out some device or scheme by which he can have a desirable government. Satan the enemy has at all times overreached man and controlled and dominated his organizations and his attempts at government. This, however, has not destroyed the desire of man for a government for his betterment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At all times in all ages there have been a few men who have been able to see that the only hope of a satisfactory government for man is the establishment and control of a government by Jehovah God. Such men have had faith that some day God will set up a righteous government, and that then the people will return to him and become his people and he will be their God. These men of faith began with Abel, and ever and anon there came upon the stage of earth’s activity a man with like faith in God and by his words and his course of action declared that he desired the civic affairs of man to be controlled by the great Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God began to give some vague promises concerning his establishment of such a government, and these men had absolute faith in such promises. By their course of action they confessed themselves to be strangers amidst a wicked organization of men dominated by the enemy Satan. They steadfastly refused to make common cause with any part of Satan’s organization. Casting their all on the side of God they firmly withstood every attempt to dislodge them from their position of confidence and faith. They were subjected to cruel and wicked treatment. They suffered imprisonment; they were tortured, stoned, sawn asunder, enticed, tempted, ostracized, starved, afflicted and tormented, that they might be turned away from God. When offered places of ease and comfort, a position of honor and trust in the organization of men under the supervision of Satan, they refused all such offers. They preferred to dwell in tents and in caves and to wander in the desert that they might remain true and faithful to the great Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why did not these men join with others to try to reform the world and establish a better government? The answer is that they had faith in God, and they knew that there was no other way aside from his way to bring their heart’s desire. Their course of action bears eloquent testimony to their faith in the establishment of the kingdom of righteousness in God’s due time. The Apostle Paul bears testimony to their faithfulness when he says: “For they that say such things, declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned: but now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.” (Hebrews 11: 14-16) They desired a government ruled by the God of heaven; and because of their faith and steadfastness God has made provision that in due time the civic affairs of earth shall be ministered by him and that these faithful men shall have a part therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The promise that God made to Abraham implied his purpose to some day establish a righteous government for the benefit of man. Abraham believed that promise. Then the Lord caused his prophets to declare his purpose and intention at some future time to raise up a mighty ruler, and that unto him shall the gathering of the people be. Not many of the people believed what the prophets said, but some did believe. Those of the Jewish nation who had faith in the promises were confidently looking for the coming of a king. The last of the faithful prophets to bear testimony thereof was John, who came announcing that the day of the anointed of God had arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then came Jesus, and some believed him to be the One sent of God. His disciples followed him. They knew nothing about heaven and were not induced by a hope of heaven to follow him. They hoped that Jesus, as the representative of Jehovah, would establish the kingdom about which the prophets of God had written and the Psalmist had sung. They looked forward to the time when this kingdom would deliver Israel and through Israel bless all the peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus began his ministry by announcing, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” He did not teach his disciples to pray that they might develop a character in order that they might have a comfortable place in heaven but he taught them to pray: “Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as in heaven.” Throughout his entire ministry he emphasized the importance of the kingdom. He made the kingdom paramount to everything else and taught his disciples that faithfulness to his Father was absolutely essential in order to have a part in that kingdom. By many parables and dark sayings he taught them concerning the kingdom that they might understand in God’s due time. After they had endured hardships with him for three and one-half years and had proved their faith and confidence in him, he said to his disciples: “My Father has covenanted with me for a kingdom, and now I covenant with you for a kingdom.” When about to take his departure from earth he told them to continue faithfully serving his Father; that in due time he would return and receive them to himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Having learned the words of the prophets concerning God’s kingdom, having heard the words of Jesus for three and one-half years magnifying the importance of the kingdom, understanding that he was the one who would be at the head of that kingdom and that that kingdom would be established only at the end of Satan’s rule, it is most reasonable to expect these disciples to propound the question which they did propound. Their question was propounded and the answer recorded, not so much for their benefit but for the benefit of the Christians who should be on the earth at the time of the coming of the kingdom. Only five days before his crucifixion they asked this question of the Lord: “What will be the evidence of these things, and of thy presence and of the end of the world ?” He then told them of the conditions that would obtain when that great event should come to pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bible Students for a long time had been watching for the fulfilment of the prophetic utterances of the Lord given in that answer. They expected something to be manifested in 1914 because Bible chronology shows that the Gentile Times ended in that year. True to the prophecy there began the World War, followed by f</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">am</span><span class="font6">ine, pestilence, the regathering of Israel, and other things mentioned by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is true that some of the Bible Students expected 1914 to end the earthly pilgrimage of the church and that the faithful would then go to heaven. But the Lord had something else to be done. Now Christians are beginning to realize that the Lord God has not called men out of darkness into his marvelous light merely to get them into heaven, but that he has been training men to faithfulness in their devotion to him that he might </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">put </span><span class="font6">them into positions of honor and trust in the ages </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">come to carry out his purposes, and that some of these positions of trust are in connection with the kingdom. Such Christians are realizing the great importance of faithfulness to God, which course was blazed for them </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font6">the faithful men of old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was about 1922 that the Lord permitted his light to shine more clearly upon his Word, and the Bible Students there began to understand more fully the words of Jesus. To these Bible Students the war, famine, pestilence, return of Israel and the persecution of Christians, marked the time for the incoming of the kingdom and was therefore to them good news. They also saw that in due time this must be good news to all peoples of good will. Jesus had commanded: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">witness; . . . and then shall the end come.”—Matthew 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bible Students now began to see that this command directed them as the witnesses of the Lord to carry this good news to the peoples of earth. It then became apparent to them that God had set his anointed King upon his throne, that the Lord was in his holy temple, and that now it had become the privilege of the Christians to advertise the King and his kingdom. They saw the time had come for them to heed the words of Jesus to look up and lift up their heads. This they did and have continued to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No organization on earth, aside from the Bible Students, was then giving or since then has been giving witness to the name of Jehovah. Bible Students now understood that God referred to his consecrated people when he said: “Ye are my witnesses, that I am God.” They also saw that Zion is God’s organization and that as consecrated and anointed followers of Christ Jesus they constitute a part of that organization. They began </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to appreciate that the words of the prophet applied to such consecrated ones wherein it is written: &quot;Thy watch</span><span class="font6">men shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.”—Isaiah 52: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Consequently from 1922 in particular and forward the truly consecrated, moved by an unselfish devotion to the Lord, have rejoiced to know not only that the day had come for the establishment of the long-promised kingdom of God but that it is their privilege to proclaim this good news to mankind. All of the truly consecrated who have appreciated this great fact have delighted to put forth their best endeavors to spread the good news concerning the day of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the past few years these consecrated ones have seen more clearly the hideous organization of the Devil. It is God’s due time for them to see. They have also obtained a clearer vision of God’s wonderful organization. They now see and appreciate, in some measure at least, that in attempting to perfect his organization and to use it for his purposes the Devil has compelled obedience by force; that by the military and police power he has coerced men to obey his orders, and that when men fail to carry out his orders he enforces his rule by severe and cruel punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Contrasted with this wicked rule the Christian sees that God’s organization is controlled by love, which means an unselfish devotion to his cause. They see that the motive prompting the faithful heroes of old was love, and that these set an example for the Christian. They appreciate the fact that God has set the members on earth in his organization as it pleases him, and that it is a great privilege for each one wherever placed to perform with joy his duty. For this reason the organization of the Lord on earth today is stronger and doing more effective work than in the past. While no one is compelled to obey, all who because of unselfish devotion to the Lord do participate in his service have the joy of the Lord and receive his favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It seems evident that the Lord limits the supply of money for the carrying on of his work in order that man might not think that he is doing the work but will recognize that it is God’s work. It is a noticeable fact that those who have much use little in the service of the Lord, and that those who do the most have the least in the way of this world’s goods. But these are strong in faith and rich in joy. The Lord always makes the necessary provision for his work, and we may be sure that he will have his purposes accomplished in his own due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To further his work the Lord has graciously permitted his people to build printing and book-making establishments in America and in Europe. It is thereby possible to prepare a message concerning the kingdom to place in the hands of the people at a nominal cost. He has also permitted them to erect radio stations to broadcast the message of truth far and wide that it may reach the prisoners that are held in the denominational prison-houses and others who could not and would not otherwise hear the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Elisha was given a double portion of the spirit of the Lord; and it is quite manifest that since 1919 there has been a far greater manifestation of the spirit of the Lord in carrying on his work. Prior to that time the thought in the minds of Christians seemed to be generally that of going to heaven. That was largely selfish. In more recent years the Christians have seen that it is their great privilege to represent the Lord and declare his goodness and that he will reward them in his own due time. They are therefore prompted more by unselfishness, which is a greater manifestation of the spirit of the Lord. With a burning zeal and devotion to him they unite in doing the work the Lord has committed into their hands. To these faithful ones the Lord has committed the interest of his kingdom on earth at this time. By his grace they are striving to perform their commission. This will explain why there has been a steady increase of the work since 1919. As to the present status of the Lord’s work on earth reference may be had to the annual report of 1926 published herein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The foregoing statement concerning the Lord’s work is made to establish the fact that the International Bible Students Association, together with its associated corporations, does not constitute a denominational system or systems and is not teaching a new religion. On the contrary the Society is an association of truly consecrated followers of Jesus Christ to whom the Lord Jesus has restored the doctrines of truth taught by him and his apostles and the holy prophets. They now see their great privilege to be witnesses to the name of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Throughout the earth there are ecclesias or local organizations duly constituted and organized in harmony with the directions given by the apostles. Each one of these ecclesias has its local servants. There is no membership roll, and there are no earthly books upon which the names of the Bible Students are inscribed. The Society has no selfish purpose or cause to serve. Those who constitute this company of Christians are fully consecrated to do the will of God. They are pleased to welcome into their midst any and all who believe in the great truths taught in the Scriptures and who honestly, earnestly and zealously engage in the proclamation of the kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>Teachings</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">As an evidence that the Society is strictly adhering to proclaiming the message of God’s Word as taught by Jesus, the holy prophets, and the apostles, there is set forth herein an epitome of the truths so taught, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That Jehovah is the only true God; that his name has been pushed aside by so-called Christians for many centuries; that the Devil has blinded even Christians to the troth concerning him; that the world is totally blind; that the time has now come for God to make for himself a name in the earth and he commands his people, as his witnesses, to proclaim his truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the Bible is the inspired Word of God and that it contains a statement of the divine plan for man’s salvation and blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the great fundamental truths prominently set forth in the Bible are these: Adam, the first man, was created perfect in organism and endowed with the faculties of wisdom, justice, love and power; that he wilfully violated God’s law in order to join his wife Eve in the transgression which Satan had induced her to commit; that the Lcrd God justly sentenced to death and expelled him from Eden; that all of his children were thereafter begotten and born, and that hence they were begotten in sin and brought forth in iniquity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That God made promise that through the seed of Abraham he would bless all the families of the earth, and that in due time he would redeem man from death and ransom him from the power of the grave; that he would raise up a mighty ruler unto whom the people shall be gathered; that in due time he sent to earth his beloved Son who died upon the cross, whom God raised up from the dead and who by his death and resurrection provided the great redemptive price for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That since the death and resurrection of our Lord, beginning with Pentecost the Lord has been selecting the members of the body of Christ; and that these, Jesus the Head and his body members, constitute the “Seed of Promise” according to the promise which God made to Abraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That Christ Jesus taught his followers to pray for the coming of God’s kingdom that God’s will might be done on earth as in heaven, and he promised that he would return in due time and set up his kingdom; that the great hope of the church from Pentecost forward has been the second coming of the Lord, the completion of the church and the inauguration of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That God’s provision for one becoming a member of the church, which is the body of Christ, is this, to wit: Belief in Christ Jesus as the great Redeemer of mankind; a full consecration to do God’s holy will; justification of the one consecrating, which justification is obtained by the act of Jehovah in justifying or determining that one is right with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That justification by faith during the Gospel Age is for just one purpose and that is that the one justified may be a part of the sacrifice of the Lord, hence such have made a covenant with the Lord by sacrifice; that then God begets such an one by his spirit to the divine nature and inducts him into the body of Christ and anoints him; that thereafter such Christian must perform his part of the covenant faithfully unto death and that thus doing he will receive full membership in the body of Christ and an abundant entrance into the heavenly kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That when Jesus was on earth his disciples propounded to him the question as to what would be the proof of his presence and the end of the world; that his answer was couched in prophetic phrase; that he gave a statement of conditions that would exist at the time of the end of the age and the setting up of his kingdom, to wit, the World War, famines, pestilences, revolutions, return of the Jews to Palestine, the persecution of Christians, and then </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> period in which the gospel of the kingdom must be proclaimed to all the nations as a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the proof shows that the Gentile Times ended in 1914; that there God, according to his promise, set his anointed King, Christ Jesus, upon his throne (Psalm 2:6); that there followed a great conflict in heaven between Christ on one side and Satan on the other, in which Satan was cast out of heaven; that since then the Lord has come to his temple and is now strengthening his people for the final experiences on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That soon will come the great time of trouble foretold by God through his prophets, and specifically mentioned by the Lord, which shall result, in the complete destruction of Satan’s empire and the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth; that then unrighteous men shall cease to rule the world, and the world shall be established in righteousness that it shall never be moved. ■—Psalm 96:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the reign of Christ will be for the purpose of granting to every one of the human race, both dead and living, an opportunity for life, and that to this end all those who have died in ignorance of God shall be awakened and given a knowledge of the truth; that the church alone participates in the first resurrection; that all the families of the earth shall have an opportunity to know the Lord and to obey him, and that those obeying shall be granted the blessings of life everlasting in peace and happiness upon the earth for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible Students believe that the only reason for their being on earth at this time, and the only excuse for the existence of their organization, is that they might be witnesses that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is at hand. The Devil for so long a time has blinded the people to God’s truth that now the time has come for God to make for himself a name. He will have his people bear testimony of him to the world, and then will follow the great conflict which shall mark the final end of earth’s wicked organizations; that such trouble is not a fight in which the Christian shall participate, but it is a fight of God Almighty against the Devil’s organization; and that the part to be performed by the Christians on earth is to faithfully represent the Lord by telling others of God’s purposes, and thereby to show forth his praises. The Bible Students are earnestly attempting to do this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The International Bible Students Association is not seeking membership and has no membership roll. All who believe in the truths taught by Jesus and the apostles, and who now believe in the presence of the Lord and that the time has come for him to set up his kingdom, and who desire to participate, and to the best of their ability and opportunity do participate in giving the witness to the name of Jehovah, are counted in as members of the Association or Society. All such, in obedience to the admonition of the Apostle Paul, are standing shoulder to shoulder, fighting for the gospel of Jesus Christ and never quailing before the enemy. These have entered into the joy of the Lord; namely, seeing that the time has come for the establishment of the kingdom, and the vindication of Jehovah’s name, it gives them great joy and delight to tell this good news to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible Students, in the performance of what they understand to be their covenant and in diligently trying to be witnesses for Jehovah, are now doing their part to hold up the standard of the Lord to the people, to remove the false doctrines that have stumbled the people and point the people to God’s great way of returning to him, and thereby are bringing consolation to all those who desire to be free. Believing that the time has come when a witness must be given to the kings and rulers of the earth, as well as to the peoples, they are earnestly putting forth their best efforts, gladly spending what little money they have and also spending their time and energy in spreading amongst mankind the good news that Jehovah is God, that Christ Jesus is the King of kings and Lord of lords, that God has set him upon his throne and that he bids all the peoples of earth to give heed to his message and to render obedience to his rule. It is now the privilege and joy of the Bible Students to make known to Christian peoples and to all peoples of good will that the kingdom, for which Jesus taught his followers to pray, is here; and therefore with gladness they are declaring that the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Annual Report for 1926</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lard,, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me . . . Therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.&quot;— Isaiah</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">13:10,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">t'</span><span class="font6"> g' 1HE words of the above text are prophetic. The I prophecy must have its fulfilment sometime, and some creatures must fulfil the prophecy as God’s witnesses. The context and other Scriptures show that now is the time for its fulfilment. Whom is God using as his witnesses and servants to fulfil this prophecy? The answer is, That organization of Christians on the earth which we term “The Society&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There must be a reason for the existence of any organized movement. The Prophet Isaiah definitely locates that which constitutes the servant of the Lord, when he says, “Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.” (Isaiah 42:1) We know that this scripture refers to Christ and the members of his body, whether operating on earth or in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The church of God, consisting of Jesus and his faithful followers, was planted by Jehovah in purity. (Jeremiah 3:21) The enemy Satan by the exercise of his wicked influence corrupted men who had become a part of the earthly organization, but he has not cor-i’upted the true church. In the parable concerning the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">27 </span><span class="font6">development of the church, Jesus stated that the “wheat and tares” must grow together until the time of the harvest, and that then the unapproved ones would be gathered out that the approved ones might be left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This parable clearly shows that there would be two classes of Christians, one class approved and one disapproved. It follows then that the approved ones would constitute the class mentioned as the servant of the Lord and the members thereof would constitute the ones who are his witnesses. These prophecies do not refer to individuals but to the compact members of the body of Christ, harmoniously working together with the Head in obedience to Jehovah’s commands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An organization is properly defined as a company of persons or individuals working together systematically and orderly to accomplish some given purpose. If such an organization has the Lord’s approval it follows that it must function harmoniously. There could be no division in that organization. Individuals making it up might from time to time drop out and others fill the vacant places, but the organization will keep on in the even tenor of its way Just as the Lord intended it. We believe that which we generally call the Society is such an organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One or more corporations may be formed and used in conjunction with the work done by an organization. Such corporations do not constitute the organization. They are organized for the purpose of meeting the demands of the law of the country or countries wherein the work is carried on. Such is exactly the case with reference to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the expression “The Society” is used it is not intended to convey the thought that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">corporation </span><span class="font6">is God’s visible organization, but the thought intended to be conveyed is, to wit: The company of individuals working orderly, systematically and harmoniously together in obedience to God’s commands in doing his work does constitute God’s visible organization on earthy The corporation or corporations used in connection therewith are merely servants of the organization. Who can gainsay this statement? If anyone is wholly devoted to the Lord and puts forth his best efforts in obedience to God’s commands to serve him, then he will work harmoniously together with his brethren; and he and his brethren as followers of Christ will constitute the Lord’s representatives on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Is it at all reasonable or consistent that God has two or more organizations to accomplish his purposes ? What would be the necessity for more than one? Is it at all reasonable that he would have more than one organization on earth bearing his name as his authorized representative to fulfil the prophecy above mentioned? It is neither reasonable nor consistent. The only reasonable conclusion in harmony with the Scriptures is that Christ is one, and that all the members of his body who are on the earth and who are standing together and harmoniously working together to accomplish the work assigned to the members of the body constitute God’s organization on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Clearly this is the thought expressed by the Prophet Isaiah: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reign-eth! Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.” (Isaiah 52: 7, 8) The “feet of him” means the members of the Lord on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These are </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font6"> compact body, not two or more. As the Lord’s representatives they jointly constitute the watchmen. They see eye to eye what is to be done, and together they lift up the voice. The human voice produces the most harmonious sound known to man. Symbolically therefore the voice represents the harmonious message which the feet members of Christ must deliver. These feet members deliver this message as God’s witnesses, and they are the only ones who do bear witness to him and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matthew 24:14) These words of the Master constitute a positive commandment which the context and the facts show must be fulfilled after 1914. It is not to be expected that anyone will obey this commandment and give this testimony except those who are in harmony with the Lord and therefore in harmony with one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">St. Paul, writing to the church, said, “Only let the lives you live be worthy of the Good News of the Christ, in order that, whether I come and see you or, being absent, only hear of you, I may know that you are standing fast in one spirit and with one mind, fighting shoulder to shoulder for the faith of the Good News. Never for a moment quail before your antagonists. Your fearlessness will be to them a sure token of impending destruction, but to you it will be a sure token of your salvation—a token coming from God.” (Philippians 1: 27, 28, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth)</span><span class="font6"> With greater force do his words apply now than when written. All of the Lord’s people must now stand shoulder to shoulder, fighting for the gospel of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In harmony with this it is written, “For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not burdensome.” (1 John 6: 3, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Biaglott)</span><span class="font6"> All who are keeping his commandments in harmony with this text must of necessity be in harmony wiih the Lord and with each other. Thus they constitute one company, working together systematically and orderly for the accomplishment of God’s purposes. Such constitute “the remnant”, within the meaning of the Scriptures, against which the Devil is now making war. ■—Bev elation 12:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What company of individuals on earth is meeting these Scriptural requirements? The only company that is even attempting so to do is that association of Christians known by the generic term International Bible Students Association, otherwise spoken of as “The Society&quot;. It therefore follows that such an organized body of true followers of Jesus are the ones meant when the Lord says: “Ye are my witnesses that I am God.” Meeting these requirements then shows the only reason for the existence of such an organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures show that Satan the enemy would war against those who keep the commandments of God. The facts show that he does war against those few composing the organization who are giving testimony concerning God’s kingdom. The facts also show that some individuals have yielded to his evil influences and have fallen. When they fell they ceased to be a part of the organization and usually became opposers. Some may stumble for a time, then be recovered and again enter the ranks. The organization, however, is always intact, even though the personnel is not always the same. Those who do stand to the very end will constitute “the remnant” and will receive the final approval of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It does not seem that anyone who is really a Christian can find any objection whatsoever to this definition of the Society. All who are in harmony with the Lord and who are obeying his commandments constitute the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Society. The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is the servant of such and merely an instrument which the Lord’s people use in the performance of their Divinely given duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who are faithfully and joyfully obeying the commands of the Lord are subjected to all manner of assaults from the enemy. This is to be expected. They are learning that God is not trying to get some into heaven, but that he is giving some an opportunity to prove their loyalty and faithfulness and loving devotion to him, to thereby demonstrate their fitness for the heavenly kingdom. He is permitting all of the professed ones to be hindered by conditions that would put them to the test. All who can be shaken will be shaken. Only those who by the Lord’s grace stand firmly to the end, joyfully obeying his commandments, are the ones that cannot be shaken.—Hebrew 12: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Instead of trying to get all into heaven God is shaking out all that can be shaken. He preserves those and those only who love him and who are faithful. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;O </span><span class="font6">love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.” (Isaiah 31:23) It follows then that anyone who receives the Lord’s approval must obey his commandments; and since his commandment now is to give a witness concerning his kingdom this must be done, joyfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As to God’s channel on earth for the dispensing of his message of Truth, is that even an open question? It is not an open question. A channel means that through which anything flows or passes. Who on the earth is God using through which to pass or cause to flow his message of truth ? His anointed ones, of course, in a collective capacity, acting as his servant class. No individual is the Lord’s channel, but individuals collee-tively constitute his channel through which the Truth does pass. The Truth is God’s Truth, and those whom he has anointed as members of the body of his beloved Son are the ones whom he uses as his channel and his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Therefore that company of Christian people begotten and anointed of the holy spirit, working together systematically, orderly and harmoniously, constitute God’s channel, otherwise called the Society, to give the witness concerning him and his kingdom, in obedience to his commandments. God’s promises are given to such in a collective sense. The promises cannot be claimed by individuals unless these individuals are members of the body of Christ. When one puts himself outside of the pale of the church then he puts himself outside of the promise of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These statements are here made for the purpose of clearly defining what constitutes the Society and the reason for the existence thereof, and the reason why each member thereof should urge every other member to participate in the service of the Lord in obedience to his commandments.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Annual Meeting</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">A copy of the minutes of the last annual meeting of the Society follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Pursuant to notice duly given as provided by law and by the charter and by-laws of the Society the annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bibue &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society was held at Memorial Hall, Pittsburgh, Pa. at ten o’clock Monday, November 1st, 1926. The time for the regular annual meeting is October 31st, but this date being Sunday the meeting was held according to law on the day following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The meeting was called to order by the President in the chair who called upon Brother W. E. Spill to offer </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">opening prayer. Beading of the minutes of the previous meeting was omitted by common consent. The next order Of business was the report by the President on the work </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the Society during the fiscal year which closed September 30th. This report is quite voluminous, covering some sixty pages of manuscript. The convention voted to have it read. The President thereupon read the report. It was enthusiastically received, and upon motion the members of the annual meeting voted their unqualified approval thereof. The Treasurer then made his report. The law does not require these reports to be made, nor does the charter; but they are made for the encouragement of the brethren. This was the statement made by the President of the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The next in order was the election of a Board of Directors of seven members, to serve for a period of three years. The Board, as constituted at that time, was, to wit: J. F. Rutherford, C. A. Wise, W. E. Van Ajnburgh, A. H. Macmillan, C. H. Anderson, H. H. Riemer, and J. A. Baeuer-lein. A motion was made that the corporation meeting proceed to re-elect the seven persons above named as the Board. Brother R. J. Martin was then also placed in nomination. Thereupon Brother C- H. Anderson arose and stated to the corporate members that he was so situated that he could not give personal attention to the duties as a member of the Board of Directors, and therefore withdrew his name and asked the corporate body to vote for Brother Martin in his stead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thereupon a motion was made that the Secretary of the Society, by unanimous consent, cast the entire vote, present and voting, for the following named persons as and for the Board of Directors for the ensuing term of three years, to wit: J. F. Rutherford, C. A. Wise, W. E. Van Amburgh, A. H. Macmillan, R. J. Martin, EL H. Riemer and J. A. Baeuerlein. The Secretary then announced that there were present, in person and by proxy, 157,484 votes, all of which he cast by ballot for the persons above named as a Board of Directors. Thereupon the President declared that upon the advice of the voters and of the vote cast accordingly the above named seven persons were duly elected as members of the Board of Directors for the ensuing term of three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The next order of business was the election of officers. The name of Brother J. F. Rutherford was presented as President. There were no other names presented. Thereupon it was moved that by unanimous consent the Secretary be instructed to cast the entire vote of the meeting for Brother j. F. Rutherford to serve as President for tlie term of three years. Brother C. A. Wise was called to the chair and put the motion, which was unanimously adopted. Thereupon the Secretary cast the entire vote of, to wit, 157,484, for Brother J. F. Rutherford for the office of President of the Society for a period of three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brother C. A. Wise was then nominated for Vice President. Brother A. H. Macmillan also was placed in nomination. Brother Macmillan withdrew his name, and thereupon the meeting unanimously elected Brother Wise as Vice President for the ensuing term of three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brother W. E. Van Amburgh was nominated and by unanimous consent of the shareholders elected as Secretary and Treasurer for the period of three years. Brother H. H. Riemer was then nominated and unanimously elected as Assistant Secretary and Treasurer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The President then called the order of unfinished business and there being none next called for new business. Thereupon Brother L. L. Bulleit of Indianapolis announced to the Chairman that he had a resolution to present and that the resolution had to do with the officers of the Society. The President then announced, “In view of the statement of the brother as to the nature </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font6"> his resolution I now ask Brother C. H. Anderson of Baltimore to'take the chair and preside over the meeting during the consideration of the resolution.” Brother Bulleit was also invited to the platform, to read the resolution, and at the conclusion thereof he moved its adoption. Brother Spill of Pittsburgh, Brother Saunders of Pittsburgh, and a number of other brethren, enthusiastically seconded the resolution; whereupon it being put to a vote was unanimously adopted. The resolution is as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As consecrated followers of Christ, assembled in convention at Pittsburgh, Pa., and at the annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, we send love and greetings to our brethren throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are aware of the fact that all who are earnestly keeping the commandments of God as his witnesses on earth are the targets of the Devil and his emissaries. The venom of such attacks is manifest more particularly against those in the front Tanks of the battle for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The enemy has caused to be circulated against officers of the Society, and especially against the President of the Society, false and wicked accusations which have a tendency to disturb some of Our brethren. We regret to note that these malicious accusations have been carried about by some who have professed to be in present truth but who no more walk with us. We would take no notice of these vicious attacks except for the purpose of encouraging our brethren who are not in a position to know the facts as Well as we know them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For ten years Brother J. F. Rutherford has zealously and faithfully served as President of the Society. His election has been unanimous each time during that period, and at this meeting he again has been unanimously elected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The blessing of the Lord attending his efforts is the best evidence of the Lord’s approval upon him. This convention and annual meeting now goes on record expressing our full faith and confidence in Brother Rutherford and in those who are associated with him at headquarters, and in his managers in the various countries who are acting under his appointment. We call upon our brethren everywhere to stand together fighting for the gospel of the kingdom and thereby giving their unqualified and loyal support to Brother Rutherford and the brethren associated with him in conducting this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We request that a copy of this resolution be presented to Brother Rutherford, and a copy be sent to the local manager of each and ever}’ country, and that it be published in The Watch Towee, in the English and the foreign editions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Under the leadership of our Lord we are marching to victory. Let us all march firmly together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There being no further business to come before the shareholders’ meeting at this time the meeting adjourned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal as Secretary, this first day of November, A. D. 1926.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(Signed) W. E. Van Ambubgh, Secretary.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Annual Report</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Neither the law of the land nor the charter of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society requires an annual report to be made and submitted to the shareholders. The only requirement is that meetings be held at stated times to transact certain formal business. The brethren of the Lord have themselves adopted a custom of meeting at such time and having presented to them a statement reviewing the work done in the name of the Lord, and this is done for the encouragement and comfort of one another. That is the reason why this report is now submitted:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Brooklyn Headquarters</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The executive office of the corporation known as the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, N. Y. The manufacturing plant and operating offices, for some time have been ■maintained at 18 Concord Street, Brooklyn, N. Y. The corporation has a number of branch offices, as will be seen from this report. The work of all these offices is directed from the Brooklyn headquarters, and from headquarters a general view of the work is taken. Our branch offices keep in close touch with the main office and follow a general policy outlined by the executive, and by the Lord’s grace strive to work together harmoniously and to the Lord’s glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The headquarters of the corporations Im own as the International Bible Students Association and the Peoples Pulpit Association are also at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, N. Y. These corporations are organized for the carrying on of the work more efficiently in conjunction with the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society ■ The Peoples Pulpit Association being incorporated under the laws of the State of New York and the International Bible Students Association being incorporated under the laws of Great Britain. These three corporations, however, are servants of the Society and merely instruments for carrying out its purposes. Each corporation has the same president, and the other officers are practically the same.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Organization</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">If efficiency is required in worldly organizations, with stronger reason efficiency should obtain in the Lord’s work. Of course imperfect men cannot have a perfect organization, but best efforts can be put forward to cause the work to be done efficiently and economically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bethel family at Brooklyn now consists of one hundred and seventy-two persons, all of whom are engaged in some part of the service at the headquarters. There are no idlers and no drones. Bethel is a place to work and not a place to visit or idle away time. At six-thirty in the morning the rising gong is sounded. At seven the morning worship is had and breakfast is served, and the work begins at the factory and office at eight o’clock. There is an intermission of one hour for dinner, and supper is served at 6 p. m. Between these hours everyone is busy. Part of the time a night shift is operating at the factory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At each sitting in the Bethel dining room Bible questions are discussed. The evenings are spent in class meetings and class study, and each Tuesday evening there is a study especially for the Bethel family, usually led by the president of the Society. This study is of the current leading article in The Watch Towek, the purpose being to enable those present to understand the Truth more clearly and also to better equip the brethren to teach. No one is admitted to this particular study except those who reside in the Bethel Home.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Office and Factory Organization</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The best endeavors are used to have an efficient office and factory organization. This is under the immediate direction of an office manager, and with the president of the Society as general manager. Each one is assigned to his or her post of duty and puts forth an endeavor to get the best results. Tn the Devil’s organization men are compelled to obey. Tn the Lord’s organization unselfish devotion to the Lord is the moving cause for efficiency. Each one truly consecrated to the .Lord realizes that his obligation is to the Lord. He must .account to the Lord for results, and being zealous for the Lord he is anxious to get the best results. This is the reason why the showing of the Society’s factory and office is far above that of any worldly organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the beginning of our fiscal year the work for the ensuing year is marked out. Estimate is made of the amount of literature that can be manufactured by the plant and distributed. Requisitions are made out for such work and placed on file., and it is then determined which orders are to be executed at stated times. A schedule is made out and all the work for each day is marked out several months in advance. This schedule is prepared somewhat on the order of a railway time schedule, and every department receives notice as to what is expected of it; and each one in each department is expected to be on time with what he or she has to do. Every person from the president to the office boy is required to be on time, and if anyone is behind time with his work he is asked to show cause why the delay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A cost system is employed for the purpose of determining whether or not the work is being done economically, and at any time or at any stage in the- production or operation the cost of production may be determined. Work is decreased or enlarged in proportion as the Lord supplies the monies. Since no money is solicited the organization proceeds upon the theory that the Lord will provide what money is needed if each one responsible does his or her part. By faith and by the Lord’s grace the work progresses.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Means Employed</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In order to render obedience to God’s command to give the witness, the following ways and means are employed, to wit : The-Watch Towel, The Golden Age, radio, public meetings, free literature, correspondence, books, pilgrim service, colporteur and class workers. As-members of the body of Christ are set therein according to the will of God, it is understood that each one of these means of spreading the Truth is by the Lord’s will and grace; and each one engaged in giving the witness by-either of these means strives to do so as unto the Lord. A resume of the work accomplished in each one of these departments is given herein, covering the fiscal year for 1926, which ended September 30th.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Watch Tower</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The purpose of The Watch Towes is to communicate to the various ones throughout the earth who are interested in the Lord’s work explanations of the Scriptures. This is food for the mind of the new creature; and it is believed that the Lord furnishes it, using imperfect creatures, of course, to serve it to the household of faith. At the Brooklyn headquarters The Watch Tower is published in ten languages, and throughout the world it is published in twenty-three languages. During the year 1926 there were printed and mailed out from the Brooklyn office Watch Towers in the English language to the number of 1,576,300, which shows an increase over that of 1925 of 155,500 copies. Idiis is a healthy increase and shows there are many people carefully reading The Watch Tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reports show that throughout the country the classes are studying The Watch Tower more carefully than ever, and these are progressing and manifesting greater zeal for the Lord’s service. One of the purposes of The Watch Tower is to magnify the fact that Jehovah is God, that Christ Jesus the King has begun his reign, and that all of the faithful members of his body on earth are privileged to participate in announcing his kingdom to the world. As the Lord is pleased to reveal to his people a clearer understanding of the prophecies this understanding increases the zeal of the consecrated in obeying his commandments to give the witness.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Watch Tower is devoted exclusively to the publication of Bible truths. It is not deemed pleasing to the Lord to use it to answer libelous or slanderous </span><span class="font6">reports made against any of the Lord’s people. The Psalmist says, I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked are before me. (Psalm 39:1) The Watch Tower proceeds upon the theory that its columns are closed to controversies with those who indulge in evil speech. Its purpose is to do good in the name of the Lord and to spread the message of his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Golden Age</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age is a medium of communication with those interested in the Truth who are consecrated and those who are not consecrated. Its columns are given to the publication of things pertaining to science, invention, etc., which show a fulfilment of prophecy and the outworking of the Divine Plan for the good of mankind. It also carries addresses given over the radio by the brethren and other explanations of the Bible. It is a means of communicating certain things to those already interested as well as those not yet interested, that cannot be well carried in the columns of The Watch Tower. Without a doubt the Lord’s blessing has been upon The Golden Age in a marked degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Radio</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font6">The radiocasting of the message is proving one of the most effective ways of giving the witness concerning Jehovah and his kingdom. The chief stations of the Society are WBBR, Staten Island, N. Y., and WORD, Chicago, Ill. In addition thereto the Society regularly broadcasts over the following other stations; KFWM, Oakland, Calif.; WHK, Cleveland, 0.; CKCX, Toronto, Ont.; CHUG, Saskatoon, Sask.; CHCY, Edmonton, Alta.; CFYC, Vancouver, B. C. Besides these, there are stations controlled by other institutions which have arranged with local Bible Students classes to carry their programs. There is a wide witness therefore by this means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Heretofore the clergy have influenced a large number of Christian people not to attend meetings of’ the Bible Students. They are unable, however, to keep them from tuning in on the radio. The result is that many Catholics and Protestants who desire the Lord’s kingdom are listening in, and a great many letters are received showing their deep appreciation of the Truth that is thus heard. The radio has opened the way for the distribution of literature, including- the books and booklets, and doubtless this accounts for the great increase in the sale of the books this year. In addition thereto, the radio is encouraging the people who have our books and other literature to read the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is impossible to tell how many people are listening in on our radio programs, but it seems reasonably safe to say that there are millions now hearing the Truth who have never heard it before. This is just as we should expect it to be, in fulfilment of prophecy. Now is the time in which the Truth is disclosing the hiding place of falsehoods long promulgated to the people by Satan and his emissaries. The Truth is destroying the blindness cast over the minds of the people, and it is expected that the radio will continue to be a great means blessed by the Lord, for announcing the fact that he has set his King upon his throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brethren at Bethel regularly prepare radio lectures which are delivered over WBBR. Many of these lectures are published in The Golden Age and delivered at other stations. The radio furnishes a means of service to many of the brethren. Of course, it is necessary to have some musical programs in connection with the broadcasting- of. the Truth, and this has received the blessing of the Lord; he has brought forward qualified ones to produce the music, both instrumental and vocal, to his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The glad tidings seemingly rise higher .and higher each year, and as we come to the close of 1926 it can be confidently asserted that the radio .has reached a class of people and a greater number of people than any other means heretofore employed in the same space of time. Undoubtedly it is one of the God-given inventions to spread the message of the Truth. Like a voice in the wilderness the cry goes out through the air, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand I” And the common people are hearing, and many are being made glad.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Public Meetings</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">During the fiscal year of 1926 worldwide witness dates have been fixed, and on these days brethren throughout the earth have proclaimed the message at public meetings. Reports concerning these are gratifying. At the date fixed every public speaker, be he a pilgrim or san elder, has used the same subject. In this way a uniform .message -goes out at the same time. The apostle declared that the Lord’s people should be found standing shoulder to shoulder fighting for the gospel of Jesus Christ,; and the worldwide witnesses illustrate well how they with one accord are engaged in the same thing at the same time, with their faces turned toward the. kingdom and not toward each other. These faithful witnesses are marching .in solid phalanx, singing the praises of Jehovah as they .go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the .fiscal'year 4,820 public meetings in the English language were directed and advertised from the Brooklyn office. In addition to this, public meetings have been held in America addressed by speakers in the following languages, to wit: Polish, Greek, German, Lithuanian, Hungarian, Russian, Slovak, Italian, Swedish, Syrian, Armenian and Japanese. In addition thereto special meetings have been held for the colored people. The total number of all these public meetings in the United States during the year was 6,425, with an attendance of 506,698. Of course the attendance at the public addresses given over the radio cannot be positively stated, but the correspondence indicated that this would be numbered in the millions.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Free Literature</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">At the convention held in Indianapolis in 1925 a resolution was passed; and this, together with the public address delivered by the president of the Society, was published in form of free literature for volunteer distribution. That literature was called “A Message of Hope”. Its publication and distribution were accomplished during the fiscal year of 1926.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the London convention in May of 1926 a resolution known as “A Testimony” was passed, supported by the public address of the president of the Society ; and this has been printed and sent out as free literature for volunteer distribution during the year 1926. The Society’s presses at Brooklyn alone printed 35,414,000 copies of these two resolutions and public addresses, which were sent out and distributed as free literature. In addition to the English language in which this was published, it was printed in a number of other languages; and the total distribution throughout the nations of earth of this volunteer matter during the fiscal year of 1926 amounted to about 40,000,000 copies of the Message of Hope and 50,000,000 copies of the Testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The London resolution and address to the World Powers has probably had a more thorough and complete distribution than any other. An attempt has been made to get copies into the hands of all the rulers of the earth. The Society has received acknowledgment from the king of Great Britain of the receipt of this volunteer literature; and the reports from the United States, Germany, Switzerland and practically all of the European countries are to the effect that the rulers have received copies; and thus the witness has been well given by volunteer literature. The distribution of this volunteer matter has brought orders for a great number of books, showing that the people are reading it and that thousands of them are approving what is therein stated.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Correspondence</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Brooklyn headquarters carries on a large correspondence. Of course there is a great deal of detail correspondence in filling orders for books and literature, and conducting the routine work. In addition thereto a great many letters are received and answered pertaining to the spiritual condition of brethren throughout the earth. A large amount of this correspondence goes to the president's office. An attempt is made to answer every letter that is received, and this entails a tremendous amount of work. The brethren do this gladly and rejoice in the privilege of having an opportunity to help others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The correspondence for the fiscal year of 1926 has been greater than that of any proceeding year. It furnishes a means, however, of giving a witness to the Truth. Many newly interested ones write, propounding questions. Many write the radio stations, asking questions, and these are answered by radio and by letter. Correspondence, therefore, is one of the means which the Lord has employed to give the witness which he now commands must be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the most effective ways of testifying in obedience to the Lord’s command is that of publication and distribution of books. When one picks up a book to- read it, seldom does he stop to think of the effort that must be put forth to produce that book. For the benefit of those who have a part in the Lord’s service and who might wish to know we give herewith an outline of the work that must be done in order to produce a book and get it into the hands of the people. It is interesting to follow each step, from the time of the preparation of the manuscript until the book is carried by some colporteur or class worker and placed in the hands of one who might read it. The various steps are as follows, to wit:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The machines turn out ten thousand volumes a day; this means that the brethren at the factory handle material in the quantity of 250 tons each working day, as the material used in each book is handled by them about 50 times.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Production</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">At the beginning of the 1926 fiscal year arrangements were made to increase the output of books to meet the demand. A press was manufactured in Germany and brought to America, made especially for our use in the manufacturing of books. To our knowledge this is the first rotary press used in America to manufacture books. This one press alone is capable of printing a book of four hundred pages to the number of ten thousand volumes per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year our factory has printed and bound the following books: The seven volumes of Studies in the Scriptures, The Harp op God, Deliverance, Comport for the Jews, Watch Tower Reprints, Standard for the People, Hell, Our Lord’s Return, and other miscellaneous booklets. In addition to printing these in the English language they have also been published in the following foreign languages, to wit: Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Bohemian, German, Greek, Hawaiian, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Ukrainian and Yiddish. In addition to the above books we are now manufacturing the Diaglott on Bible paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Comparing this year’s production of our Brooklyn plant with that of 1925 there was an increase of 127,501 bound volumes produced. There was a decrease in the production of booklets over that of 1925, and this is accounted for because of the running of the large amount of free literature. The free literature printed during the year is equivalent to 4,046,376 booklets. The shipment of English books to colporteurs, classes, branches, etc., by the Brooklyn headquarters during the fiscal year is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bound volumes ................................................ 1,482,091</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Booklets ....... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,851,533</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Total ............. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,333,024</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This shows an increase of bound volumes and booklets, in English, over that of 1925 to the number of 1,011,700.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to this, books produced and shipped out during the fiscal year which were published, in languages other than that of English, are, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bound volumes...........................-.................. &nbsp;&nbsp;81.344</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Booklets —................................................_.......... &nbsp;378,771</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Total ............................. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;460,115</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the foreign shipments there is a decrease of 59, 935 copies, but all told there is a net increase of 951,765 volumes. Add to this the printing of The Watch Tower, The Golden Age, and the great quantity of handbills that were printed, and 35,414,000 copies of the volunteer literature, and it is easily seen that the presses have been busy during the fiscal year of 1926.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to the English publications, the type is set, plates are made and books are manufactured from this office in the following languages, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Polish, Greek, German, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, Russian, Italian, Hawaiian, Hungarian, Icelandic, Lettish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Roumanian, Danish, Armenian, Albanian, Arabic, Croatian, Esperanto, Finnish, French, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish and Turko-Greek.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Increased Facilities</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There has been a steady growth in the demand for books and literature bearing the message of God’s kingdom. In order to meet this growing demand it became apparent that our facilities for the publication and manufacture of books must be increased. This was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">clear indication from the Lord to take some steps to increase. He has commanded that the -witness must be given, and we may confidently depend upon him to provide the means. For the past few years we have rented a building and used much second-hand machinery which we bought on time and paid for in instalments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Inasmuch as we are paying a large amount of rent which, of course, goes to those other than the Lord’s consecrated, the officers of the Society decided to attempt the erection of a building. A lot one hundred feet square, situate at </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">desirable place in Brooklyn, was purchased. There is now in course of erection an eight-story fireproof building on this lot. This will give almost double the floor space we have had during the past few years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A notice was sent out through The Watch Towek announcing that bonds would be issued, secured by first mortgage on the Society's real estate, and in addition thereto guaranteed by the Society, and that the money derived from such bonds would be used for the erection of a building to increase our capacity for spreading the message. It is exceedingly gratifying to report that this issue of bonds was quickly taken by the brethren, and was in fact oversubscribed. It is also worthy of notice that by far the greater amount was subscribed by those brethren who have a small amount of earthly means and who took a hundred dollar bond. This is exactly as we should expect it. The Lord has never used the earthly rich to carry on his work. It has always pleased him to use the weaker things to accomplish his purposes, thus clearly demonstrating that it is the power of the Lord that accomplishes the result and not man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When our new quarters are ready for occupancy it is the intention to install some new and additional machinery, and it is believed that then we shall be able to manufacture 10,000 volumes per day. This work is done by young men consecrated to the Lord who realize that they are enjoying the greatest privilege that any person on earth could enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It must be apparent to all that the most effective way of giving the witness concerning God and his kingdom is through the books and other printed matter. Where families can sit down by their own fireside and read, much can be accomplished in the way of enlightening the people. The far-reaching effect of the distribution of a million books cannot be fully estimated, and when we take into consideration that during the.fiscal year more than three million books and booklets have gone into the hands of the people of the United States, besides the great quantity of free literature, we can have some idea of the extent of this witness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Pilgrims</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">A pilgrim is one who travels about under the direction of the Society, preaching the gospel of the kingdom. He is able to preach two sermons a day. However, he who puts a book of approximately four hundred pages into the hands of one who reads is preaching more than forty sermons.in one day. From the Brooklyn office during the year 1926 there have been brethren sent out as pilgrims, who have engaged in preaching the gospel in English and in other languages as follows, to wit: English 116; Polish 10; Greek 8; German 11; Lithuanian 4; Ukrainian 6; Hungarian 3; Russian 2; Slovak 1; Italian 1; Syrian 1; Armenian 1; Japanese 1; Colored 3; Total 168.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These brethren have addressed class meetings to the number of 10,923, at which there was a total attendance of 432,791. They have addressed public meetings to the number of 6,425, with a total attendance of 506,698. The total mileage traveled by them during the year was 1,027,098.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now these pilgrim brethren spend their afternoons visiting the people in person, together with other brethren, then in the evening they hold meetings.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Colporteurs</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">A colporteur is one who travels about from door to door selling books which contain the message of God and his kingdom. During the ■fiscal year of 1926 there have been in the United States 414 colporteurs in the regular service, and 307 auxiliary colporteurs, or a total of 721 engaged in the service. The record of these colporteurs shows a marked increase in the sale of books over that of 1925. Their sales </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies in the Scriptures, The Harp of God, and Deliverance for the year total 166,181; and booklets 369,476. This shows a net increase of 95, 019 overthe booklet sales of 1925.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The colporteurs are wonderfully favored by the Lord. They not only preach many sermons by placing the books in the hands of the people but they have many opportunities of personal conversation with the people, and are thereby enabled to comfort many that .mourn by telling them God’s truth and how he will remove their burdens. Of course, some people treat them badly; and we should expect this, because this is the time for the goats to manifest themselves. However, many people treat the colporteurs very kindly, and this too is to be expected, because now also is the time for the sheep class to manifest themselves. The colporteurs testify that the blessings they enjoy are very great. The course that they take, and the results they accomplish, should be encouraging to others to engage in the service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Class Workers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">On a number of occasions it has been called to the attention of readers of The Watch Tower that this is a time when the Lord is making manifest's “remnant” amongst his people. By the remnant is meant those who faithfully and joyfully participate in the Lord’s service and who continue faithful to the end. In many ecclesias throughout the country the remnant is being made manifest. These classes are organized for service work and delight to go out in the work, and all classes that are dwelling together in peace are rejoicing in the opportunity of service. The busier they are in the service the greater their peace. This is exactly as the Lord has promised, because all such love his law and they permit nothing to offend them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the fiscal year<sup>-</sup> 860 classes were organized for service, and there were 523 additional sharp-shooters. The reports show a -weekly average of 1540 workers in the class service organization work. During the previous year there were 1,089 in this branch of the work. The reports show class sales during the year as follows: Bound volumes 169,391; booklets 756,073.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The combined sales of the classes and colporteurs for 1926 were, to wit: 1,125,549, or an increase of 207,773 over 1925.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Bethel Family Field Work</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">For the past year it has been thought well for the Bethel family to serve five days a week in the office and factory, and give Saturday to field service and Sunday to holding meetings, etc. The results have been very gratifying indeed. During the fiscal year the family alone has disposed of 363 sets of eight volumes and 357 sets of seven volumes, or a total of 530 sets; also 5,710 copies of The Harp and Deliverance, and 48,190 booklets, making a grand total of 57,803 volumes which they have placed in the hands of the people during the year. It is therefore seen that the Bethel family has had the privilege of preaching the witness in more than one way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I. B. S. A. Week</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The week of August 32nd to 39th was set aside especially for service work and known as I. B. S. A. Week. Reports were received from 531 classes in the United States showing 5,216 workers in the field during that week, and a total sale of 87,119 volumes. This was a decided increase over the result of I. B. S. A. Week for 1925.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Financial</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Good Hopes for 1926 have been less than the year before, although the cost of doing the work has been more. The larger portion of the Good Hopes has been spent in foreign countries, and for 1926 there is a deficit of more than three thousand dollars. We have faith that the Lord will provide all that is needed, however.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Conventions</span></h2>
<p><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font6">During the year numerous conventions have been held in various parts of the country, addressed by the pilgrim brethren, officers of the Society and others. These conventions have been helpful and upbuilding to the Lord’s people and have greatly encouraged the workers. The brethren are coming to a deeper appreciation of the fact that engaging in the Lord’s service is not to be compared with anything else. The Lord God is setting up his universal empire. He has set his beloved Son, his King, upon the throne. He has invited all who are consecrated to him to lift up the standard for the people, that their minds might be turned toward the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Everyone of the consecrated is an ambassador for Christ and a representative of Jehovah God. Each one must render his account to the Lord. Many of the friends are realizing that the designation “Faithful and True” is one of the titles given to the Lord Jesus, and that there could be no greater title given to anyone than to have it said of him or her at the end of his course: He has been faithful! Loving devotion to the Lord, and faithfulness, is that which holds the consecrated in line and enables them to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might, and to joyfully march on to victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each foreign branch is under the direction of a resident manager: and each one of these managers makes a report each month to the Society's president, and at the- end of the fiscal year an annual report. From these reports to headquarters information is gathered, and from this the annual report in the foreign lands is made up.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Local Foreign Work</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">By the term “Local Foreign Work” is meant the service carried on from the Brooklyn office in languages other than that of the English. This work is conducted in the office under competent assistants speaking the languages, to wit: Polish, Greek, German, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, Hungarian, Russian, Slovak, Italian, Syrian, and Armenian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Pilgrim service in the various languages is furnished </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">hereinbefore stated; also correspondence is carried on, translation of the volumes, the publication of The Watch Tower, and the publication and distribution of books and booklets-by colporteurs and class workers. These divisions of the work are not set out in detail for the reason that the total production and sales are embraced in the account of books manufactured and sent out from the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course all these brethren working in the foreign departments at Brooklyn also speak the English language, being members of the Bethel family and under the general management of the office manager and executive. In fact the foreign work here is merged together with the English work, and for this reason a separate and distinct report is not deemed necessary.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Foreign Countries</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">The work of all the foreign countries is supervised from the main headquarters at Brooklyn. Some of these countries are able to carry on their own work without financial assistance, while others require practically all their expenses to be borne by the American office. Of course, the work in these foreign countries is handicapped to some extent by the limited amount of money; but it is evident that the Lord would have it as it is, otherwise he would change the situation. Our American brethren are given the privilege however of being able to contribute to the Good Hopes fund, much of which is used for spreading the gospel in countries outside of America.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>British</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Great Britain is small in area, but the population is far above the average in intelligence. The work in Great Britain has taken on an impetus during the year such as was never before experienced. The sale of books in that small country during the fiscal year 1926 was fax greater than in any previous year, and measures up to what the annual sales throughout the entire earth totaled prior to 1914. Gradually the order-loving people of good will in that land are coming to see that there is no comfort in what they are receiving from the systems and no hope is held out to “them, either by the systems or by the government. They want to know something about the Lord and his kingdom; and the Society, as the Lord’s representative, has the privilege of carrying the message to them. Brother Hemery, the local manager at London, has well covered the situation in his report and the following is taken therefrom:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It can truly be said that the past year has been the most eventful of all the years in which the Lord’s people of the British Isles have engaged in the harvest work, in the witness to God, and in doing that work which the Lord has now set his people to do for the honour and for the establishment of the kingdom of his dear Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year has been notable in several ways, as ought to be expected. There has been more activity in the Lord’s service than in any previous year. Those who have long had a knowledge of the presence of the Lord have roused themselves to greater activity, and they have been reinforced by many who have recently come to a knowledge of the Truth, and who have thrown themselves wholeheartedly into the service of their King and for his kingdom. It is specially interesting to watch how those who now consecrate themselves to the Lord enter with avidity into his work. Only a few years back, when one saw the Truth he often took a considerable time to get free from the shackles of Babylon; but now, probably because of the manifest breakdown of Babylon’s claims, those who get free are immediately ready to join the Lord’s army of attack against that great city, the Devil’s organization. The urgent message of the Truth in this day of treading the winepress exactly meets the need of those who now Beek the Lord, it gives them just the work they desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a pleasure to report not only a large sale of books And booklets but a very considerable increase over Last year’s figures. The total output of books of all kinds carrying the message of the establishment of the kingdom is 662,096. The two main outflows of books are, of course, the Colporteur Service and the Service Work by the classes. The colporteurs have done very well indeed, and have responded in a true spirit to their honourable service. Those who have laboured long in the field do not tire; indeed, they seem to renew their youth; and it is a pleasure to report to you that since the London convention the colporteur work has received a stimulus, and many brethren are now entering in and taking its opportunities of service. Total books sold by colporteurs 292,389.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Service Work is, of course, more generally confined to the towns and suburbs. Great work has been done, and the persistent witness of house-to-house visitation is bearing its fruit. In this phase of the service the office staff and the other members of the London Bethel Home take share regularly, according to the arrangement you made. Every Saturday secs the Family off to the work in good time, making an average of about 550 calls, with average sales per week of 120 books. It is found to be a most enjoyable feature of the service, and an aid to both physical and spiritual health. The total output of books by the Service Work is 366,630.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Country Witness work, by which is meant the work done by motor parties in towns and villages where there are no classes, is a very active phase of our service. The brethren who are engaged in it, though isolated from class fellowship, are stimulated by their work and report enthusiastically of their privilege of service. There is hardly a hamlet in Great Britain where the witness has not been given several times, always followed by regular colporteur work; and many classes have been formed as a result of this work, besides that a very large number of books has been sold by this means. All Britain knows of the International Bible Students Association and of its message of the establishment of the kingdom of heaven, and that “millions now living will never die”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At present an endeavour is being made to carry the witness into the Irish Free State. A motor party and some colporteurs are already there, and a number of other Colporteurs are being directed thither. It is too early yet to report on the probabilities. The north of Ireland has had a good witness, but it has not much love for the Truth; and we have to note with regret that many of those there who have been blessed by the Truth have not valued it sufficiently to retain it. Frequently an argumentative spirit has hindered the spirit of the Lord, and the love of the Truth has faded away. But the Lord has some there who are very earnest in witnessing for him, and who show much of his spirit. These are blessed accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The outstanding feature of the year was the London Convention. Arranged, according to your instruction, on </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">larger scale than anything previously attempted, both in that it had an international character and was timed to last a full week, it more than met anticipations. As has already been reported, the immediate preceding conditions, the chief of which was a general strike which ended just before the convention began, brought the blessings of the convention into greater prominence. But of that outstanding week, the chiefest feature was the public witness given at the Royal Albert Hall, when Brother Rutherford addressed great audiences on two occasions, and when the “Testimony” to the rulers of the world was promulgated to the public and to all men. The convention and the public witness, and the wonderful output of books on the Service Day, when nearly 120,000 copies of “The Standard for the People” were sold, made the convention and this current year of 1926 one which must be preeminent, not only in British service years but in what has thereby been added to the general work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The six million copies of the “Testimony” which were printed for us in Brooklyn -were received and at once distributed. There has been considerable evidence that the message has bitten the clergy and some of their adherents. On the other hand, there is evidence that it has been received with favour here, even though Britain is therein shown to be the “seat of the beast”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no great change noticeable in the immediate prospects of the work. At the moment of writing, the long protracted miners’ lockout seems as if it might be brought to an end; the miners are starving, and apparently are being compelled to ask the mine owners for work. It is difficult to get the truth of the prospective trade situation, but in my judgment there is reason for thinking that there is plenty of trade to be done as soon as there is coal for the motive power, and therefore good reason for thinking that we shall find open doors for the books. We here look forward to the time when, in the Lord’s own way, the British people will be brought face to face with the fact that they in common with all humanity need Jehovah God. Though professedly God-fearing people, the nation as a whole is practically pagan. But undoubtedly there are many thousands of good people here who, when the test comes and the degradation of Babylon is clearly seen, will decide for God as against both church and state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In accordance with your instructions, the Pilgrim Service was rearranged. The brethren report that the two-day appointments are preferred; the pilgrims get more opportunities of getting acquainted with the brethren and of helping them out into the work. It is reported that in some of the classes there is not a very ready response to the call for afternoon service instead of a meeting. However, the change is certainly profitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Public Witness work has been very actively prosecuted ; 1,768 meetings having been held, as notified to the office, and 7,553,800 folders having been distributed to advertise these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Forty-five new classes have been formed during the year, bringing the total number up to 400.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The letters dispatched number 75,963 and those received 45,859.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The British friends look with eagerness for the time when the minds of the people will have been made ready by force of circumstances; and in the meantime we are doing what we can to arouse the people and to comfort all who will hear, by the ministry which God has given to his people-</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Canada</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Witnessing for the Lord’s kingdom has progressed in Canada during the fiscal year and the results are exceedingly gratifying. Every evidence is given that the Lord is superintending the work there as elsewhere, and his blessing has been added to this. Here and there are a few who are cold and inactive and who do little ot nothing in the work. Usually these are the ones who have been long in the Truth and who have become dreamers and think there is nothing more to do. Their inactivity, however, is made up for by the activity of others who have more recently come to a knowledge of the Truth, and the Lord’s work goes grandly on. The local manager of the Toronto office, Brother Salter, submits his report and the following excerpts are taken therefrom:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Once again it is my blessed privilege to render to you a report concerning the activities of the Lord’s dear children in Canada, and as I do so my heart is full of thanksgiving and praise to our Father in heaven who has so richly blessed his people in their service for the kingdom during the fiscal year that has now closed. This is my ninth annual report to you and, thanks be to God, it reveals the fact that the witness of the Truth has far surpassed any year heretofore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TORONTO FACTORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the transfer of our printing presses to the basement of the new addition to our premises, and the installation of the large Premier press recently supplied us by Brooklyn, we have now an excellent and well-appointed plant in every respect During the year it has rendered good and efficient service. In addition to printing all our printed supplies required in connection with the office we have been able to care for all orders for advertising material sent us by the various Canadian classes which, together with the volunteer matter, numbered 2,400,855 pieces, an increase of 48,803 pieces over last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tlie year’s output of books in Canada shows an increase of Si ,904 over 1925, the total sales being 308,353 books and booklets; and gratifying it is to report that over 40,000 of this number were Studies and that over 33,000 were Harps and Deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The number of colporteurs in the field was not quite as large as last year, the number being 63; but the result of these faithfnl workers was greater than that of 1925. These colporteurs accounted for the sale of 120,403 books, including- 3,094 sets of Studies, which is an increase of 1,313 in sets alone over last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PILGRIM WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There have been engaged in this phase of the work in Canada 17 regular pilgrims and auxiliary pilgrims, a slight decrease compared with 1925, and a corresponding decrease in the attendance at public and class meetings. The attendance at 1,818 public meetings was 151,709, and at 2,116 class meetings, 92,270.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new policy adopted by the Society whereby the pilgrims are given two-day appointments with evening meetings only, thereby opening to them the privilege of entering into the canvassing phase of the service, is greatly appreciated by both the pilgrims and the friends. Already it is manifest that the Lord’s blessing is resting in no uncertain way thereon, as revealed in the results and through the letters received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SCHOOL WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Formerly various “school teams” were engaged the whole year serving the truth in the schools of Canada, with the exception of the winter months when, motoring being impossible, they were routed to serve classes and to colporteur small towns. The results during the six to eight weeks of harvest time were not good, and during the winter months they went slightly behind financially, which loss was eared for by the Society. This year we closed down the school work during harvest, thus enabling the brethren to go into the literal harvest fields for six weeks and thereby finance themselves for the coming winter months in the colporteur field. The result for the five and one-half months of school</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FBENCH WOBK IN CANADA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Early in May three zealous colporteurs began an assault on the enemy’s stronghold, and blazed a way from Montreal along the north shore of the St. Lawrence river by Ford to Quebec City. Here they crossed to the south side and continued along the south shore with unabated energy, heading for the Maritime Provinces. Many interested were found enroute, despite the thorough warning by priests. At Riviere du Loup their course was arrested when on June the 14th the whole party was taken before the court. They pleaded not guilty, were released on bail and continued their route. Our lawyer wrote the Quebec City authorities informing them of our position and stating that the action would be defended vigorously. Thereupon the authorities decided to drop their charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Arrests were by no means confined to Quebec. At St Boniface, Manitoba, a French settlement controlled by the priests, a colporteur sister was arrested in the month of May for selling our literature without a license. She was released on bail, and here again the action was defended and the charges dismissed. Winnipeg papers carried a fair report of the trial, and thus a mighty witness was given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite the numerous arrests for distributing the “Indictment” in French last year, it was decided to distribute another 150,000 tracts this year in the city of Montreal, during August. Several brethren applied for license to distribute, but were refused, whereupon it was decided to do the work without license. The work was begun and proceeded well. At the close of the first morning’s work it was found that one brother had been arrested. He was imprisoned for a few hours. Pending his hearing the remainder of the friends continued the work and the authorities did not interfere, being content to await the verdict in the one ease. A splendid witness was given, and several communications commending the work were received. In due time the charge against the brother came up for hearing; and despite the fact that the same Recorder had previously condemned four brethren for the same offense, he dismissed the complaint, and thus an open door was left for further activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A French class numbering eighteen is now organized in Montreal; and these, together with other French brethren, are energetically heralding the good news of the kingdom in the province of Quebec.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Northern Ontario, at a place called Chiswick, a French class of thirty members just “grew up”. The colporteurs labored in that district last year, and we had also mailed the French tracts, etc. This year a French colporteur sister was laboring in that territory again and “found” this class of about thirty, all out of the Catholic church, but not in touch with the Society. They were studying the French Habp and rejoicing therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER LANGUAGES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work Is also carried on in Canada in the Polish, German, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Italian, Greek and Hungarian languages. While the numbers are not great the interest is strong, and those who are engaged in the work put forth zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house and much good is accomplished. More brethren are needed in that work and in the Lord’s due time it is hoped these will be raised up.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year twenty-eight conventions have been held in Canada, nineteen for the English-speaking friends, four for the Ukrainians, four for the Polish, and one for the Germans. At each of these conventions the spirit of the Lord has been manifest in a marked degree and the brethren were greatly built up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work of witnessing for the Lord’s kingdom in Canada. Is in a healthy condition. The friends are happy and rejoicing, and are pushing on against all obstacles to complete the work which the Lord has committed into their hands.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>Germany</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The World War worked greater havoc in Germany and in a more material way than probably in any other nation involved. Out of the depths of their sorrow many of the German people have turned to the Lord and have received comfort. As our faithful brethren there have been moved by the spirit of the Master they have gone forward under adverse conditions giving the witness concerning the kingdom. In 1925 there was a measure of recovery in a material way, but 1926 has been a year of great depression in Germany and the people have had a hard way financially. The efforts of the governments to stabilize monetary conditions have caused general unemployment and high cost of living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Notwithstanding the great scarcity of money there has been a wide witness given to the Truth—a decided increase over 1925. In the year 1926 in Germany there were sold to the people, and delivered, books and booklets to the number of 3,328,658 volumes. This was a decided increase over the year previous. In addition thereto our own plant there printed and sent out 7, 615,440 copies of The Watch Towee and The Golden Age; and the London resolution and discourse, produced in the form of volunteer matter, were distributed this year in Germany to the number of 12,764,000 copies, freely to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Meetings were held for the German public </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to the </span><span class="font6">number of 2,816, with a total attendance of 464,512; and the meetings for the interested numbered 87,791, with an attendance of 3,010,731. There have been engaged in the service twenty pilgrims regularly. In addition to this there have been auxiliary pilgrims in the service, under the direction of the Society, to the number of 222, which is an increase of 90 over 1925.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brethren in Germany are very self-sacrificing and are putting forth their best efforts to let it be known that Jehovah is God and that Christ is King. Special effort was put forth there during I. B. S. A. service week. In that week there were sold and delivered in Germany books and booklets to the total of 1,348,582 copies. It may be of interest here to remark that since the World War the Society’s books and booklets in Germany have gone into the hands of the people to the number of 10,108,502 volumes, which means practically an average of one for each family. Of course every family has not the literature as yet, but this shows </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">tremendous witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year 109 new classes were organized in Germany and enthusiastically took up the service work. Besides this there are many towns wherein are small numbers who are interested in the Truth but who are not yet fully organized for the service. During the year 1926 there were 55 fewer colporteurs in Germany than in 1925; nevertheless, the sales were greater. Greater numbers have entered the class service work, and this probably accounts for the fewer colporteurs and the greater number of sales. Some of the German colporteurs have been moved into Austria and Czecho-Slo-vakia to try to carry on the work there. The number of class workers engaged during the year in Germany </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">was, to wit: 12,000. In addition to these regular work</span><span class="font6">ers there were many others working part time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Magdeburg our German headquarters is located. It has the Society's best printing plant in Europe, and is now equipped with modern machinery, has its own electric light and power plant, houses all the workers and feeds them, has some ground on which to grow vegetables; and about 170 brethren are engaged in the work there. Our German brethren are becoming expert in the manufacture of books. Only in the last few months, however, has the Magdeburg factory been able to produce good cloth-bound books, and that only since cloth began to be shipped there from America. The Magdeburg factory during the year produced as follows: Cloth bound books, 555,000; paper bound large volumes, 460,000; booklets, 2,272,000; magazines, 7,154,000; free literature, Testimonies, etc., 17,411,330; making </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">grand total of 27,852,330 pieces produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There have been sent out from the Magdeburg factory this year 60,270 parcels and 9,663 boxes or cases of literature. In addition thereto, in Germany are maintained nine shipping depots from which shipments are made. The total parcels and boxes shipped from Magdeburg and branches are, to wit: 340,000. Letters received during the year 90,920; dispatched 78,099.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Notwithstanding the great amount of work accomplished in Germany there has also been much opposition. The Devil has been warring against those who keep the commandments of God in giving the witness, and who have the testimony of Jesus Christ. Many of them have been arrested and haled into court. This required the employment of lawyers and many legal battles. There have been pending in the courts this year in Germany cases against 897 brethren. Out of this number 460 of the actions have been tried and completed, and there remain 487 cases yet undisposed </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of. </span><span class="font6">In 421 of these actions the brethren were acquitted, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and in 25 they were </span><span class="font6">fined because of technicalities and failures of the attorneys to take advantage of the legal points at proper times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course this effort on the part of the adversary has been designed to discourage the brethren and hinder the work. It became necessary to install a legal department </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font6">the Magdeburg headquarters, with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">brother in charge who is familiar with the law, in order to look after our brethren who were arrested. The Lord has sustained them and they go on with joy. The German brethren are happy because they know that they are giving a witness to their fellow creatures, and that soon the kingdom </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">God will be in full force and the people will be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font6">lieved from their distress and suffering.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Central European Office</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Society's Central European office is at Berne, Switzerland, where a factory for the manufacture </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">books and booklets is also maintained and operated. During the first part of the year there was considerable disturbance at the headquarters in Berne because of the activities of the enemy. These things are to be expected because this is the time when the Devil is warring against those who keep the commandments of God. The difficulty has cleared away. A few have gone from the service, but those who remain are all the more active and the work goes on. Quoting from the report of the manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although there has been a decrease of workers, more actual work has been done with less workers who have manifested all the more zeal; the cost of production has been decreased also, and the work is now being managed more economically and systematically. . . . There is every indication that the friends in Switzerland are renewing their strength and that the “remnant” are fighting all the harder to make up for lost time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The countries under the jurisdiction of the Central European office are, to wit: Switzerland, France, Belgium, Italy, Jugo-Slavia, and Holland. A report of these will appear under the heads of these countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year there were manufactured and shipped out from the Society's plant at Berne 837,137 volumes of books and booklets. The home office has had to carry quite a heavy expense for this Central European office during the year, but we hope that in the year coming conditions will be better. Books, booklets, Watch Tower, Golden Age, volunteer matter, etc., to the total amount of 7,259,800 copies have been printed at this branch and sent out. Letters and cards received 10,430; dispatched 9,974.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Northern European Office</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Society's Northern European office is situated at Copenhagen, Denmark, under the management of Brother William Dey. Under the jurisdiction of that office are the countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Esthonia. The Lord has manifested in no uncertain way the approval of the establishment of the Northern European office. Brother Dey is an untiring and zealous worker, prompted wholly by love for the Lord. The brethren have taken new interest under his supervision, and the local managers and other brethren have been working in harmony. From Brother Dey’s report the following quotation is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a joy to be alive and sending you the report of the work in the Northern European countries for the year just ended. On March 31st the increase in output was but little over 10,000 volumes, for the winter was severe. With the spring, however, and the London Convention, there came a change, so that it rose to 187,585 volumes. In all 73,003 Studies and Habps were put out, an Increase of 83 percent over last year; and 319,495 booklets, an increase of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">93 </span><span class="font6">percent. The grand total was thus 392,498 or, including Bibles, etc., 403,937 pieces for the fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are now directors in 188 of the 232 classes; and as you advised, the local managers have arranged fewer public meetings for the pilgrims so that the time freed might be devoted to helping the brethren to better grasp the new thoughts and encourage them in the furthering of the work. As a result 650 brethren are out each week on an average, while in I- B. S. A. week, 1500 swung into action and put out 70,000 books. It was a wonderful time, and we confidently expect next year will see still greater numbers taking part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of colporteurs, the legion of honour in the Lord’s army, there are 53 wholetime ones and about 30 auxiliaries, and these have put out 108,134 volumes; although in some parts they must cycle forty-five miles between villages, with no Intervening houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bulletins, based on the American one, now go out regularly, and the organization is gradually being perfected so that the work may be carried on still more energetically and systematically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the eight dates fixed by the Society for World-wide Witnesses there were 1040 “shouts”, with 91,544 strangers present and 9,164 books sold. Soon we trust that the Lord may arrange for us to use the radio also; we are trying to obtain permission for broadcasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On your advice the Swedish office was on October 1st moved from Orebro to Stockholm, and we confidently look forward to still further expansion in the work there. Offices are now also opened at Riga and Reval, as arranged with Brother Rutherford in London; and though at present the harvest is plenteous and the labourers few, we expect jn answer to our prayers to see many more classes formed and organized for service before next year is gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The interchange of pilgrims has been much appreciated in the various countries, and has served to emphasize the unity of the work. The idea of giving pilgrims two days in a place is proving very beneficial in these countries where the distances are so great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has been a pleasure to colabour with the local managers, all of whom have wholeheartedly taken up every suggestion for the more effective carrying on of the work. We hope that the large Increase in output will enable each of the four old offices to pay their way this year. It is indeed cheering to be able to report to you that everywhere the brethren are in good spiritual condition and are seeing more clearly than ever what a privilege is ours at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We shall all be much delighted if we can have a visit from Brother Rutherford next year; the friends th all Scandinavia love him very dearly and, though we have no rights at all, have come to look upon him as belonging to us in a special way, as until this year he has never failed to visit us when over in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In service week the countries under the jurisdiction of the Northern European office placed in the hands of the people 68,599 volumes. A little more than a year ago it looked rather dubious for the work in Northern Europe because of opposition there; but now, thanks be to the Lord, the opposition has melted away and the Lord’s work is going on with a greater impetus than ever in the history of that land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Africa—South</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Society’s South African branch at Capetown exercises management over all the countries of South Africa, including Nyassaland, Rhodesia and the Transvaal. This is a great country in size but small in population, comparatively speaking, and the brethren there work under great handicap. The local manager, Brother Thomas Walder, assisted by Brother George Phillips, is putting forth a strenuous effort to bear the message to the people. The following is a quotation from the report from that office:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I am glad to report that our figures show a substantial Increase over last year, the book sales being about 10,000 In increase. When It Is remembered that this phase of the work is confined almost entirely to the Europeans, and of these there are only approximately one and a half millions spread over a subcontinent totaling as many square miles, the figures are very encouraging. Truly the field is great and the workers are few; but these have gone forth, some working under exceedingly lonely and trying conditions, and have manifested much zeal and self-sacrifice in their desire to see “The Standard for the People” raised in every corner of this vast country. In addition to the workers reported below, there are considerably less than 100 class workers in the whole of South Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to the books and booklets put out in South Africa during 1926, the “Message of Hope” was distributed to the number of 282,500; and now the “Testimony” is having a wide distribution there. One hundred and fifty-seven public meetings have been held, with an attendance of 12,933; and 199 pilgrim visits have been made to the classes, with an attendance of 2,256. Only one brother is giving all of his time to the pilgrim service, while others give part time. In Nyassaland and Rhodesia alone 202 meetings have been held, with an attendance of 6,734. We quote further from Brother Walder’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The country is politics-mad, and just now “patriotic” and racial feeling is running high over the “flag” controversy. Midst all this we rejoice to hold aloft the banner of our King and the kingdom, and to bear witness that only by rallying to it will the blessing of life in true peace, happiness and prosperity be found. . . . Most of the service work is being done by English-speaking brethren. Where the brethren are busy there is a happy spirit of peace and harmony prevailing. Where they have not accepted their privileges of service, there is often strife and discord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is gratifying to note that the few brethren working in South Africa continue with renewed zeal and determination and that the Lord is richly blessing their efforts. The local printing press established by the Society at Capetown has been a great help in carrying on the work in that land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>Africa—West</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in West Africa is conducted from Sierra Leone, and in addition to that country is the country of the Gold Coast and Nigeria. The Lord’s work moves steadily and majestically on. The following is quoted from the report of Brother Brown, the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It Is seen that the Lord has blessed the work here, when we remember how the people suffered financially by the railway strike here; many of the strikers had to return to work at reduced wages. Sierra Leone is well stocked with books. The volunteer matter for this year has been absorbed by the people more readily than any previous time in this country. The denominational churches are in distress and perplexity. The people are looking for the Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brother Claude Brown has made an extensive trip throughout Nigeria during the year and Brother W. B. Brown is now on a journey to that country. Where darkness once covered that land completely, now the light of the glorious kingdom is shining there and some of the people are rejoicing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>Albania</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In the early days of the Gospel Age Albania was known as Illyricum. The Apostle Paul preached the gospel there. (Romans 15:19) It seems in keeping with the Lord’s way of doing things to now have the witness given in that country at the close of the age. The population is made up of Greeks, Mohammedans and Turks. They have a language of their own, known as Albanian. There are only about fifteen consecrated brethren in Albania, and these are doing their best to spread the message of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brother Stamulas of the Greek Department in Brooklyn, who is now in Athens, is being sent also into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Al</span><span class="font6">bania to assist them. Among those who have received the Truth there is &amp;&nbsp;Mohammedan officer of the Turkish army, who is now quite active in doing the Lord’s service. In America there are about thirty consecrated Albanian brethren, and these are anxious to assist their fellow countrymen to get a knowledge of the Truth. The Greek Catholic religion has control of the Albanians, but now they are breaking away and are looking for that which is satisfying and which is fonnd in the Lord’s Word.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>Argentine</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">From Buenos Aires the work for the Argentine Republic is directed. Brother Muniz, the local manager, in submitting his report to the Society’s president says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All the dear friends here, though not many, send you their great appreciation for the Truth that the Lord brought to them by your splendid help. So they send to you and all the dear ones with you their love, and I write mine with theirs; and we all hope that the dear Lord may keep helping and blessing you that you may be able to continue imparting those blessings to us in this far-off country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brother Muniz reports that there have been distributed this year in Montevideo and Paraguay, from the local office at Buenos Aires, 323,400 copies of the volunteer matter; and books and booklets have been sent out to the number of 3,355. The number of Watch Tower subscribers in this territory, in Spanish, totals 880. During the year 184 meetings have been held with a total attendance of 3,800. There are now twelve classes in Spanish and German in those regions. Brother Ott and Brother Gimpel went to the Argentine last year from Germany and have been doing good work amongst the German people. Although the distances are great these brethren, together with Brother Muniz, have been putting forth a strenuous effort, with splendid results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Generally the people are very irreligious, yet there are a few who desire to hear the Truth. It is the privilege of God’s consecrated children, however, to give the witness ; and this by his grace is being done.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Armenia</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Armenian work is directed from Beirut. Brethren there have erected a wooden meeting house for regular meetings. During the year there have been 134 public meetings with an attendance of 9,720; and 227 class meetings with an attendance of 5,912. Two conventions were held in Beirut during the year, with 107 brethren attending. At these conventions 22 were immersed. The Armenian books placed during the year were 3,439 volumes. Sixteen thousand copies of the “Indictment” and “Message of Hope” were distributed amongst the people there. The field there seems to be great and the laborers few, but the brethren who are doing the work are putting forth their best efforts to give the witness of the kingdom, and the Lord has blessed them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>Australia</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Tire report from Melbourne, the Society’s headquarters in Australia, for the year 1926 is gratifying. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font6">must have in mind that Australia and New Zealand are vast territories, and much effort is required of the brethren to travel and bear the message there. However; the witness goes grandly on. To give a full, detailed report would require much space. A summary of the work as given by Brother Johnston, the local manager, is here quoted, and generally covers the situation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Truly the Lord hath done great things for us whereof we are glad. The year just ended has been the busiest and the best in the history of the Lord’s work in this part of the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You will see by comparison that we have Increased our output of volumes over last year by more than one-half. The brethren throughout Australia and New Zealand are greatly appreciating their privileges of service in the drive work, and the message is going forth with a vigor and volume greater than ever before. It is very refreshing to hear the testimonies of these dear ones who, filled with the joy of the Lord, recount their experiences in his glad service. A natural sequence to the foregoing is that the activities of the Melbourne office have greatly increased. But the staff do not mind that; they are pleased to be fully occupied in the dear Lord’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I. B. S. A. Week, August 22-29th, was a great success In this part of the world. By the universal nature of its appeal many were inspired to engage In the service who had not heretofore done anything in tlie drive work. The results were highly gratifying. Reports received from a number of classes reveal that at least 4,150 books were disposed of during that week. That is a good record for Australasia, but I have no doubt but that it will be surpassed during the coming witness week in October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The attendance at the worldwide witness on August 29th was not so large as usual, the largest recorded meeting being 500, at Cairns. Perhaps the title was too staid to attract attention. I anticipate that greater attention will be paid to “Earth’s Greatest Conflict Near”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pilgrim work during the year has been considerable, nearly 90,000 miles having been covered in our endeavors to reach and to feed the Lord’s flock. A total of 21,735 people have heard the message of the kingdom, and much good has been accomplished. There still remains much to do, however, and there will be no slacking of our hand in that direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Through the kindness of the Head office we now have a printing press installed and in operation, and are hoping to effect a considerable saving on our heavy printing bill. We are greatly indebted to the Brooklyn office and to Brother Rutherford for all the assistance, financial and otherwise, received from time to time, and would continue to ask for an Interest in your prayers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>Austria</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">During the first part of the year the work in Austria did not progress so well as it seemed that it should, and for the sake of economy and better organization Austria was placed under the direction of the Magdeburg office. There are five classes in Austria that are well organized and engaging in the work, but there are several small classes that are not yet organized for service. Since the reorganization the Austrian work is taking on a new impetus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The local manager reports from Austria that not withstanding the handicap during the first part of the year, in Austria this year there have been disseminated 55,943 books and booklets, or an increase of 13,070 over that of 1925. During I. B. S. A. Week alone, in Austria, there were put into the hands of the people as many books as in any previous three months period. There is always great opposition to our work in Austria, because it is a stronghold of Catholicism and the people are much hindered by the “prison keepers”. Notwithstanding this the witness is being given throughout Austria, and those who are privileged to give it are rejoicing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>Blind</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Society maintains at Logansport, Ind., a branch for the benefit of the blind people. This is in charge of Brother A. L. Ball. Fifty-four blind brethren are regularly served with the literature of the Society which Brother Ball prepares for them in the blind systems and sends to them. Amongst the literature regularly printed for the blind are the leading article in The Watch Tower and the Sunday School lessons. Other blind people who are not consecrated are becom</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font6">interested in reading the literature thus prepared.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>Brazil</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Necessarily in a Catholic and priest-ridden country, wherein the greater part of the population possess a small degree of intelligence, the giving of the witness is attended with difficulty. Brazil has a great territory and few workers, but it is gratifying to note that the work from the Society's office at Rio de Janeiro goes steadfastly forward. The local manager says in his report : “The Lord has opened a large door here at present to proclaim the Truth. The brethren are active, the preachers are constantly preaching against us, but our glorious King gives us joy and courage and we go on.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are classes there in Portuguese and Ukrainian, besides those for American-speaking brethren. Some colporteurs are doing splendid work. The work is particularly progressing in Rio-Claro, Villa Americana, Soro-caba, Parana, St. Catharina and Rio-Grande-Do-Sul. There is a number of German and Ukrainian brethren in Brazil who are showing real zeal for the Lord. There has been a great increase of requests from the people throughout Rio de Janeiro and other parts of Brazil for literature concerning the Truth, and the Society has furnished this as fast as possible. The Society has its own printing press there for local work, and this is used to print the Portuguese Watch Tower as well as tracts and advertising matter in the various languages.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>British Guiana</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The report from British Guiana for 1926 is encouraging. It shows a decided increase over that of 1925. From the report submitted by Brother Phillips, the local manager, the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite a long drought, followed by a severe rainy season which ruined most of the remaining crops, and the subsequent depression of trade which obtains as a result of this combination, there has been a substantial increase in our sales during the year. The total number of books sold is nearly twice as large as that of 1925, and the booklets are more than three times as many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This, we believe, is due in large measure to the regular Sunday-morning-eanvass of the outlying villages, which was undertaken during the year. Our records show that more than half the total sales were made in these villages. The people are desperately in need of money, but are so anxious for the Truth that the writer has seen, on several occasions, the last shilling in the house used to purchase our books, and at a time when there was no immediate prospect of replacing the money. We think that there must be many blessings in store for the people of British Guiana who, as a rule, listen to our message gladly, even though too poor to buy the books readily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “Message of Hope” also was enthusiastically received, and many were heard to remark that they needed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There has been a better attendance at the class meetings in Georgetown during 1926.' The brethren, in the main, continue to appreciate The Watch Tower, which is regularly studied; and they are loyal to the Society, recognizing it to be the Lord’s channel for the organization of his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brethren have also during the year made nine visits to the leper colony and delivered discourses and answered questions. Many of these poor, afflicted people expressed great appreciation for the Truth, and they look forward to our monthly visits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The dear brethren in this part of the world continue to show zeal and loving devotion to the Lord and to perform their part of the work in giving the witness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>Bulgaria</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">There are now several classes in Bulgaria, small </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">number. During the year one pilgrim brother has visited these classes and has held meetings for 386 of the friends. The message has been put out, in the form of books and free literature, but not in great quantities. The witness is handicapped there by reason of governmental restrictions and opposition, yet the hope is to get notice into the hands of the powers that be that the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>Canal Zone</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in the Canal Zone is under the direct supervision of the Brooklyn office and is giving a good account of itself notwithstanding the difficulties involved.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>Colored</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Under this heading reference is made to brethren </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">America who are of African descent. This work is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">or</span><span class="font6">ganized and conducted as a separate branch only with the view of giving a more effective witness. Brother Banks travels practically all the time amongst the brethren, and several other speaking brethren are working part time. From a report of Brother Banks the following excerpts are taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The common people are ready for the Truth, and if the clergy were out of the way there would not be halls and auditoriums enough to hold the people who would assemble to hear it. The people are dissatisfied with the nominal churches. It requires about twenty months for one person to completely cover the field of the present allotment where there are classes of colored people interested in the Truth. During the year there have been 240 visits made to the classes, and the number of miles traveled was 18,375; public meetings held 304; class meetings 341; attendance at public meetings 13,315; attendance at class meetings 5,966.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The loyal and faithful brethren are to be commended for their hearty cooperation, and th® results as shown from the work done throughout the year are gratifying. While there is some opposition, of course, this is to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">expected. The adversary will strive to prevent the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">wit</span><span class="font6">ness in every way possible. Amongst the loyal ones, however, the sweet spirit of the Lord prevails, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">Beal increases. The Lord’s blessing upon this separate division of the work has been manifest in many ways, showing that the proper course was taken in having </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">special witness given amongst the colored people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>Czecho-Slovakia</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Czecho-Slovakia during the most of the year has been directed by our local manager from the city of Host, but it has seemed more economical and better to put this work under the management of the German office, which has now been done. The “Testimony” is being given in an effective manner in that country. A million copies of the “Testimony” tract are now being distributed throughout Czecho-Slovakia, and colporteurs are being sent there from Germany, also pilgrim brethren, to assist in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are eight well-organized classes now in Czechoslovakia that are engaged regularly in the service work, and other smaller classes doing what they can. The increase this year in Czecho-Slovakia has not been such a large one, but it has been a healthy increase. The books sent out during the fiscal year were 9,GOS more than in 1925. Fifty-nine public meetings have been held during the year, with an attendance of 6,618; and there have been class meetings to the number of 1,186, with an attendance of 13,050. The literature is being put out there in both the Czech and German languages.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Denmark</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The local office in Denmark is at Copenhagen, under the supervision of Brother Luttichau, who has been long and faithful in the service. Brother Luttichau begins his report by saying that the number of books from that office which were sent out this year was more than double what was sent out in 1925. This is due to the better organization and the greater zeal of the brethren; the Lord’s grace being the chief factor, of course. The class workers, auxiliary colporteurs and regular colporteurs have been putting forth splendid efforts in Denmark. During I. B. S. A. Week alone 24,941 books were put out there. “This has been a means of opening our eyes to see what can be done by concerted efforts, and it will surely spur us on to reach out for far greater results,” says the local manager. There have been new classes formed and these have added fresh and zealous workers to the field. At present there are twelve Danish brethren giving all of their time to the colporteur service, and six auxiliary colporteurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Esperanto</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font6">Esperanto is a language that some have attempted to make universal. Brother Alfred Egg of Baden, Germany, devotes his time to the work in the Esperanto language. Brother Harteva of Einland assists at such times as he can. During the year letters received in Esperanto were 103 and letters dispatched numbered 265. Four issues of The Golden Age have been put out in Esperanto to the number of 231 copies. Millions, World Distress and Standard for the People are translated and published in the Esperanto. There is also a number of blind people who read the Esperanto language, and in about fifteen countries there are about forty of these blind ones who are corresponding with the Society’s office and reading the literature prepared for them in Esperanto. During the year two lectures were delivered in England in Esperanto. It </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font6">interesting to Bible Students to know that the Bible is published in the Esperanto language. While this does not seem to be so important to give the witness, yet it is one </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the means adopted, and the Lord’s blessing is upon it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>Esthonia</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Esthonia is now really getting started. It has been handicapped for lack of workers and for other reasons. Brother West, the local representative under Brother Dey, reports amongst other things as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I am convinced that many hearts have been comforted and refreshed as a result of our witness here. The population here is very mixed, as one might imagine, with </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font6">many changes in recent years. Some are prosperous and quite satisfied with Satan’s organization, and others toil with little gain and hope for a better order. Many who previously had large estates have had them confiscated, and Hie compensation they get is practically negligible. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">met one such family yesterday. They had borrowed the Wobld Distress booklet from a friend, and when I arrived they were right ready for me and after a short canvass bought four other booklets. A gentleman whom I recently-met, when I first introduced the books said that </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font6">did not want them. Detecting, however, a certain friendliness manifested by him, I continued the canvass; and finally he absolutely broke down and tears ran down his cheeks. He really did want the books, but he said, “I cannot speak, I have no money and nothing to do.” I found that he already had the Wobld Distbess booklet, and after mak</span><span class="font5">ing </span><span class="font6">another call I glanced through his window on my way </span><span class="font5">hack </span><span class="font6">and he was intently reading that booklet</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>Finland</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Finland is under the jurisdiction of ths Northern European office, and Brother Kaarlo Barieva is the local manager at Helsingfors. The report from Finland this year is gratifying, to say the least. Notwithstanding much opposition that was stirred up during the past twelve months by the adversary, the Lord’s witnessing concerning his kingdom goes grandly on. From Brother Barieva’s report to headquarters the following excerpts are taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a great and highly appreciated privilege to send you the report of the work done In Finland during the last year. It has been a marvelous time In the service of the Lord. It is true that the great adversary has made severe attacks upon us and has succeeded in leading astray some of those who have been with us; but he has not been able to hinder the work, which has gone grandly forward, and we have seen the fulfilment of the prophecy of Jesus, In Matthew 25: 28: “Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.” Although some have left us, those who have been faithful have experienced the increase of their privileges, and so the work has prospered over all our expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although we thought that we had come to a very good result last year, yet the output this year of 118,460 volumes has been almost twice the amount we put out last year. This is Indeed very encouraging for such a country as is ours, where the homes are very scattered. All our cities and towns together contain only about 100,000 families, and of the 600,000 families in the country districts some live very far from one another. But the work is the Lord’s and he will direct it to a happy consummation, and wo feel very happy over our part</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this connection I would like to express my deep gratitude over the arrangement you have made, putting the Finnish work under the general supervision of the Northern European office. It has been indeed a very, very great blessing here, and In all the other countries involved.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>France</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Work in France during the year has not progressed so rapidly as we might hope. In fact the French people do not take readily to things religious, especially where serious thinking is required. However there are several colporteurs working there, who report good success in come sections. Several classes in France are quite active, but with a country as intelligent as it is there should be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">greater witness being given. The financial crisis in France has made it very difficult to place the literature in the hands of the people. Probably this is one of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">reasons why the work there has not become greater.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>Belgium</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">What is said of France may be said of Belgium. Thera are several zealous brethren in Belgium who are doing the best they can, but the work is not so great as we hoped for. The Belgians, of course, speak the French language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year there have been placed in the hands of the people of France and Belgium 43,232 books and booklets. There have been 412 class workers and 27 colporteurs engaged in the service there. This is a good showing, but we hoped to see it better, and we believe </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font6">will show up better in the near future.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>Greece</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The adversary succeeded in doing much against ths Lord’s work in Greece during the past year. His priests of the Greek system caused orders to be issued against the distribution of any and all of the Society’s literature. Many books were confiscated and destroyed. Detectives were sent to our headquarters at Athens and the books there were seized. Many of the brethren were arrested and required to appear in court. Their zeal, however, was not dampened. Trusting in the Lord they have pressed on energetically, doing with their might what their hands found to do; and now the Lord is clearing the way. It was truly a test of their faith, but true to his promise the Lord has delivered them. From the local manager at Athens, the report following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It. is with great joy and thanks in the Lord that I anj writing you this letter. I am sure that you will be very glad to know that the dear Lord has today granted liberty to the work here. The internal Ministry of Greece today has given an order to the Post Offices throughout Greece that all the publications of the Watch Towes Bible &amp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tract Society shall be allowed to circulate in Greece, “for there is no law that can forbid them to be circulated,” says the order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As you know, the previous government had forbidden our publications; all the Watch Towers that were sent here were destroyed by the Post Offices, and some of our books held, others destroyed, and others sent back to America. Now we are granted the liberty to tell the Truth to the people, with the stamp of the internal Ministry that “there is no law that can forbid” the publications of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. We all rejoiced greatly and gave thanks to the Lord for his great favor to us. The brethren now will go out in the work with such zeal and joy as never before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year three pilgrims have been working amongst the brethren in Greece and also serving the public. The report shows that 298 class meetings were held, with an attendance of 2,107; and 20 public lectures, with an attendance of 3,030. Most of the Greek colporteurs during the year were compelled to withdraw from the service, but now they are returning since the edict of the new government. Notwithstanding this handicap, during the year 11,263 volumes were placed amongst the Greek people, and 200,000 copies of the “Indictment” were distributed. The work now appears to be in a much more healthy condition, and the brethren are rejoicing and are pushing on with renewed zeal.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>Holland</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Holland plods along, but a witness is being given nevertheless. This is directed from the Society’s office at Berne. Fourteen public meetings have been held in Holland during the year. Two colporteurs are regularly engaged in the service there. During the year a total of 12,643 books and booklets have been placed in the hands of the people. There are 250 subscribers to the Hollandish Watch Tower.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>Hungary</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The World War so disrupted the peoples of Hungary and mixed them in with other governments that there are many things there to hinder the work of preaching the message of the Lord’s kingdom. Part of the Hungarians are within the jurisdiction of Roumania, while the others are under the control of the Czecho-Slovakian government. In both places there is marked opposition to the Truth. Frequently the literature is confiscated by government authorities, on the pretext that it is enemy lierature. The brethren are ostracized and persecuted because they were non-combatants during the World War. For some time the Hungarian work has been directed from Cluj, Roumania, by the Society’s office at that place; but the enemy has gotten in his work and made much disturbance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Hungarian work has not been going on satisfactorily, either in America or in Europe. The brother in the Brooklyn office who was looking after the Hungarian work thought it more important for him to sell life insurance and do something on the outside, and the Lord’s work has been hindered here in a large measure. It is regrettable to say that the Hungarian work is in this condition. We are now pleased to say, however, that it is being reorganized, particularly in the country of Czecho-Slovakia; and the Hungarian brethren in Roumania have also been able to surmount some of the difficulties there and are pushing on with the work. There are many zealous brethren amongst the Hungarians, and a few ambitious ones whom the adversary can use to make trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two brethren have been making pilgrim visits amongst the Hungarians in Czecho-Slovakia and have held 139 meetings, with an attendance of 3,109. Five other brethren have given part of their time to the service. The exact number of books and other pieces of literature put out is not available at this time; it has not always been convenient for the brethren there to keep memoranda and make reports because of the opposition. In Roumania four Hungarian brethren have been engaged in the pilgrim service all the time and one </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">portion of the time. These have visited during the year 979 classes and held meetings at which there was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">total attendance of 43,800.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>India</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">For several years the Society has maintained </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">branch office at Khottayam, India, under the direction </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Brother Joseph, a native. This dear brother has done splendid work, has held many meetings, has bad the literature translated into several dialects and has placed a great quantity of literature in the hands of the people. In addition to Brother Joseph three other brethren have served regularly in the pilgrim service, holding meetings for the public and visiting the classes. Brother Joseph is now translating and publishing the “Testimony,” and that will be distributed in India within a short time. Several conventions have been held there during the year. These have been well attended by the natives and much interest shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was our thought that a greater attempt should be made to witness also to the English-speaking people of India. To carry out this purpose Brothers Skinner and Wright were sent to Bombay in July last, with instructions to open an office there and begin the holding of meetings and generally spread the Truth throughout India amongst the English-speaking people. In addition to handling the work in India Brothers Skinner and Wright will also carry the message into Persia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Headquarters are now established in Bombay, and the Khottayam office in southern India is now working under the supervision of the Bombay office. Bombay is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">city of a million and a quarter inhabitants. Brother Skinner reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have found that the Lord has a great work for us to do in this country, a work which will require many laborers. We feel sure there are many here who will </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">glad to hear the Truth. You will be glad to know that the work in Bombay is now assuming a definite and tangible nature. My heart is cheered by the evident care of the Lord over our labours. The month of September opened with some 39 addresses to call upon, which had been handed in at the public meeting on August 29th. We canvassed these people and the results have been gratifying—45 volumes and 40 booklets were disposed of in this way. The response from English people, however, was practically nil, almost all the books were sold to Indians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This work brought us in touch with a small community of Kanarese, a people from a state south of Bombay. They are educated and chiefly employed in business houses. They have responded to the message of the kingdom in a wonderful way, and we have organized a regular week-night Habp study class in their own private meeting-room. Some </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">them, particularly their leader, seem to be really consecrated to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last Sunday I was invited to take the regular Sunday service in the Kanarese Church, a building owned by the American Mission but lent to this community for Sunday services. Great appreciation was manifested by several </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">erf </span><span class="font6">the congregation, which numbers about 60.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The house-to-house canvass work is also proving a source of joy; the response so far has been fairly good, but we have difficulty in learning where to go to find Englishspeaking people. One family of Jews told me that they had had </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">book sent out from England last May, Compost fob thb Jews, which had been a real source of joy to them. When I showed them the Hakp by the same author there Was great excitement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The printing of the “Testimony&quot; In Malayalam, Urda and Marathi is now being done.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>Italy</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Not having any person fully equipped for public work in all Italy, the work there has been limited largely to colporteurs and brethren holding small public meetings in the towns and villages. During the year, however, there have been placed in the hands of the people 11,729 books and booklets, besides a large quantity of free literature. The brethren in Italy are not great in number but they are zealous for the Lord. While the work is not so large as we might hope, still we are not at all discouraged, seeing that the witness is being given in that country and that the people will never be able to say that they had no opportunity to know of the Lord’s kingdom being brought in.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>Jamaica</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The efforts on the part of the Society are put forth to reach all lands wherein the name of the Lord is named—the continents and the isles of the sea as well. During the year there have been in Jamaica, B. W. I., four pilgrims in the service. They have held public meetings to the number of 141, with a total attendance of 13,337; and have held 121 class meetings, with an attendance of 3,562; and thus doing, they have traveled 2,197 miles. During the year five colporteurs have been in the regular service, the total number of books and booklets placed being 8,139 in that period. In addition to this, free literature to the number of 41,500 copies have gone into the hands of the people. The local manager, Brother Davidson, in his report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In spite of the many severe trials and testings, the year has been one of the best, because of the rich blessings which we have received from being engaged In active service In harmony with the head office of the Society, and on account of the clearer understanding of many of the prophecies which are now due to be understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bible Students in Jamaica, with few exceptions, appreciate very highly the service of the Society and esteem It a privilege to cooperate in the work that is now being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I am glad to say that the work progresses under the following heads: Pilgrim work, Colporteur work and Service work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although there are not many who are engaged in the pilgrim feature of the work, those who are thus engaged manifest very great interest in the work and esteem it a great privilege to advertise the King and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The colporteurs are also doing their best in putting out the books by which the people are being enlightened, and their joy increases day by day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The latest feature of work, known as “Service Work&quot;, has brought rich blessings to many who could not be engaged in the other branches of the Lord’s work. Many and varied are the experiences of those engaged in this feature of the work, and great is the joy experienced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This feature of the work is greatly assisted by the use of a car which takes some of the workers to various points, and many have the privilege of thus serving. We are truly glad for this feature of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I must also say that the classes are receiving much blessing through the study of The Watch Tower. They are also taking an active part in the work of the kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>Japan</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">During the past year the work amongst the Japanese on the Pacific Coast, Hawaii and other places, as well as in Japan, has progressed in a very satisfactory manner. Brother Akashi was sent by the Society to Hawaii and then to Japan. He remained in Hawaii several months, and during that time a class of fifteen fully consecrated Japanese was organized; and these are now participating actively in the spreading of the gospel amongst the Japanese in the Hawaiian Islands. This Hawaiian Japanese class now has two Berean studies In the Hasp each week, on Sunday and Friday, and a testimony meeting every Wednesday evening. One of these Japanese brethren who has but recently come into the Truth sold 13 books in one hour, while a Japanese sister sold about the same number in an hour and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">half. A Japanese director has been appointed for the work in Hawaii.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the Japanese work in Hawaii was organized, Brother Akashi then proceeded to Japan. He is now in Tokio with a stock of The Harp, Standard for the People, and a number of other booklets, and is now also making mats for the printing of the Deliverance book in Japanese. From there he goes to Kobe, where there is a class of Japanese Bible Students. In his report Brother Akashi says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Japanese people are very hungry for the good news. They are struggling to get their daily bread, and many commit suicide because It is so hard to live. My privileges are great to carry them the message of comfort, and 1 am glad to remember that the battle is not ours but the Lord’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jugo-Slavia</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font6">Jugo-Slavia is one of the new countries carved out by the League of Nations. Its population is made up of Serbians, Croatians, Slovenians and Germans. The Serbians are Greek Catholics, while the Croatians and Slavians are Boman Catholics. There are few Protestants in the land. Many of the people, are very illiterate, although some are well educated; and almost all are peoples of good will. We have considerable of the literature in the Croatian language, and some in the Serbian and other languages used there. There are about forty zealous brethren in the land who are doing their best to spread the message of the kingdom, giving the witness as the Lord commands. One brother, who is well educated and who speaks Serbian, Croatian, German and French, is translating for the Society. The Society is establishing a local branch at Panceva, with Brother Iliga Yaksic as local manager.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>Korea</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Society’s office at Seoul, Korea, continues to put forth an effort to spread the gospel. The Society has a small printing plant there and publishes literature in the Korean and Chinese languages. Now Brother Akashi will go over and use the presses at Seoul for the Japanese work as well. One of our brethren in Korea, Brother Park, has made long journeys on foot, one trip being of about two thousand miles, canvassing for the books and holding public meetings. He has met special opposition from the Protestant missionaries, as is the case everywhere. He reports that in each instance the native police helped him and got him out of the trouble. On this journey he put into the hands of the people 2,436 books and booklets carrying the message of the kingdom. The people are very poor in Korea, and it is difficult for them to purchase the books. It is also to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">taken into consideration that not many Koreans are </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in&gt;-</span><span class="font6">terested in the Christian religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Latvia</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font6">Latvia is one of the countries where the work has recently started under the direction of the Society’s Northern European office. Headquarters for Latvia </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font6">at Biga. During the year a goodly number of free tracts have been placed in the hands of the people, two classes have been organized for service work, eleven have entered the active service, and one brother is in the pilgrim service there, in addition to the occasional visits of Brother Dey from the Northern European office. Brother Taylor, the local brother looking after the work </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">Latvia, says amongst other things in his report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord’s blessing has been very richly upon our work here in the last three months. At the beginning of Jul&gt; a small convention was held in Riga, and the friends took</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">part in their first service drive. Since then they have been seeing their privileges even more clearly, and have become very zealous in their care of the kingdom interests here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the war, the people here suffered much, Riga itself having been occupied four times, Including the Bolsheviks. Conditions are now very bad; in Riga alone 240 factories are idle, and in other large towns it is the same. So ours is a joyful privilege, in being able to tell the people about the incoming kingdom. The harvest, I am sure, will be a big one, but the labourers are very few indeed. Additionally, the people here speak three different languages, Lettish, German and Russian. This makes it more difficult to work among them, but we pray the Lord that he will send more labourers into the harvest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In September we held public witness in three towns, and in all 975 people attended, and 600 books were sold. The Devil tried his very best to stop these meetings, In many different ways; but we held them, and very great Interest was manifested at each. Many were the expressions of gratitude after the meetings, and numerous requests for further lectures and studies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>Lithuania</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">This is another one of the Baltic states where the Truth has recently been carried under the supervision of the Society. During the year there have been distributed upwards of 13,000 books and booklets, and 30,000 copies of the “Message of Hope”. There has been one pilgrim engaged in the service who, with other brethren, has held 45 public meetings, which have had a total attendance of 9,313. Two colporteurs are engaged in the service in Lithuania. Brother Zavist, the local representative, in his report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It Is a pleasure to send you the year’s report for 1926. As you know this Is a Catholic country. The clerical party has been in power. In January they ordered me to leave the country within seven days. In May, however, the Social-Democrats came into power and are separating church from state. Already there la more freedom to give out the Truth. The people are hungering for It. After every lecture they asked: “When will you come again?” At Marljampolis last mouth the theatre was packed with seven to eight hundred people, and the hooks went like a snowhall in a fire. It is a real pleasure to deliver the message of Truth with such blessings of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year 45 public meetings were held, with an attendance of 9,213; and in all,- a total of 13,163 books and booklets were distributed. In the country the average wage is but $3 a week. Therefore I would like if possible that The Watch Tower be made cheaper here than $1.50. In July a local convention was held in Mazeikiai, attended by 35, Including some brethren from Memel. We disposed of 277 books in a morning’s service, and ten dear brethren symbolized in a nearby river their consecration to the Lord. It is due the class at Memel to say that they have helped very much in the work. Though they have to cycle 20 kilometers (12J miles) each way, from what was German territory to Lithuania proper, and can work only on Sundays, yet they sold more than half of the above books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Norway</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark121"></a><span class="font6">Norway is under the direct management of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">Northern European office hut makes its report to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">main office like all other countries. During the year 8,830 cloth hound books have been placed in the hands of the people; paper covered books to the number </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">43,650; Scenarios to the total of 278; Bibles, booklets, etc., 1,424; tracts distributed 269,500. There are fourteen classes organized for the service work, 120 friends regularly engaged in the service work, and two brethren are engaged in the pilgrim service. Brother Enok </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Oman, </span><span class="font6">the local manager, in his report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work-year just ended has given us several more proofs of the fact that it is the Lord himself who is leading his work, far up here in the north. As you know, the north of Norway is the northernmost place on earth where the Truth is known. Travel and communication are very difficult. In some parts it takes from fourteen to eighteen hours to go from one class to another. But we are glad </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to say </span><span class="font6">that the work has been blessed of our dear Lord this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Norwegian people have this year had many troubles; the Workers’ papers say that Norway has had more lockouts and strikes this year than any other place on earth. Of the two and a half millions of people, more than 20,000 workers are out of work, and the business life is very slack. The people seem now more and more to listen to the Truth, and we are enthusiastic to have the privilege of lifting up the standard for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All of us here are very thankful to you for sending us Brother Dey. We love him; his unselfishness and zeal are encouraging to us. Through him the work has been better organized, especially the getting of the friends out into the work; and the exchanging of the speaking brothers from the different countries is a great help. More and more of the friends are getting their eyes opened to see their privileges to get into the ranks in this wonderful time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Indeed we are enjoying the wonderful light we get through The Watch Tower. The classes are studying the leading articles and are feeling much blessed by them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>Palestine</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">An office of the Society is still maintained in Ram Allah, Palestine, and the brethren are doing their best to give the witness there. Some of them speaking Arabic and other languages reside in Jerusalem. Comfort for the Jews has been delivered to several Jews in Jerusalem, who have rejoiced very greatly in what they have read. It is a happy privilege that is given to the Lord’s people now to give some witness in the land where the feet of our Savior trod.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>Poland</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">During the year there has been a great deal of distress amongst the Lord’s people in Poland, in fact amongst all the population. Notwithstanding this the Society’s representative at Warsaw reports that the efforts of the friends have been greatly blessed. During </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the year </span><span class="font6">three brethren have been regularly engaged in the pilgrim service, and six auxiliary brethren engaged in the same service. Public lectures have been held to the number of 395, with an attendance of 61,065. Class meetings have been held to the number of 672, with an attendance of 29,248. Fifteen conventions have been held. Books and booklets, including Bibles, placed in the hands of the people during the year total 259,468.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Recently the friends have been enjoying more liberty in the spreading of the Truth, and now the Truth is spreading more rapidly. Publication of The Golden Age in Polish having been done in Switzerland, and this having been interfered with by the Swiss government, has somewhat hindered the work. A Polish brother was sent from Warsaw to Berne, Switzerland, to work on the Polish edition of The Golden Age, but the Swiss government would not permit him to remain there. The adversary seems to make all the trouble he can, and the Lord permits just enough to develop what he sees is necessary in his people. The Polish work in Poland, of course, keeps in close touch with the Brooklyn office, and there is a constant attempt toward hearty cooperation. All of God’s people having one spirit are anxious to give the witness, and this they are doing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>Polish Work—In Northern France</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">In Northern France there is a number of Polish people, and amongst these has grown up a class of zealous, consecrated brethren who speak the Polish language. The work among them is under the supervision of the Berne office. The Society also maintains a local depot at Lens, with a brother in charge. The work has been handicapped there somewhat during the year by reason of the fact that the brother who formerly was there has returned to America. There are many zealous Polish brethren, however, who push on with the work. During the year class meetings to the number of 303 have been held, with an attendance of 14,841; also 80 public meetings, with an attendance of 9,645. After all, the chief work is to give the witness that the people may know that Jehovah is God and that Christ is King and the kingdom is here; and this is being done.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>Portugal</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Portugal is conducted from the Society’s local branch at Lisbon. There are now 450 subscribers to the Portuguese Watch Tower. Books and booklets put out during the year total 764. There have been many inquiries by letter about the Truth, and these </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font6">received attention. The following is a quotation from the report of Brother Ferguson, the local manager:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I think there is a great witness yet to be given to the people here, and it seems that the time has come when the people will heed the message of the Truth and more will manifest an interest in it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>Roumania</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">After great difficulty much of the opposition begins to clear away in Roumania, and the prospects are now better than heretofore. The Society maintains a print</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font6">plant in Roumania and makes many books. Practically every publication that has been started has at one time or another been stopped by the government, and much expense has been entailed by reason of the necessity to make defense and contend for the rights of those who are striving to serve the Lord. Six Roumanian brethren have been in the regular pilgrim service dur</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font6">the year, and five for a portion of the time, and these have visited during the year 1,837 places and have held meetings that had a total attendance of 85,149. The books have to be put out in a secret way, therefore the brethren must labor under great difficulty. Yet they persistently go on in giving the witness. Much volunteer matter has been distributed, and the Society’s presses are now busy printing other literature which we hope soon to get into the hands of the Roumanian people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>Russia</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">It has been almost impossible to do anything as yet in Russia. The Russian government refused the application of the president of the Society to enter Russia during the year, on the ground that he hails from America and that America does not enter into diplomatic relationship with Soviet Russia. There are a few Russian brethren, however, who are doing their best to give the witness there. It is very difficult to get books and literature into Russia. One brother from Russia writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have ten believers on our farm here, also four at Kourgan, five at Sharapkino, and six at Pavlovka. All these understand the Truth. I supplied them with books, giving one or two books to each. We are greatly in need of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Russian work in America goes on meanwhile, and we are also continuing our efforts to get the literature into Russia. In the Lord’s due time he will permit it there; if it is his will it shall be done. And since the Lord has declared that the message must he preached to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">dll</span><span class="font6"> nations as a witness, it seems that Russia must yet have it ere the end comes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark135"></a>Spain</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">During the year the work in Spain has progressed very satisfactorily, notwithstanding the great opposition there. In June 1926 two of the largest radio stations, in Madrid and Barcelona, broadcast two lectures of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">president of the Society, which reached all of Spain and nearby countries. Another evidence of how the Lord blessed the publication of the London resolution and public address is that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">La Libertad,</span><span class="font6"> one of the leading newspapers in Spain, carried a full and complete report of that resolution and of the address of the president of the Society, as delivered at the Royal Albert Hall, London. When we call to mind that fourteen months </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ago</span><span class="font6"> the Truth had not been even heard in Spain it seems almost a miracle that it has spread there so remarkably during this short period of time. Only the Lord could have done it in the face of the great opposition. Prom the annual report of Brother Young, the manager there, the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our loving Father has continued to open the door and has kept it open; and, thanks to your liberal assistance, ths witness has gone steadily forward to all parts of Spain and her colonies during this year. The opposition has increased. Several of the brethren have been arrested and their literature confiscated. Some have been thrown out of work, and others have had to leave their villages because of the persecution. Jezebel fears The Watch Tower more than al] the Protestants in Spain. In the press and from the pulpit the people are warned not to read The Watch Tower ; that to do so is to commit mortal sin. In the “Edict” of the Bishop of Pamplona, The Watch Tower and all publications connected with the I. B. S. A. were classed as “heretical, scandalous and strictly prohibited”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite the opposition God has blessed the witness in Spain, and in the fourteen months since the volunteer literature has been published here in Watch Tower form the interest has steadily increased. The list of paid subscribers to The Watch Tower in Spain alone now totals 805. In addition to this 1023 Spaniards have become subscribers in other Spanish-speaking countries, a total of 1828. These have nearly all come in in nine months time!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The publication of the “Testimony” in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">La Libertad,</span><span class="font6"> Spain’s leading newspaper, took the Midianltes completely by surprise* In one night over 75,000 copies went out to the people. Thfl entire “Testimony”, including your London address in </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font6">its strength, passed the government’s censor without a change. Never before has such a powerful rebuke been published in this centre of Jezebel’s power. This is the Lord’s doing, and is marvelous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Following is the summary of the witness given in Spain during this year:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Volunteer literature distributed in</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Number of Watch Towers on regular order for</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">monthly distribution in foreign Spanish countries 7,150</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because of the many restrictions this witness, except the foreign part, has to be carried almost entirely by the office workers. This makes the work difficult and costly, and in no way could the witness be given except for the liberal assistance which Brooklyn has furnished throughout the year.—Matthew 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I had over 1,000 extra copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">La Libertad</span><span class="font6"> run off, and those are being mailed to all the government officials, mayors, bishops and cardinals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Public officials in Spain hold titles from the pope, and these together with the priests make it rather difficult to give the witness; they would make it impossible except for the Lord’s intervention. Brother Corzo, who devotes all of his time to the colporteur work, and Brother Maximo, who works at the colporteur service part time, were recently arrested in Alcoy, a town in Spain; their books and their literature being seized. The following is from Brother Young’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They were brought before the authorities and questioned as to their purpose, nature of their work, etc. The mayor of the city has a title from the pope. After several days under vigilance they were told to leave Alcoy immediately. The chief of police, who questioned them, however, finally bought a Bible and also a Habp, and subscribed for one year to The Watch Tower. He said confidentially to Brother Corzo, “You people are the only people in Spain who are telling the people the Truth.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>Spanish Work—In America</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The work in America among the Spanish-speaking people has gone on very satisfactorily during the year. About 1,300 Spanish Studies and Harps have been placed in the hands of the people, also 3,000 booklets and 80 Spanish Bibles. A large number of Spanish tracts have been distributed, and a Spanish edition of The Watch Tower is published in America, regularly every two months, besides the one published in Spain. Two public meetings have been held in Southern California, and three in Texas, for the Spanish-speaking people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark143"></a>Spanish Work—In Mexico</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">Some colporteur work has been done in Mexico during the year. Besides this, the local classes in Mexico have been canvassing for the literature in the Spanish language. Another new class has been organized in Mexico; these brethren being formerly Baptists.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>Sweden</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Society’s headquarters for Sweden is now in Stockholm, having been removed there from Orebro during the year. Stockholm is a more convenient point from which to carry on the work. It is in charge of a local manager, and is under the jurisdiction of the Society's Northern European office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work in Sweden has never been in as good condition as it now is. While it is true that some have stumbled and fallen and turned away and walk with the world, and some have become more violent in opposition, yet the work accomplished in Sweden during the year 1926 has exceeded that of any previous year. Organization of the classes to do systematic work has been a wonderful blessing to our Swedish brethren. Brother Eneroth, the local manager, reports in part as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is still much to be done along the Une of organization, but it is a real joy to note how the friends are grasping the idea more and more, that we are now battling under the King of kings and Lord of lords. And all the faithful ones are highly appreciating The Watch Tower that brings still more light, refreshment and stimulus with each coming issue. More and more classes are taking up The Watch Tower for study, and report great blessings therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here we have had the same experience as the Lord’s people everywhere, that the gathering of ourselves together in conventions has been a great help and blessing. Because of the expensive traveling in this country, and because only </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">very few of the friends possess motor cars, the numbers at conventions are not great. Our main convention this year was attended by 250 friends only, but its influence has become far-reaching. We got something of the London spirit, and quite a number of the Swedish brethren entered the colporteur service as a result of that convention, while many decided to and did spend their vacation in canvassing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The above-mentioned lack of motor cars was especially felt during I. B. S.. A. Week, during which some of the classes were suffering from lack of territory, 1. e., they could have reached far more people during the time at their disposal had they only had means of transportation. I. B. S. A. Week as well as other drives proved to be very helpful here. During that week the number of workers engaged in service was two and a half times as many as ever before. All wanted to be in the ranks. It was good also to be able to tell the public that Bible Students were out all over the world that week with these books. Then they wanted </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">listen and know what it was all about..</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>Switzerland</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">During the year some of the brethren in Switzerland became disturbed and caused considerable confusion, not only disturbed in isolated sections but all over Switzerland. Of course, we can trace this to the adversary. Some of the brethren who had been zealous in the work became unfaithful and, contending against the work, disturbed others. Brother Harbeek of America was sent to Switzerland, and the Lord has blessed his efforts in reorganizing the work there, and it is now going on better. There is a healthier condition there and the brethren are happier. Since the convention at Basel in May last, which has heretofore been reported in The Watch Tower, the friends have settled down to a more zealous and earnest work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Notwithstanding the difficulties the more zealous Swiss brethren have put forth an effort to give the witness concerning the kingdom. The government has interfered with the colporteurs and class workers, and has made it very difficult for them. The distribution of the “Indictment” stirred up the hatred of the clergy, and these enlisted the aid of the political wing of the government to make it more difficult for the brethren to witness. Brother Harbeek in making his report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The special siftings which came upon Switzerland during the year have caused some to leave the “remnant”, but others are zealous and there is every indication that the friends in Switzerland are renewing their strength and the remnant is fighting all the harder to make up for lost time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year the brethren in Switzerland have put into the hands of the people books and booklets to the number of 206,858 volumes. The witness is being given and the Lord is blessing the effort. Sample copies of The Golden Age to the number of 197,808 have been distributed. The subscribers to the Swiss Golden Age have increased by 965 during the year. During the year </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">25</span><span class="font6"> gave all their time to the colporteur service and 1,265 in the classes participated in the service work. There were 21 Swiss brethren engaged in the pilgrim service during 1926. Meetings were held for classes to the number of 1,738, with an attendance of 78,241; public meetings to the number of 331, with an attendance of 26,469.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the passing of the storm it is gratifying to see the Swiss brethren putting forth so much zeal and earnestness in the Lord’s service. They are happy; they have the spirit of the Master, and are rejoicing in the Lord and realize that the joy of the Lord is their strength.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>Syria</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Society maintains its headquarters for Asia Minor at Beirut, under the management of a native brother, a college professor. This brother has left his secular work to devote himself entirely to the Lord’s service. The interest in Syria has increased during the year. Quite a number of additions to the class have been made, and a goodly witness has been given. Thus the Lord is carrying the message to the ancient lands as well as to the more modem civilization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark150"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark151"></a>Trinidad</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">The Trinidad, B. W. I., branch of the Society’s work is in the Port of Spain. Trinidad is an island north of Venezuela, South America; and while the friends there are not great in number, they are great in zeal for the Lord and for his cause. During the year 2,738 class meetings have been held in Trinidad, with a total attendance of 42,708; and 153 public meetings, with a total attendance of 13,294. A total of 6,624 books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people. Those of the Port of Spain class called at 2,075 homes during I. B. S. A. Week and delivered the kingdom message. Brother Talma, the local manager, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brethren as a whole are in good condition, loyal to the Lord and to his organization; and I think we could do more were it not for the financial straits.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark152"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark153"></a>Conclusion</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">The little companies of God’s faithful witnesses are united in action under the supervision of the King of kings. It is our belief that these are the feet of him who are bringing good tidings of great joy, about which the angels prophesied at the birth of Jesus. (Isaiah 52; 7) Having received a commission from Jehovah to be his witnesses in the earth, these also constitute his watchmen. They are in harmony with the Lord and- in harmony with each other, and together they lift up the voice. This harmonious and sweet message of the kingdom is sounding throughout the earth. All who are participating in it have entered into the joy of the Lord and appreciate the meaning of that joy. They realize that the joy of the Lord is their strength. They are not concerned about time, or just when the work will end, but they are deeply concerned about faithfully performing the commission the Lord God has given unto them. By their actions and by their words they are unitedly saying, &quot;Blessed be the Lord out of Zion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">END OF ANNUAL REPOST</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. —Genesis 1:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah testifies to his being the Author of creation, saying, “I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.” Before him we bow in profound reverence and in recognition of him as the great First Cause. We worship him as the true God, the Designer and Builder of all things, and especially as the Creator of that which our senses discern; namely, the earth and the visible heavens whose beauties and glories delight us by day and by night. Such reverence of God tends to our gaining eternal life. (Prov. 19:23) If is the beginning of godly wisdom, whereby we are able to enjoy and view properly the manifold works of Jehovah and to benefit by the earnest consideration of them. In wisdom Jehovah made all his works, and we may draw wisdom from the study of them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark154"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark155"></a>January 2</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">So God created man in his own image; in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Genesis 1:</span><span class="font6"> 27.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark156"></a><span class="font6">Jehovah, undoubtedly conversing with his loyal Son, the Logos, said: “Let </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">us</span><span class="font6"> make man.” Accordingly the Father furnished the plans and specifications for building the first man, even to the numbering of the hairs necessary to make a perfect creature; and the Logos carried out the plans to the letter, and has been interested in man’s welfare from that time to this. What a thrilling moment it must have been for him when that perfect thing, the result of his exquisite workmanship, first breathed, and opened his eyes, and began the exercise of those powers which made him once and will make him again the ruler of all the earth, the earthly likeness of the Creator! Jehovah was pleased at how the Logos had faithfully used the power delegated to him and pronounced the creature, man, very good. He loved this earthly son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">rain </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">for the earth, who malceth grass to grow upon the mountains. He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.—Psalm 1^1:8,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The holy prophet marked God’s providences as they embraced even the lower creatures of earth, and was moved to sing the praises of Jehovah therefor. Should not we do the same? Jesus did so. Hearken to his words: “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.” Listen to God’s own words to Job: “Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.” Jehovah provided meat for the ravens, even though they were designated as unclean for Jewish food. Truly God’s love is broad; and we cannot but be benefited by a consideration of his loving provision for fowl and fish and creeping things. It reassures us of his everlasting love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Out of the ground made the Lord God to grow everyt tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the tree of life also in the midst of the garden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Genesis 2: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah was Adam’s Benefactor and Friend. Before creating him, Jehovah, like a faithful parent, looked out for his happiness and provided a paradise of pleasure to be his home. Jehovah was not merely interested in planting attractive-looking trees and trees bearing fruit good for man’s daily food; he was also interested in having man live for ever to delight himself in the Lord and to glorify him on earth. So he made the tree of life to grow in the midst of the garden. He intended that Adam, when tested and proved worthy of eternal life, should partake of it and thereby have God’s guarantee that he should revel in the fulness of life for ever. In due time every intelligent creature will have an opportunity, under full and fair conditions, to follow Jehovah’s righteous commands and receive the reward </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">being permitted to partake of the tree of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.&quot;—Psalm 111: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font6">N HIS marvelous works God displays his wisdom, justice, love and power. When man begins to learn of these mighty works he is filled with wonder, admiration, awe and reverence for the great Master Worker. In that attitude man is beginning to learn wisdom. No man can begin to be wise until he learns to reverence and worship Jehovah. With profound respect and reverence, mingled with fear and trembling, man then seeks more knowledge of Almighty God. As his appreciation for God and his wonderful works increases, his affection and love for the Mighty One grow. Then he delights to know more of God’s works, and. this pleasure leads him to seek them out. The goodness of God and his works impel man to adore and worship him. Consecrating his life to do the will of God, he now delights in keeping God’s commandments. Such are the progressive steps of the Christian. Jesus Christ, the beloved Son of God, has always delighted to do his Father’s will. The true follower of Jesus Christ becomes the earnest student of the divine Word, and his pleasure is found in seeking out the works of the great Creator. Then he employs his facul</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ties to </span><span class="font6">glorify his heavenly Father’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rid-eth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.—To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old.— Deuteronomy 33:26; Psalm 68:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many are the gradations of invisible principalities and powers of rulership, ranging from the angels upward. Man was made a little lower than the angels; consequently he has to look up to these invisible planes of power which are above. Very properly therefore he may call these superior heavenly powers “the heavens”. But neither men nor heavenly beings can look to anything loftier than to Jehovah God. He surmounts all heavens; all are beneath his throne. By all these heavens, or on all of them, he rides to the swift execution of his purposes. All his heavenly organization moves in harmony with him. Despite his loftiness Jehovah does not slight his cause in so lowly a place as the earth but rideth upon the heaven to the help of Jeshurun, his righteous ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">There is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.—Romans 13:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All rightful authority proceeds from Jehovah. The secular authorities on earth exist only because Jehovah has allowed a limited period of time in which he suiters all nations to walk in their own ways. (Acts 14:16) Even Jesus, after his ascension on high, must needs wait until Jehovah authorized him to clear the Devil out of heaven. The saints here below are not above Jesus. The test upon them is to resist the world's influences and remain supremely loyal and obedient to Jehovah amid the sway of the permitted earthly authorities. We may be sure, however, that if Jehovah does not permit us to strike a blow against these unapproved earthly authorities that he forbears to overthrow until his due time, he will never consistently allow these powers to crush and triumph completely over his approved people. -—% Chronicles 20:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Januai’y 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you?—1 Corinthians 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each one who is a member of the body of Christ and who abides in the temple class, is the dwelling place of God’s holy spirit. Though a new creature his organism is still the body of flesh, and the natural tendency of his flesh will be earthly. If he lets his mind be governed by such tendency, it will search out and meditate upon facts and things pertaining to gratifying the flesh. Those who follow this tendency are not walking after the spirit, but are in danger of defiling the temple of God and suffering destruction from the Lord. Since Jehovah dwells in us by his spirit, let us not be carnally-minded. Let us bear in mind that the spirit of God dwells in us for a purpose; not as a mere hallowing influence that removes us from the realm of the profane and secular things, but as a power to enliven us. and move us to accomplish that which Jehovah’s Word reveals to be his will for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.—Psalm 46:</span><span class="font6"> 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is with those who are of Zion. The fact that Almighty God has provided his kingdom, which kingdom will overthrow the enemy, is proof that he has an army. “The Lord, The God of hosts, is his name.” (Amos 4:13) Host means an organized body prepared for conflict; a company of service soldiers, waiting upon the Lord, ready for his war. Jehovah, the God of Jacob, is the God of Zion. He is the Most High; making and carrying forward his plan at his good pleasure; and his power is irresistible. In his own due time he will lead his righteous hosts against organized and entrenched wickedness, and will sweep the enemy and his organization before him with the broom of destraction. “So shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.”— Isaiah 31:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble’, he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 99:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has inaugurated the kingdom of his dear Son. Represented by his Messenger, who came to his temple in 1918, Jehovah is now seated in glory amidst the cherubim. The Revelator John caught a vision of Jehovah upon his throne and round about him four beasts, symbolically representing wisdom, justice, love and power. Prior to this time it has been made to appear that God is unjust, because so much unrighteousness is practised amongst men, who say that God is responsible for it. It has been represented that God’s power is insufficient to restrain evil; that he is not wise enough to establish a different condition; and that he is not a God of love, otherwise he would not permit so much suffering. Now the time has come for the four divine attributes of Jehovah to be expressed plainly. Zion, his organization, is the instrument being used to publish these great attributes of his as working </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">harmony.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God . . . hath also given unto us his holy Spirit. —1 Thessalonians</span><span class="font6"> 4 • </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The spirit of Jehovah is love, because God is love. His disposition is to do good unto all. Everything that our Father and our Lord do is prompted by love. When begotten and anointed of the holy spirit, we receive the the spirit of the Lord; hence we receive the spirit as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">gift from him. “As he is, so are we in this world.” “He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God.” As we come in contact with those of the world and present to them the gospel of the kingdom, we may be rebuffed, spumed, ill-treated, slandered, and abused. But, remembering that we have received from God his spirit, we shall pity those who persecute us and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">shall </span><span class="font6">watch for opportunities to do them good, especially </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">present unto them the balm of God’s message </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">when trouble breaks their spirit and makes them needy &lt;4 God’s comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The beginning of the creation of God.” —Revelation 3:14-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">E</span><span class="font6">) EFORE the beginning of creation God was alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">% Then it delighted the Creator to bring into existence the Logos his beloved Son. The beginning of God’s creation has always been and ever will be his greatest joy. One of the titles of the Logos is “The Bright and Morning Star”. He is always resplendently shedding forth the glory of his Father. He has always occupied a confidential relationship to Jehovah. He was entrusted with the great work of the redemption of man. Under the most crucial test he proved the most complete devotion to his Father and was given the title “Faithful and True”. He was made the mighty Priest unto God, which office was foreshadowed by Melehizedek, and is henceforth and for ever the great Executive Officer of the Almighty God. He occupies the highest position next to his Father. He is the anointed King whom God has placed upon his throne. Now with joy he engages in the work of cleansing the universe and establishing a righteous government which shall endure for ever. God has graciously arranged that the church, the bride of his beloved Son, shall be associated with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">him in this marvelous work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For the word of the Lord is right; and all his works are done in truth.—Psalm 33: 4-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The works of Jehovah are not like those of Satan, works of hypocrisy, sham, imitation or counterfeiting. They are true works, able to bear the most searching investigation. Hence they have his approval. The Bible, written by holy men of old who were inspired by his spirit, is his Word; and hence it is right and true and will abide for ever. God has manifested his works and his dealings unto his church in recent years. These are not deceptive nor imaginary works, as those who go out from us would like to make us believe. They are true works of Jehovah, unerring in the glorious objective toward which they are working. It is because of this that these works have successfully withstood the combined assaults of all the forces of darkness and untruth. They shall continue to stand through the shaking period now on; for they are true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He that spared not his own Son, hut delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?—Romans 8:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In his unbounded love Jehovah did not shrink from delivering up his own Son, his firstborn and only-begotten One, to die for the sinner race. Could any gift transcend this gift in behalf of man? No! for in it was wrapped up everything for which either church or mankind could hope of life and happiness. It was Jehovah’s supreme sacrifice. Hence all gifts that he might bestow thereafter could not but be less in value in the affections of Jehovah than this gift of his precious Son. Out of this great gift all other gifts to us grow, and thus “to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, . . . and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him”. What an assurance this gives us that Jehovah’s lovingkindness shall continue to us and that “no good thing will be withhold from them that walk uprightly” until the kingdom is surely gained!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What the law could not do, in that it was weals through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.—Romans 8: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The law of God is good. It is perfect. The spirit of it is love; “the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart.” But alas! even if we have the spirit of that law in our hearts, yet our flesh is weak as respects keeping that law perfectly. In our flesh dwells no good thing, so that we cannot do the things that we would. Consequently the law, delivered to the Jews, was inefficacious of itself to perfect the Jews in righteousness because the law of sin and death operated in their flesh; their attempts to keep the law could not make them worthy of justification in God’s sight. But thank God! what the law could not do under present conditions, Jehovah did. He sent his righteous Son to die, and thus provided for the imputation of righteousness to tire church on the basis of Christ’s ransom sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[Him] God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.—Romans 3:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s righteousness shines forth with unsullied lustre in all his works. He has been reproached with charges of barbarism and unrighteousness in arranging for the vicarious sacrifice of his innocent Son. His judicial ability to remit the sins done beforehand and to justify those who consecrate themselves to him with true faith in Christ’s blood has been questioned. But when we remember God’s law: “Life shall go for life,” and appreciate that the majesty and inviolableness of that law must be maintained, it is then we see that Jehovah is true to his own standard of righteousness in that he set forth Jesus to be a propitiatory, or victim that makes propitiation, for the sins of the whole world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold my servant, whom I uphold, mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; 1 have put my spirit upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isaiah &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The servant whom Jehovah stays up, and in whom he delights as his elect or chosen one, seems clearly to be composed of those who are devoted to the Lord Jehovah and are faithfully serving him. Of this class Christ Jesus is the Head. He was always faithful in his service and is designated The Faithful and True. Upon him Jehovah put his spirit that he might do the Father’s will. Upon those who are in Christ Jesus this same holy spirit has come through the Head, Christ Jesus. Without question these must be serving the purposes of Jehovah as opportunity affords. To them Jehovah announces their present form of service, saying, “Ye are my witnesses.” Whereas Satan is employing all his power to discredit God, it is the privilege of the servant class to testify of the goodness and greatness of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love.—Ephesians 1:</span><span class="font6">4-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah chose the Logos as the great Melchizedek Priest to execute his purposes and also chose to associate </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">company of saints with him in the great work. Jehovah made this choice before ever Satan had founded his wicked world organization. And what was Jehovah’s conception of these saints in Christ Jesus away back there? It was of a class distinguished because of holiness unto the Lord—not divided in their allegiance </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">the cause of righteousness, not fractional in their devotion to Jehovah, but fully dedicated to God’s will and purposes not for a day or to any fixed date but for ever. Their heart condition, as Jehovah foresaw it, would be blameless in love; they would hold him uppermost in their affections and be sincere and genuine in their expression of unselfishness. To such Jehovah will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">give </span><span class="font6">the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“God commendeth his love toward us.”—Romans 5: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">P</span><span class="font6">ERFECT love is the perfect expression of unselfishness. All of God’s works are perfect. God is love. In everything he has done and does is found the perfect expression of unselfishness. Because of Adam’s sin the entire human family was alienated from God. Unselfishly God sent his beloved Son to the earth to die that we might live. Then he brought us to a knowledge of his goodness by showing us some of his marvelous works. His unselfish course brings him pleasure, exemplified in the words of Jesus that it is more blessed to give than to receive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This expressed love of God he commends to us who are his children by adoption into his family through Jesus Christ. From him we learn that an unselfish devotion of our all to him will result in fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore. With ever increasing pleasure we seek out his works; and as our vision broadens and our knowledge of his loving kindness increases, in the language of the poet we exclaim: “0 Lord, how manifold are thy works; in wisdom thou hast made them all 1”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.—2 Corinthians 5:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What a rare and inimitable exhibition of love by Jehovah! Jesus his Son had never tasted or been defiled with sin, and yet Jehovah’s love prompted him to make that Holy One as it were the personification of sin </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">order that sin might no longer be imputed to man. It is true that the ransom feature of God’s plan made </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font6">necessary that Jesus die in talcing the sinner’s place, but still—to what unscalable heights Jehovah’s love must have risen for our sakes to be willing even to impute sin to One so pure and innocent and loyal as his faithful Son Jesus. How gratifying, though, the results must be to Jehovah now! For his Son proved true even to the death of the cross; and we, who have been washed </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">his blood from all sin, now appear unto Jehovah </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">the embodiment of righteousness in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.—Psalm 91/.: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The present conflict is the greatest war of the ages. This is the time when the enemy is assaulting Jehovah’s faithful representatives on earth. The nation has been born; and the dragon, namely, the Devil and his organization, makes war against those who observe the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. “They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous.” (V. 21) The only righteous ones are those who are in Christ, and their righteousness; is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font6">virtue of being in Christ. They need not fear in the present crisis. Jehovah is the defensive rock of their refuge. Abiding in the shadow of this great rock, they abide in the secret place of the Most High; and, knowing their security in him, they may boldly continue sing</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font6">forth his praises, letting even the enemies hear their </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Voices for a testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">There are diversities of operations; but it is the sama God which worketh all in all.—1 Corinthians 12: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It should ever be borne in mind that the church is Jehovah’s organization and that he is supervising its operations, because it is devoted to him. He is the One who is really doing the work, and hence all credit and praise should go to him. He pours out the one spirit upon the whole church that it may be one with him and with. Christ Jesus, the Head, and that the members thereof may be one with themselves. There necessarily will be differences of operation of God’s spirit, or power, with different members of the church according as their appointed tasks and duties may differ. Nevertheless, a brother should not become discouraged if he sees another brother in a prominent service accomplishing what appears to be much, while he himself is engaged in a minor service not bringing such noticeable results. Why not? Because he possesses the same spirit as his more capable brother; he serves the same God; and the same God is using him as well as his more prominent brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God giveth not the spirit by measure unto him. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.—John 3:34,35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah committed to Jesus all his interests. Surely Jesus possessed the greatest ability of any one ever on earth. His ability did not consist of physical strength and a collegiate education; for he did not use his physical strength particularly, nor did he ever attend a theological school. Of what, then, did the ability of Jesus consist? His absolute, complete devotion to the Father’s will, his complete loyalty to Jehovah. This finds expression in his words: “Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, 0 my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” His capacity was complete; therefore Jehovah filled him with his spirit in the complete sense, and he proved his loyalty to Jehovah to the utmost. Let us be conformed unto Jesus’ image by Jehovah’s spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, 1 have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.—Isa. 55:</span><span class="font6"> 4-Jesus testified of his own mission in coming to earth and in appearing publicly in the midst of Satan’s world: “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.” (John 18:37) Whatsoever Jesus had seen and heard of the Father, that he testified. (John 3:32) Consequently Jehovah could give him as one who can lead the people into truth and who can command them in the ways of the Lord. As Jehovah used Moses as his witness before Pharaoh and Egypt and then used him in leading Israel out of Egypt and in commanding them all the words of the Lord, so the Lord will use the Christ, the Prophet like unto Moses. Could Jehovah state and illustrate his commission to us more plainly? Surely our privileged part of the present is to witness to the people and to go through the gates and thus lead them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings.—Revelation 11:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The temple of Jehovah God is made up of the living members who are saints and whom the Lord finds to be faithful when he comes to take an account with them. It is well settled by the Scriptures that the Lord comes to his temple after he takes his great power and reigns. In 1914 Jehovah’s Vicegerent Jesus began to reign, and thereafter at the beginning of 1918 the facts show that a great trial came upon all the true church throughout the earth. That marked the time when Jehovah opened his temple in heaven; and now the enlightened eyes of the faithful behold the “Messenger of the Covenant”, or testament, enthroned in glory in the temple. Intermittent flashes of light on God’s truth, like lightnings, accompany and follow this notable event. As the flashes of light have come to the temple class since 1918, they have appreciated the greater illumination of their understanding and have rejoiced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Lord trieth the righteous.&quot;—Psalm 11:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE faithful followers of Christ Jesus are righteous because of being in Christ. Such constitute the temple class. At the end of the day of God’s preparation Christ Jesus comes to his temple. One of the purposes of his coming is to take account with those who profess to be the Lord’s. The trial leading to judgment begins with those who compose the house of God. Being put to the test the Lord finds some who have been faithfully safeguarding his kingdom interests. To such he says: “You have been faithful in a few things. . . . Enter into my joy.” His joy is in vindicating the name of his Father and in magnifying all of God’s mighty works. In doing this he cleans heaven and earth of the wicked system, and he delivers the people from the oppressive hand of the enemy. He invites his faithful body members to share this joy. He gives to them the garments of salvation, identifying them as the true sons of God, and the robe of righteousness, marking their approval as members of the temple class. To such Jehovah says: “Ye are my witnesses, that I am God.” These will boldly declare his message, thus proving their perfect love for God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It came to pass, that when he was returned, having received, the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to he called unto him, to whom he had given the money.—Luke 19:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1914 Jehovah gave the kingdom of earth to his noble Son, Jesus. The new King has servants in the earth; and to these he has committed the interests of his kingdom, represented in the parable by the money ot pounds. This servant class has undertaken to look after his interests in the earth. The Lord furnishes them with opportunities faithfully to represent him; namely, to advertise the King and the kingdom of which they are ambassadors. By utilizing these opportunities, so manifold and numerous today, the servants give evidence of their faithfulness to the Lord. Those who will shine the brightest in the kingdom will not be the ones who hold the most prominent positions on this side the vail, necessarily. It is faithfulness that warrants the Lord in advancing anyone to a position in the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Moreover, the light of the moon shall he as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall he sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the Lord hindeth up the breach of his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">■—Isaiah SO: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is the day in which Jehovah is binding up the hurt of his people, and hence they now dwell in Zion, and their eyes see their teachers. In times past Christians have had some difficulty in determining what is Jehovah’s will concerning them. Now they can see his will, as symbolized by the moon, more clearly than ever before. They know it is God’s will that they should have boldness now in proclaiming the message of the kingdom. The light of that kingdom is symbolized by the sun. The Sun of righteousness is arising; and the light of God is shining round his organization, Zion, and particularly upon the Head thereof. This increased light the Lord Jesus, the Head of Zion, sheds on those who are of Zion walking in the path of the light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall bring again Zion.—Isaiah 5%: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Prior to 1874 A. D. the Lord’s people for the most part were languishing in Babylon under ecclesiasticism, and Zion was as a captive daughter. Thereafter Jehovah sent forth his command: “Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.” It was by the carrying out of this command by the Elijah class under their Head, Christ Jesus, that Jehovah brought again Zion, bringing her out of captivity and giving her a proper position in his arrangement and also freedom of activity in his service. The regathered saints have specially appreciated this great deliverance and restoration since the Lord has come to his temple. Therefore Zion’s watchmen now vehemently lift up their voices, seeing eye to eye throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">•—Psalm 107: 40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Princes are favored ones in the courts of the earth; they do not possess the highest authority, but occupy only a minor position in government. They may well picture the ecclesiastical wing of Satan’s world organization. These princes have been rebellious, and companions of thievish financiers; they have loved gifts and followed after reward like Balaam. (Isaiah 1: 23) While Jehovah’s faithful ones have stood in awe of his Word, these princes have persecuted them without a cause; they did sit in judgment and speak against them. (Psalm 119:23,161) Now their day of visitation has come. Already he has poured out contempt upon them </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">the form of warnings, indictments, and adverse testimonies; and he has contemned them in taking away from them the kingdom and giving it to a nation bringing forth the fruit thereof. In the wilderness which Satan has made in the earth, they wander with no way </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">flee or escape Armageddon. Will any individuals a</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">mong </span><span class="font6">these princes yet worship? (Isaiah </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">49:7) Let </span><span class="font6">us </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">hope </span><span class="font6">so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 31</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: . . . This shall ye have of mine hand, ye shall lie down in sorrow.—Isa. 50:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The true Christians should never look to man or men as the source of light, and wantonly kindle their own spark-giving fires for illumination. Nominal Christendom, as we now see it, has fallen into this very snare. The ecclesiastical leaders have put away the Word of God, the Lamp that Jehovah lit to lighten the Christian’s pathway, and have walked in their own wisdom, and the people with them. Some of these leaders have been more brilliant than other men and have leaped out into prominence. Their natural brilliancy and lack of humility were a misfortune to them. Jehovah likens their brilliancy merely to sparks that flare up and soon disappear in the darkness. The people have walked in the light of this ecclesiastical fire and its spark-like bright lights. What portion do they now have from the Lord’s hand ? Let us hasten to their help.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus Christ.—2 Corinthians ^:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jehovah created the earth he made thick darkness a swaddling band for it. (Job 38: 9) At his command the darkness fled away. This miracle Jehovah has repeated in a far grander sense toward those who walk in the path of the just, the justified ones of the Gospel Age. He has shined in their hearts because there in the seat of their affections he has found a love of righteousness, of truth and of light. The light of the Lord that shines in this world of mental darkness is not for those who refuse to walk in it. It is not for those who love wickedness. It is for those who do truth and who come to the light that shines and who advance with it onward to perfection. Every one who receives the light of the knowledge of the glory of God receives a favor of priceless value.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment.’* ■—Psalm 10If.: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font6"> GARMENT or mantle is a symbol of identification. In beautiful poetic phrase, nowhere surpassed, the great Jehovah identifies himself </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">the Author of light. This he does by covering himself with a garment or mantle of light. Light is a symbol of life. Jehovah is the great Life-giver. All creation is indebted to him for life. Things are created by the invisible power of Jehovah operating as he wills. “Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For more than sixty centuries the human race has been without life because of Adam’s sin. God has provided that the race may have life through his beloved Son. Hence Jesus said: “This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” With humble mind and devout heart the Christian delights to search out God’s works. Beholding the Mighty One wrapt in a mantle of light he exclaims: “Bless Jehovah, 0 my soul; thou art exceeding great. Majesty and state hast thou put on 1”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.—Psalm IJfl:</span><span class="font6">4-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The magnitude of God’s universe cannot be approximated by the mental powers of man. Abraham, in casting his eyes to the heavens at God’s command, could not count or tell the number of the stellar luminaries of the night. Applying the eye to great telescopes of today there burst upon the vision countless myriads of bright shining stars which Abraham could never discern with the naked eye. Astronomers, in mapping out the heavens which can be brought within the range of our vision, calculate that there are thirty thousand million stars in our universe. But Jehovah, the Creator, has accurately tabulated the number of the celestial orbs of light and even holds in memory their originally-given names. What assurance this gives to the saints that the Lord knoweth them that are truly his and retains in his unlimited memory their names!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God loveth a cheerful giver.—2 Corinthians 9:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is the greatest Giver, and he gives largely and cheerfully. Therefore he loves a cheerful giver, not because the giving is done unto him or that he is at all enriched by the giving, but because it reflects his likeness and savors of love. It is not the gift that Jehovah values so much as it is the glad spirit in which the gift is made, grateful for the chance to give that good might be done and the Lord glorified. We cannot always make large, bountiful gifts, but what we do give we can give cheerfully in the Lord’s spirit. The antitypical “sons of Levi” now have the opportunity as never before to be cheerful givers toward the greatest of causes. The Lord is now in kingdom power, and they may now conform to the prophetic picture and be willing in this day of his power by giving their all toward his cause. He is in his temple, purifying them that they may cheerfully offer their every faculty as “an offering in riedi icon sn ess” unto the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The glory of the Lord herein spoken of is the visible blessing of honor that he bestows upon his faithful witnesses. Glory means honor. To be singled out and distinguished or marked by the Lord’s favor is to be highly honored of the Lord. Is not then the Lord’s glory amidst his people today, inasmuch as he has singled them out and distinguished them with the exalted honor of publishing the glorious tidings of the kingdom? Are they unprotected while in this honorable service? No 1 True, the ranks of those in Zion were thinned down by the Lord’s gathering those that offend and do iniquity out from the kingdom class. But the Lord has added others, and more also, so that &quot;Jerusalem [has become] inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude”. Though without visible walls, Zion has Jehovah as a wall of fire round about her.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.—Rom. 8:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has begotten us and anointed us with his spirit and made us his children. He has thereby- made us also his heirs, to share a divine inheritance with the victorious One, Jesus, “whom he hath appointed heir of all things.” The reading of the Apostle Paul’s original letter is “if so be that we suffer together’”, and bears out the thought that the suffering is shared by the heavenly Father as well as by the Son and the church, and that likewise the future inheritance will be shared jointly by all three. It is to fellowship with this infinite heart of love that the saints are called and begotten, to fellowship with the One who for thousands of years has been reproached by evil angels and evil men, who have not understood and who have sought to thwart his benevolent designs and thus have caused him sorrow. Let us share the sufferings, and prove worthy as his heirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, 0 God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.—Isaiah 6Jf: J/.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the Gospel Age Jehovah reveals his deep things only to the members of his family. This family relationship is attained by exercising faith in the shed blood of Jesus, by full consecration, justification, spiritbegetting and anointing. Then the new creature begins to have the eyes of his understanding opened. As he gazes into the perfect mirror (God’s Word of Truth), and strives to reflect or conform himself to the glorious things set forth therein, the revelation grows brighter and brighter “unto the perfect day”. This revelation of the deeper things of God’s Word is not by natural keenness of perception, nor by human mental brightness, but by God’s spirit. Blessed are they who have waited for him, and whose eyes now see the temple of God in heaven opened and witness the flashes of the lightning of his truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to its the ministry of reconciliation.—2 Corinthians 5:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is the source of all the “new” things which we so abundantly enjoy in Christ Jesus. He has not reconciled us to himself by Christ Jesus that we might merely rejoice selfishly and with self-complacency in our spiritual blessings and our peaceful relationship with God. Bather he has reconciled us in order that we might be made acceptable to be put in trust with his great work. He has given us a ministry, and ministry means service. It means to attend upon Jehovah’s will; it means to run errands as his messengers with his official messages. It is an unselfish service and brings with it </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">large opportunity to exercise supreme love for God, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">pure love for our brethren in Christ, and a broad </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">compassionate love for the groaning creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;God . . . created all things by Jesus Christ.&quot; —Ephesians 3:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">unsearchable riches of God’s creation reaches I the pinnacle in the creation of The Christ. For ages this creation has been a mystery, which mystery is made known during the Gospel Age to the saints. It seems certain, however, that restored man will understand the mystery of God, because he will see that he has received life from God through Christ Jesus. All must know of the ransom sacrifice and accept it in order to obtain life. When the record of Jehovah is written up, the people will know who is born in Zion and therefore who is of the mystery class. They will know then that Jesus died and arose from the dead and was exalted; that then God through Jesus Christ created the members of his body, who together with the Head constitute the mystery; and that Christ is the great agency of Jehovah to give life to all the obedient ones of earth. The day has come for this witness concerning God to be given in the earth, and the true Christian must now begin to tell the people of this good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The kingdom, of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Matthew £2: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is the great King who has made the marriage for his Son, Christ Jesus. That the members of the church may be made ready for the marriage Jehovah grants them wedding garments through his Son, to whom they are espoused. The wedding garment is a symbol of distinction to identify one as ready for the wedding. It must be worn by those expecting to be members of Christ’s bridal company. This garment does not picture justification, because it is the new creature that dons the garment and one becomes a new creature after he receives justification. It represents that which the new creature must keep on if he would win the approval of the King. Surely then it must picture the doing of Jehovah’s will, the keeping of his commandments in the way he has pointed out that the same must be done. Take heed, then! The King has come in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">So now it was not you that sent me hither, hut God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.—Genesis 4-5: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah ordered in Joseph’s affairs so as to have him brought down to Egypt and finally elevated to the prime ministry of Satan’s first great world power. By this providence of Jehovah it worked out that Joseph became a mighty witness for the Lord in the land of Hum. Joseph’s case is an instance of how Jehovah “bi'ingeth out those which are bound with chains”. His keepers hurt his feet with fetters and laid him in irons “until the time that [God’s] word came; the word of the Lord tried him”. Joseph therefore acknowledged that Jehovah was responsible for having Pharaoh make him “lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance; to bind his princes at his pleasure, and teach his senators wisdom”. In Joseph’s experience Jehovah gives us </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">likeness of what he will do with his servant class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will betroth thee unto me for ever; ... I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know the Lord.—Hosea 2:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Addressing Zion, who is the mother of the kingdom class, Jehovah says through the Prophet Isaiah: “Thy Maker is thine husband; Jehovah of hosts is his name.” Hence the words of our text apply to the church on earth, which represents Zion. Jehovah planted the church a noble vine, wholly a right seed; but ecclesiasti-cism caused a strange vine of a degenerate plant to grow. This vine the Lord openly repudiated in 1919, and soon it will be trodden in the wine-press. But the remnant in Zion is now being gathered to Jehovah. He is making them to know him. He is proving their loyalty to him. He knows that this proved class will ever be faithful unto him. Therefore he lovingly and devotedly assures them that they shall never be estranged from him, but be joined to him and to his glorious Son, the Bridegroom, for ever. What a blessed consolation and stimulus to faithfulness!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.—Psalm 32:</span><span class="font6"> 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Trouble suirounds the church, but God becomes her hiding place. The floods of trouble envelop others, but shall not come nigh to the chosen of the Lord. Those who are of the temple class, and who are therefore under the robe of righteousness, appreciate the fact that the times are perilous, never was danger so great; yet at the same time they feel absolutely secure in the strength of the Lord. They find that Jehovah has compassed them about with songs of deliverance, and they sing for joy. Surely this is the happy condition of the temple class at this time. They know that the time of deliverance is at hand, even as Jesus long ago told them to expect. Therefore they lift up the head and let their lips echo the songs of deliverance that others might hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee.—Psalm 76:10, Revised Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The weakness of God is stronger than men.” Jehovah’s plans and arrangements have seemed to men to be weak because they have permitted the wrath of man to assert itself and have permitted wickedness and evil devices seemingly to triumph. But in these very respects Jehovah will display his strength by completely reversing what the enemy intended and by making their activities serve in conjunction with his good purposes. He will make all work out for the good of those who love him, and thus will enhance his praise. As in the case of Pharaoh, he lets the wrath of his enemies rise to its whitest heat. When their wrath is come to the full, then it remains for him to gird wrath on him to uphold him (Isaiah 63:5) while he shows forth his power over the enemy and gets name and honor upon them. Patience and courage then, ye saints of God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">So thou, 0 son of man, 1 have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ezekiel 33: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The word watchman, when properly defined, includes the thought of leaning forward to penetrate into the distance, of observing and taking heed to orders and acting accordingly. Through his beloved Son, the great Watcher over the interests of his own has put his anointed ones on guard as watchmen to watch the interests of the Messianic kingdom and to testify from time to time to the unfolding of his plan. These are not looking out for self-interests, nor are they making a studied effort to reach some easy place in the heavenly kingdom. They forget self; they warn their brethren and others who are in danger; they observe the word at Jehovah’s mouth, and seek always to honor his name and to serve him. They sing in their hearts, singing the praises of Jehovah God and his mighty Son Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;[GW] </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hath raised us up together, and -made us sit together in heavenly places’’—Ephesians 2: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE apostle addresses these words to the new creatures in Christ, of whom he is one. Among the other mighty works of God is that of the new creation. The members thereof have been raised up together in Christ and by faith given sweet repose in the heavenly condition. These are the offspring of Jerusalem which is above. Their citizenship is in heaven, where all creatures in harmony with God reflect his glory. Above and higher than all the creation of heaven is the Lord Jesus Christ; and the great God, Jehovah, rides upon the heavens of the heavens because all of his righteous organization uphold him. The faithful Christian, even though in the world, is not of the world. His heaven, or invisible ruling power, is the righteous organization of Jehovah, of which Jesus is the Head. By faith he has association and companionship with those of heaven looking forward to that blessed day when he may see the Lord in all his glory and beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thy' righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: 0 God, thou preservest man and beast.—Psalm 36: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Righteousness marks all the acts and works of Jehovah, and it shall stand forth prominently for ever like “mountains of God” (margin). His judgments are laid deep in the unfathomable depths of his wisdom, and shall therefore never fail nor go astray. Modern savants frighten men with fears that in time this earth shall become a dead planet and creature life become extinct upon it; while militarists devise and prepare for the next war, that imperils the life of every human being. Jehovah in his righteousness has rendered judgment, and it shall stand. His decision is to carry millions alive through the great day of battle and to recreate and preserve the dead members of Adam’s family in the regeneration under Christ’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein: for he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.—Psalm</span><span class="font6"> AJ.: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In preparing the literal earth for man’s habitation, God gathered into basins the waters of the deep that covered the face of our planet, and made the dry land to appear. In the terrific deluge that destroyed the old world, the flood waters covered even the high hills; but Jehovah made the floodwaters to assuage and the dry land to appear, and another world was founded upon it. Again, “the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves,” but this time they are the floods of the ungodly and conscienceless who would swell and overwhelm all humanity. But again will it be proven that) “the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than mighty waves of the sea”. He will rebuke them and will establish the new world upon or in spite of the storm-struck seas and floods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you.—Rom. 8:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The word “quicken” as here used means to vitalize; to energize; to enliven; to cause to move with rapidity. It means to do something to the Lord’s glory, and not to remain inactive. It means to glorify God with the body, which is his. The holy spirit, the spirit of Jehovah, is so mighty that it raised up Jesus from the dead. It is logically able also to make alive, energize, the human body to activity in service for righteousness, even though that body was once given over to sin. The new creature now is responsible for the mortal body. Hence the spirit of Jehovah dwelling in him should lead him to use his strength, energy, time, influence, money, and everything he has, to the Lord’s glory. He who faithfully does so unto the end of his earthly life, shall be made alive in a divine body by the spirit of Jehovah in the first resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm S3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The nations are raging; their governors take counsel together against Jehovah and his anointed One. It is ungodly and selfish counsel, inimical to the interests of the people and dishonoring to the Lord. The people in their vanity give way to imaginations, and rely on human organizations for deliverance. Their devices^ while evidently sincere and well-intentioned, are inadequate and short-sighted. Jehovah has his own counsel for blessing the people, the living and the dead. He will not further the wicked devices of Satan’s organization, lest they exalt themselves. (Psalm 140:8) “There is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel, against the Lord.” (Proverbs 21: 30) This should elicit our strong confidence in Jehovah; it should urge u$ onward in explaining why human devices and counsels are doomed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Isaiah 60:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Like the ninth plague that afflicted Egypt just before the deliverance of Israel came, the gross darkness enshrouding the earth today is a darkness that can be felt; and the people are much pained. The rulers’ hearts are failing them for fear. But “unto the upright there-ariseth light in the darkness”; for Jehovah has risen upon Zion as a great Sun, and she stands as though clothed with the golden beams of the great Star of day. The full light of the kingdom message is hers. Tire glory of Jehovah as manifested in his loving favor and his unfailing protection is also seen upon her. The prophet of the Lord, looking forward to the unique position of the temple class in this time, rouses them to action with the cry: “Arise, shine; for thy light is come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom, prepared for you from the foundation of the world.— Matthew 25: SJj.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the earth at this time there are millions of people of good will, who sincerely desire a better condition for themselves and for others, but who are not alive to Jehovah’s way. Many of these see the efforts put forth by God’s witnesses in telling of the good tidings of the kingdom; and insofar as they can they are moved to extend aid and comfort to God’s servants because they are his servants. This they do because of the good that is still in them. It is for such sheeplike, inoffensive ones that Jehovah has prepared the kingdom from the foundation of the world. Many of this righteously disposed class of people will pass through the coming trouble and be the first ones to have a trial for restoration. On proving their righteousness when God’s judgments are in the earth, Jehovah will bless them through the Christ and will welcome them into life eternal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;I </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up.&quot;—Amos 9:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">fTIHE work of Jehovah is not limited. With the com-I pletion of the new creation there shall come out ' of Zion, God’s organization, the great Deliverer;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">and unto him shall the gathering of the people he. The people of Israel shall again hear and understand the glad song of Moses and shall learn the sweet refrain of the Lamb of God. The great Jehovah has now set his anointed King upon his throne, and bids those who are his faithful followers to go and bear witness of this great truth to the rulers and peoples of the earth. These are also commissioned to carry the good news to the oppressed of Israel, that the Jews may know that the day of deliverance is at hand. In the custody of these witnesses God has placed his message of reconciliation. The faithful remnant not only delight to search out the works of Jehovah but rejoice to be workers under the direction of his beloved Son; and they now declare to the Jews that God is sending to them their King, who will plant them in their land that they may abide there for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[The Lord] fruslrateth the tokens of the liars, and malceth diviners madj . . . confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers.—Isaiah</span><span class="font6"> 44- </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">25,26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The lying prophets of Christendom, whom Jehovah did not send and to whom he spake not, sanctified war and held out plausible tokens of the Lord’s blessing upon the nations that engaged in the war. They divined that much spiritual good would result from the war, and that the world would be purged by its great trial and made “safe for democracy”. They have given their manifesto and votes as tokens that the League of Nations is “the political expression of God’s kingdom om earth”. Subsequent events to date have proved that they are mad, wild, in their false divinations; for the Lord is frustrating all their tokens and exposing them as false prophets. But the word of his servant class, whom he truly sent forth as his messengers of the gospel to the nations, is steadily being confirmed. God’s counsel is sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord said unto Moses, See, 1 have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.—Exodus 7:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah sent Aaron with Moses to Egypt to act as a mouthpiece for Moses. It was Aaron’s business to talk. Soon thereafter Egypt was overthrown that Jehovah might make a name for himself. Now in the end of the world God will overthrow Satan and his organization, of which Pharaoh and Egypt were types; and this he will do that he may make a glorious everlasting name for himself. His saints are to be witnesses concerning this fact and to give testimony in the earth. He has made Jesus, the antitypical Moses, “the mighty God” (Isaiah 9:6), to do this stupendous work. Jesus’ brethren, the members of his body who are on earth-, are pictured by Aaron; and these Jehovah has made the spokesman of the invisible One to declare the message of the Lord to the peoples of earth. Jehovah requires faithfulness on the part of these spokesmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">See, I have this day sei thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to thrown down, to build, and to plant.—Jeremiah 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jeremiah’s commission represents that given to God’s anointed ones. Jehovah has set them over the nations to declare unto them the uprooting, pulling down, throwing down and destruction that is in store for earth’s iniquitous systems, and the upbuilding and planting irremovably of the new heavens and the new earth. The proclamation of this program of Jehovah must be given before many peoples, nations, and kings (Bevelation 10:11); and it must be given by the anointed ones with zeal for Jehovah and without fear. There can be no slacking of their hand now. Great is the honor bestowed upon them. With Christ Jesus and the members of his body on the other side of the vail, they are to have a part in the great battle of Armageddon, which shall crush the international “vine of the earth&quot; and its fruitage. None others will have a part therein. Faithfulness brings them a heavenly reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.—John 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God loves the oppressed people of the world. So great is his love that he gave his only begotten Son that the people might not perish, but that those who should hear and obey might live. It would be just like Jehovah to make everything ready for them to hear at the proper time. For more than six thousand years man has been alienated from God. Anticipating the time of the glad return of the exiles unto himself, God through his prophet bids his anointed servant class to mark out to them the way that leads to life. He tells them to go and make ready the road for the entry of the people; to bank up the causeway; to gather out the stones; and then to lift up a standard to which the people may rally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">February 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac.—Psalm 105: S, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who are of the faith of Abraham can surely bear witness that Jehovah has remembered his covenant, as they behold his work among the Jews in this eventful period of history. Jehovah confirmed the covenant unto Israel, saying, “Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot cf thine inheritance.” Modern facts forcefully prove that he has not forgotten his promise to Israel throughout all the thousand or more generations which have been born since the covenant was made. He is today prospering the word of his covenant in a most perceptible manner; for lo! the natural sons and daughters of Abraham are returning thousands upon thousands to the promised land. The time has come therefore for the spiritual seed of Abraham to say unto the cities of Judaism: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“0</span><span class="font6"> ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. Seek Jehovah, and hi.3 strength; seek his face for evermore.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.—Micah 7:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is “the God of truth”. He keeps covenant and shows mercy. Jacob prayed: “I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant.” The truth that Jehovah revealed to Jacob grew cut of his mercy to Abraham. He had showed unto Abraham his covenant, which promised blessings to all the families of the earth. God will perform all this truth and the terms of mercy in the Abrahamic covenant, and Abraham and Jacob shall themselves witness its performance when Messiah’s kingdom wakens them to life. Jehovah gave his own word, and he swore to it by his own name. The Apostle Paul tells us that he did this that we, the heirs of God’s promise, might have strong consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;His work is honorable and glorious”—Psalm 111:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE prophet here states a great truth. Honorable means excellent, beautiful and imposing in form and appearance. Glorious, when applied to God’s works, means that these are majestic, magnificent, and clothed with splendor. All the works of Jehovah reflect his honor and glory, and are in keeping with his name. This truth thus stated suggests the thought that all creatures approved by him will reflect the honor and glory of God, and that their chief function is to magnify his holy name. The time has come for God to make for himself a name in the earth. He will make manifest his power and majesty to all creation. He commands that his saints on earth shall now be his witnesses and bear testimony to the peoples of earth of his purpose to shortly reveal his majesty, honor and glory by establishing his kingdom of righteousness and through Christ to bring deliverance to the people. The remnant must now lift up this standard to the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jie revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth. what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleih with him.—Daniel 2: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is nothing hid from the ken of Jehovah God. “Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee: but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.” (Psalm 139:12) The secrets of men are known to him because the day comes when he shall judge them by his Son Jesus Christ. But Jehovah has deep secrets of his own pertaining to his designs toward his saints and toward the human family. These secret things are impossible for human insight to penetrate and know; they are as dark sayings to human minds. “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will show them his covenant.” To them he reveals his deep secrets by the power of his spirit, as these secrets become due to be understood by his servants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.—Rev. H: 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The vine of the earth is the wicked organization of which the Devil is the head. It produces the grapes of the earth, the fruit of wickedness. The winepress is Jehovah’s. It is the instrument or means which he uses to crush the life-blood out of the grapes of the earth. He employs in the treading process his beloved Son, who is willingly and joyfully supported by his faithful body members. No one this side the vail can see every detail of the operation of God’s winepress. The earnest watchmen of the temple of God, however, can see that it means the agency which Jehovah will employ to annihilate that wicked system that has long defamed his name and oppressed the human race. Seeing the wonderful results that will follow the treading of the vine of the earth in the battle of Armageddon, these watchmen are thrilled, because they know that the day of deliverance for themselves and mankind in general has approached.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses.—Joshua 20:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s provision in the law given through Moses for six cities of refuge must be a shadow of something to follow. Accordingly Satan, who has the power of death, seems surely to be the avenger of blood. The consecrated Christian is the one who flees to the city of refuge; for in making a consecration and being accepted of the Lord for sacrifice he agrees in effect to the slaying of his humanity, the putting to death of the old man. Christ Jesus is the city of refuge to which Jehovah has ordained and made a way that he shall flee from the vengeance of Satan. As the preservation of the unwitting slayer of old depended upon his faithfully abiding in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest, even so the preservation of the saints depends upon faithfully abiding in Christ until the high-priestly class is completed. The Lord does not preserve those who become unfaithful and who despise their covenant with him and forsake their haven of refuge.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">As one whom his mother comforteth, so will 1 comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Isaiah 66:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The effort of the enemy is to discourage and frighten the Lord’s servants and thereby to weaken them and cause their spirit to mourn and their hands to hang limp and inactive at their sides. On the other hand the Lord comforts those who are in his organization, Jerusalem, with all the tenderness of a mother consoling her child. To comfort means to strengthen, to make confident and fearless, to make cheerful and of good hope. The need of comfort implies testings. Of these the last members of the body of Christ seem to be marked out for their portion; but while they are passing through their fiery experiences, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort will not leave his own comfortless. Whatsoever is written in his Word is written for their encouragement and comfort, that they might patiently endure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">This people have 1 formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.—Isaiah, 43: SI.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has formed or organized spiritual Israel not for his selfish enjoyment but for his altruistic purposes. He has not called the church merely in order to take a limited number into heaven. True, the heavenly glory will be the great reward of the faithful. However, faithfulness is a condition precedent and one which is required to be proven before the one who possesses it can be taken into heavenly glory. Peter plainly states that God has called his church out of darkness into marvelous light that the members thereof might show forth his praise. It follows, therefore, that faithfulness must be manifested in showing abroad his praises; and this must be done at least to a degree this side the vail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thou art worthy, 0 Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.— Revelation 4:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All the creatures of the universe—the Logos, the divine family, angels, cherubim, seraphim, man, the beasts of the field, the fowl of the air, and whatsoever passeth through the depths of the seas—all were created by Jehovah. The inanimate things of this realm of existence—the sun, moon, and stars, things visible and invisible, indescribably grand—all emanate from his creative powers. Did God create all these wonders for his selfish pleasure ? That he derives pleasure therefrom should not argue selfishness on his part. Jehovah delights and finds pleasure in activity and work of creation. He properly experiences pleasure in seeing creatures that he approves happy and blessed. He is love. If love is unselfishness perfectly expressed, how could Jehovah’s unselfishness have been expressed toward anyone or anything had he, who was originally alone, not engaged in creation? Truly he is worthy of worship, not alone as Creator but as Love personified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Uy Father worketh hitherto, and I work.”—John 5:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font6">T WAS on the Sabbath day that Jesus healed the man who had for a long time been afflicted. For this good work the Jews sought to kill him. These Jews claimed to be representatives of Jehovah. In rebuking them Jesus said: “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.” Thereby he proved that work is honorable and pleasing to God. Some now who claim to be sons and servants of God object to work. They refuse to engage in the proclamation of the kingdom message and criticize those who thus work in the Lord’s name. Such are selfish. All in whom the love of God will now be made perfect must have boldness in declaring his message and in using every opportunity so to do. Both Jehovah and his beloved Son, by example, declare that work done according to God’s way and in his name is honorable and pleasing to him. Only those who work and do so joyfully in obedience to God’s command, have an assurance of an abundant entrance into his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.—Genesis 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah entered into his rest after the creation of man, to continue in that rest unto the conclusion of the great seventh day. He did not make the whole earth </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">paradise for man, but placed man in the garden of Eden, and blessed him with the faculties and strength to carry out the divine commission to subdue the earth. Then he left man to do the work of extending Paradise earth-wide. But now that man has fallen in sin and death, Jehovah has committed that work to the great Executor of his plan, meantime continuing in his rest. He has blessed his day of rest, ordaining that the outcome of it shall be blessed to all concerned. Man by his disobedient course has filled the day with sorrows; but the blessings of the mercy and goodness of Jehovah faithfully continue to distinguish the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anomtest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.—Psalm 23:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Losing faith, the children of Israel cried: “Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?” Jehovah did not fail them, nor has he ever failed his people. In the tabernacle arrangement, he provided for the priests’ bread by having a table of shewbread stationed in the holy of the tabernacle. The enemies are not permitted </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">interfere with Jehovah’s feeding of his people. The great enemy, Satan, the Dragon, has been expelled from heaven, and is especially near now; and all the church’s enemies would come upon her and eat her flesh, but they stumble and fall. And while the vicious Dragon looks on, Jehovah provides spiritual meat and commands his earthly organization: “Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink.” (Isaiah 21: 5) Never may we Say, as did unappreciative ones in Malachi’s day, “The </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">table of </span><span class="font6">the Lord is contemptible”; but let us give thanks in faith for what the Lord provides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thou hast sinned: therefore 1 will cast thee as profane ozit of the mountain of God: and 1 will destroy thee, 0 covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.—Ezekiel 28:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the end of Satan is destruction there should be no doubt. That his destruction will be deferred until his wicked works are destroyed is also sure. (Hebrews </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2:</span><span class="font6">14; 1 John 3: 8) The great author of sin and the relentless opposer of righteousness shall not live for ever as a blot on Jehovah’s creation. This means that eventually peace shall reign in earth as well as now in heaven, and that Jehovah’s will shall be done on earth as it is done in his own official court. Since the coming of the kingdom in 1914 and the warfare in heaven that followed, this erstwhile covering cherub has been cast out of the mountain of God as an unreformably profane creature. Let no one be deceived into thinking that he will be recovered to virtue and to Jehovah’s realm of holiness. His binding is imminent, and in his eventual destruction the justice and truth of God’s ways will be; made manifest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For this God is our God for ever and ever; he will be our guide even unto death.—Psalm J<sub>t</sub>8:1</span><span class="font6">4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why then should we be anxious about the future? Armed with the message of truth which proceeds out of their mouth like a sharp sword, held by Jehovah in the shadow of his hand, and protected as a hunter protects his arrows in his quiver, let the anointed' ones </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font6"> forth to the battle, singing the praises of Jehovah as they go. Let fear be flung to the winds; and, moved by a burning zeal for the Lord, let the saints march on under the guidance of Jehovah to victory and to the kingdom of God. Arouse the great company class. Bid them leave their dark prisons and come forth and take their stand on the Lord’s side. Hold on high the standard of the Lord foi- the people. Point them to the highway. Grand now is your work, ye anointed ones! Blessed are all they who participate therein!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Before I formed thee in the belly 1 knew thee; and before thou earnest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee; and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.—Jeremiah 1: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For forty years prior to Jerusalem’s first destruction Jeremiah prophesied respecting it and the nations. Peter assures us that Jeremiah did not realize the full significance of God’s words to him, but that they apply particularly to us upon whom the ends of the ages are come. Jehovah foreknew his remnant class in this end of the age before ever that remnant emerged into its present great work. Foreknowing the work they would do he inspired Jesus to prophesy: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations.” Hence he sanctified or set apart the remnant class which he was forming or preparing to this work. When the Lord came to his temple and the spirit was poured out upon all flesh, there Jehovah ordained the remnant to stand forth and testify as his mouthpiece to the nations. What strength the knowledge of Jehovah’s supervision gives to us!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For thus saith the Lord God, Behold I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ezekiel 34:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Jehovah is my Shepherd.” “We are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.” His faithful Son is the good Shepherd who gave his life for the sheep. For centuries the hireling “shepherds and the principal of the flock” have made havoc of Jehovah’s sheep and scattered them with their rule of force and cruelty. Now the day of deliverance has come; and Jehovah, even Jehovah, is engaged in searching and seeking out his sheep. Those who respond to his message, he feeds in good pasture and makes to lie down in a good fold. Since the Lord Jesus has taken his seat on his glorious throne for judging the nations, Jehovah uses him to bless those sheeplike ones who do good unto his sheep.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘God shall help her, and that right early.”—Psa. 16: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HERE is a due time for every part of the work of Jehovah. The due time for carrying out this command is at the end of the Gentile Times. The command is addressed to the temple or servant class, and such are designated as witnesses to testify that Jehovah is Ged. The proclaiming of this gospel of the kingdom God will have done by his saints this side the vail and before the complete fall of Satan’s organization. Who will delight to give the witness? The answer is: Those whose religion is Christ Jesus and his kingdom. Some who claim to be consecrated to the Lord put forth all their efforts to make many believe that by developing a character they will get to heaven. Such deceive themselves. Those who have real faith in the kingdom of God as his means of delivering the human race joyfully seize the opportunity to devote their faculties to the Lord’s service in declaring the message of his kingdom. &quot;When this witness has been given then all opportunity of participating therein will be gone. When too late some may awake to the fact that they have failed to heed the Lord’s commands and that they are not of the kingdom. Only the remnant will be diligent in obeying the Lord’s commands and will receive the everlasting reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was bom there.—Psalm 87:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has predestinated that Christ’s glorified body shall comprise one hundred and forty-four thousand members. Each member is to be born in Zion, the heavenly city of God, in the first resurrection. The Lord is supremely interested in this elect company, and he counts them as they are born in Zion. He will continue to count until the last member is born to make the elect number complete. Not one member shall be left out of the count or overlooked, because Jehovah can tell even the number of the stars. Jehovah is not ashamed of them, because they have not been ashamed to confess him as their God on earth. Because they have spoken oft one with another, honoring his name among themselves and before men, he has had a book of remembrance written before him in which their names are recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength, because of thine enemies; that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 8:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jesus rode on the ass into Jerusalem and went into the temple, and the priests and scribes objected to the children crying out in the temple, Hosanna to the son of David! the Lord asked: “Have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise”? Similar circumstances, have arisen in these times: The King has offered himself to Christendom and has come to his temple for judgment. The saints in the temple condition are crying as never before : “The kingdom is come. Hail to the King!” The giantlike ruling powers of Christendom frown upon these saints, who arc like babes and sucklings intellectually and numerically in their sight. They object to the joyful acclamations of the new King. But again Jehovah has perfected praise out of the mouths of his little ones; he has ordained strength unto them to raise their voice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">77ie </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lord preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.—Psalm U/5:%0.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The enemy is vigorous and powerful. He is seeking to destroy the members of the body of Christ. All his forces are arrayed against the seed of promise. However, these latter, observing the rules or laws which the Lord has laid down, are safe from all harm. Jehovah pre-serveth them. Their continued safety depends upon their loving devotion and faithfulness to the Lord and his cause. Pleadingly the Lord therefore says to them through his prophet: “0 love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth the faithful.” As the enemy advances to the assault let each member of the body remember that the battle is not his but Jehovah’s. The Lord is leading, and he is certain of victory. Observe the orders of the Leader, carry on strenuously in the conflict, and trust to the Lord for preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jie sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.—Psalm 1^1:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whatsoever Jehovah commands or- orders, that thing specifically comes to pass or into being. The inanimate Creations and forces of nature and of the universe obey his commands; but his special creation, his saints, distinguish themselves by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">intelligent</span><span class="font6"> obedience to his commands. Since the great World War Jehovah has sent forth his commandment to his saints on earth in these words: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness.” And readily and joyfully the faithful saints respond. In consequence of their willingness and in view of the Lord’s blessing, his Word runs very swiftly to all the nations of earth as a testimony. Yea, it rushes through the air at the rate of one hundred and eighty thousand and three hundred miles a second by means of the radio waves, penetrating even the walls of the houses and bringing to the people the most gladsome tidings ever broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.—Psalm 91:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this period when Satan, the abased Dragon, is waging war against those who keep the commandments of God, he is using various devices to get them into his toils. He takes on the guise of a fowler, intent on ensnaring the unwary. Jehovah God has given the assurance that he shall deliver those who, like helpless birds, take refuge in the covert of his wings. One of the snares of the malicious Fowler from which Jehovah has delivered us is ecclesiastieism, “the false prophet.” (Hosea 9:8) No more does the rod of the great wicked one or of his ecclesiastical element rest upon the let of the righteous. (Psalm 135: 3) Nor can the destructive pestilence that stalks abroad in the gross darkness covering the earth touch them with its deadly contagion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Daniel 6:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Daniel, as a member of that “cloud of witnesses” of whom the world was not worthy, was innocent before the Lord, and therefore Jehovah stopped the mouths of the ferocious monarchs of the forest. The Apostle Paul, another witness for Jehovah, also testified: “I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion,” out of Nero’s clutches, who was verily more cruel than the lions of the wood. Looking back at the enemies of the Lord’s people who rose up during the World War and would have swallowed up the church alive, we too can say: “Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.” Today the great accuser of the brethren, deposed from heaven, roams abroad as a roaring lion, seeking w’hom he may devour; but we know that our innocency is established before Jehovah because we are under the robe of righteousness. And as long as we are faithfully engaged in making known that Jehovah is God, the lion’s mouth is shut by Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font6">S USED in this text godly means holy. Only those are holy who, being in Christ, are fully and entirely devoted to the Lord. In such God is working to will and to perform his good purposes. Such he sets apart for himself to use now as his witnesses and for ever to glorify his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It will not do for the Christian to devote his faculties to selfish purposes and to give sparingly to the Lord’s service. Such are not holy unto the Lord and are chiefly for self. The depth of each one’s consecration is put to the test. He fails in the test when he considers the Lord’s service of secondary importance. He meets the test when he joyfully bends his energies in obedience to the commands of the Lord and delights to tell others, and does tell them, about the works of Jehovah and the blessings his kingdom will bring. As a rule those who possess most of the material riches find it very difficult to meet the test. Those who are wholeheartedly engaged in the Lord’s service because of their love for him and his works constitute the rem’nant of his people in these last days.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 have satiated the weary soul, and 1 have replenished every sorrowful soul. Upon this 1 awaked, and 'beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jeremiah 31: 25,26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah had promised (verse 14): </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font6"> will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the Lord.” How wondrously he has made this prophecy to go into fulfilment even this side the vail! Incidental to the great World War, the soul of the church became weary of life, like Elijah. &quot;Take away my life,” she said, as her soul became sorrowful amid the trialsome experiences of 1918. But in 1919 in the Fall the wise virgins of the church awaked; and Jehovah multiplied the proofs and assurances to them that the kingdom was established and their Bridegroom was truly here. He began to unfold the parables and scriptures respecting the kingdom and the present honor and favor and work of the church. What fatness God’s priestly class now enjoy! How all this goodness satiates the souls of his people, who have been weary and sorrowful!</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.-—Hosea 11:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How tender is the message of Jehovah toward Israel! His taking Israel by the hand and leading him out of Egyptian bondage was a sincere manifestation of love for him. His love was again displayed when he brought his only-begotten Son out of Egypt, where Joseph and Mary had borne him as a babe. Similarly, Jehovah has bestowed great love upon his church, his first-born ones, in these days in delivering them from slavishness to Egypt. He has called them out of the world, typified by Egypt, to draw near to the mount of God to worship and serve and know him. To them he says: “Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses.’* (Isaiah 44: 8 ) His admonition to them is not to go down to Egypt again, but to maintain fealty to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">0 visit me with thy salvation; that 1 may see the good of thy chosen, that 1 may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that 1 may glory with thine inheritance.—Psalm 106:</span><span class="font6"> 4,</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord has visited his chosen ones with salvation and has made them to see good while still in the land of the living here on earth. By one master-stroke of Jehovah in 1914 the new nation, the new heavenly governing factor over earth, was born. Shortly thereafter the great adversary was unseated and cast out of heaven; and the cry rang throughout heaven: “Bejoice, ye heavens, and ye that, dwell in them.” Not only the heavens rejoiced, hut “Zion heard, and was glad”. That is, Jehovah made the children whom Zion brought forth since 1918 to rejoice in the gladness of the newborn nation. He has adorned them with the robe of righteousness and the garments of salvation. Should they not glory as his inheritance and bless him out of Zion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Not unto us, 0 Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 115:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This prayer expresses the proper heart condition and the real objective of all true prayer; namely, that unto his own name Jehovah might bring the glory rather than answer anything of a selfish kind in our prayers. This type of prayer is the true heart sentiment of all the active servants of the Lord at this time. They know that the day has arrived in which Jehovah wifi make a name for himself. He is to be exalted in the earth. All selfish considerations should be dismissed; perfect love should be displayed in the full devotion of all our powers and faculties to Jehovah and his service. God’s mercy and truth are at stake because Satan’s organization would hinder his mercy from coming to th« people and would prevent the spread of divine truth. But Jehovah will triumph over all opposition and will add the laurels of glory to his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 107:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In all the great deliverances recorded in the annals of Ged’s people, Jehovah comes to the fore as the great Emancipator, the great Champion of true freedom. What wonder then that it is written: “Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!” The sad condition of the “great multitude” is now becoming prominent. They have been divided in their love between Jehovah and the attractive things of Satan’s empire, and have contemned the Most High, who counseled them to render fulness of devotion and complete holiness to the Lord. Therefore they have been taken into bondage in Babylon, where they now sit in darkness and in the shadow of the second death, languishing in the foul cage of eeelesiastieism with every unclean bird for their companion. Is there none to help ? Ah, yes; Jehovah!</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Romans 11:</span><span class="font6">4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time that the Elijah feature of the church’s work passed and the Elisha work began, only a remnant were filled with such zeal for Jehovah that they were joyfully vulling to take up the new phase of the work and to respond to his call, saying: “Here am I; send me.” Those who volunteered for service Jehovah has reserved for himself to carry out his purposes before he overthrow the worship of Baal, the Devil, in the battle of Armageddon. This remnant refuses to bow the knee servilely to Baal or to receive the mark of the beast or the number of his name in either forehead or hand. Emboldened by love for the true God, they courageously stand erect amid Baal’s bowing worshipers and shout; “Jehovah, he is the God.” Who will be of the remnant? “If Jehovah be God, follow him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 30 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“He will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness/'—Romans 9:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HIS text is a quotation from the Prophet Isaiah. The prophecy had a miniature fulfilment upon fleshly Israel. It has a more important applica-cation to those of spiritual Israel. There was a remnant of fleshly Israel who were loyal to the Lord to the end. The Scriptures abundantly prove that only a remnant of the spirit-begotten ones will be entirely devoted to the Lord to the end. When dates were named, fixing the time that the church might be glorified, some were spurred on with greater zeal evidently because they hoped to get into the kingdom early. When no dates are named some become doubtful, negligent, and think it is time to lay up earthly treasures and go slowly with the work of the Lord. Thus they do. The Lord’s work is a righteous work; and when the due time comes for him to finish it with spiritual Israel he will finish it quickly; and those composing the remnant will be found to be the faithful ones. The promise is not to those who are faithful to a date; but “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">March 31</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Isaiah 59:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">World powers, commercial giants, scientists, philosophers, and ecclesiastics—all have put up their respective standards. By these the enemy Satan has come in like a flood, hoping to confuse the people and turn them in disgust away from Jehovah God. The cries of the people have come up to God, and he has commanded another standard to be raised. It is the standard of divine truth; and the spirit of Jehovah, poured out on all flesh since the Lord’s coming to his temple, causes his anointed ones to lift it aloft. The standard of the Lord serves to mark the rallying point for the people, and to define the way of righteousness and holiness through which the people must pass in order to be the recipients of the blessings which Jehovah has reserved for them that obey him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall roar from on high, . . . he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.—Jer. 25:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The treading of the wine press is a picture of the great battle of God Almighty against the Devil. It pictures the complete destruction of the enemy’s entire organization, and not merely the humiliation of false religious systems. The treading takes place during the period of the wrath of God; it is near at hand, because since 1918 the day of God’s wrath has come. It will be a time of tribulation such as mankind has never before known. Jehovah employs Jesus and his faithful following in the treading. Prophecy pictures the Lord as going into the winefat and with his feet treading out the grapes of the vine of the earth. The last members of the body of Christ on earth who remain faithful till death are designated as “the feet of him”, and therefore as a part of him they have a part to play. Jehovah roars from on high and shouts by having them as his witnesses to declare the day of his vengeance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.—Psalm 102:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I’d the foundation of Zion Jehovah laid his beloved Son, a precious stone. Before he laid him he tested and tried him; hence he is spoken of by the prophet as a tried stone. At Pentecost God began the selection of the other living stones to be God’s holy temple, the residence of the official family of God. Because Jesus and the other members of the temple class are the ruling factor in earth’s new government, the name Zion applies to them; and in a special sense therefore God began to build up Zion in 1914, when the new nation was born. In 1919 the ecclesiastical builders of Satan’s organization rejected Jehovah’s tried and precious stone. Nonetheless that stone maintains its position as the “head of the corner”; and‘ Satan’s henchmen are being overthrown that “glory to God in the highest” may result and thus Jehovah appear in his glory in Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.—Psalm 107:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The storm pictures Jehovah’s fight against the iniquitous empire of the Devil in the battle of Armageddon. Jehovah commands the fight to begin, and the Prophet David describes the tempestuous waves of trouble stirred up by the stormy wind that Jehovah raises up. In the deep distress that smites the nations they will discern the Lord; that is, they will see the manifestation of his power in the troublesome events. “Their soul is melted because of trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end.” This great tribulation will so humble the hearts of men that they will cry unto the Lord; and he will lift them up and establish peace, lasting peace, on earth. He will bring them to their desired haven, God’s kingdom ; and there “nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.—Proverbs 16:</span><span class="font6">4. The thought is that Jehovah has made and reserves all things for their own due time. He holds the times and seasons within the unyielding grasp of his own hand. Be assured that God could have imprisoned or destroyed the Devil at any time, but his Word discloses that it is Jehovah’s purpose to let the Evil One come to the full in his wicked course before he executes his final judgment against him. While he is doing this, the Lord permits others of his intelligent creatures either to follow the Devil in his wrongful course or to war against iniquity and follow righteousness and be classed as “the true”. The Lord’s people should therefore not fret because of those who prosper in their wicked ways. The day of evil for which Jehovah has reserved the wicked has come. Therefore his obedient ones should not hesitate to take the slaughter weapons and smite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.—Isaiah 51:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tins means that Jehovah has commissioned the members of the church on earth to deliver the message of new heavens and a new earth. This is the real duty </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">each one. Lest he fear, Jehovah gives to him the full assurance that his divine power is shielding and protecting each one of the faithful ones. As we visualize the powers of evil, we can with certainty know that Satan would wipe out the members of the church instantly if God would permit him so to do. But those who are hid within the shadow of Jehovah’s hand occupy a position of absolute security. When his work is accomplished and the record is written up, then Jehovah will point to those of Zion, that all the peoples of the earth may know who they are; and to these favored ones </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font6">will say: “Thou art my people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The counsel of the Lord standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.&quot;—Psalm S3:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE counsel of the Lord is synonymous with his plan or purpose. From the foundation of the world his plan was definitely made. God does not change. He says: “My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure: ... I have purposed it, I will also do it.” For this reason the creature can absolutely rely upon the promises of the Lord. When God makes a covenant with one whereby he promises to give him the divine nature God’s part of that covenant is absolutely certain. If the creature now performs his part of the covenant faithfully, he is certain to have an abundant entrance into the kingdom. The Scriptures define what the creature shall do in the performance of his covenant. (2 Peter 1:4-11) The Scriptures do not say that he is to develop a character, but that he is to work out his salvation by faithfully performing the work that God has given him to do. He must take his stand for the Lord and be God’s true and faithful witness. For that is the purpose of God concerning ths Christian at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The glory of the Lord shall endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works.—Psalm 10^: 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“His work is perfect.” When Jehovah had brought forth man in his image and had finished his preparatory work on earth, he beheld everything that he had made and rejoiced because it was good. When the work.of sin-atonement is consummated and all things in heaven and in earth have been gathered together in one under Christ, Jehovah will rejoice again. Honor and glory shall then crown man once more to the praise of Jehovah ! But exceeding the glory and brightness of all his works, the work in which he will rejoice most, will be the new creation, &quot;the precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold.” Giving us what is only a faint conception of the joy he will have in them, he addresses Zion, whom they represent, saying, “As the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, the Lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">him, and his work before him.—Isa. 62:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is responsible for the proclamation of the message of the King and his kingdom unto the ends of the earth and in this the time of the end of the world. It is by his command that this proclamation is made; and it is by his witnesses whom.he hath raised up and anointed with his spirit, and in whose mouths he hath put his words. They are ordained not only to be a prophet to the nations but also to comfort those that mourn in Zion, to strengthen the hands of their brethren in the work in Zion. This they do by announcing to them that the King is come, and by not ceasing to remind them that the King is here. He is come with great present rewards .for those who faithfully devote themselves to the work which is before him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It is the sacrifice of the Lord’s passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Exodus 12,:'27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The memorial of the Passover as celebrated by the Jews was not to glorify or eulogize primarily the lamb whose blood provided a covering for them from death, but was to exalt Jehovah, who provided the means of deliverance and who intervened in their behalf with a display of mighty power. Hence the purpose of the Passover and the demonstration of Jehovah’s power in conjunction with it was to glorify God and convince the people that Jehovah is the Almighty God, that there is none other besides him, and that all who receive his means of salvation and obey him are absolutely certain to receive the blessings he has promised. Likewise, in memorializing the sacrifice of out Passover Lamb, Christ Jesus, we should seek first of all to extol and honor Jehovah, giving thanks to him for providing a Lamb for our salvation and deliverance as well as that of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Uy Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">John 6:32,33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Except we eat this bread which Jehovah sent down from heaven we can never attain everlasting life. To “eat of this bread” is to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">man eats, and therefore absorbs, natural food through his mouth. He eats or absorbs spiritual food through his mind; and when he sets his affections upon that which he believes, he is said to believe with his heart. (Homans 10:10) The -world of mankind will have to eat this bread, that is, exercise belief in Jesus, during the reign of Christ, in order to get life under the terms of the new covenant. The members of the body of Christ also have to eat of this same bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And this day shall he unto you for a memorial;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">for in this selfsame day have 1 brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day.—Exodus 12: Ilf, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why should Jehovah command Israel to keep the Passover as a memorial each year ? Evidently that they might not forget that Jehovah is the Almighty God, their friend and benefactor, and the only source of life. Hence, in enjoining upon his disciples the keeping of the Memorial of his death Jesus followed the course that his heavenly Father took. He knew that the safety of all his followers depends upon faithfulness to Jehovah and to himself. Therefore he knew that if his disciples would keep constantly before their minds the reason why he, the Lamb of God, had died, and that this reason was that they might be delivered from Satan and live, then they would be better enabled to resist the Devil and stand firmly for Jehovah and his cause. The real purpose of the Memorial of Jesus’ death is the safety and welfare of his followers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vi'liat shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Psalm 116:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In view of Jehovah’s benefits to us, let us thankfully drink the cup which Jesus, his Son, offers to us. By inviting us to drink the Memorial wine Jesus was not simply inviting us to accept and believe on his blood as providing the price of redemption for ourselves and all mankind. He was also plainly inviting us to suffer death with him, because the wine symbolized his blood and drinking blood was punished among the Jews with the death penalty. That this was his meaning is supported by his statement: “Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.” In other words, only those who are broken with Christ will receive inherent life, immortality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“You however have remained with me amid my trials; and I covenant to give you, as my Father has covenanted to give me, a Kingdom—so that you shall eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom, and sit on thrones as judges over the twelve tribes of Isra</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">el.”—Luke 22: 29, SO, Weymouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font6"> COVENANT is a solemn promise to do a thing certain. God gave his solemn promise to his beloved Son that because of his faithfulness he should have a kingdom to rule and bless mankind. His faithfulness meant his death. Taking the cup of wine Jesus said to his disciples: “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured for you.” By that he meant that his blood provided the ransom, without the shedding of which blood no man can be saved. The disciples must receive the benefit of the ransom price. This they did receive at Pentecost, when they were justified and begotten of the holy spirit. By inviting his followers to partake of his cup, Jesus offers such who continue faithful the great privilege of being in the covenant and sharing with him in his kingdom. Therefore he said to his disciples: “I covenant with you for a kingdom, even as my Father has covenanted with me for a kingdom.” Those who die with Christ Jesus the sacrificial death shall live with him. Those who by faithful service suffer reproach that came upon him by reason of his faithfulness shall share with him in his glorious reign. This is one of the great works of Jehovah which is the result of complete unselfishness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Hood shall</span><span class="font6"> be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">io you for</span><span class="font6"> a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">token upon the houses where, ye are: and ivhen J see the Hood, I will pass Over you.—Exodus'. IS: 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The law covenant was made in Egypt between God on one side and Moses as a mediator for the people on the other side; and the blood testifying thereto was the blood of the Passover lamb, which blood also furnished a special protection to the first-borns. The new covenant was made on earth between Jehovah on one side and Christ Jesus as Mediator for the people on the other side, at the time of the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the wine the night before our Lord’s death. The blood testifying to this new covenant was the blood of Christ Jesus (Matthew 26:28), and it has furnished a special protection to the “church of the firstborn’’ throughout the Gospel Age. The Lord Jesus’ followers will be passed over and saved from the “second death” if they faithfully abide under the covering of that blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Examine me, 0 Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.—Psalm 36: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This should be the attitude of all the anointed ones toward Jehovah at Memorial time. For a person may claim to be copsecrated to Jehovah, and indeed be consecrated, and have a vision of the Devil’s organization and of God’s organization, and yet try to have fellowship -with both. But he cannot be faithful to Jehovah unless he refuses to lend his influence, sympathy and love to Satan’s organization, “Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and the table of devils.” Let aH the consecrated then submit themselves to examination in the light of Jehovah’s Word and see if they can truthfully say: “I have consecrated my life to the Lord. With me it is God first and all the time. Unreservedly </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">will support his cause. I delight to identify myself with his organization, of which Christ Jesus is the Head.” All who can may partake of the Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thou has multiplied the nation, thou hast increased their joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.—Isaiah 9: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the first Memorial supper Jesus said to his disciples • </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font6"> will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.” What did he mean ? The wine in the cup not only represented the blood of our Lord Jesus but it also symbolizes joy and good cheer as part of the potion that Jehovah God pours for the church. Hence drinking the wine with his faithful followers in the kingdom must refer to his sharing the joys of the kingdom with us. Now the nation has been bora, and Jesus began the exercise of his kingdom power in 1914. In 1918 he came to his temple. Verily then this is the time of the application of the scripture, “Let the saints be joyful in glory”; for now it is that the Lord in his temple bids his faithful servants to enter into the joys of their Lord. Has not Jehovah multiplied their joy at this time? And are they not already in a measure drinking of the cup of joy with Jesus? Surely!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power—1 Corinthians 6: Ilf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Blessed consolation! The mighty power of Jehovah which he demonstrated toward Christ Jesus when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, will save us out of death and raise us to life divine. The gates of hades shall not prevail against the members of God’s church in Christ. Standing face to face with death is the greatest of all ordeals. But if one can face it, fully assured of the fact that if he is faithful Jehovah will raise him up out of death to endless life, the ordeal loses its sting. If he can appreciate the further fact that his death and resurrection will result in vindicating the name of Jehovah God and be to the glory of God, then he can face the ordeal peacefully and with joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God giveth it a &quot;body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.—1 Corinthians 15:38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah in his manifold wisdom has given to each of the many, many seeds of the plant and vegetable kingdom a distinct and individual body. So has he prepared for each member of the divine family a body, “a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.” The divine family, the kingdom class, is begotten again, “not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abid-eth for ever.” As every creature must possess an organism, so must the kingdom class in the resurrectiou. When they have their part in the first resurrection, Jehovah will give them bodies, and they shall awake in the likeness of the Lord. It will please him to give them spiritual bodies, of the divine nature. &quot;What an incentive this prospect is to faithfulness in doing the will of God! What a supernal reward!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April .19</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech by us: we pray in Christ’s stead, Be ye reconciled to God.—■ 2 Corinthians 5: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah by his anointing has made us ambassadors for Christ, clothing us with a warrant of authority to represent the King and the interests of his kingdom. Our citizenship is in the heavenly kingdom. Our unqualified allegiance is to the King of kings and his kingdom of righteousness. It is therefore our duty and privilege joyfully to obey the commands of the King. Our message to the people is in effect, “Be ye reconciled to God.” What entreaty or earnest recommendation to the people could be more appropriate than this, seeing that the kingdom is already established, and the new covenant will soon be inaugurated through which the blessings of reconciliation with God will be thrown open to the people! Let us see to it that we do not receive in vain this grace of G od; that is, our honorable appointment as his ambassadors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The Lord saveth his anointed.&quot;—Psalm 20: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font6">T SEEMS probable that the occasion of this Psalm was the peril and deliverance of Jehoshaphat. (2 Chronicles 20) The enemy, in three divisions, was advancing upon Jehoshaphat. A prayer was sent up to God for help. The spirit of the Lord came upon a Levite, who delivered a message from God giving assurance of victory and complete deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now God’s anointed ones on earth see the hideous organization of the Devil and the day of Armageddon approaching. They discern the enemy in three divisions advancing. From the Word of God comes the full assurance that the Lord will preserve his anointed. Those who love the Lord will faithfully keep his commandments. Bearing witness that Jehovah is God, they will gladly declare the day of his vengeance and the time for the complete deliverance by and through his beloved Son the anointed King. “Oh love the Lord, all ye saints; for the Lord preserveth the faithful.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">She brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.—Rev. 12: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jehovah anointed Lucifer as the covering cherub to safeguard Adam and Eve, he began his organization with respect to mankind. But Satan plied his arts of temptation against the human pair and, like </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">dragon, swallowed them up within his power. Subsequently Jehovah organized Israel as his nation, but Satan eventually overreached that organization. Still later Jehovah began the true church. Apostates went out from the church and developed the ecclesiastical organization of Christendom; and Satan, the great Dragon, devoured them. In 1914 A. D. Zion, Jehovah’s true organization, gave birth to the ruling factor of the new world. Praise Jehovah that he has delivered it, the man child, from the voracious jaws and power of the vicious Dragon, Satan, and has enthroned it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">behold, the stone that I have laid before Joshua: upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts.—Zechariah 3: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The appellation “Joshua”, used alone, refers to the members of Christ’s body this side the vail w’ho have not yet proven themselves as overcomers; whereas the expression “Joshua the high priest” applies to the glorified Christ, the anointed King. In 1914 Jesus Christ, the glorified One, began operations against Satan in heaven and expelled him therefrom. In 1918 he came to his temple; and it was there that Jehovah laid The Stone before Joshua, the saints on earth. This Stone, the anointed King, is also called “the chief corner stone”. It is the angle stone by which all other stones of God’s temple must be measured, and all the approved ones must be engraved with the engraving like unto the chief stone. Seven is a symbol of completeness, and the seven eyes therefore symbolize the complete light of truth streaming upon the Lord, The Stone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thro-ugh God ive shall do valiantly, for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.—Psalm 60:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only in the strength of Jehovah shall anyone do valiantly. He it is that shall really tread down his and our enemies in the battle of Armageddon. Armageddon shall mark the use of God's wine-press for treading out the life-blood of the “vine of the earth” and its ripe grapes of wickedness. In just what manner Jehovah will do the treading is not yet revealed, but certain it is that the Lord himself will do the crushing. What part then in that great work is to be performed by the Lord’s remnant, yet on earth? God’s Word makes it clear that their part is to declare the day of God’s vengeance; to be witnesses that he is God; to sing forth his praises; to be unreservedly and whole-heartedly on his side; and to hold forth his standard for the people, that they may know which way to go. This the remnant does by constantly participating in the Lord’s service as opportunity may afford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God giveth to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy.—Ecclesiastes 2:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“There is one good, that is, God,” said Jesus. Jehovah God is goodness personified. Logically then his will and his commandments must be good. Hence those who are whole-heartedly devoted to Jehovah and who from sincere hearts are striving to do his will and and keep his commandments are good in the eyes of the Lord; they are engaged in doing good. True, their works are imperfect, but their hearts are perfect toward Jehovah as they busy themselves in that which is good in his sight. All others are classed as workers of iniquity and have Jehovah’s disapproval. To those who are good according to his standard Jehovah gives three essentials to their proper performance of his service: He gives them a knowledge of his good and holy will through his Word; he answers their prayers for wisdom as to how to perform; and he refreshes them with joy. which makes them happy in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: luild thou the walls of Jerusalem.—Psalm 51:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rebuilding of the wall round about Jerusalem by Nehemiah foreshadowed the work of the church in restoring and proclaiming the truth for a purpose, and seems specially to represent the work of the church from and after 1918. It is in reality, however, Jehovah who in his good pleasure builds the walls, because it is in his strength and by virtue of his favor and protection that the work is accomplished. A wall represents a protection to those inside. Therefore the holding forth of the truth, as foreshadowed by the rebuilding of the walls, serves as a protection to God’s people in Zion; also as a testimony that God has a people in the earth, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">testimony that vindicates the honor and dignity of God, a testimony that the present evil order is of Satan and must fall, and a testimony that Jehovah will have the victory and set up his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord looseth the prisoners.—Psalm lift: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord loves these prisoners despite the fact that their rebellion against the Most High and their slighting of the counsel of their true Friend, Jehovah, have brought them into the solitude of prison life in spiritual Babylon. He is moved by their groanings and cries for deliverance. He can force open the prison doors and release them. Even now he is sending messages of truth and deliverance through the very walls and doors of the prison by means of the all-penetrating radio waves. It is the advance notice of approaching deliverance. Seeing that Jehovah has anointed and preserved his servants, his elect, “to proclaim . . . the opening of the prison to them that are bound,” let us manifest our obedience to Jehovah and our love for our imprisoned spiritual brethren by hastening unto them with God’s message and bidding them to “go forth” and show themselves, unashamed, on the Lord’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">April 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“God . . . hath prepared for them a city” —Hebrews 11:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">G</span><span class="font6">OD is so completely unselfish that he always shows his appreciation of everything that is done to please him. His faithful creatures profit by this knowledge. In the outworking of his plan God honored certain men, among whom was Abraham, by giving them the privilege of being his witnesses. These men were imperfect, but they had an honest desire to see better conditions for mankind. They were in the world over which Satan presided as god; and yet they had no sympathy with that world. Their desire was for a government ruled over by the righteous One of heaven. They took their stand unreservedly on the side of God, and all manner of persecution failed to move them from their course. Because of their faithfulness God was not ashamed to be called their God; and in further recognition of their devotion to righteousness he provided that their citizenship shall be in the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness, which new earth will be presided over by the new heaven, of which Christ is the Head. The devoted followers of Jesus Christ, who now continue to faithfully represent the Lord to the end, will be granted the privilege of associating with Christ Jesus in that glorious heaven and of aiding in directing the civic affairs of the new earth, wherein will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">the ancient worthies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, 1 will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant.—Malachi 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The promise was that Jehovah would send a deputy or ambassador, clothed with full power and authority to act </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font6">him. The coming of the Adonai, the Messenger of the Abrahamic Covenant, to the temple class is not an imaginary thing; it is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">fact, positively and emphatically stated in the Scriptures, and fully corroborated by the physical facts since 1918. Jehovah states that his Messenger will prepare “the way” before him. A way means </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> course to be pursued or a mode of action; and here it clearly seems to mean “the way” which Jehovah has prepared for men to get life, whether upon the spirit plane or the human plane. The preparing of the way must refer first to the preparation of the church since 1874, and later to the way for all the people who will come into harmony with Gfod.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchman wakefh but in vain.—Psalm 127:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is Jehovah that builds the house; otherwise the efforts of all those laboring in God’s cause would be vainly spent. The time has now come for him to build the house, the temple, both by resurrecting the sleeping saints and by further preparing the temple stones which are still in the quarries of earth. The time having come for the work, the temple must be reared; and it is being reared. The Lord has come to his temple class, and those who refuse to conform to his plan of work or who in self-conceit choose to work independently of his organization are cleared out. Happy are they who think soberly. They realize that they are not necessary, but that the Lord has favored them with an opportunity to serve in his cause and by this course to prove their fealty, obedience and loving devotion to him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Z </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts.—Haggai 2:</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the Lord of hosts.” This is a promise that the glory with which Jehovah shall fill the antitypieal temple shall far outshine the glory of the typical temples, not even excluding Solomon’s temple, which is estimated to have cost eighty-seven thousand million dollars or more. What a transporting prospect of glory, honor, and immortality rises before the church’s vision! How it spurs her on to patient continuance in the Lord’s service! The present shaking of the nations but assures her that the glorification is nigh at hand. Even now the glory of the Lord has risen upon his temple class in the earth. Lo, it stands effulgent with the glorious light of the kingdom message, streaming from it to the peoples in darkness. “Happy Zion, what a blessed lot is thine!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">let the nations be glad, and sing for joy; for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.—Psalm 67:4,</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark163"></a><span class="font6">Jehovah will be the Governor. The dominion, the rule or power of the kingdom, will reside in him. To govern means not only to rule but primarily to guide and thus to control. AU this Jehovah will do. He will open the highway to life, and use the Christ as the faithful Guide to direct mankind’s steps in the way of holiness that they might ascend the highway and unerringly reach the glorious goal, life eternal. Throughout all their wayfaring up this highway to life, they shall receive righteous judgment and shall learn righteousness at the hands of him whom Jehovah has ordained to judge the world in righteousness. This hope should be cause for unbounded joy on the part of the people. Let us create this hope in their hearts by telling them the Lord’s message that their joy may begin now, and that they may sing unto the Lord for gladness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">even in him.—Ephesians 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s plan, as revealed to man, is that God has appointed his beloved Son to be King; that he has made him the chief corner and foundation of his organization Zion; that in due time he is presented as earth’s rightful King; that although rejected by all, God completely establishes his organization, which brings righteousness to the earth; that when the work of restoration of man is completed, every creature who is obedient to God will be granted everlasting life and will joyfully support and render homage to the great King. When Jehovah’s plan is fully accomplished and all creatures in heaven and in earth are gathered under one Head, Christ Jesus, and all are through him subject to the Father, then all things will be to the glory of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.—Psa. h.5:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For many centuries Satan and his angels have constituted the heavens of the evil world, and mankind organized into forms of government under Satan’s suzerainty have constituted the earth. Satan’s earthly princelings have comprised the commercial, political and ecclesiastical elements. But now we are hasting unto a new heavens and a new earth. Satan and his angels have already been deposed from their erstwhile heavenly position, but they still exercise their baneful influence as heavenly powers over mankind. Yet their time is short. Preparations are now moving rapidly forward for the great and final conflict, in which the old world will be utterly destroyed and new heavens and a new earth be established. In the new earth Jehovah’s appointment is that all the martyrs, of whom Satan’s world was not worthy, the faithful ones from Abel to John the Baptist, shall be the princes. They shall be the children of the Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“He hath made his wonderful works to he remembered.&quot; —Psalm 111: If.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE works of Jehovah are wonderful, and marvelous in our eyes. They stand as memorials to the wisdom and loving kindness of our God. Among these memorial works may be noted the sending of Joseph into Egypt and his experiences there; the institution of the Passover; the deliverance of Israel from Egypt and the giving of the law at Mount Sinai; the atonement day sacrifices and the blessing of the people that followed. All these things foreshadowed greater things to come and to stand as memorials to keep the mind of the creature fixed upon Jehovah. Offering his beloved Son as a great sacrifice for sin, he caused this wonderful work to be kept as a memorial by the church until the coming again of the anointed One; and for ever thereafter that great sacrifice will stand as an eternal monument to the love of Jehovah and of his dear Son. It is the will of God that his creatures shall keep these marvelous works in mind and from them learn to likewise wholly devote themselves to the cause of righteousness, learn concerning these wonderful works, and help others to understand them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy spirit.—Titus 3: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our own righteousnesses are but as filthy rags; they are not fit as a covering for our naturally undone condition before the eyes of Jehovah. By our own works we can never be justified in his sight. Jehovah well understood this; and in his mercy he provided for our salvation from death, arranging for us to be washed in the blood of his dear Son that thus we might be presented before him as regenerated human beings deserving of the right to live on earth. But over and above this mercy Jehovah has shown us greater favor by accepting us for sacrifice with Jesus and begetting us by his spirit and in this manner renewing us, making us new creatures in Christ. Can we keep silent in view of such grace? No!</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you.—1 Thessalonians 3:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah sheds abroad his love into our hearts by his spirit which he imparts to us. The more we have of his spirit the more we increase in love of the brethren. This will mean that we will unselfishly consider the interest of our brethren. Knowing that they also have made a covenant with the Lord by sacrifice, we will be anxious to see them perform their part of the covenant, that they too may have an entrance into the kingdom. We will earnestly beseech our brethren to render their “reasonable service” unto the Lord. (Romans 12:1) We will not be anxious to enjoy some honor at the expense of our brethren, but will rather in honor prefer one another. There will exist a real family feeling as becomes members of the household of God; and as such we shall fight shoulder to shoulder, safeguarding each other’s interests, “fighting for [our] brethren,” and always contending for the gospel of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed be the Lord my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.—Psa.</span><span class="font6"> 744'</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1-</span><span class="font6">The hand is a symbol of active power. Jehovah has placed certain powers, duties, and obligations in the hands of his people; hence there is a responsibility upon them to use the same. There is no allowance for slacking the hand, oi’ for failing to use oui* smallest powers, as pictured by the fingers, in the conflict now raging. The Lord has given his “young men” who are endowed with vision, a searching insight into the Devil’s organization and warned them earnestly of the maliciousness of the Dragon, the Devil, who now wars against those who keep Jehovah’s commandments. The war is on; the Lord is pressing the battle to the gates of the enemy. Those of the Lord’s army </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font6"> fight; the enemy must not be spared. No consecrated Christian can afford to yield to fear and withdraw from the active front and remain -silent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another, according to Christ Jesus.—Bomans 15:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is a God of patience. During all the centuries during which reproaches have been cast upon him and his he has borne up forbcaringly and has steadfastly and zealously pursued his holy and righteous plans, allotting sufficient time for all his good purposes to ripen. He is now granting time to his remnant on earth to display the like calibre of mind, patience, in his service. Patience means constancy in the performance of duty, enduring hardship as a good soldier, and doing so with inward joy, knowing that a right course is being pursued which is pleasing to God. The faithful Christian never becomes impatient with serving the Lord by trying to run ahead of the Lord or by quitting the service because his expectations are not realized when he wants them. He is certain that Jehovah is not unfaithful to forget what he is doing, but will keep his every promise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">0 send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.—Psalm J/3: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the coining of the Lord to his temple and the opening of the temple of God in heaven, there have been flashes of lightning; that is to say, intermittent illuminations of the Word of God, giving further glimpses of truth in his great plan. These flashes of light do not emanate from any member of the temple class, but from the Lord. It is Jehovah who is sending out </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font6"> light and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font6"> truth, and at the critical time for the church. The church, who had expected to go home in 1914 and whose soul was inclined to be cast down and disquieted within her, was puzzled temporarily as to why the Lord stopped the war and left her still on earth. Responding to her prayer for leading, Jehovah has indeed sent out the needed light and truth to show which is the way unto his holy hill of Zion, the heavenly kingdom. And now, praising Jehovah, her exceeding joy, on the harp, she joyfully goes to his altar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">May 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The works of his hands are verity and judgment: all his commandments are sure.—Psalm 111:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The hands of Jehovah are always busied with truth and judgment. His works, which will accomplish the redemption of mankind and the deliverance of the church, are verity; that is, they are in full harmony with, and in fulfilment of, his Word, which is truth. He backs up his truth with works so that his Word comes true and does not return unto him void. Surely as we scan all his works in our behalf we can testify: “There hath not failed one word of all his good promise.” Additionally, all his works are judgment; that is, they are in absolute accord with Jehovah’s sound judgment and they never err or diverge from strict righteousness. “The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.” Summing up the consistent testimony of Jehovah’s works we can say: “Holy and reverend is his name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">May 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Jehovah is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed”—1 Samuel 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE Prophetess Hannah gave utterance to these words. They may be taken as stating a great truth; to wit, that God has a clear perception of all truth and that he measures and tests his creatures according to their actions. As a man thinks, so is he. His course of action indicates what is the operation of his mind. God knows every secret thought and knows that these often govern the actions of his creatures. If one really loves the Lord God he will wholly devote himself to the Lord. Hannah loved Jehovah and served him. She consecrated her son to the Lord before his birth, and at a tender age put him into the Lord's service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here is an example for all consecrated parents. The new creature in Christ should be wholly devoted to the Lord and should devote all he has to the Lord, which includes his infants, if he has any. The kingdom of heaven is here. Teach the little ones to devote themselves to the King and his kingdom. By your actions God will weigh you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ezekiel 16:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are to remember whatever comeliness we have as Christians is of the Lord Jehovah. He has bestowed it upon us; and we should use it, not for self-gratification, but to his praise. He has made us acceptable and comely in his beloved One, Christ Jesus. In that One alone we stand complete. We have no natural beauty to trust in before the Lord’s eyes, nor should we become heady over any spiritual grace that we possess or think we possess. What makes us really comely in the Lord’s sight is our obedience to his commands, as a result of which we are perfected in love and conformed unto the image of Christ, the “altogether lovely” One. Gazing upon his faithful witnesses in the earth today, Jehovah through his prophet exclaims: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet-of him that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings!” God’s message </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">as they teld it forth</span><span class="font6"> makes them beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">May 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.—Psalm 121:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All who are in Christ Jesus and who diligently strive to keep themselves in the love of God, who with all their keeping keep their hearts pure, who trust in the Lord with all their heart and lean not to their own understanding, who in all their ways acknowledge him—these he will keep. All the powers of the evil one and his agencies cannot separate them from the love of God and cannot pluck them out of his hand. Slumberihg never, he is not off guard for a moment. What a greatGod we have! What an invulnerable fortress! Here We may dwell in peace, confident that as long as we strive to do our part in keeping our covenant of sacrifice and rendering our reasonable service we are sure </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Jehovah’s': favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">May 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall 1 talk of thy wondrous works.—Psa. 119: ST.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Are any bewildered at the great changes which have come into the life of the church since 1918? Are they still in doubt as to what is the way of his precepts, what course of action Jehovah commands? Let them diligently hearken unto the Word of the Lord; lek them take heed unto the great signs from heaven, the great events in church and world which are ordered from heaven and which speak louder than words, testifying that the kingdom of God is at the door. By thus looking unto the Lord and the manifestation of his power, they will be guided by his spirit aright. For Jehovah has not failed to make his church understand which way he commands them now to go. Having given them the clear proof that the kingdom is at hand and that the King is here, he now gives them to understand that their business is not to keep silence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">May 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.—Psalm 33:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This statement of truth was written by one of God’s people who had only earthly hopes. What a blessed word of consolation it is for us to pass along to those engulfed in the present distress of the world! Mourning fills the earth; and in their trepidation many who are meek and many who are poor know not which way they may turn or what they may do and on whom they may hope and why. To them God seems to have covered himself with a cloud that their prayers pass not through. It is our noble and ennobling privilege to assure them that Jehovah is gracious; that he will consider them favorably who reverence him, and that such may hope in his mercy through the time of trouble. It may be that amid the destructions of Armageddon he will deliver their soul from death and spare them to be among those millions now living who will never die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.— Psalm IJiS: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each one who has Jehovah as his God, and who has his good spirit, the spirit of love, abiding in him, delights to do the will of God and to keep his commandments, He will pray that his heavenly Father will teach him his will that he may do it joyfully. True to faith, the Lord is leading his teachable ones in the course of uprightness; he is not leaving them to the mercies of misleading teachers. He leaves no ambiguity or uncertainty about His commands laid upon his people today. He has given them a clearer vision of his purposes and made clearer his will. Obedience thereto is now imperative. The responsibility attaching to the office of the anointed cannot be evaded by any kind of reasoning or sophistry. Each anointed one is being put to the test.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">May 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that 1 should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: ... he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.—Isaiah 50:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our vocal powers, out powers of expressing thought to others, are gifts from Jehovah. In view of having consecrated our all to him, it is eminently proper that we use these powers to glorify Jehovah. Using our tongues slanderously, or in backbiting and gossiping, is not in harmony with our consecration. It is dishonoring to the Lord and not in accord with the learning which he has given us through his Word. He has made us responsible for our tongues, because their power can be used either for or against the kingdom interests. He has wakened our ears to the kingdom message and has made us learned in the things of the kingdom, for what purpose ? That we might use our tongues and other powers in comforting all that mourn and in strengthening the brethren who might be growing weary.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Jehovah at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.&quot;—Psalm 110:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">C</span><span class="font6">HRIST JESUS, the Priest and Executive Officer of the Most High God, is here shown going into action against the Devil and all of his representatives and rulers on the earth. Jehovah God is the great King’s right-hand support. It is the day of Jehovah’s wrath and the great battle of God Almighty. He uses Christ as his field marshal to lead the fight. Fully equipped for war with his sword upon his thigh, clothed with dignity and majesty, he rides prosperously to certain victory. His faithful followers in heaven and earth support him, doing their bit. The part to be performed by those on earth is to sing the praises of God and his anointed One just before and while the battle is on. The forces are marching to that happy day when God, through Christ, will strike through and defeat the enemy. The temple class now begins the glad song of deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In that day will 1 raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof: and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old.—Amos 9:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The tabernacle of David symbolizes the reigning house or family of David. Jehovah determined upon this royal line, as it is- written: “Moreover, he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim; but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion, which he loved.” In 606 B. C., the reigning house of David fell; its tabernacle collapsed when Jehovah overturned the kingdom. But Jehovah had promised that a man should never fail from the throne of David. With the coming of Jesus, who was of the line of David, and with his anointing as the Messiah, Jehovah gave to him the right to the kingdom; and there he began to restore and raise up the fallen tabernacle of David. Throughout the Gospel Age Jehovah has been in process of raising it up by the selection of the body members of the Christ, who should reign with Jesus. In 1914 Jehovah established the throne in mercy; and the King now sits upon it in the tabernacle of David, judging.—Isaiah 16: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">May 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He giveth power to the faint; and io them that have no might he increaseth strength.—Isaiah Jf0:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, faint-eth not, neither is weary.” In him is everlasting strength. His work goes on unceasingly. When the afflictions of the World War had made the church faint and they seemed no longer to have might, Jehovah gave power and strength to them that they might keep up with his work and finish the work he has given us to do. Youths may faint and grow weary despite their physical vigor, and the young men may utterly fail, and no one can rely on the strength of arm. “But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles.” Jehovah never proves unreliable. In him alone can we truly be strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bebulce the company of spearmen, . . . scatter thou the people that delight- in war.-—Psalm 68:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The earth has shaken in all ages with the rumblings of the wars provoked by the Devil’s servants; who have delight in pitting their fellow men against one another in battle. As a consequence, the. wealth of nations has been wasted, the sorrows of those who were forced to provide the men for battle have been multiplied, and the burdens and debts of the people have been increased. The clergy have sanctified war in cowardly servility to the state, and the true church has suffered. The Christians are for peace; yet when they speak Jehovah’s message, the dupes of Satan are for war and fight against them. The day of reverses for the enemies of God and mankind is at hand. In the battle of the great day of God Almighty a sharp rebuke shall be administered to them, and they shall be scattered. Then peace shall unfurl her banner without fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">May 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. . . . And the Lord spaice unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Jonah 1:17; 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is able to take care of any contingency in order that the witness to his name shall be given. He is able to preserve his witnesses in a most miraculous manner, that the work assigned to them might be effected. He is able to overrule also the disobedience of those who grow fearful or who doubt the Lord’s message and who shrink from exposing themselves as witnesses in a hostile world. Even the gates of hell cannot prevail against Jehovah’s true servants. The adversary schemed to bring about Jesus’ death; and when that One lay prone in the tomb Satan imagined that he had for ever silenced Jehovah’s greatest Witness. But in vain! On the third day Jehovah brought Jesus’ soul up out of hell and showed him unto faithful disciples who should be God’s witnesses unto the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth.—Isa. 23:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth. . . . For the Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it?” The time has arrived for the accomplishment of his purpose to dissolve the glory of earth and humble pride in it. Jehovah alone shall be exalted in this day. The new nation was born in 1914; and the fulfilment of the angels’ prophetic anthem must go into effect: “Glory to God in the highest.” Jehovah’s cause has been dishonored by those whom the world considers honorable; but now the contemptible course of these honored servants of Satan is being exposed, and the honorable name of Jehovah rises more and more into prominence. Seeing then that this is Jehovah’s purpose, let us by his grace resist present temptations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">May 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Of the people there was none with me; for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury.—Isaiah 63:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jehovah says: “Of the people there was none with me,” it proves that no religious system on earth will be supporting Jehovah in his battle to overthrow the Devil’s organization; because the religious systems are now a part of that enemy organization. Christ Jesus will be Jehovah’s Chief Executive in treading the vine of the earth. Of all the people of earth who profess to be followers of Christ, none are in fact with him except those whom he counts as a part of himself, as his body members, because of their faithfulness. It follows that none now on earth, regardless of what he may have heretofore done in the name of the Lord, can be counted in as a part of the Lord, the Christ, unless he is with the Lord, actively supporting him in the fight against Satan’s organization. He could not include any of those </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">present truth or other professed Christians who </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">any wise compromise with the Devil’s organization </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font6">sympathize with it. Are you in the Lord’s ranks ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">May 25 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;God . . . hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope.”—2 Thessalonians 2:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HIS text applied to the church throughout the age, but with stronger force it applies now. The darkness of the long night is lifting, and the light is shining into the minds and hearts of God’s people as never before, because the day is at hand. The Lord is in his holy temple; and the test of the temple class must of necessity continue until the end. The members of the temple class are admonished to stand fast, tenaciously holding to the law of God, which is his will concerning them which they have learned by the unfolding of his plan. Christ Jesus has begun his reign. The saints now abiding under the robe of righteousness are given everlasting consolation and great hope, looking forward with confidence to the happy time when they shall see Jehovah and the mighty King face to face. The a</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">iim</span><span class="font6">nni. tion to the saints now is: “Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.” These faithful ones will constantly feed upon the Word and joyfully engage in the Lord’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.—Psalm 97:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah reigns; for he has set his anointed One, his Son, as King upon his holy hill of Zion. The Lord would have all the peoples of earth rejoice over this auspicious fact; especially would he have “the multitude </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">isles” rejoice, that is, the “great multitude” who shall yet wash their robes and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. But “clouds and darkness are round about him”, and the world is in the gloom of the greatest crisis of all time and complete collapse is approaching. What shall the Christian do whose eyes of faith perceive that the reign of the Lord has begun? Eejoice to himself? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">No; </span><span class="font6">but let him point the people to the fact that Michael, the great Prince of Peace, has stood up and will bring to the people the desire of their hearts;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">May 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations; and with thee will 1 destroy kingdoms.—Jer. 51:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus is the Head of Zion; and Jehovah will actually employ him as his war-club, as his great Executive, Melchizedek, in breaking to pieces and destroying the nations and kingdoms of Satan’s world system. The Lord’s followers, a remnant, this side the vail, do not use violent means in their warfare under Jehovah’s standard; nevertheless the Lord has given them a measure of “power [authority] over the nations” in furnishing them with challenges, warnings, indictments, and testimonies embodied in resolutions to be circulated among the nations. These fall like a storm of hail upon rulers and ruled; and while they do not break nations and kingdoms to pieces, yet it is to be hoped that they serve to break up and destroy the faith and reliance of many of the governors as well as the governed upon the nations and kingdoms of Satan’s organization. What we cannot do Jehovah will do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Come, 'behold the vjorlcs of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth. He malceth wars to cease unto the end of the earth.—Psalm 46:8,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To the League of Nations or any human organization for the promotion of international peace will not go the credit of outlawing, abolishing and suppressing wars in the earth. To the Lord Jehovah alone will go the glory of this grand achievement. But first must come his feaf-ful works of desolation in the earth. No power asid$ from Jehovah’s can now avert Armageddon, and he will not use his power to avert it. The Devil’s organization must fall to make way for the kingdom of righteousness j his war-machine must be desolated. Then, the Prince of Peace in charge and with the government resting upon his shoulder, there shall be an end of war but nd end of peace. Then shall the people be led forth with peace, and they shall rejoice and be glad.—Isa. 55:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">May 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined. —Psalm 50: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This prophecy is now in course of fulfilment. God has not shined out of nominal Christendom. On the contrary nominal Christendom has defamed his holy name, and pushed him into a corner, and made him appear in a bad light. But now the new government has been born from the womb of the morning, and has come forth with the dew or freshness of youth and vigor, and is shining to the glory of God. Ah, yes; out of the true Zion Jehovah is shining, because his organization is praising his holy name and is testifying that he is the true and only God. Never was such a privilege granted before to beings on earth. Now as never previously ia the time for God’s saints on earth to let their light shine that men might see their good and faithful work of witnessing, and glorify God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Remember me, 0 my God, for good.—Nehemiah IS: SI.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God remembers. He is not unrighteous to forget any work of love or service of faith. It is not inappropriate when we go to the Lord in prayer to ask him to remember some of the things that we have done to his praise, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">did Nehemiah, especially when the enemy opposes and the way is fraught with difficulties, and when the best </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font6">can do is to leave our judgment with the Lord. Nehemiah prayed for service. He prayed that he might win favor in order to get to go to Jerusalem and rebuild the ruined walls. The members of the church now are building, and in bringing the truth to the people should pray for wider opportunities of service. God will remember them for what good they have done and in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">good way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">May 31</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hany nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.—Micah</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4 •</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While Satan, the enemy of God and righteousness, still exercises his power over men, it is impossible to teach all people the truth. Only those who have a desire for a better and happier condition will heed the message. When Satan is restrained and shorn of his power </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">deceive the people, then the message of the truth will freely flow and be received with welcome by the millions </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">earth. Jehovah will use the great Prophet and Priest whose lips have kept knowledge, to teach the people his way of holiness; and the people shall seek the law at his mouth and speedily learn righteousness and walk in the paths that Jehovah has opened for them to attain life. At this time it is our privilege to carry the Lord’s message to the teachable ones of earth, that they may see in advance the way that Jehovah has prepared in their behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;1 meditate on all thy works; I muse on the works of thy hand.”—Psalm 14-3:5.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark164"></a><span class="font12">B</span><span class="font6">EING persecuted by Saul his enemy, David hid himself among the rocks. There he prayed God that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font6">might be rescued from his foes. Being acquainted with what God through Moses had written concerning his works David, while there alone, meditated upon those mighty works and soliloquized concerning the same. He talked to himself about them and thus gained courage and strength. David represented the church hard pressed by the enemy Satan, whom Saul represented. The Devil is making a desperate attempt to destroy those who keep God’s commandments. These constitute the remnant, and they gain courage and strength while they meditate upon the mighty works of Jehovah. Seeing some of the marvelous things he has accomplished in Christ, the saints have full assurance of faith that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font6">in his due time will deliver all those who love and serve him faithfully to the end. These can truly say: Seeing God loved us so much as to perform the great ransom work, surely since we have become his sons he loves us more and will love us to the end if we are faithful to him. We will meditate upon his wondrous works, which constantly re</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font6">d us of his power and willingness </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to bring to us full deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hear, dll ye people; hearken, 0 earth, and dll that therein is: and let the Lord God be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.—Micah 1:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has sent his deputy, “the messenger of the covenant”; and now he sits upon his throne of judgment, in the temple, in the house of God. Those who are loyal in action as well as in heart abide the day of the messenger’s coming-, but all others are cleared out of the temple as they fall under the judgment tests. However, the Scriptures indicate that the judgment would extend to others than the spiritual “sons of Levi”; namely, to those of nominal Christendom and their allies. Evidences prove that Christendom did not stand the test but completely repudiated Christ’s kingdom, and has been rejected by Jehovah. It follows that the time is come to let the people hear the judgment of the Lord. Appropriately the declaration of God’s vengeance is proceeding out from or through the temple class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.—Isaiah 60:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The earth will be the place of God’s sanctuary during the Millennium; for then it shall be said: “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.” Jehovah’s sanctuary or tabernacle is his great mediatorial body, the Christ, through whom mankind will have access to God and be reconciled to him. The presence of Jehovah’s sanctuary will make the earth the place of his feet, and there men shall worship at his footstool. He will therefore make the earth beautiful, glorifying it with Edenic beauties. The glory and grandeur of Lebanon’s forests of evergreen trees will be given unto it. Yea, the willing and obedient of mankind shall be planted in the earth and grow up as everliving trees to the glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage Q He retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.—Micah 7:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The blessings of Jehovah are poured out upon </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font6">creatures. They are bestowed so lavishly that they can be said to be multiplied. God is the fountain from which flow multiplied mercies, like the waters of a peaceful river. The center and channel of God’s mercy is Jesus. It is particularly made manifest during the Gospel Age toward those who make a covenant with him by sacrifice and diligently strive to keep that covenant. And in these days he has shown special mercy to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">remnant of his heritage in passing by whatever </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">may </span><span class="font6">have been their transgressions during their trials of 1918 and 1919, and has mercifully favored them with the blessed Elisha work. All who will finally enter into the kingdom must imitate Jehovah as to mercy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles.—Isaiah 1$: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Never were the opportunities of the church to exercise herself in her calling greater than now! The Lord has kept his servant class, his elect, unto this very hour and opportunity. Gross darkness blankets the people’s understanding of Jehovah and his plans for human welfare, but Jehovah has preserved us to be light unto the people. This means that our mission and responsibility is to let the light of God’s kingdom message shine unto all the Gentile nations. Jehovah has manifold blessings to bestow upon mankind through his kingdom) and that the people might have a surety, token, or covenant by which to know that the kingdom is begun and the blessings are about to flow forth he has given </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font6">covenant-people, his faithful remnant, to preach the sacred Word and promise to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.—Joel 2:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Pouring out means a libation, a gushing out or shedding forth. The spirit is the invisible power which Jehovah exercises toward his saints to accomplish his purposes. He pours it out on no one unless that one is willingly in heart harmony with God. He must have an honest, sincere desire to do God’s will. As at Pentecost, so since the coming of the Lord to his temple in 1918, Jehovah is not now limiting his spirit to a few, for we have reached the last days spoken of. The tremendous work of the Elisha class must be accomplished. Those who are “young men” in spirit and determination must &quot;see visions” in order to be inspired onward; and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">&quot;double portion” of the spirit of the Lord must needs embolden them and energize and nerve their faculties to the great work that is to be done before the end comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.—Romans 11: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Addressing Israel as the natural seed of Abraham before whom lay the opportunity to become the heavenly blessers of all the families of the earth, Jeremiah said: “The Lord called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit.” After Pentecost only a remnant of the Jews retained their position as branches in this tree, which symbolized heavenly kingdom blessings and opportunities. The vast majority of the tree’s natural branches were broken off at the close of the seventy symbolic weeks of exclusive favor to the Jews in A. D. 80. Jehovah spared them not because they failed to meet the test of faith and obedience. Let us, who have been grafted into the olive tree, take heed to our ways. God is unchanged. The Lord is in his holy temple. The judgement is on. What we were and have done in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">past </span><span class="font6">does not count now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.”—Hebrews 5:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">H</span><span class="font6">E WHO filled the office of the Levitical priesthood must be born of the tribe of Levi; hence he had father and mother. (Exo. 2:1; Num. 16:10;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">17: 3; 18:1) In contrast Jehovah appointed Melchizedek as his high priest without regard to parentage. This priesthood was “without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life”. (Hebrews 7:3) Melchizedek was a type, and was designated or called by the name of “priest of the most high God”. Priest means chief executive or principal officer. Melchizedek was therefore typical of God’s principal officer, the Logos, the anointed Jesus, and Jesus Christ in glory. The Logos was the beginning of God’s creation, and there is no record of the time of that creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The beloved Son has always been the chief or principal executive of Jehovah in carrying out his plan. He is called of God by the title of “priest after the order of Melchizedek”. His work is not confined to the Millennial Age, but he has always been and ever will be Priest or Chief Officer of Jehovah. Therefore there is a priesthood without parentage, without descendants, without beginning of time or ending thereof. This is one of the marvelous works of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.—Psalm 89:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mankind apparently have not yet come to realize that there is no help in themselves. But Jehovah has perceived from the very beginning that none of them could by any means give to God a ransom for his brother. Therefore he laid help on One who was mighty to prevail above sin, and who was mighty in his love for God to the point of being obedient even to the death of the cross. The Lord hath highly exalted this One who once was man among the people, yet holy and separate from sinners. Him he has made King of kings and Lord of lords. He has laid for man’s help all power in heaven and in earth upon that One and has made him “the mighty God”. Ye holy ones, advertise this Mighty One.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the Lord’s.—Obadiah 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Gentile kings have had their day, and now the kingdom over earth is the Lord’s. The mount of Esau represents the Devil’s organization, -which is impregnated with the selfish spirit of Satan and the profane disposition of Esau to sell his birthright for the pottage that the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life craved. This organization, particularly its ecclesiastical element, is noted for its violence to the Lord’s true people; in the day of assault on God’s organization it stood on the other side. (Obad. 10:11) The judgment of the mount of Esau is at present in progress. Jehovah has set his anointed One on his holy hill of Zion. He is the Savior of mankind. With him are the saints who slept, but who are now risen and acting in the capacity of saviors with him. On earth the saints who seek to ascend into the hill of the Lord are engaged in pronouncing the Lord’s judgment against Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, 1 will gather them out of all countries whither I have driven them in mine anger, . . . and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely.—Jer. 32:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Behold Jehovah now bringing his Word to pass and gathering the Jews at the rate of thousands monthly to Palestine. In consequence of their iniquity in rejecting the divine Word ancl also him of whom that Word testified, Jehovah’s anger has caused them to be dispersed far and wide among the Gentiles, debarred from residence in their beloved land. But their warfare and their appointed time were accomplished by 1878 A. D.; for by then Israel’s double of disfavor from the Lord ended. They shall be planted anew in the land, never to be uprooted again but to dwell safely. These facts mark the present as the time to speak comfortably unto Jerusalem. Wherefore, 0 thou that bringest good tidings unto Jerusalem, “lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God.” —Isaiah 40:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the Lord, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.—Zephaniah 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah hath taken away the church’s judgment, having clothed her with the robe of righteousness in manifestation of his approval. He hath cast out of heaven her great enemy, the accuser of the brethren; and he himself, as represented in his Messenger who has come to his temple, is amongst his people. Special protection from evil is promised to them while engaged in his work. The enemy, though cast out, is not yet bound. He is desperately fighting to maintain his empire, but the victorious Lord is majestically marching against him. Behold, the “Faithful and True” leading his army to certain victory 1 Ye soldiers of the cross, yield not to the seductive wiles of the Devil. With armor girded on and with the sword of the spirit, march on to certain triumph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">He </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke.—Isaiah 59:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The accoutrements of Jehovah as he wages a victorious warfare against the adversary and his auxiliary forces picture those qualities which identify and distinguish Jehovah in battle. He presents a clean or righteous breast to the eyes of all; he has righteous motives and causes for carrying out his destructive program against Satan’s organization. He has in mind the salvation of his remnant and all those for whom his Son died. He comes arrayed in the capacity of an Avenger: the day of vengeance is in his heart. Zeal as a cloak marks him in all his activities. All those who take their stand on the Lord’s side should take their clue from this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I the Lord will be their God, and my servant David </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">prince among them; 1 the Lord have spoken it. And</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land..—Ezekiel 31: Zj., 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time will come when Jehovah will establish peace amongst all the peoples of earth who will trust him. He made a covenant with the Israelites at Mount Sinai, and in that covenant he promised to keep them in safety and in peace. He said: “And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid the evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.” The Israelites violated that covenant; but God will make </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">new covenant with the house of Israel, through David, his beloved One, the Prince of Peace. Israel and all mankind shall turn to Jehovah as their God, and he in turn will bless them. He will rid the earth of all that have ravaged and preyed upon the human race; and even the beasts shall be at peace among themselves and with man. Oh the glad times coming I “Tell the whole world </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">these </span><span class="font6">blessed tidings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;jffe </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.”—Psalm 107: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE true Christians, although being in the world, find no abiding place there. Their citizenship is in heaven because their affairs are directed from on high. For a long while these true saints were held in captivity to the Babylonish systems. That was a wilderness condition. God’s due time came to gather together unto him those who had made a covenant with him. (Psalm 50:5) These saints, hungered and famished for truth and for sweet fellowship with others of like precious faith, cried unto the Lord, who heard their cry. He then led them forth out of captivity that they might journey to the blessed city of God’s kingdom. Now the true saints are journeying through the gates, that is to say, moving toward the kingdom, and with joy are singing Jehovah’s praises while holding high to others his standard of righteousness. They are privileged now to be his witnesses that others might know that he is God. Blessed is the privilege of any who thus bear witness for Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The voice of him that crieih in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God,—Isaiah 40:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wilderness means a wild or neglected place, a desert. It describes the wild or deserted place of the world; for the clergy and the principal men of the flock have permitted the truth to be so obscured that Christendom </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font6">become a desert place. The word voice is a symbol </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of a </span><span class="font6">message. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font6">is the voice of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">him;</span><span class="font6"> that is, the message </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Jehovah. The wilderness is the place where the prophecy shows that it cries. Since the world has been made a wilderness, the time has come when those who are associated with the Lord must, as his voice, cry forth in the wilderness the message of truth that has been placed in their possession for that purpose. The message is for the people of the earth to prepare to receive the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange worlc; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.—Isaiah 28: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The memories of Mount Perazim and the valley </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Gibeon glorify the Lord. There the Lord got glory for his name—how? By the visible manifestation of his conquering power over his enemies, and by openly espousing the cause of his people and protecting them and giving them victory in the conflict. The record is that Jehovah fought for Israel. Once again Jehovah will rise up in behalf of his cause and his elect ones, and will manifest his just wrath against the enemies of the kingdom of his dear Son. His glory will now be established in all the earth by visiting the multitude of his enemies and shielding and delivering his faithful remnant. To those who pin their faith to the Devil’s organization it will be a strange act and work. “Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: . . . but let the righteous be glad: lei them rejoice before God.&quot;'— </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Psalm 68:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord, shall cause his glorious voice io he heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger.—Isaiah 30:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The voice of Jehovah is his message. It is a glorious message, telling of the establishment of the kingdom of Christ and of the glory of the Lord with which it will fill the earth and of the blessing it will bear to the people. By his spirit which has been poured out upon his servants and handmaids in these “the last days&quot; ha is causing these gracious messages to be heard in all continents and in the isles of the sea. While this voice of the Lord goes forth, Jehovah’s four angels hold back the winds of strife that the message may be heard, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">the great tribulation of Armageddon is held back; its days are cut short. When the kingdom message has resounded long and far enough in the earth, then the end shall come and Jehovah manifest the descent of his arm of strength upon his enemies in his indignant anger. The Lord Jesus is the Arm he will employ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall hless us.—Psalm 67:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the new heavens have full control of the situation in the earth without the interference of Satan’s organization, then the earth shall yield her fruit abundantly and blossom like the garden of Eden. Then the people will be illuminated with the knowledge of the truth and come to know Jehovah; then they will respond to the Scripture admonition, “Let all the people praise thee, 0 Goa.” They will say, Jehovah is God, even our own God; and Jehovah will say, It is my people. The new heavens, the Christ, will hear the new earth; and Jehovah will hear the new heavens, and through them he will shower his blessings upon mankind. The harvests of earth’s crops shall be increased so greatly that the reaping thereof will extend up to plowing time; the increase of their vineyards will be so enormous that seedsowing time will arrive before the treading of the grapes is completed.—'-Amos 9:13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">will lead them in paths that they have not known:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight.—Isaiah</span><span class="font6"> 42: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">16-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people have been blinded by Satan, the god of this world. They have lain under the spell of darkness. They have been led in crooked ways while they groped in search of life, liberty and happiness. They, like even the true church for many centuries past, have not known of the Lord’s way for the people, the highway to life. Hark! the hour has struck for deliverance. God’s Word is now heard saying to his servants, “Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears. . . . Let them hear and say, It is truth.” Anoint the blinded eyes with the message that tells of the way by which the Lord will lead the people to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bowntifully with me.—Psalm</span><span class="font6"> 742: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This expresses the prayer of the “great multitude” in the denominational cells of that great prison-house, ecclesiasticism. Their hearts are being brought low with labor for that which is vanity, and they are beginning to realize the wretchedness of their condition of restraint. Their prison rations are poor and unsatisfying to those who are consecrated and spirit-begotten; and they long for liberty to learn more of the knowledge of Jehovah and his plan without the impudent and dictatorial interference of their ecclesiastical guards, in order that they might freely praise the Lord. They have been disobedient children; and their tears of disappointment shall yet flow profusely over their loss of membership in the body of the Anointed One, the Christ. But Jehovah will deal bountifully with them and bring them out of the prison, wiping away their tears and leading them to the springs of the water of truth. Ye righteous ones in Christ Jesus, hear the cry of the prisoners and compass them about with the Lord’s message.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Lord . . . r&amp;vedleth his secret unto his servants the prophets.”—Amos 8:</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE new creature in Christ becomes a prophet of the Lord when that new creature avails himself of opportunities to proclaim the message of the kingdom of the Lord. Such are members of the “servant** class to whom God has given the commission to declare that Jehovah is God and Christ is his anointed King upon his throne. This faithful servant class of the Lord constitute those who are of the temple and under the robe of righteousness. Agreeable to his promise, since the Lord has come to his temple there are flashes of light revealing more of the secrets of God’s marvelous works. Those who love the Lord obey his commandments, and more and more he leads them into the light. Those who are negligent and indifferent, and who fail or refuse to participate in the service of the Lord, quickly become blind. Only those who abide in Christ and faithfully perform their covenant by serving the Lord claim this promise of having the secrets of God. The importance of the Lord’s service cannot be overstated. All those who are of the temple class will proclaim his praises.— Psalm 29:9,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, 1 will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall he carried upon their shoulders.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Isaiah £9: 2S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is today signaling with his hand of power to the Gentiles. The standard that he has set up is the message of life that his “servant” class is bringing to the people. Tias not the slogan for the past few years been “Millions now living will never die”? A great many who have heard this message have manifested the keenest interest in the message and expressed their desire to see the kingdom established. These may with propriety be designated as children of Jehovah’s “servant”, inasmuch as the Head of the “servant” class is Jesus “The everlasting Father”, and the saints this side the vail are bringing to them the message of life, that is to say, the message that shall lead them to receive life. Many of these are rejoicing in the truth and in its message of life, and are expressing this joy in their own way, as illustrated by bearing children up in their arms and on their shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.—Isaiah H:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When we consider Zion, and that no enchantment or divination can avail against her and every weapon formed against her shall prove futile, can we not say in the language of the prophet: “What hath God wrought 1” Centuries ago at the baptism and anointing of his obedient Son, Jesus, Jehovah brought forth the foundation stone thereof; and after he had tested out his preciousness and sureness he laid him in Zion. Now the holy city rises in new national glory on her sure foundation. Should anyone in trepidation ask: “If the foundations [of Christendom] be destroyed, what can the righteous do ?” the messengers of the new nation can respond: Jehovah hath founded Zion. The poor in spirit may trust in it and betake themselves to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thou art my King, 0 God: command deliverance </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jacob.—Psalm 44:4-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not our rightful province to dictate to the Lord as to when shall come deliverance. Jehovah has marked his own times in his plan, and our times are in his hands, and it is best that so it is. Forbid then that we should either presume to get ahead of Jehovah or to let the acceptable time of the Lord slip by without availing ourselves of the divinely-provided mercies and opportunities. Jehovah is our King, and he commands when deliverance shall come for his elect ones. Happy is our lot to be his subjects, living in this thrilling time. For even now are we compassed about with songs of deliverance; yea, we see fulfilling the prophecies presaging that our deliverance, to wit, the redemption of our body, draweth nigh. Shortly Jehovah will arise for our help and command deliverance for us; and, freed from earthly evils for ever, we shall enter his temple above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 will plant in the wilderness the cedar, . . . 1 will set in the desert the fir tree, . . . that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the Lord hath done this.—Isaiah 41:10,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who is so blind but that he can already see the fulfilment of this prophecy of the Lord beginning? Turn your eyes eastward to the holy land, and behold the irrigation schemes that the repatriated Jews are conducting in a land that has lain barren for centuries, laden with malaria and trachoma 1 See the zealous Zionists, being given the worst of lands, draining swamps, watering sand dunes and converting them into gardens and farmlands! See them planting trees by the millions in the waste lands, and majestic forests beginning to rear their heads! This is the hand of the Lord; for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font6">verifies his Word. He has caused it to come to pass in this the due time that all, whether Christian, Jew </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font6">Gentile, might see, know, and consider that Jehovah </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font6">receiving the Jew to favor again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God: for he hath given you the former rain according to righteousness, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.—Joel 2:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The early rain is to sprout the seeds, and the latter rain to mature the grain in the ear. From the time of our Lord’s parousia, and during the period of preparation, was a time of the early rain. That was a time of refreshing, because Jehovah turned his face to his people. It was a time of gathering together God’s people, and this work was done generally prior to 1918. Then followed a period of expectation and impatient waiting until the completion of the work. Unexpectedly the evidence was given that the Lord came to his temple In 1918. That was the time of the latter rain, which greatly revived the saints and which has brought joy to their hearts. During the former rain was performed the Elijah work. During the latter rain is performed the Elisha work. Ye workers, haste along with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that 1 will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah.—Jeremiah 31:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The breaking of bread and the drinking of wine the night before our Lord’s death by the Lord and his disciples was the commencement of the new law covenant. This new covenant will bring life to the obedient ones </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Israel and to all mankind. The blood as a basis for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">covenant was shed on earth, or in the world, which was pictured by Egypt, at the time that Jesus died upon the cross. There the antitypical Lamb was slain. The new covenant will be inaugurated in heaven. The outcome of it will be to release mankind from bondage and to regenerate and give life to all who will be obedient </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">its terms. The inauguration of this blessed arrange-jnent is nigh at hand. JUet all those who would be “able toiinisters of the new covenant” announce the fact.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.&quot;—Isaiah 61:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">? | 'tHIS wonderful work of Jehovah will be accom-| plished by his Chief Officer, the great Priest after the order of Melchizedek. Even now Satan has been expelled from heaven and soon shall be shorn of all of his power. While this work is in progress the remnant class on earth joyfully bear witness to the people that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is at hand. The time is at hand when the new world shall be established. This will constitute the new heaven and new earth; to wit, Christ, the invisible ruling power and his visible agencies working righteousness on the earth. Prom his organization God will cause righteousness and his praise to spring forth before all the peoples of the earth, and then all shall learn of the glory of God. The temple class has begun the glad song of deliverance. The knowledge of the righteousness of God will continue until every creature that breathes will participate </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">singing the praises of Jehovah.—Psalm 150.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">June 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God . . . hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth; and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation.—Acts 17:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has always taken an unselfish interest in the ultimate welfare of the nations. Uninfluenced by any selfish consideration, he covenanted to bless all nations of earth in Abraham’s seed, the Christ. While the nations were yet sinners, God commended his love to them in that his Son Jesus died for them. Further, Jehovah determined beforehand on the time when the miserable times of Gentile supremacy over the nations should terminate. In arranging for all nations to have a common blood stream by all being descendants of the first Adam, we observe Jehovah’s farsighted policy of economy in his scheme for human salvation. For as in Adam all peoples that descend from him die, so all these peoples shall be made alive through one sacrifice, the sacrifice of the One who spilled his blood on Calvary. In view of this provision for them Jehovah has decreed that the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached to all nations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God settelh the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains; but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.—Psalm 68: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “great multitude”, with soiled garments, now sit solitary, where they feel the want of the fellowship of Jehovah and of the Bridegroom and the bride. Like the scapegoat of old, unclean and bearing iniquity, they have been led away into this solitary land or condition by the hand of the clergy of Christendom, who stood convenient and in readiness in 1919. There the ecclesiastics, as prison-warders, keep them bound with the chains of intimidations, threats, misrepresentations, and false teachings. In their loneliness their souls are set alongin^; and they are now crying unto the Lord that they might dwell with the Lord’s true family, the true household of faith. The time for Jehovah to hear their prayers has come; and he bids them now, “Come forth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">July 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For Jie hath looked down from the heights of his sanctuary; from heaven did the Lord behold the earth;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">to hear the groaning of the prisoner, to loose those that are appointed to death.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Psalm 102:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah condescends to look down and consider the affairs of earth. One of his special considerations at this time is the interests of a “great multitude” of his spirit-begotten children who are imprisoned by the ecclesiastical servants of the great gaoler or prison warden, the Devil. Up to this hour this great prisonkeeper “did not let his prisoners loose homeward” (Isa, 14:17, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font6">; and now Jehovah purposes to intervene in their behalf. For they have made a covenant with Jehovah; they have been justified and accepted and begotten by his spirit, and therefore are appointed to death that their spirits might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. Their gleanings have come up to the ears of their God and Father; and now, just prior to loosing them from “affliction and iron”, he sends his anointed ones to proclaim the opening of the prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">July 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He hath founded the earth upon her loses [margin], tliat it should not be removed for ever,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm lOj.: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah thus gives a foundation for the hope that the earth shall abide for ever, that through the everlasting future it shall revolve on its axis and traverse its yearly orbit with faithfulness and obedience to its Creator and be the beautiful home of restored mankind. Therefore human creatures and all that live and move and exist on earth may be glad. “Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps: fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word: mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars: beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl: kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth: both young men and maidens; old men and children : let them praise the name of the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his Icing dam ruleth over all.—Psalm 103:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">throne is a symbol of sovereign power and authority. It signifies that he who possesses the throne has original jurisdiction and supreme power, absolute authority; and that there is none above him, but that he exercises power and authority without limitation. Where Jehovah has prepared or set up his regal seat is in the celestial universe. The stellar group, knowm as the constellation of Pleiades and situated in the north, seems to be marked by the Bible as the center of the celestial universe, the place of the throne of Jehovah, from which supreme authority is exercised. Prom this place of sovereign authority established in heaven above us Jehovah directs all things of the depthless heavens. Prom there he will in due time direct all things of the earth through the Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Be causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth.—Psalm- 101^:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has made all his creatures dependent upon him for their continual provision, fulness, and happiness. All his works bespeak his manifold wisdom and his love. He carpets the earth with green grass not only for beauty’s eye but in behalf of the grazing animals; he makes the ground to teem with forms of plant life not merely to delight the sensibilities of man but also for man’s service and for his daily food. From all this Jesus drew a wholesome lesson for us, saying, “If God bo clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you?” How wretched that men should yield mentally to teachings that Jehovah is a God of hate and eternal torment, and that they should overlook the lesson of his love which he teaches even in his provision in nature for beast as well as man! Oh, let us gather out the stones from man’s pathway and hold aloft the standard that “God is love” I</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?&quot;—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jsaiah 1^0: 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HIS text is a tribute to the majesty, greatness, wisdom and power of Jehovah. To know God and his beloved Son means life. The masses of mankind know not God and are therefore without hope. Millions of Christians know so little of God and his, plan that they are fearful and weak, and permit themselves to be held in prison. The context shows that the time has come for the anointed Servant Class to tell the people concerning the true God. The works of Jehovah that are visible to the natural eye bespeak his, greatness and tend to establish faith in him. There ia none to compare with him. Satan the mimic god </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font6">centuries has made a great show, but his show days are about to end. The works of Jehovah will endure for ever. The anointed Servant Class is now commanded </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">lift up the standard of God and testify to his name; and this will result beneficially to the prisoners and to the peoples of good will. All the power and pomp displayed by the Devil’s organization and his agencies are as nothing in the sight of God. The testimony must ba given concerning this. Soon God will convince all mankind of his great power and that his power always works </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">harmony with wisdom, justice </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and love. It is </span><span class="font6">his </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">expressed </span><span class="font6">will that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Servant Class shall give this testimony at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God.—2 Corinthians 1:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah it is who has given each consecrated one his station </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in Christ, but let no one</span><span class="font6"> conceitedly imagine that he is so immovably established in the body that he cannot be removed because of unfaithfulness and barrenness. Each one thus baptized into the body of Christ is anointed by Jehovah’s spirit. The anointing means a divine designation to a position of service of authority. It carries with it a commission to do </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">certain</span><span class="font6"> things, and this commission is well covered by the Lord’s prophet, Isaiah (chapter 61:1-3). It is not beyond the bounds of modesty to assume that those thus anointed will be given an opportunity to exercise themselves in their commission. This is even the case: The opportunity to serve as ambassadors for the kingdom is given </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">to the </span><span class="font6">anointed ones now in this present time as never before. May gratitude for this favor of being among the anointed ones now impel us to faithful effort in representing Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth.—Romans 8:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Does Jehovah lay anything to the charge of his elect ? No, he justifies. To justify means to make right with God, to approve as being perfect, whole or holy unto him. God justifies the consecrated one in order that he might be an acceptable sacrifice as a part of the body of Christ Jesus. No blemished sacrifice can be accepted by Jehovah. Perfection is counted unto him not by reason of his own righteousness, but by reason of the fact that he has exercised faith in the blood of Jesus shed for him as a sin-offering. When justified, the consecrated one has the right to live as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">human being, because </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font6">is counted perfect; every perfect man has the right to life. This right to live thus counted to him </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">by Jehovah is </span><span class="font6">the right to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">live </span><span class="font6">on earth as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">human being. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This </span><span class="font6">right is what is sacrificed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Be will finish the work, and cut it short in righteous* ness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.—Romans 9: SS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah will make a sharp and quick work of gathering his remnant unto him and of announcing the kingdom before the complete end of tire evil order. He will cut it short in righteousness, or righteously, because hia good purposes have ripened unto their consummation and the world’s iniquity has come to the full. The time is therefore short, and the privileges of the remnant are great beyond the description of human words. The issue today is clearly drawn; the fight is on to the finish; the campaign grows with intensity. Let every Christian who loves God, and who possesses the zeal of Christ in his heart, now give full expression to unselfishness by showing forth the praises of him who hath translated us out of the power of darkness into his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">July 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that 1 will send a famine in the land; not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.—Amos 8:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because the Israelites walked contrary to Jehovah’s law, he visited them with a great famine in the days of Elijah, true to his warning of Leviticus 26: 26. Similarly, during the Gospel Age the disobedient course of the people under the leadership of ‘The shepherds and the principal of the flock” has resulted in the earth’s being famine-stricken for hearing the pure message of God’s comforting Word. The people are spiritually “sick with famine”. They wander to and fro seeking the Word of the Lord and are faint. What an opportunity for the anointed ones of Jehovali on earth at this time, to feed the famine sufferers! God lays his charge upon them, saying, “The priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.” The best way to keep the knowledge of the truth is to use the truth by telling it to others and thus feeding the hungered ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God is faithful, who will not suffer you io be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.—1 Corinthians 10:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The temptations that beset those of the world likewise beset those of the church, but Jehovah has prepared a way for the church to escape. That way of escape is by fastening our anchor to the Lord, relying upon his promises, and conforming ourselves to the commandment of his Word. Since the ejection of Satan from heaven and his restraint unto the earth, he is assiduously warring with those who keep the commandments of God, and the “hour of temptation” has verily come to the church as well as to the world. The great foe is appearing as an angel of light, and insidiously seeks to appeal to the consecrated ones by the avenues of the “lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life”. Their way of escape lies in setting their affections on things above., waiting on the Lord, and unselfishly prosecuting the Lord’s work to the glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">July 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.—1 Cor. 12:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Order is one of the fundamental laws of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font6">ehovah. He does everything orderly. The Christ is the new creation of God. It is that which will overshadow all other creations of Jehovah. It follows that everything about the new creation must learn to be orderly; and, when finished, everything about ii; will be orderly. It is certain that each member of the church must leam order. It is one of the hardest lessons for many to leam. No one sets himself in the body of Christ. Jehovah hath done the setting according as it hath pleased him. Then let each one perform the duties assigned to him in the Lord’s arrangement and not be meddling in the affairs assigned to some one else. Order in the body requires tach member to do diligently what ia appointed him to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">do.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 8: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE selfish, ignorant man boasts of his own accomplishments and of the greatness of other men. The man devoted to Jehovah gives honor to his Creator. He sees that the things of Satan’s organization are all vanity. He knows that the works of Jehovah are everlasting. Man beholds the moon and the stars, shedding forth their gentle light at night time, and the sun, which dispels darkness and rules the day and gives life to the vegetation of earth. He views himself in the light of these works of the great Creator, and begins to appreciate his own insignificance when compared with Jehovah God. He reverences his Maker, and his reverence of Jehovah leads man into the way of wisdom. Learning of God’s plan of redemption through his beloved Son, he consecrates his life to the Lord and walks in the light. He appreciates the great honor of being the ambassador of the Lord and in faithfully representing the kingdom interests. He forgets self and honors God. He delights to tell others of the majesty and power and greatness of Jehovah and his works. He learns to think soberly, and does not think more highly of himself than he ought to think. He becomes unselfish and grows more like the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God . . . hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts.—2 Corinthians 1:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A seal of one possessing authority is placed upon </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">document to authenticate it, and thereby to give assurance that it is genuine. The seal of no higher authority could one have than that of Jehovah, nor could one have </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">grander seal. When one is justified, accepted, and begotten by the spirit of Jehovah, he becomes a new creature. God then seals him with the holy spirit, which is an earnest or guarantee of inheritance, which guarantee holds good during one’s faithfulness until the inheritance is received. The one thus receiving the holy spirit, and the witness of the spirit that he is the son of God, thereby has the authentication of his genuineness as a new creature in Christ Jesus. He is not left to doubt or to grope about in the dark, but has the full assurance, given to him by this guarantee.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me ... to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes.—Isaiah 61:1, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The unselfish ones in Zion remember this part of the commission that accompanies their anointing. “Ashes” symbolize deep humiliation, great sorrow and woe. These may come to the Christian because of the seeming triumph of the enemy, or because of treachery on the part of others, or because of injustice that others may practise against him. If an anointed one of the Lord finds his brother in Zion suffering such humiliation, sorrow or woe, from any reason, Jehovah commissions him to give him beauty for ashes. “Beauty” is a symbol of embellishment or ornament about the head or of the mind. To give beauty then means to point the mourning ones to something that will ornament their minds, to induce happy and beautiful thoughts, and thereby bring strength. We should call their attention to their divinely-given commission and bid them to arise and shine in the beauty of God’s sendee.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me ... to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them . . . the oil of joy for mourning.—Isaiah 61:1,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Joy”</span><span class="font6"> means gladness, satisfaction and delight because of the blessings of goodness, present or hoped for, both for oneself and for other creatures obedient to Jehovah’s law. Jesus’ joy consisted in possessing sweet fellowship with Jehovah, and the prospect and certainty of vindicating his Father’s name and bringing all the obedient ones of mankind back into full harmony with God. If we possess the blessings of the goodness of the Lord now, or have reason to expect such blessings in the near future and therefore have a hope for the same, such brings joy and delight. If the anointed ones encounter any of their brethren in Zion in mournful distress, Jehovah’s commission to them is to dispel this mourning by giving him the oil of joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">July 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me ... to a-ppoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them . . . the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.—Isaiah 61:1,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">garment is a covering by which one is marked or distinguished, and which rejects one’s state of mind. Praise means due acknowledgment and proclamation of the perfections, the great and wonderful excellencies of Jehovah, and to laud and magnify his name. It means to mention with joy Jehovah’s great plan and how it is revealed and carried into action. To put on the gar-pient of praise therefore means to distinguish oneself </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font6">boldly, fearlessly and joyfully proclaiming the truth, advertising the King and his kingdom; and by pointing </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">people to the fact that Jehovah is God, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font6">power is now being lovingly manifested on behalf of mankind. If any one finds any of the brethren in Zion </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in the </span><span class="font6">“spirit of heaviness”, Jehovah commissions his anointed one to encourage and assist them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.—Isa. 61:1,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the vision of the kingdom given to the Revelator, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">Christ, Head and body, is pictured as a tree or wood of life, the leaves of which are for the healing of the nations. This picture suggests that the nourishment and healing for the sin-sick and starving world and for their upbuilding and restoration come through the Christ. It images the philanthropic purposes of Jehovah in the Christ. In view of these beneficent purposes Jehovah </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font6">putting Zion through a course of instruction. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font6">commissions each one in Zion to do certain things. The faithful performance of these things shall result in the faithful one's being called a tree of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah; and this shall reflect the glory </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Jehovah God, the great Husbandman and Creator.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun hnoweth his going down.—Psalm 104:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is the Creator of lights. He created the sun and the moon of our heavens, and ordained them to give light to the physical sight of man by day and by night. But grander far! he has given to spiritual Israel, “the children of light,” a knowledge of his will, which illuminates their pathway as the silvery moon of night and which now in this season of God’s plan shines with the effulgence of the sun. He has given them the light </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font6">new day, the sunlight of the kingdom message, which now<sup>r</sup> shines with the brilliancy of seven suns, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">the light of seven days. To those who faithfully walk in the path of God’s light and reflect the light upon others Jehovah’s Word says: “Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">light by day, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the or</span><span class="font6">dinances of the moon and of the stars for a light </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font6">night, ...

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee.&quot;—Isaiah 28: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH is a God of peace. Regardless of confusion caused by the enemy Jehovah is always tranquil, calm and undisturbed. His mighty works bespeak his majesty, dignity and quiet serenity. The peace which he enjoys is centered in himself. The peace which his intelligent creatures enjoy results from an abiding confidence in the Lord. The visible and inanimate work of his hands testify in his behalf. The mountain peaks stand as though they were silent sentinels on watch, and witness to the greatness of his work. The faithful followers of Christ Jesus enjoy the peace of God. These continually trust in and serve him. The prophet likens them to watchmen who are also made witnesses for God: “Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing.” The voice is the harmonious message of truth which they delight to proclaim. The precious promises of God are for these faithful ones. Because of their faithfulness and loving devotion to him he keeps them in sweet peace and leads them into ways everlasting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">How much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Matthew 7:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We may be sure that the Father is pleased to have ua ask for such things as we need. But asking, we must also exercise our faculties with which we are endowed to provide such things as are necessary. No one should think that he can sit down and idly fold his hands and expect the Lord to put into his lap just such things as he may need. Jehovah’s way of providing is by giving us an opportunity of cooperating with him in acquiring the things needed. His child, then, will pray and diligently act in harmony with his prayer. This is the rule in spiritual things: “Ask and ye shall receive.” But act in harmony with such asking. Having acquired the knowledge by which we may know the will of God, then we must diligently endeavor to conform ourselves to that will. Following the divine rule, the child of God does not want. No good thing will Jehovah withhold.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">We </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">have such an high priest, . . . a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lord pitched, and not man.—Hebrews 8:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah, and not man., pitched or set up the true and spiritual tabernacle, in which by his spirit he will dwell with mankind during the Millennial Day. When the time came for building the typical tabernacle in the Wilderness of Sin Jehovah called by name, and particularly and specially designated and invited, one individual to have charge of the work and with his assistants to prepare the tabernacle furnishings. Jehovah said to Hoses: “See, I have called by name Bezaleel [meaning, God is Protection or in the Shadow (i. e., protection) of God], the son of Uri [Light—the light of the world], the son of Hur [white, noble, also pit—the noble One lay dead three days in the pit], of the tribe of Judah [Praised— in his prehuman condition]: and I have filled him with the spirit of God.” Bezaleel represented Christ Jesus, whom Jehovah made the minister of the true tabernacle.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Romans 8:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah calls or invites none with the heavenly calling except those who are justified. None should get the thought that because they have once been called with the one hope of our calling they are always in the called class. There is a limit to God’s favors. He is not calling into the bride class any who have once known him and then have measurably forgotten him. The Scriptures define these as wicked because, though once they heard, they have turned away from the truth again to the exercise of their selfish wills. (Psalm 50:16,17) Those who have been invited to Jehovah’s great feast of love, and who remain in the heart relationship with him in which they were when they responded to his gracious cal], and who keep on showing forth the praises of him who called them, will be the ones upon whom Jehovah has predestinated that the laurels of victory shall rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">July 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Let no man say when he is tempted, 1 am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man.—James 1:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is infinitely above all the enticements of temptation to evil. He is holy and righteous and cannot deny the law of his own being. Hence the present temptation of the church comes not from Jehovah, but from Satan through the avenue of the world. It is presented now in three ways; namely, as to the body, as to the mind, and as to the will. Every one who will be of the kingdom must resist and overcome this threefold temptation. He must refuse to use his spiritual powers for personal gain, but must present his body a “living sacrifice” daily; he must be absolutely invulnerable to the influence of the glamour of the world and be loyal to Jehovah, to Jesus, to God’s Word, and to his work; he must have no self-pride or self-ambition to run ahead of the Lord, but be willing and anxious to follow where the Lord leads and to do what the Lord directs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">July 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The woman, fled into the wilderness, where she hath </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.—Revelation 12: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah duly provided a place for the safety and nourishment of his anointed ones on earth who represented Zion, the woman. On March 27th, 1919, the day immediately following release from prison, the officers of the Lord’s organization on earth began formulating plans for aiding the church and furthering the witness. Then it was that the woman, Zion, fled into the wilderness unto the divinely provided place. This place seems to symbolize the condition prepared by Jehovah’s providence for those on earth who represented Zion and in whose mouths he put his words and whom he covered with the shadow of his hand. In that condition they remained until “the day” when, with the fearlessness of Elisha and with the glorious vision of the Lord enthroned in his temple, they joyfully emerged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">July 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth. grace unto the humble.— James</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4 ■' </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A refusal to submit to God’s law or to be governed by his rule of action is the result of selfishness and pride; and such Jehovah pushes away from him. For one to seek his own glory and honor could not be pleasing to the heavenly Father. When Jesus was on earth he did not seek to glorify himself, but always sought to honor and glorify Jehovah. Each one to be pleasing to the Lord must likewise keep himself in the background and should always honor Jehovah and Jesus. Humility is plainly an essential in those who seek so to do. Humility means to be submissive to God’s will. His will concerning the church is expressed in his Word. Humility therefore means to obey God’s law. Those who cheerfully obey receive unfailing supplies of grace from Jehovah through Christ Jesus and the honor of serving </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6"> always upholds them.—Proverbs 29: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">July 27 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.&quot;—Psalm 145:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">C</span><span class="font6">OMPLETE dependence of the creature upon the great Creator for life and happiness is here expressed. One may live for a time and ignore God; but he who would live for ever must know God and his beloved Son. The speaker in this Psalm being David, the words express the heart sentiment of members of the new creation and particularly of “The Servant Class” at the present time. These see the goodness of Jehovah in every one of his acts and learn that all who love him are the recipients of his bounties. They see that the greatest achievement of the creature is to be like the Creator. He is righteous in all his ways. Mercy, generosity and loving kindness are bestowed upon all his creation. He is the perfect expression of unselfishness. He is love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Members of the new creation devote their lives to the service of God and delight to meditate upon his works and proclaim his praises. They are works of his hands. Their reward will be life inherent, with the privilege of extending blessings to others as agents of the Mighty One. When the human race is restored and all the universe made clean then every creature will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">completely satisfied with the bounties received from </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the open </span><span class="font6">hand of the great Jehovah God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to Hess you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.—Acts 3: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The seed of Abraham in whom all the families of the earth are to be blessed is primarily Jesus. Even those who are to be associated with Jesus as the heirs of the Abrahamic promise must first themselves be blessed in Jesus. It is by him that we have “access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God”. To us there is “one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him”. When Jehovah raised Jesus from the dead as the assured seed of Abraham, he sent him first to the Jews to bless them with the kingdom opportunities, because they were the children of the prophets and of the covenant made with their fathers. But they refusing the first offers, Jehovah turned to the Gentiles. Let us therefore be responsive to the great kingdom opportunities.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south: hut God is the judge; he putteth down one, and setteth up another.— Psalm 75:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It seems to be entirely in harmony with the Scriptures to say that one’s position in the body of Christ may be changed by Jehovah from time to time. As one proves faithful to that which has been committed to him, he may be advanced to a different place. Since the church is God’s organization, it follows that if the church organization acts according to the prescribed rule laid flown in the Lord’s Word, we are warranted in the view that the Lord promotes his servants in the body of Christ this side the vail. If such continue faithful unto death, then they have the assurance that God, through Christ, will assign them to a position of relative importance in the glorified body of Christ beyond the vail. May all then, who are heartily striving to please and serve </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">Lord, take their changes in his service as being from him, the great Judge, and endeavor to be unmurmuring.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">to do of his good pleasure.—Phil. 2: 12, IS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Apostle Paul straightforwardly told the church that his presence with the brethren should not be the incentive for them to work out their salvation according to the rules laid down in God’s Word. They should not seek to please men, even men who are prominent servants of the Lord, with eyeservice. They should seek to be faithful just as much when out of sight of their more prominent brethren as when these brethren are present, always bearing this in mind that it is not a mere man or human force that is working in their midst but that it is Jehovah God who is working among them. His power rests upon them; his eye observes their efforts; and he is the one to be pleased first of all. He is the one who should furnish the incentive to be faithful.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">John 5:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s deep love for his only-begotten Son prompted him to take his Son into close counsel with himself and to show him all his works which were due to be performed in behalf of man’s salvation. This he did that his Son might be his trustworthy witness to the world and might keep in harmony with the will and work of his Father. While Jesus was here on earth, it was at his anointing of the spirit that Jehovah began to show him the work in which his Son was to be his great Executive Officer, a high priest after the order </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Melchisedec. It was at that time that “the heavens were opened unto him” and the Laipb of God began to unroll the scroll of the divine plan which he had received of the Father. Similarly, Jehovah loves his children, the body members of Christ, revealing unto them the works </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font6">is doing and granting them to be workers together with him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Ezekiel 81: 86, 87.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Six hundred and six years before Christ Jehovah executed his decree of overturning. The right of the Solomonic line to the kingdom passed from them, as the diadem and crown were removed from their heads and overturned. But the sceptre did not depart from Judah. Our Lord Jesus sprang from the tribe of Judah; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">when he had been immersed in Jordan’s stream </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">the spirit of Jehovah anointed him, there Shiloh came, and Jehovah gave io him the sceptre and the right </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">the regal diadem and crown. For nearly nineteen centuries the exalted Jesus was seated at the right hand </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the majesty on high. But it was not until 1914 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A. D. </span><span class="font6">that he wielded his sceptre; for then it was that Jehovah sent the rod of his strength out of Zion. This is the day </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Jesus’ power as King. If so, then we as his people should be willing and joyfully volunteer to serve.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Daniel 8:1/4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Gentile Times ended in 1914. Earth’s rightful King was then present, but his first work (since 1874) </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font6">a preparatory work for the beginning of his reign. In the last days of the Gentile kings the God of heaven </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font6">begun to set up the promised kingdom, and since </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1918 </span><span class="font6">it is breaking to pieces the kingdoms of this world. The members of the kingdom class now on earth occupy </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">position of honor that no one else on earth can hold. They are the honored servants of the Lord. They, as earthly representatives, are the ambassadors of the king</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">dom </span><span class="font6">of God, and are clothed with authority to tell mankind of that kingdom and the blessings it will bring </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">them.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;For whom he foreknew, he also foreordained to he conformed to the image of his SonF—Rom. 8: 29, B. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE new creation is the highest part of the works of Jehovah. The nature of that creation is divine. Jesus Christ is the beginning and head thereof. He stands preeminently above all. Having foreordained the new creation, God’s will is that each member thereof shall be conformed to the image of his beloved Son. Each one must resemble the Head. Jesus was wholly devoted to his Father. Each one who will ultimately be a member of the new creation must, while on earth, wholly devote his life to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When one is begotten to the divine nature he does not see so clearly the divine requirements. As he walks in the light and comes nearer to the perfect day, more clearly he sees the necessity of being like Jesus. As Jesus delighted to do the will of his Father, so his true followers delight to do God’s will. The law of God concerning all such, as clearly shown by the Scriptures, now is to bear testimony that Jehovah is God and Christ is King and that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. The foreordained likeness means a complete devotion to Jehovah in harmony with the covenant of sacrifice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lord will not impute sin.—Romans Ji'.T,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The covering for sins is the merit of Christ Jesus, Imputed to such as confess their transgressions and crave Jehovah’s forgiveness, and who have a desire to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font6">his will. This covering should not be confused with “the robe of righteousness”. (Isaiah 61:10) The nonimputation of sin to the Christian is equal to the actual imputation of righteousness. Otherwise stated, where one has an abiding faith in Christ Jesus and in God’s Word and has an honest and sincere desire in his heart </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">be free from sin and to be righteous, Jehovah can treat such an one as whole or righteous. The reason is that God looks at the heart; that is to say, God counts evil to the one who has an evil intent, whether he commits </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">overt act or not; and likewise God counts righteousness unto the Christian, who naturally is not righteous, because of his heart’s devotion to righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">'If this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.—Acts 5:38,39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While we should feel and faithfully seek to discharge our responsibilities in the Lord’s work, fearing lest we displease him whom we so love, we should on the other hand not feel any anxious fears respecting Jehovah’s work. It is his work, and he is fully able to take care ?&gt;f every feature of it. It is not our counsel that we are heralding to all the nations of the earth; it is Jehovah’s and it shall therefore never fail of accomplishment. Xt follows that when men oppose us in our work as his witnesses in the earth, they are in reality fighting against Jehovah; and they shall not prevail. The Lord therefore wants his servants to be bold and aggressive in his service, knowing that they are in the right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, Hood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. . . . before</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the great and the terrible day of the Lord come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Joel 2:30,31,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Has not Jehovah shown his people wonders in the heavens, by giving them a better vision than heretofore of the Devil’s organization and of the birth of the nation, of the easting of Satan out of heaven, and-of the preparation for the great and final battle on the earth ? Blood and fire are symbols of death and destruction. In the earth during the past few years there has been a great amount of death and destruction. Smoke is a symbol of confusion, and now we see such great confusion as never before in history. The nominal Christian system is all in confusion, and its leaders have turned the light of the kingdom message into darkness by openly uniting with Satan’s makeshift for Christ’s kingdom. The will of Jehovah, symbolized by the moon, has become to many the symbol of death. Noting these fulfilments of prophecy, God’s witnesses should rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">After that he gave unto them judges, about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.—Acts 13:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The period of the judges, from Joshua to Samuel, was a period marked by Jehovah’s deliverances of the people. The record of this time is one of repeated departures of the people of Israel from the law of the Lord. What did the Lord do? Cast them off for ever? No! He permitted them to be chastised at the hand of their enemies; and then when they had learned their lesson and were penitent and cried unto the Lord, he brought them deliverance. “When the Lord raised them up judges, then the Lord was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge.” Herein we see illustrated greater deliverance, not alone for Israel but for all mankind, from Satan, sin, and death. The great Judge whom Jehovah has ordained to be the Deliverer is Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice; let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ful m thee.—Psalm 5:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah defends them! The thought makes the Christians shout for joy. In giving their testimony to the name of Jehovah, which they love, they realize the danger to which they are subjected, because they know that the evil one now seeks to destroy all those who keep the commandments of God. Yet they have greater boldness than ever in proclaiming the message of God’s kingdom, because they love God. They have no fear. Confidently they rely upon Jehovah, who has promised to preserve those who love him and who are faithful. Threatening evil does not deter one when he knows he is perfectly protected. As long as he is faithful the Christian is perfectly and completely defended by Jehovah. Over such God places his hand in love. The Christian’s joy overflows in singing the praises of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; 1 dwell in the high and holy pla&gt;ce.—Isaiah 57:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is holy. He dwells in the holy place because in that place of his sacred dwelling his will is always done and it is always right. Wrong never defiles that holy place. Jehovah God the lofty One has ever pursued and will evermore pursue a course of righteousness and perfection. “The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.” (Psalm 145:17) His course is always the same; there is no change in him. He says: “I am Jehovah, I change not.” (Malachi 3:6) From the course of righteousness he never deviates. His law, his rule of action, is always perfect. His every act is unselfish; therefore he is love. How could we come into the presence of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font6"> Holy One without holiness! No wonder Jehovah admonishes us through his apostle, saying, ‘Without holiness shall no man se$ the Lord.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.&quot;—Hebrews 1: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HIS prophecy was written concerning Jesus. From the beginning he was always in harmony with his Father and always the delight of Jehovah. The other morning star turned to lawlessness. Ths beloved Son hated lawlessness and loved righteousness. For this reason Jehovah anointed him to the highest place, far above all others of his creation. Hereby is the rule of God proven that he who devotes himself wholly to God is always rewarded. This is not selfishness on the part of Jehovah, but it is prompted entirely by love. God is righteous. All who faithfully serve God must follow righteousness. All the righteous shall live. Such is the law of God. The reward is to all who delight to be obedient to God. Obedience means to keep his commandments and to do so joyfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In these closing days of Satan’s empire, and just before the fall thereof, God will have his saints give </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">strong testimony. The remnant of his people will delight to give this witness. While so doing God will protect them and be to them a crown of glory and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">diadem of beauty, and their future reward will be exaltation. Then they will be for ever with the Anointed </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">highly exalted One.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Habakkuk 1: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord is at work in our days in a manner most manifest to Christian eyes. Among all the heathen, or nations, this work is being projected; and the people of Christendom regard it and wonder and marvel. Contrary to what human minds would think or believe, Jehovah has raised up the meek, the insignificant, and the poor of this world, and a few in number they are at that, and has entrusted to them the most glorious and also the boldest of messages, the message of destruction to Satan’s empire and the victorious rise of Christ’s kingdom. These Jehovah has made his representatives and witnesses, but has passed by the ecclesiastical lords and leaders of Christendom and made their wisdom to perish and their understanding to be hid. Their unusual message challenges- Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began: that we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us.—Luke 1: 70, 71.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s prophets were “holy men of old”; therefore Jehovah put his Word into their mouths and spake by them. Their message was holy, because Jehovah is holy and any message which would proceed from him would partake of and reflect his own qualities and would be as much a part of him as his own organism. The prophets all spake of deliverance, of restitution. The Bible records stern truths about these men; and judged by the false standard that Satan holds up by his representatives, they could never be counted holy. They were far from coming up to the Lord’s high standard. Nevertheless, Jehovah counted them holy, not because they were perfect in the flesh, not because they had “developed </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">character”, but because despite their human weaknesses they were absolutely and unswervingly devoted to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because Jehovah is holy he speaks in holiness, and everything that proceeds from him is holy. God’s apostle therefore consistently refers to the Bible, God’s Word, as &quot;the holy scriptures”. (Romans 1: 2) How foolish then for mortals of the present time, who &quot;despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities”, to refer to the Bible in disrespectful terms! How foolish for any man so far to forget himself as to reject the Word of God, particularly for those who once believed upon the Word of the Lord! The Bible’s precious truths are not to be cast before everybody. For this reason Jesus said: &quot;Give not that which is holy unto the dogs.” The message of Jehovah is holy, and should be regarded and treated thus by all who claim to know the Lord. The time will come when every creature that is granted the privilege of life will realize that God’s Word is holy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.—Acts 1^:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All the works of Jehovah and all his acts testify as unimpeachable witnesses to his goodness. His goodness has been from everlasting and will be to everlasting. His goodness, in the full meaning of that word, means being everything that is true, reliable, benevolent, gracious, pure, righteous, holy, and in everything and in every way being opposed to that which is evil. Jehovah’s goodness has been manifested to all who have sought to know him. But even the nations who have not known God and whom he has suffered to walk in their own ways have had witness given to them of the goodness of the great invisible One, in that he has permitted them to reap the benefits and bounties of the rain and the seasons and the forces of nature which Jehovah has put into operation. Nor will this testimony be lost; for some not distant day all nations shall intelligently know the. Lord, and then shall they look back and remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God . . . did uisit the. Gentiles, to take out of them </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">people for his name.—Acts 15:14-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was at the sending of Peter to the Gentile household of Cornelius, a devout man whose prayers and alms had come up before Him for a memorial, that Jehovah God visited the Gentiles. It was there that the angels (messengers) of God carried the Lazarus of the parable into the bosom or favor of Abraham, who typifies Jehovah, the lofty Father. Thus was opened the opportunity for the Gentiles to become members of “Abraham’s seed” in whom all nations are to be blessed. From then until now God has been occupied in taking out from Gentiles </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">people for his own name, Jehovah. Seeing then that we are called by his name, and seeing too that Jehovah has in these last days brought us to a keener appreciation of the fame and dignity and majesty of his name, we above all people on earth should seek to honor that name and publish the fame of that name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the holy spirit and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil: for</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God was with him.—Acts 10: 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jesus was baptized at Jordan, the holy spirit </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Jehovah came upon him, not only begetting him to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">new nature but also anointing him to preach the blessed news of God’s kingdom. The power of Jehovah accompanied the anointing. When our Lord went forth with his heart burning with the desire to proclaim the good news to the people, he was met with an indifference, a coldness of heart, an opposition to righteousness, and a disposition to criticize everything new which, upon anyone less determined, would have had a chilling effect. To verify his message as being from Jehovah he performed his many miracles, thus testifying that God was with him. Today the people are receiving God’s kingdom message as never before. But should we at times encounter the conditions that Jesus did, let us look unto him who proved faithful to his anointing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Lord preserveth the faithful&quot;—Psatm 31: £3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">N</span><span class="font6">O ONE could prove faithful without being put to the test. For this reason God graciously permits the adversary to beset His anointed ones. Jesus was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. He was subjected to the most severe trials, and in all of them he was faithful to his Father. He was tempted to compromise with the Devil and his organization. He gained the victory in the test. All his followers must be subjected to similar tests. Now the test is severe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some who receive the truth at God’s gracious hand are inclined to draw back from being his faithful witnesses. Others who walk in the light rejoice to avail themselves of every opportunity to tell of God and his King and his kingdom. Such enjoy sweet peace, because they are fully confident that God will keep them and preserve them from all evil. Regardless of the perils that may surround them the faithful have no need to fear; for God is greater than all who can be against them. He will keep the faithful ones in the hollow of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">his htmd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For, behold, the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will erv-grave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts.—Zechariah 3: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Joshua was the high priest of the Lord in the days of Zechariah, the prophet whom Jehovah used to encourage Joshua in the rebuilding of the temple and the reordering of its service. The high priest therefore represents the antitypical priests, the body of Christ, particularly in these days when “the Lord is in his holy temple”. Before us therefore Jehovah has laid the foretold stone, not for us to stumble over it as have both the houses of Israel, but to believe on it and to acknowledge it as the stone which the Lord made the headstone of the corner. Jehovah has tried this precious stone, and his power has engraved it with the express image of his own person. He has endowed this living stone, Christ Jesus, with the seven eyes, hiding in him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.—Colossians 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord also shall save the tents of Judah, first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah.—Zechariah 12:</span><span class="font6"> 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One may be a natural descendant of Israel, and even of the tribe of Judah, and yet not be a Jew. A Jew therefore is one who is the natural descendant of Jacob (Israel), and who has faith in the words uttered by Jacob concerning Judah. Such a one will have faith in all the promises which Jehovah has made to the Israelites through his holy prophets of old. Such dwell in the tents of Judah: such comprise the “cities of Judah”, and such will the Lord save first in the Messianic kingdom. With them and the holy patriarchs and prophets, resurrected and restored, Jehovah will make the New Covenant, that through that covenant all the Gentiles might be blessed. Thus Jehovah will faithfully follow his announced order of bringing salvation; namely, “to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 will hear them.—Zechariah 13: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What a hope-inspiring message from the Lord we have to give to the meek and poor and righteously-disposed people of the earth! It is laden with the tidings of deliverance, yea, even deliverance from going down into the pit of death. We cannot now assure the people that Armageddon may be averted; the fire of God’? jealousy will flare out and devour Satan’s earthly institutions; and the “shepherds and the principal of the flock” will be cut off. But we can assure them that Jehovah will protect and bring through the period of fiery destruction a third element found among the people, the element that hungers and thirsts after righteousness and that now rallies to the standard of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Zechariah 12:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jerusalem in the setting the Lord here gives it in the prophecy evidently refers to his organization of all his spirit-begotten ones in the earth. Opposition in this day is to be expected by them; for Satan would continue as the god of this world, and will logically oppose all who stand for Jehovah as God. The anointed ones of the Lord, as they faithfully give their witness and advertise the King and the kingdom, are naturally burdensome to those who are in favor of the kings and kingdoms of Satan’s organization. These may be expected to gath-ther against God’s organization, Jerusalem, in the earth in the effort to rid themselves of this weight burdensome to them. But Jehovah’s remnant should take courage; those who touch them touch the apple of his eye; he will protect and deliver his own and will disperse and destroy their assailants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.—Malachi 3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is written, “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God”; but Jehovah encourages his saints to prove him true to his promises by continuing in that course of faithfulness which merits the fulfilment of his good promises. The Lord in his temple is now purifying the “sons of Levi” that they may offer unto him an offering in righteousness. His command now goes to them: “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse.” A tithe is a tenth. Ten symbolizes all in an earthly sense; a tenth, or tithe, represents the whole and likewise symbolizes all. (Numbers 18:25-28) The Levites of old offered tithes to the high priest as unto the Lord. “The sons of Levi” who now bring their tithes, their earthly all, what blessings Jehovah pours down upon them from the windows of heaven!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind.—2 Kings 2:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Prophet Elijah and his companion, Elisha, both represented the same class of Christians but at different </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">periods</span><span class="font6"> in the church’s history, and pictured therefore different works to be done by the same people. A fiery chariot separated Elijah and Elijah, and Jehovah took Elijah away heavenward in a whirlwind. In the spring of 1918 the World War, pictured by the whirlwind, was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font6">its height. During this raging whirlwind fiery experiences arose in the chariot, the vehicle, the Watch Towee Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, throughout the earth; and a separation of the work to be done by the Elijah and the Elisha class was clearly marked. There was a sudden cessation of the work. The fiery experiences which came as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> result of the assault upon the Society and its work marked the dividing line of the two phases </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the work. The Elijah part of the church’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">work </span><span class="font6">ceased, to be followed by the Elisha work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth.’’—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Psalm 60:</span><span class="font6"> 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE day is here when Jehovah will make it known that he is the Mighty One who has placed his King upon his throne. To his faithful remnant class he says: “Ye are my witnesses, that I am God.” To these he gives a banner that it may be displayed because of the truth. A banner is a flag on a staff or standard which is held high that others may be guided thereby. The Lord has placed in the hands of his people his banner or standard of his kingdom, and he commands them to march with it toward the kingdom and to lift it up for the benefit of others. So clearly is the course of the saints marked out there can be no doubt about what they are to do. The message of truth is prepared in such form that all the saints may have a part in holding it forth to the glory of the Lord. Why does The Watch Tower repeatedly remind the saints of opportunities of service? Because this is the day when the truth must be proclaimed, and the Lord will have his people at all times made aware of their duties and privileges. Blessed is the Christian who joyfully seizes the banner of truth and lifts it high to the glory of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord I</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that 1 rise up for a testimony </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">[Rotherham </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font6"> LXX]; . . . </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.— Zephaniah 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord's obedient ones need wait no longer; for Jehovah has commanded the warring to cease firing temporarily and has risen up in his authority to give an unparalleled witness in the earth. The testimony to be given is to the effect that he is Jehovah, and that the world is his and the fulness thereof, and that he has set his King on his holy hill of Zion, .and that all earth’s inhabitants, the rulers and the ruled, should bow and render obedience to him as King of kings and Lord of lords; also that his judgment is to assemble the kingdoms and nations for destruction in the great battle of Armageddon. In this battle Jehovah will arise in the fulness of his power, and give a most impressive testimony to his deity and supremacy. Therefore let none delay any longer but go forth with Jehovah’s testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God . . . quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.—Romans 4:17. </span><span class="font6">Jehovah called Abraham “a father of many nations” when as yet he was not such. At the burning bush which Moses beheld at the mount of God, Jehovah called himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when in fact these patriarchs did. not exist but were dead. This manifests Jehovah’s utmost confidence in his own plans. It shows his own certainty that his callings and promises are sure of fulfilment. It expresses his own unchanging purpose never to deviate from the course outlined in his Word; not one jot or tittle shall go unkept. It evinces his own foreknowledge of what shall be according to his perfect and righteous plans. From this all may take consolation, knowing, however, that inasmuch as Jehovah hath called them to the heavenly kingdom he will surely give them a place therein if they are faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.— Nahum 1:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Jehovah reigneth.” In 1914 he set his kingly Son upon the throne as King of kings and Lord of lords. The beginning of his reign is while his enemies are still in power on the earth, and hence is accompanied by the storm clouds of disastrous trouble. “Clouds and darkness are round about him”; but the clouds are simply the dust stirred up by his feet, the outward indication of his steady march to victory. In due time he will raise up a great whirlwind from the coasts of the earth, and the slain of the Lord in that day shall be from one end of the earth to the other. This will be the way the Lord Jehovah will take to awe even Satan’s hosts with his might and to exalt his name above all and bring deliverance to enslaved and dying mankind. Wherefore “strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them of a fearful heart, Be strong.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall he with fM-m-ing torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Nahum 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Gentile Times under the supervision of the god of this world ended in August 1, 1914. Before that date it would not have been consistent for the Lord, the King of glory, to take unto himself his great power and reign. Since he has been present from 1874 it follows, from the facts as we now see them, that the period from 1874 to 1914 is the day of preparation. This in no wise militates against the thought that “the time of the end” is from 1799 until 1914. The period from 1799 to 1874 could not be said to be a day of preparation, but a day of increasing light. It is not reasonable to think that the King began to make preparations until he was present. The Elijah work was done under his supervision from 1874 forward, ending in 1918.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them,—Psalm SI/.:</span><span class="font6"> 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Elisha was at Dothan, performing the duties which God had laid upon him. He was beset by a great host of the enemy. Elisha had no fear, because he knew that God was with him. At that time there was surrounding Elisha, but invisible to others, an heavenly host there for his protection. Now the church is doing the Elisha w’ork at Jehovah’s command. The enemy has gathered in great force to make war against those who keep God’s commandments, bearing testimony to his name. But the Elisha class have no cause for fear, because God has surrounded them with a wall of perfect protection to shield them from the assaults of the enemy. This is the fight of Jehovah God, and not our fight. True, we are privileged to have part in the fight, but our part is to sing the praises of God with boldness and with joy, and God will see to it that his angels protect us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August JO</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">'It shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Matthew 10:19,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wherever the witness is to be given, and wherever Jehovah may bring his witnesses to deliver testimony to his name, we may be sure that the spirit of the Lord will be present to empower his witnesses. Not that Jehovah’s spirit will operate the tongue and lips of his servants mechanically, and cause them to utter things for which they have no moral responsibility before him; but if one is filled with the Lord’s spirit, that is, if one is willing to witness for Jehovah under extraordinary conditions and one’s love of the Lord is perfect and casts out fear of man which brings a snare, then Jehovah will display the power of his spirit in his servants. They will speak not their own message, but the things which Jehovah speaks in his Word and which he has made them to know and understand by the power of his spirit. He will bless their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">August 31</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Blessed is he that considereth the poor: The Lord will . . . keep him alive.&quot;—Psalm pl: 1&gt; %■</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">S</span><span class="font6">ATAN, through members of his organization, haa always oppressed the poor. The time draws near when his organization of oppressors shall be broken. That will be in the great time of trouble. The poor are not confined to those who-have little of money or goods, but the term embraces the poor in spirit who sigh for relief from the workers of iniquity. These are people of good will. Such the saints now consider, and endeavor to carry to them the message of truth. When God’s righteous indignation is expressed against the organization of Satan in the time of tribulation, such as never was upon the earth, those who have in obedience to God’s command considered the poor shall be kept in the hollow of God’s hand. This text seems particularly to apply to those honest peoples on earth who are now considerate of the poor and oppressed and who honestly endeavor to do them good. The promise is that they, because of their kindness, shall be blessed upon the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Doubtless there are those who are hearing the truth and believe it to an extent who will pass through the time of trouble and live for ever. It is the privilege of the saints now to enlighten such, and to tell them of God’s kingdom and how they may be of the millions living that shall never die and who may be of the class that shall early receive the benefits of the kingdom; to tell them also that their kind consideration of the poor will be remembered for their own good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest 1 come and smite the earth with a curse.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Malachi</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4- </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Elijah’s activities pictured a particular work done by the church under the supervision of her Head, Christ Jesus. It follows, then, that the Elijah work must be done between the beginning of the Lord’s presence and the day of smiting the earth with a curse. The effort was to convert Christendom to a humble, childlike condition, making them teachable as children, and turning their hearts from error, sin, and unfaithfulness, and leading them back into harmony with the great heavenly Father and the writings of his holy men of old. The work did not succeed in accomplishing this, but did fulfil Jehovah’s command: “Gather my saints together unto me, those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.” Because the Elijah work did not result in turning Christendom to the Lord, Jehovah cast off its systems in 1918; and now the earth is being smitten.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He malceth his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.— Matthew 5:^5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of the Millennium it is written that whosoever will not come up submissively to God’s organization, Jerusalem, to worship and serve the Lord, upon such there shall be no rain. Other natural blessings will be held from the refractory ones then, but during the present season Jehovah is showing forbearance and mercy even in the bestowal of the common blessings of nature. God exercises mercy. Mercy may be defined as a forbearance to inflict harm under circumstances of provocation when one has the power to inflict it. It is a compassionate treatment of another. It is pity put into action. The Apostle Paul exhorts the Christians in respect of showing mercy, saying, “Be ye imitators of God, as dear children,” “forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Xe </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">shall serve: I have given your priest’s office unto you as a service of gift.—Numbers 18:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has given both Jesus and the church, his body, the office of the priesthood. On the typical Atonement Day the high priest did the sacrificing. Serving with the high priest the underpriests would bring to the high priest that which was to be sacrificed. Christ Jesus is the great antitypical High Priest, and it is he who is offering up his body members as a part of his own sacrifice. The body members are counted in by him as a part of his sacrifice. No member of the body, while in the flesh, is qualified to offer anything unto God. That office of offering unto God belongs to Jesus Christ. His body members, when complete and glorified, will then become a part of the High Priest; and then, and not until then, will such body members participate in the sin-offering.. They participate by virtue of the fact that they are members of the body. But while in the flesh each one must do something in order to perform his covenant with Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God is no respecter of persons.—Acts 10:51).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a man each consecrating one gives up his right to live on earth as a perfect human being. Therefore it is apparent that the sacrifice of each and every justified one is exactly the same. Let no one then exalt himself in his own estimation by thinking that he has made a greater sacrifice than has his brother who is weak and unpolished. Let no poor, uneducated bne, without ability to make for himself a name or to accomplish much of anything else, be discouraged by thinking that his sacrifice as a man is much less than that of his abler brother. Up to this point Jehovah respects them exactly the same, so far as their sacrifice is concerned. They each have made a like covenant with him. The question thereafter is, Will each perform his covenant with faithfulness? The one who does perform his covenant with faithfulness will have an abundant entrance into the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.—Psalm 40: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The mere surrendering of something unto God at the loss of another is not that which is pleasing unto him. God never profits by reason of sacrifice. “I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.” (Psalm </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">69: </span><span class="font6">30, 31) ) It is the doing of the will of God that is pleasing to him. The pleasing part that the Christian performs is to heed God’s admonition as given through the Apostle Paul to present his body daily; that is to say, to keep himself always ready and on the alert to use all faculties with which he is endowed and which operate through his body, to the glory of God in the performance of his covenant. This is his “reasonable service”. He who does this with joy and rejoicing unto the end shall receive the glorious reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.—Job 33:88.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At this time the sick and afflicted human race is in the miserable and unhappy condition described by Job’s visitor, Elihu. Their souls verily draw near to the grave and their life to the destroyers who are preparing for the worst conflict of human history. Is there nothing we can do for them in their distresses and fears? Ah yes, indeed; for we can bear to them the enlightening and comforting message of God’s Word. We can assure them that Jehovah has sent a Messenger, to interpret God’s Word and make it plain, that they might know the only true God and Jesus Christ his Son, and go over the highway that leads to life. And if they now draw near to God through his Word, and find and accept their ransom, Jehovah may be gracious unto them and say: “Deliver him from going down to the pit.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Let </span><span class="font6">him not die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Whatsoever God doeth, it shall he for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it: and God doeth it that men should fear before him.&quot;— Ecclesiastes 8: Ilf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE works of Jehovah are complete in themselves. All his works are perfect. His works bear witness to the absolute supremacy of God. “To whom then will ye liken God, or what likeness will ye compare unto him?” He is the complete expression of wisdom, justice, love and power. He is worthy of the adoration and worship of all his creatures. He has made all his works complete, that man might reverence him. Why are there so few men who really reverence and serve the Lord ? The enemy has blinded most men, and they know not God. The evil cause dates from Eden. God has not prevented the exercising of this blinding influence by the enemy, knowing that in his own due time he will cause even this to magnify his glory. Now he is turning the light upon his plan that men who love him may know him. The masses of the people do not know God because ignorant of him and his works. Now he directs the saints on earth as his witnesses to declare to the people that he is God and to lift up to them his standard, that they may know the way that leads to life. All who are of the temple class will now delight to tell the people concerning the great God and the blessings that his kingdom now at hand will bring to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It came to pass, the selfsame day, that the Lord did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.—Exodus 12:51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Speaking of his deliverance of the children of Israel after the economic wrecking of Egypt and the bereavement of its firstborn, Jehovah says: “For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Soba for thee?’ It was at a tremendous ransom-cost to Egypt that God delivered his typical people. Though they were disposed to complain of the lengthening out of their oppressions, yet their deliverance was not delayed one day. Four hundred and thirty years to the day after Jehovah had made his covenant with their forefather, Abraham, he brought them forth. Let us be patient, then. Though some of our expectations as to what Jehovah would do at certain Biblically marked dates have not been realized, we may be sure that the plan of God, as revealed, is correct and will be worked out exactly on time. But with us, “Time is no more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.—Exodus 11:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The arm of Jehovah is as strong today as it was at the deliverance of Israel at the Bed Sea. In an apostrophe to it Isaiah speaks for us today: “Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the -waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?” The day of grander deliverance is now come, both for the antitypical firstborns of the Lord and for the people for whom Jesus died. Therefore can we take up the divinely inspired prayer: “Awake, awake, put on thy strength, 0 arm of the Lord; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon F’ Anfi confident in the coming fulfilment of this Scriptural prayer, we can joyfully announce deliverance at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Exodus 13:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“So didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name,” writes Isaiah (63:14). The glory of the Lord was manifest in the cloud. Seeing that there was an outward manifestation of God’s presence and favor upon his people when he brought them out of Egypt, many scriptures lead us to expect that the Lord will give some outward manifestation of his presence and favor to his faithful ones in the great impending conflict. It is very manifest that God intends his work to go forward to a full consummation, and that his remnant, which are the faithful ones, shall not again be scattered by evil powers or evil teachings. In shielding and preserving them from the enemy, God manifests his glory upon his own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In the same day, the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates.—Genesis 15:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let it be settled in the mind of each one that when God Almighty makes a covenant that covenant will never be forgotten but that its provisions will certainly be fulfilled in God’s due time. Over two thousand years before Christ’s birth Jehovah promised to give Abraham and his seed the land of Palestine. What though Abraham still sleeps in the grave and has not yet taken possession of the land, the period of the typical jubilees expired in 1925 and the regathering of the natural seed of Abraham to their homeland is taking place before our eyes. The rebuilding of Palestine is now beginning and is well under way, and gives the most trustworthy assurance that God’s covenant will be made good to Abraham. This alone should command the respectful attention of everyone believing that Jehovah is God. It should strengthen our faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices! wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.—Hebrews 8:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Has Jehovah ordained the new creature to sacrifice? No! The new creature does not sacrifice. He must perform his covenant with diligence, and that covenant is to do the will of God. Jehovah has ordained Christ Jesus the High Priest to offer up the consecrated one as a part of his own sacrifice. The office of offering unto God falls to Christ Jesus. The pait to be performed by the new creature, as an underpriest, is always to be ready and on the alert to do the will of God. Such is his reasonable service. It is the service that is reasonably required by his covenant. The performance of a reasonable service could not be a sacrifice on the part of the one rendering it. It is of the utmost and vital importance that every new creature in Christ Jesus carry out his reasonable service. The performance of service means the joyful obeying of God’s commands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.—1 Thessalonians 1:</span><span class="font6"> 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Holiness, unto which Jehovah has called us, is not merely a standard which the mind can reach up to and endorse, but one which must be attained. Absolute holiness, within the meaning of the Scriptures, must be attained by the overcoming Christian on this side the vail. It means that he must be pure in his thoughts and words and actions, insofar as that is possible with his imperfect organism; but it means much more than this. It means a complete and absolute devotion to Jehovah’s cause, prompted by love for him; it means the faithful performance of the Christian’s covenant as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">witness of the Lord. A Christian can, on this side the vail, refuse to sympathize with or support in any way the Devil’s organization; he can devote every faculty that he possesses to the support of and witness for God’s organization. By so doing he will attain to the standard </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">holiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">*1 will make him my firstborn, higher than the Icings of the earth.&quot;—Psalm 89:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HIS text, together with the context, is a prophecy relating to Christ. Anointed at the Jordan to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ba </span><span class="font6">King he was clothed with all power and authority at his resurrection. Abiding God’s due time for him to act against the enemy, the mighty King as God’s Executive Officer now goes to make war. The kings of earth have long been controlled by the invisible overlord Satan, but the time draws near when Satan shall ba shorn of his power and all of the peoples of earth shall become subject to Christ. God has placed his beloved Son upon his throne, and commands that all shall obey him because he is higher than all the kings of earth. Upon earth there are yet some of the feet members </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the Christ. These are commissioned to tell the people </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the blessed time now at hand that Jehovah is God, that Christ is King, and that the day of deliverance is here. To fulfil such commission seems to be the only reason why the last members of Christ are yet on the earth. The faithful will finish the work assigned to them, and then will be received into heavenly glory. The promise is to those who faithfully represent the Lord unto the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief.—Isaiah 53:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was while engaged in furnishing the sin-offering for our iniquities that God’s loyal Son Jesus was bruised and put to grief with what would have crushed any other man. It was not the pain of heart or feeling or of body that racked Jesus that was pleasing unto Jehovah. It was the demonstration of trustful, uncomplaining submission and active obedience on Jesus’ part that gave God warm pleasure; and this demonstration could not be made unless Jehovah had permitted Jesus to encounter bruises and grief here in this world of sin. In such testing and perfecting of the obedience of his dearest Son there was no heartlessness on Jehovah’s part; “for it became him [Jehovah], for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation [Jesus] perfect through sufferings.”—Hebrews 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lord, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, 0 Lord our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2 Chronicles H: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no restraint to Jehovah to save with many or with few. Jehovah has always won his battles with apparently overwhelming odds against his cause. This is because greater is he, the Almighty One, than all that can be arrayed against him and his, and because Jehovah would have no one glory in man but reserves the glory of the victory for himself. Thereby he wisely guards his people from vaunting themselves against him, saying, “Mine own hand hath saved me.” This fact should humble us and make us realize that Jehovah does not need us to accomplish his work nor to win his battles, but that he greatly honors us in granting us to enlist in his cause. This fact should also embolden us because, though we have no power of ourselves and go forth against a multitude, we have Jehovah with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord Icilleth, and maJceth alive: he bring eih </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">down </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">to the grave, and bringeth up.—1 Samuel 2: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To Lucifer in Eden was entrusted the power of death with respect to man, but the exigencies of the case caused Jehovah to intervene and to pronounce sentence, upon Adam and to execute that death sentence upon him. In his justice and in vindication of the honor of his name and his word, Jehovah brought Adam down to the grave. In minor strains we praise this wonderful manifestation of his justice, but in melodies of faith and joy we praise him for his mercy and love in his good purposes to bring back and make alive again. He spared not his Son from death, but by greatness of power brought him up again from the grave. By this he furnished the ransom for all that are in their graves, and gave assurance that in the fulness of his times he shall display his power in Christ by bringing them up from the graves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should, come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour.-—Joshua 11:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is according to the plan and purpose of Jehovah to let the hardness of men’s hearts continue and increase in opposition to his program of deliverance for mankind. In the days of old did he not let the iniquity of the Amorites fill the measure of the cup before he brought Israel into the land and destroyed them ? Thereby the righteousness of his act was vindicated. Further, the hardness of Satan’s organization has proved the mettle and faithful endurance of his saints today, because it becomes necessary for them to be bold and persevering and to fight; and it manifests the worthiness of Satan’s organization to no divine favor but to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">destroyed utterly. Jehovah’s little army in the earth should not be dismayed. He has left them apparently unprotected in order that their hardened enemies might come against them in final battle only to be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them ail that 1 shall command him.—Deuteronomy 18:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah will not for ever leave the groping masses </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">mankind to seek unto the observers of times, the diviners, the enchanters, the necromancers, and clergy </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Satan’s dominion in their blind attempts to know the divine will and to get into harmony with the Supreme One. He has promised to raise up in their behalf </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">prophet of truth, who really represents Jehovah and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font6">ordained to be mediator between God and man. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">He has </span><span class="font6">put his words into the mouth of this prophet, and by him he shall bring all the teachable out from under </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">deceptions of the evil one and his servants and unto </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font6">accurate knowledge of the truth. The Christ, Head </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">body, is this great Prophet and Mediator like unto, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">yet </span><span class="font6">greater than, Moses. During the Gospel Age God </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font6">been gradually raising up this prophet. Soon mem</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">bership in </span><span class="font6">this mediatorial body will be complete, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">blessings will begin to flow to benighted mankind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.— Psalm 2: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people vainly imagine that present world powers can bring their desire by giving them a government of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">peace </span><span class="font6">and happiness. At the same time the ruling factors of the present evil world take counsel together a</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">gainst </span><span class="font6">Jehovah and against his anointed </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">One. </span><span class="font6">Their efforts will be in vain. The time has come that Jehovah </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font6">placed his King upon the throne. He has set him upon the <sup>ft</sup>hill”, or highest position of authority relative to his kingdom. Ours is therefore a transition peri</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">od ;</span><span class="font6"> and what a wonderful time it is for us </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to be </span><span class="font6">on </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">earth!

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.&quot;—1 Peter 5:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font6"> PROUD person is one who overrates his own excellencies and becomes presumptuous before the Lord and therefore lawless. Such will not be submissive to the ways of the Lord. A humble person does not think too highly of himself. He has full faith and confidence that the Lord is at the helm and capable of handling his own affairs; that he causes his work to be done according to his own good way and that he has but one way. Such humbly and gladly submit to the Lord. The proud ones do not progress in the light shining upon the divine plan, but in due course lose the spirit of the Lord and of the truth because God resists them. The humble ones are the constant recipients of God’s favor. They rejoice that the trurh is the Lord’s, and delight to honor him as the author of all truth. They humbly ask and receive increased light and greater blessings because they love the Lord and prove their love for him by joyfully keeping his commandments. Such do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 am the Lord which sanctify you.—Leviticus 20: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The word sanctification in Scriptures usage properly means set apart for a holy purpose. The purpose of God is a holy one; namely, the selection of joint-heirs with Christ to reign with him in his kingdom for the blessing of all the families of the human race. All associated with Christ must be holy. Christ was holy, $nd everyone joined with him must be set apart to that holy purpose. Anyone connected, therefore, with this part of Jehovah’s great plan would have to be separated Unto this holy purpose or work, be fully sanctified. In all this, however, Jehovah does not coerce anyone. Before appointing any to a position of glory, honor and immortality he enlists their willing and hearty cooperation by informing them of his plan for them and by setting before them joys and rewards.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In my distress 1 called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 18:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.” (Habakkuk 2:20) But the earthly organization of Satan will not keep silence for long. When this gospel of the kingdom has been preached in all the world to the limit, then a tumult will arise again. The floods of ungodly men will menace God’s organization, symbolized by Jerusalem, in the attempt io frighten the saints and overcome and take them captive. In their distress it is the privilege of God’s remnant to cry unto the Lord. His countenance doth behold the upright, and their voice he will hear out of his temple. Then the earth shall shake and tremble </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">Jehovah goes forth and fights against those nations beleaguering Jerusalem. He will deliver his faithful remnant, and they shall not be cut off from the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He came with ten thousands of his saints. . . . Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand.— Deuteronomy 33: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moses told the people of Israel that were then before him. that Jehovah loves them, and that the reason why he loves them is that he loves them (What better reason can anybody give for loving anybody that he truly loves?) and because he would keep his promise to their fathers. It is easy to comprehend the reasons for God’s great love for his only-begotten Son, Jesus, but we like Israel do not find so many reasons for him to love us, his saints. Nevertheless, he does love us; and all the expressions of love to natural Israel come with peculiar force to apply to those whom natural Israel typified. For this reason the saints may unwaveringly trust that Jehovah will hold them in the hollow of his hand </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">they now seek to proclaim the words which they </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font6">ceived while sitting at his feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord fought for Israel.—Joshua 10:1</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because the cause of his people is really his cause, the Lord did the fighting; and more were they that fell as a result of the miraculous storm of hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword. Thus victory crowned the day for Israel. This reminds the Christians that the present fight is not their fight, but it is really God’s fight against the Devil’s organization, and that in his due time he will clear out that organization completely. Happy are we that we do not have to fight with carnal weapons, but that this warfare means battling for the truth and standing firmly for the Lord under the most trying and adverse conditions with full faith that if we abide in him we shall stand victorious with him at the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">My sons, be not now negligent: far the Lord hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—S Chronicles $9: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wondrous thoiight! We are not to be made ministers </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the world; but Jehovah has chosen his sons, the anointed Christ, to stand before him to serve him; and their loving devotion to him rises upward to him as a sweet incense. God encourages his sons in diligence, and commands diligence. He looks with disfavor upon negligence. Diligence and fervency show a heart appreciation of God’s favors and a loving devotion to him. God’s sons are now, while on earth, to be diligent as witnesses that Jehovah is God. If they keep faithful to death, they will enter into Jehovah’s sanctuary to minister unto him, and be associated with his beloved Son in the reconstruction and blessing of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">All thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children.—Isaiah 51:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is the children of Zion, God’s organization, of whom Jehovah is the teacher. In the Psalms he encourages us with the promise: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font6"> will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go.” These words cannot apply to the individual. No one can claim the precious promises until he becomes a member of the church. The promise is that Jehovah will teach his church. With this thought in mind let us remember that Jehovah will reveal to his church his great truth when he sees it is good for her to have the same. No man is entrusted with the interpretation of the Scriptures which contain Jehovah’s written teachings. The Scriptures are not of private interpretation. The Lord is his own interpreter, and he uses such instrument as he may choose to bring to the children of his organization the things that he desires them to have. What peace and assurance it gives us to know that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we are </span><span class="font6">being taught of Jehovah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“He hath shewea his people the power of his works.”— Psalm 111: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">H</span><span class="font6">IS people are members of the Christ, God’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">new </span><span class="font6">creation. This text is a prophecy, and applies approximately at the end of the age. These favored and faithful ones have been privileged to see the power of the works of Jehovah in advance of others. Many professed Christians throughout the age have been greatly engrossed with the things of this world, which is the Devil’s organization. These were influenced in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">measure by that organization. Now the saints see </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font6">evil organization in its true light, and at the same time see the mighty , works of the great Jehovah and that his due time is at hand to make for himself </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">name in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There must be a reason why the Lord God has shown his people these wonderful things. The Psalmist gives the reason: “That he may give them the heritage of the nations.” The greatest blessing that could come to any one is to be made a member of the royal family </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">heaven. But members of the anointed class should always keep in mind that before God will exalt them to heavenly power and glory they must be gladly submissive to him and must prove their faithfulness by loving and joyful devotion to the Lord. For this reason the Servant Class now see that it is of utmost importance to the Christian to be engaged in the Lord’s service. Such have </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">clearer vision of God’s wonderful works and the blessing that these will bring to the children of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tea, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Nehemiah 9:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is a testimony to the faithfulness of God’s providing for the congregation of his people in the wilderness. About 1874 the true church began to announce the second coming of Christ Jesus and the setting up of his kingdom. This, of course, was in harmony with God’s will and was the command of the Lord. Then and there the saints began with zeal and energy their journey toward the kingdom. In 1914 they reached the mountain of God’s kingdom, from whence the law of the new covenant will be proclaimed. During all the intervening forty years of journeying did the church lack anything? The experience of the church stands as a faithful monument of testimony: “They lacked nothing.” Then let hot our faith in God’s providence for the future fail us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">September 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; . . . And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the Lord.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Exodus lli.: SO, 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After Jehovah had overthrown the pursuing hosts of Satan’s world power, Egypt, in the Red Sea, a song of deliverance was sung unto the Lord, extolling the mercies of God. In a more wonderful sense will a song be sung when Jehovah has delivered mankind from the thraldom of Satan’s empire and has placed them upon the highway that they may journey back in holiness to endless peace and happiness. Then in a fuller sense may it be said: “Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.” (Exoous 15:13) This will be true when the Christ has guided to the end of the Millennium the people who obev and when Jehovah has received them into the blessedness of his eternal kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?—Job 38: 22,23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has stored up great treasures of natural forces which he has used and still purposes to use in a supernatural way to glorify his name. In the visitation of the plagues upon the land of Egypt to effect the deliverance of his chosen people, he “sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground”. In fighting to victory for Israel at the city of Gibeon, he oast down great stones of hail upon the Canaanites and slew more therewith than the children of Israel slaughtered with carnal weapons. Jehovah purposes to be wroth again as in the valley of Gibeon; and against that day of battle and war he has reserved his treasures of hail. He has decreed that “the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies”. Have you entered into the treasures of the hail since the temple of God has been opened 111 heaven? (Revelation 11:19) Or have you withheld your hand?</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">My Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he tdketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.—John 15:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has planted the Christ vine to accomplish his great work in the earth. He takes personal interest in the care of this vine. The fruit for which he is looking is not character so-called, nor is it the fruit of the spirit. It is really the outgrowth of the possession of the fruit of the spirit, love. The chief office of a vine is to bear fruit that by its wine it may cheer God and man. (Judges 9:13) Correspondingly, Jehovah has planted his vine, the Christ company, that it may cheer him by its obedience in 'showing forth the praises of him who hath called them out of darkness into his marvelous light’; and also cheer men by bearing to them the knowledge of Jehovah and his glorious kingdom for making them everlastingly happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Arise, 0 Lord; let not man prevail; let the heathen be judged in thy sight. Put them in fear, 0 Lord;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">that the nations may know themselves to be but men.—Psalm 9:19,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The battle is being joined more closely day by day; and men, particularly the human ruling factors serving in the Devil’s organization, would, and verily think they can, prevail over the Lord’s cause. While they in comparison with Jehovah God apparently do not recognize themselves to be but men of dust, yet God’s remnant should not forget that “the shepherds and the principal of their flock” are merely puny men, and should therefore not be ensnared by the fear of man but be bold and uncompromising in giving testimony to the rulers of the world as well as to the ruled. Man shall not prevail; but shortly God will arise in his strength amid Armageddon’s tumult and will display his power and supremacy in such awe-inspiring manner that the nations will fear and know themselves to be creatures of clay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.—Psalm 24: 7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now the time has come in which Satan’s wicked systems are to be dashed to pieces. The members of the church on earth do not do this work of dashing to shivers. They are not the ones who will bind Satan and destroy his power. Matched against him they of themselves are too weak. Who will do this mighty work? The King of glory. Who is he? “Jehovah of hosts, be is the King of glory.” He is the Almighty One, stronger than the strong one, Satan. He never lost a battle. Beholding the King of glory majestically marching on to victory and to the deliverance of suffering humanity, God’s remnant cannot keep back their songs of elation and praise. Jehovah finds them joyfully willing to be used as his witnesses to make known the glories of his kingdom to the oppressed people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Known unto God are all his works, from the be ginning of the world.’’—Acts 15:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font6">HILE it is necessarily true that the knowledge of God is without limitation at all times it is certain that this text has reference to his plan for the salvation of mankind. At the beginning of the world man’s overlord was Lucifer. It seems quite reasonable that God would make his plan at that time in the alternative; that is to say, if man should prove faithful a certain course should be followed, but if man should fall, a different course would be taken by the Lord in dealing with him. Man would therefore be morally free to choose right or wrong. Predestination would not enter into the matter. The facts show that man chose the wrong course and from the very beginning God knew all the details of his plan for the full recovery of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From then till now God has been carrying forward his plan. The seed according to his promise, through which salvation and blessing shall come, is The Christ. While everything of value that is accomplished for the salvation of man is through Christ Jesus the beloved Son, God has graciously provided that there shall be members of his body which are taken from amongst men. The approved ones among such wholly devote their lives to the Lord and it is their real joy to obey his commands. The great program of God is now reaching a climax; and the remnant on earth in obedience to his command delight to proclaim to the people that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is the means of relief and blessing for the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.—Romans 11: 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As we view the varied features of Jehovah’s plan, we exclaim in the language of the Apostle Paul: “0 the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out I” For centuries now the Jews as a nation have been shut up in unbelief, that God’s tender mercies in the way of kingdom favors and opportunities might be extended to the Gentiles. God is under no obligation to the Jews, and yet he has arranged that his mercies on those whom he calls to the kingdom from the Gentiles should rebound in mercies upon Israel when he removes Israel’s blindness. The time for showing mercy upon Israel at the hands of the kingdom class is now begun. God has given us a message of comfort and enlightenment for Israel. Let us who have received God’s mercies at the expense of the Jews show mercy in turn upon the Jews: “Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: . . . Thy right hand, 0 Lord, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, 0 Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Exodus 15:1,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It is a</span><span class="font6"> great consolation to the hearts of God’s remnant to have this picture described “aforetime” to assure them that in the approaching struggle Jehovah God is certain to triumph. That which is required of the remnant is that they, having been called and chosen, should thenceforth be faithful unto death. With complete confidence in Jehovah and his right hand of power, the Christian can joyfully go forward in the battle, notwithstanding that the enemy is strong and great. He knows that he is right, and that he who is for him is greater than all that can be against him. He seeks not to exalt himself but to exalt and magnify the Lord and to declare his name and his great plan unto the people</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hen the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Exodus 16:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each day of theii journey Jehovah supplied Israel with his daily bread. It was a miraculous supply, coming from heaven, and in “a land of deserts and pits; ... a land of drought, and of the shadow of death; ... a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt”. Jehovah gave them of “the corn of heaven” and “every one did eat the bread of the mighty”. More miraculously yet, Jehovah has in a grander and more vital sense sent down bread from heaven. The Israelit-ish fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead. He that eats of this latter bread shall live for ever. Mankind does not know what it is; but the Lord’s servant class has the privilege of announcing to starving mankind that it is Jesus, “the living bread.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Exodus 32:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Everything upon or about the two tables of the Mosaic law was of Jehovah. He is the one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. On the stony tablets the finger of God wrote according to all the words which the Lord spake with Israel in the mount, out of the midst of the fire, in the day of their assembly there. Writing the law on stone did not effect any writing of it in the hearts of Israel; but the days come that Jehovah will put his law into the inward parts and they will not need to wear phylacteries bearing written portions of the law or to write them upon the posts of their houses and on their gates. He will take away the heart of stone, and give mankind a heart of flesh and will write his law in their hearts. He will then be their God; and they will be his people, because his law will be enthroned in their hearts’ affections and they will keep it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. . . . My name is in him.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Exodus 23:20,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In all Jehovah’s dealings with his natural people, Israel, he used angels in an official or representative capacity. In the text above, the Lord Jehovah promised that his executive officer, invisible to the eyes of the host of Israel, would be their guardian and protector if they would obey him. Thus he foreshadows that his heavenly messengers are faithfully looking after the interests of spiritual Israel. They are the official friends of the church. When one of the Lord’s little ones goes forth in the proclamation of the King’s message, he may feel absolute rest and confidence in the Lord, because his official protector walks by his side to shield him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.— Deuteronomy 32: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord takes foreknowledge of his own, and makes all due preparation and provision for them. Jehovah foreknew the natural seed of Abraham; and because he Purposed to use them in making types and pictures of etter things to come to the mass of humankind, he let his eyes fall on a land “flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all nations”. For their sakes he cared for it from one end of the year to the other (Deuteronomy 11:12), and so disposed the habitations of the nations of earth that Israel might have it. He did so because he took Israel to him to be a peculiar treasure to him above all i.he peoples of the earth. The same Jehovah has appointed the earth as man’s inheritance, but has prepared a fair habitation, the glory of the universe, for spiritual Israel, the new creation. He will not permit men or heavenly beings to interfere with their getting </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;All things are delivered unto me of my Father,&quot; —Matthew 11: 21,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE “all things” here mentioned seem clearly to refer to God's provision for the salvation of man. The people had listened to the teachings of the Jewish clergy, but without profit. John the Baptist had come and announced himself as the forerunner of the Messiah. God’s anointed One now stood in their presence, the One to whom God had committed every thing pertaining to the salvation of the people. Jesus would have those then hearing him know that he is the only way, and that it was folly for them to follow further the clergy of that time. He then invites those laden with burdens to come unto him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What was then true has since been true; to wit, that there is no other name given under heaven whereby salvation comes to man. Christ and his kingdom alone is the hope of the people. A knowledge of this fact must </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">given to the people. The Lord has constituted his faithful body members on earth his ambassadors to tell the people of Jehovah’s plan of salvation. These Christians were not given the truth merely to enable them to prepare to go to heaven, but for the purpose of affording Opportunity to prove their faithfulness and devotion to the Lord. Those really devoted to the Lord forget self, and with unselfish devotion to the cause of Jehovah Joyfully proclaim that he is God, that Christ is King, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and that the </span><span class="font6">means of salvation is in God’s appointed way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">When he bring eth again [margin] the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, Let all the angels of God worship him.—Hebrews 1: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The selection of The Stone, the anointing and the laying of the foundation of the world, that is to say, the new heavens and the new earth, took place at the time of Jesus’ baptism in the Jordan. The laying in miniature of The Stone in Zion, the &quot;tried” and proven One, took place three and a half years thereafter, when Jesus presented himself to the Jews as their King. The evidence is therefore conclusive that God’s anointed King is The Stone and that the laying of The Stone is the presentation of the King to those over whom he is to rule. The fulfilment of all this in completion has come in our day. In 1914 Jesus began his activity as ?riest of the Most High God and as the anointed King, n 1918 he came to his temple; and to all professed spiritual Israelites Jehovah offered him as King, which act constituted the laying of The Stone in Zion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Christ Jesus, ... of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Corinthians 1: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has made Christ Jesus wisdom unto us in two ways, viz., by precept and by example. As Spokesman of Jehovah the Lord Jesus gives precepts. He also took the proper course, leaving us the example that we are to follow in his steps. Our justification from Jehovah comes because of the imputed merit of Jesus, who as High Priest presents us to God; and thus is he made righteousness unto us. The justified ones Jehovah begets by his spirit and anoints them by receiving them into the body of Christ, thus sanctifying them to his own </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">use. </span><span class="font6">The standing, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font6">instantaneous one, of the anointed ones is in Christ Jesus; and thereby he is made unto us sanctification. By pursuing the wise and faithful course </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in Jesus’ </span><span class="font6">footsteps we shall become conformed to his image, and Jehovah will raise us up by him in the first resurrection.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">&quot;The whole world lieth in the wicked one”; and as he speaks, so it speaks. The ruling factors speak </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">language of lies and religious hypocrisy to the people. The people speak a language of hate, jealousy, fear, pride, malice, envy, vanity, and false religion to one another. They draw near to God with sanctimonious language and call upon him; but their language is impure and foreign to him because their hearts are estranged from him. After the fire of Jehovah’s jealousy has devoured the visible earthly organization of Satan, then the Lord’s kingdom shall purify the people and convert their language, their methods of intercourse, to a pure form by bringing them all to a knowledge of the truth. They shall learn to know and love Jehovah, and sincerely desire to serve him unitedly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.— Psalm 105:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This has been the course of Jehovah from the days of Abraham and the patriarchs down to the present. Till their work is done he preserves those whom he has anointed and made his prophets, his mouthpieces. His preservation of the anointed class, the Christ company, during the Gospel Age has been nothing short of miraculous. Jehovah has not considered even the mighty kings of earth above deserving reproof when it comes to touching injuriously those whom he tenderly regards as the apple of his eye. God’s unfolding Word shows that his anointed mouthpieces must at this time, and before Armageddon breaks, deliver a testimony to the rulers of the world order. They should not be abashed at the austerity or the outward dignity of these earthly potentates, because the Lord purposes to punish the high ones and the kings; but his faithful witnesses he protects.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">send me.—Isaiah 6:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">St. Paul asks the question: &quot;How shall they preach, except they be sent?” It is God who sends the messengers of truth. When Isaiah had the vision of the Lord in his temple, he cried out: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Woe</span><span class="font6"> is me! for I am undone.” It seems clear that his uncleanness, which he confessed, had something to do with the words of his mouth, or rather words which he had failed to speak. He recognized that he ought to be praising God, as the seraphim were doing. His penitent cry led to purgation. Isaiah’s mouth was cleansed by a live coal of fire taken off the altar. This indicates that in harmony with the work done by the Refiner since 1918 in refining the sons </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Levi, their lips were purged; that is, the temple class was awakened to the fa.ct that greater activity should be manifested in representing the Lord. Henceforth they zealously manifested their willingness to be sent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 110:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah took Jesus away from earth, the place </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">activity of his enemies, and seated him in the position </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">favor in heaven. The enemy Satan continued his nefarious operations without interference; but this </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font6">to be permitted only until a fixed time in the Father’s plan. Jesus, of course, observed the efforts of the enemy; but he must patiently wait upon the Father until the due time to act. He possessed all power in heaven and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">earth, but he was not to use it against the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Devil until </span><span class="font6">the order for action came from Jehovah. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Now the time </span><span class="font6">limit has expired in 1914, and God’s wrath has come since 1918. Very soon he will triumph in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Armageddon’s </span><span class="font6">conflict, and make the enemies the footstool </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of Christ | </span><span class="font6">and then the Lord will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">begin the stupendous work of restoring the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">'&quot;The Lord taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.”—Psalm 149:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE people of God here mentioned are those wholly devoted to him. These follow in the ways of the truth not for selfish reasons, but because they delight to serve God. They are meek because they think of themselves only as the favored servants of the Most High. Their delight is to honor his name, lenowing that the reward he will grant will be far greater than they could now imagine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Perfect love is the perfect expression of unselfishness; therefore no one can be perfect in love unless he unselfishly devotes himself to the Lord. For this reason the Scriptures declare that in the day of judgment upon the nations, which day is now here, the faithful will boldly declare the message of truth. They will not fear, because their love is perfect. The Lord takes pleasure in such. This pleasure he manifests by placing them under his protection; and in the day of his wrath against </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">evil one’s organization God completely shields </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">preserves his own. Unto such he will be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">crown </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">glory and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">diadem of beauty. The faithful remnant walk in the light, and see these great truths as the Lord reveals them. Their faith is increased because they appreciate the garments of salvation and the robe of righteousness which the Lord has provided for them in this day. They have entered into the joy of the Lord, and together they lift </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">up the voice with singing. God takes delight in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, . . . be glory and majesty, dominion and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Jude 24, £5-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Likely our guardian angels, who have ministered to us as heirs of salvation, will be the first to greet us beyond the vail. That will be a happy meeting. Doubtless these angels will instruct us with reference to being presented to Jehovah, because they have access to the courts of heaven. Then will follow the “general assembly [of the] church of the firstborn”, whose names are written in heaven, when we shall meet our “altogether lovely” Bridegroom. Finally will come the crowning experience, the granting of the “one thing [we] have desired of the Lord”: for the Lord Jesus will present us without spot and faultless before the throne of God and we shall “behold the beauty of Jehovah”, the Seat, strong and loving One who has kept us from</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hing and resurrected us faultless characters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God has chosen the foolish things of the world, to confound the wise; . . . and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 Corinthians 1: 27,28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sometimes the question is asked: Why is it that persons of slight education in the ordinary walks of life, who have no particular influence among men, would even pretend to present the message of truth ? And why is it, that when they do, it is clearly and lucidly presented and puts to flight and to shame the learned theologians who are professed followers of the Lord ? God’s own Word answers: It is because Jehovah has chosen them and has put his words into their mouths; and his spirit, operating on their minds and hearts, makes them bold ana strong in the Lord, with the ability to make clear the message of the truth now revealed. Jehovah charges them: “Speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces.”—Jeremiah 1:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">as</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">semble the outcasts of Israel,—Isaiah 11:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Au ensigu means a flag or signal, banner or beacon, which is a token of relief or deliverance. This text shows that when the inhabitants of the earth are in distress and perplexity, when the storms of adversity are beating upon the people and they mourn and cry unto the Lord for relief, Jehovah will set up an ensign for the people of the nations. This ensign or beacon light is the Christ and his message of the kingdom for the deliverance and blessing of mankind. He is the embodiment of light and truth, and is crowding the enemy to the wall, and soon will make known to the world the complete victory of truth. Now he is raising the ensign of truth for the benefit of those that have a desire for righteousness, that they may be safely led over the dark morass into paths of light and truth. Blessed are the saints whom he uses to deliver the glad message now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in, from this time forth, and even for evermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 121: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord Jehovah hereby encourages his children to trust confidently in him, to keep themselves in his love and to hold fast that which they have. It would be reasonable to look forward to a time when error would no longer be permitted to blind God’s people, and to expect that that time would come during the presence of the Lord Jesus, at his appearing to claim his own. The Psalmist evidently refers to this time when he wrote: “The rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.” To that end Jehovah specially guards his servant class since 1918; for then the great adversary </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font6">cast out of heaven </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">came down </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">earth, having great wrath. From that time forth, yea, even for evermore, Jehovah preserves them as they go </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">and out in their activities in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.—James 1: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is “the only (vise God”. To his spirit-begotten ones he says: “Bo not wise in thine own eyes.” “My son, attend unto my wisdom.” The sincere Christian, desiring to keep this counsel and to grow in wisdom, is instructed to go to Jehovah in prayer, believing that he will reward him, asking in faith through the merit of Christ Jesus; then to study the Word of God and diligently apply his mind and heart to gain a knowledge thereof. Every question that may arise in his mind concerning his course he will find answered according to the fixed rules of the Lord as set forth in the Bible. And rendering himself in obedience to the commandments and fixed rules of Jehovah will make him wise according to the divine standard. “The wise shall inherit glory.”—Proverbs 3: 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Who maketh his angels spirits: his ministers a flaming fire.—Psalm 10^:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God made the angelic beings. They must be lovable spirit creatures, fair to behold, and gloriously imaging their heavenly Father, so that he is well pleased to gram; them access to behold his face. The revealed record shows that he sends angels on important missions as his messengers and ambassadors, to represent his cause and to act as executive officers in the carrying out of his holy will. Once he sent an angel to appear unto Moses as a flaming fire and deliver a message of coming deliverance. It should thrill the heart of man to realize and appreciate that angels are not mere myths, but are mighty creatures, acting in an official capacity in carrying out God’s orders; and that men who devote themselves to the Lord are privileged to be used with thesa invisible and mighty ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 26</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The desert shall rejoice. and blossom as the rose.&quot; —J sniah. 85; 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isaiah 55:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HESE texts relate to the completion of Jehovah’s work in the deliverance of man. God having made the earth for the habitation of man, when the obedient men of earth are restored to perfection the earth will be a place of real delight. The desert, now parched and barren, will then yield its increase; and its beauty and fragrance will be like the newblown rose. No thorn shall then encumber the ground, nor any brier disturb the feelings of the tiller of the soil. Instead, the earth shall bring forth trees and plants of beauty, and shall yield fruit for the pleasure and sustenance of man. Then will the footstool of Jehovah be glorious. The things of earth in full harmony with the things of heaven will join in endless praise of the Master Workman. By faith the saints are shown these things in advance. They enjoy them by anticipation, and will delight to see the peoples of earth enjoy them in God’s due time. It is the privilege of the saints to now tell the people of these coming blessings and thus bear witness to the goodness of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you: ... I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Genesis 9: 9,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rainbow is a work of Jehovah, who causes the rain to f</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">all</span><span class="font6"> and the beams of sunshine to stream through the curtain of mist and moisture. He has set the bow in the cloud to serve as a token of the covenant he has made with Noah and, through him, with all descendants of his who dwell upon, the earth. Thus Jehovah has given visible evidence and confirmation to all mankind, which they can read for themselves, that never again need man fear deluge of waters or the chilling spread of a glacial ice-cap. That evidence shall abide as long as the rain continues to fall, the sun to shine. The bow in the clouds is a reassuring and consoling testimony in iridescent colors of the goodness, and faithfulness of Jehovah, the Father of lights. Enthroned in glory, he sits as though with a rainbow encircling him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.—Isaiah 13:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These ones are sanctified through the blood of Jesus, set aside for God’s holy purposes, made mighty through the Lord because of having on the armor of God, and are soldiers under a Captain who knows no defeat. They are called to be associated with their Head in declaring God’s vengeance. They rejoice in Jehovah’s highness, and at the same time are impressed profoundly with their own and other men’s littleness. Clearly Jehovah’s command rings in their ears: “Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain!” This means to lift up the message announcing the King and his kingdom. “Exalt the voice unto them, wave the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.” Use the voice and the might of the hands in earnestly and clearly proclaiming the message to all that have hearing ears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Psalm 110:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rod is the sceptre of authority and power rightfully reposed in Jehovah’s beloved Son. Jehovah sent the rod out of Zion, his organization, in 1914; whereupon Jesus Christ, the King, stood up and assumed his power and authority and began his reign even while his enemies were and still are exercising power, although their right thus to do has expired. Necessarily this marked the beginning of the battle in heaven by God’s loyal Son and his angels on one side, and Satan, the old Dragon, and his angels on the other side. It is the fight of God Almighty in heaven against the Devil, God’s forces being led by his beloved Son. The purpose is to subdue the enemy and make them the footstool of Jesus Christ the King. “Therefore rejoice, ye heavens,” and let saints on earth catch up the rejoicing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">No man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.—Hebrews 5:</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has called or designated Jesus as an high priest of the Melchizedekian order. Our Savior is therefore the Head of the royal priesthood. He did not place himself in that position. “Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee.” Mel-chizedek was a priest of the great Most High, and pictures the One who is superior to the Levitical priesthood and the blesser of Abraham. He is fittingly a picture, therefore, of the great Executor of the divine plan. The church, by virtue of its Head, is a part of the Melchize-dek priesthood. God has called them to this honorable station. Faithfulness now in the performance of their duties gives assurance that they shall be members </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">this glorious priestly order for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">set watchmen over you. saying. Hearken to the sound of the trumpet.—Jeremiah. 6: 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Amongst all the consecrated, spint-begotten ones who compose. Jehovah's organization on earth, represented by Jerusalem, there is a faithful “remnant” class who because of their course of conduct are called watchmen. They are the ones who are wholly devoted to the Lord and who have their heart set upon the establishment of his kingdom. They are not particular about conventionalities and daily formalities, knowing that these do not prepare them for the kingdom. They are concerned with watching the movements of the Lord and with diligently performing their part of the covenant entered into with God, that they might glorify him and have his approval. They are of that class of “young men [who] see visions” of what Jehovah is doing and wants done. They are unselfishly interested in the welfare of their spiritual brethren, and sound the trumpet of the Lord’s Word to warn them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. —Romans 12:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is the only one who has the authority to inflict punishment. His spirit does not authorize any one Christian to act as a prosecuting or a persecuting officer of another in the body of Christ. Not even has an ecclesia of the Lord’s people the right delegated to it to impose punishment. Jehovah has reserved this power to himself. If then there is evidence that one is begotten and anointed of the holy spirit, let everyone hesitate to act hastily in punishing that brother. For instance, some will go to a meeting of the Lord’s people with the determination to humiliate a brother by relegating him to a position of inferiority or inactivity. Such is not the spirit of the Lord. The Lord said: “Touch not mine anointed.” Degradation or promotion comes from Jehovah.—Psalm 76:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;He revealeth the deep and secret things”—Dan. 2:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">N</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font6">MAN can understand the secret things </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Jehovah until his due time to reveal them. These secret things he reveals to those who reverence him. Daniel worshiped God in sincerity. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font6">pleased God to use Daniel to give a brief outline of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">world powers which should arise in successive order and all of which shall go down in the great battle of God Almighty. That which executes God’s judgment against these world powers is The Stone, Jehovah’s anointed King. His power extends to all the earth and all nations, kindred and peoples must become subj’ect to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These great secrets, first made known to Daniel, have been little understood by men; but now the day is come when it pleases God to make known to his devoted servants some of his deep and secret things pertaining to the establishment of his kingdom. The great Jehovah commands those who love him to prove it by going forth and bearing witness to the fact that he is God, and that the day is at hand when the secret things of salvation shall be revealed to all who will love and obey the Lord,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curs-eth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.—Genesis 12:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this text Abraham is a type of Jehovah, from whom the blessing of all creatures derives. Here is Jehovah’s unqualified declaration of his purpose to produce a seed through which he will bless all the families of the earth, even Abraham included. The mere fact that therein we find the expression of the divine will is conclusive proof that the same will be carried out to the letter and spirit regardless of what any of God’s creatures might do. The Abrahamic promise is a unilateral covenant, which means that its accomplishment by Jehovah does not depend upon whether any one else performs. It is Jehovah’s work. God gave his word and his oath, and beyond his word there is no controversy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord gave the word; great was the company of those that published it.—Psalm 68:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Having bidden the nations to cease warring and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">silent till the Elisha work is done, Jehovah gave the word; that is, the message that Christ’s kingdom is now established and that the King is here to bless. What shall his anointed company do with this word which he has spoken ? The scripture replies: &quot;The Lord God hath spoken, who can but prophecy ?” How then can we hold back from publishing the word spoken? How can we clear ourselves of our responsibilities except that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font6">prophesy and preach this gospel of the kingdom in all the world for a witness unto all nations ? The proclamation does not wait upon any individuals: It &quot;shall be preached”, Jesus said. Let us take the matter to heart, and joyfully avail ourselves of the opportunity and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">among the myriads of the Elisha company that publish the word that Jehovah, and not man, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">has given.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.—John 5:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judgment means a judicial determination. The one to whom judgment is committed must have authority and jurisdiction to hear all cases and to enter a finding or decree and to execute that decree. Jehovah has committed all judgment unto his Son. The Son, as earth's new King, has assumed power and authority, and is binding the kings and the nobles. His judicial decree upon those who resist the increase of his kingdom will be destruction. As he sits upon the throne of glory in the temple of God, he also judges and refines the members of the temple class. During the Millennium he will judge the people of earth. He will hear their causes, determine as judge what shall be done, pronounce the decree, and enforce it. As a result of his judgment earth’s inhabitants shall learn righteousness. The overcoming saints shall participate in this worthy work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">[GW] </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hath made us able ministers of the new testarment; -not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter hilleth, but the spirit giveth life.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2 Corinthians 3: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new testament, or covenant, will be inaugurated and go into operation toward the world when all the sacrificing performed by the great High Priest is completed. Jesus, “the Messenger of the covenant,” is the Head of the great Mediator of that covenant. To each of the body members of Christ Jehovah has committed certain interests of the kingdom, and thereby he has made them able ministers of the new testament. That is to say, he has appointed them to the position of ministering in connection with the new covenant under the direction of their Head, Christ Jesus. It is our privilege and duty to prove our worthiness of this able ministry of the new testament now by advertising far and wide the impending new covenant and its blessings. Those who diligently do so to the end shall join with Jesus in scattering the blessings upon the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It was God’s purpose from the beginning to use his beloved Son to destroy the works of his disloyal, treacherous son. It was Jehovah who put or decreed enmity between the serpent-like organization of Satan and God’s organization typified by the woman. God’s bare announcement of his determination to annihilate the evil one fanned to a furious flame the enmity of Satan; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">God simultaneously laid down the rule that his servants, the seed of the woman, shall not love the great adversary or anything that pertains to him. “Whosoever . . . will be a friend of the world [the Serpent’s system] is the enemy of God.” Under the feet of only his true friends and lovers will God eventually accomplish his work of bruising Satan.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.—Isaiah 1: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Originally Jehovah planted the church a pure vine. The Word of the Lord was her standard of judgment; and the writings of God’s inspired witnesses, the prophets and the apostles, were the source of her counsels. The religious system that later grew up degenerated into a strange vine, unrecognizable by the Lord. In Christendom, which claimed to be the city of the Lord, the unfaithful shepherds and the principal of the flock rejected the judgments and counsels of the Lord’s Word. Both true Christians and the people have suffered as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">result. But now the times of restoration have come. The Elijah work has been accomplished; and by thia work Jehovah has restored to their original authority and position in Zion, his city, the judgments and counsel# of his sacred Word. His promise to the church is now fulfilled, which says: “Yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall sea thy teachers.” And Zion is now the faithful city*</span></p>

Some of the latter are on earth at the time of the ful</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">film</span><span class="font6">ent of this prophecy. These are represented </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">&quot;the feet of him”, and it is the privilege and pleasure of such to bear the message concerning God and his kingdom. It is in the day of God’s vengeance that &quot;the servant class” must plainly declare the truth, which truth serves as a sharp sword and as a polished shaft directed against the enemy of the Lord. Let no </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font6">construe this to mean that harsh and vindicative speech is authorized. Those of “the servant class” tell the truth in the spirit of the Lord; and the truth, sharp as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">two-edged sword and lilce a polished shaft, accomplishes the purposes of God. It is manifest then that those who bear witness are to use no carnal weapons to accomplish destructive work. “The servant class” on earth will tell the people plainly of Satan’s wicked organization, and that Jehovah is God and that through his organization complete deliverance shall come. All of “the servant class” will join in this proclamation as opportunity is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">afforded.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Truly I am full of power ty the spirit of the Lord, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Micah 3: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah instructed Elijah to anoint Elisha as prophet in his place or stead to finish the work which he had begun. This pictured how with the cessation of the Elijah work in 1918 Jehovah would anoint with a double portion of the spirit a faithful remnant who should further carry on his work in the earth. This work was to proceed from that time forward into the great and terrible day of the Lord, and is pictured by Elisha’s activities. Part of God’s commission to Elisha was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">slaying work. (1 King 19:17) Similarly, the work of the Elisha class includes in part the smiting of the false and evil systems with the sword of the spirit. The Elisha class has received power and might to do this appointed work by the outpouring of Jehovah’s spirit on all flesh in his service in these last days.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God.—Isaiah 13: 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The day is here when the Lord will make his name Jehovah stand forth in glory and majesty before the eyes of all nations. He will perform his strange work “that men may know that thou, whose name alone is Jehovah, art the Most High over all the earth”. His announced purpose was to have competent witnesses in the earth to give faithful testimony before the great climax of the ages is reached. For this purpose he has separated his people from all strange gods, and has made his name first known unto them. He has taken his witnesses into intimate relationship with himself, declaring his counsels unto them, clothing them with the garments of salvation, and showing unto them the power of hia works, that so they might be qualified as witnesses, thoroughly reliable and able to speak with authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.-—Genesis 5:</span><span class="font6"> #4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah knows how to deliver the godly out of temptation. (2 Peter 2:9) Enoch, because of his faith in God, was an outstanding figure in the midst of the religious hypocrisy and infidelity of his day. He was a witness on the earth for God. Satan the Devil had the power of death, and without doubt would have killed Enoch; but God prevented. The Devil had nothing to do with putting Enoch to death; nor did Enoch die because of sickness, the result of the inheritance from Adam, his forefather; nor did Jehovah put him to death for any wrongful act on Enoch’s part. While he was in the vigor of youth, and while he walked with God and joyfully conformed himself to God’s righteous law, the Lord manifested his pleasure in Enoch’s faith by taking him away—whither no one knows—from the scene of temptation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.—Exod.</span><span class="font6"> 7</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was of the Lord Jehovah that the heart of the autocratic ruler of Egypt was hardened. God’s mercy in giving respite from the plagues should have softened Pharaoh’s heart; but the effect of this remission was just the opposite; Pharaoh selfishly tried to take </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ad</span><span class="font6">vantage of Jehovah’s forbearance, and hardened his heart against the mercies of God. As a result Israel’s deliverance was delayed; but Jehovah used the occasion to magnify his power and to prove painfully, yet convincingly, that Jehovah is the name of the true God of heaven and earth. The Lord’s people now in the earth should not grow discouraged because Satan’s servants continue to harden their hearts and the deliverance of the church and the people is delayed apparently. Jehovah permits this that he may multiply his signs and wonders in earth and testify in his overwhelming demonstration amid the battle of Armageddon that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through Icings in the day of his wrath.—Psalm 110:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The armies of the two contending forces are ranging up for the greatest of all conflicts, the battle of Armageddon. Jehovah is at the right hand of the Field Marshal of his appointment, lending him his fullest support. He undertakes the work of subduing the enemy, and in doing so he uses Christ Jesus as his great Arm and Power to plunge through and smash the stoutlooking battle lines of the foe. Thereat those who during long centuries past have led mankind into captivity themselves go into captivity. Meantime Jehovah has stationed his servant class in the forefront of the consecrated ones this side of the vail. They do not strike a blow; but their part in the battle is to sing in the hearing of friend and foe, saying, &quot;Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt.—Exodus 12:29,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Psalm 136 bids God’s delivered ones to give thanks unto “him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endureth for ever”. It was a work of mercy to smite thus “the chief of their strength” because it operated in behalf of the liberation of God’s people; it demonstrated to the blinded Egyptians that Jehovah is the only true God; and it spared their first-born from further growing up in the idolatrous and Satan-bound condition of their fathers. These first-borns represent the ruling class of today, “the shepherds and the principal of their flock.” Their death seems, therefore, to picture what Satan’s agencies will suffer in the final calamity immediately preceding the inauguration of tha new covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.&quot;— Psalm 91:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HIS text is a prophecy. All prophecy has fulfilment in God’s due time. In this text is proof that there is a place of security; that the place is secret to all except those who enter therein; that the place is provided by the Most High; and that almighty power may be used in behalf of all who dwell there. The name Most High first appears in the Bible in connection with Melchizedek. Most High signifies Jehovah’s relationship to all creation, and that he is supreme over all. Since Melchizedek was a type of Christ, the Executive Officer of Jehovah, when that great antitypical Priest begins to exercise his power would seem to be approximately the time when the saints would understand the prophecy and be permitted to enter into the secret place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1914 Christ began the exercise of his power as tho antitypical Melchizedek. In 1918 he came to his temple; and those found faithful received the garments of salvation and the robe of righteousness and entered into the joy of the Lord. These therefore entered into the secret place of the Most High. From then forward is a time fraught with great danger; but those who dwell in the secret place are kept in security by the Almighty. These are commissioned to perform certain duties in the name of the Lord, and while faithfully so doing have the assurance of complete protection. As long as they are faithful they abide in the secret place and are free from all ham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Eath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?—James 2:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This does not mean that one must be poor in order for Jehovah to choose him, but he must possess something else. He must be rich in another way. He must possess the riches of faith. Tn order to have faith he must have a reverential mind; for “the reverence of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom”. The natural course will then be to seek a knowledge of the Lord. As he increases in knowledge of the Lord’s Word, he will increase in confidence in it; and thus will his faith grow. When he has an abundance of faith, a copious supply of it, he may be said to be rich in faith. If he becomes an heir of the kingdom these riches of faith must increase. His treasure, then, is in doing the Lord’s will; and in this he delights. There is where his love, his affection, is. What great condescension of Jehovah to choose the poor of this world and to make them heirs of the promised kingdom I</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Galatians</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4-’ </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Father means life-giver. The realization that one has life brings joy of heart with gratitude and thankfulness to the Giver. The ideal relationship between the father, the life-giver, and the son is a sweet and blessed one. There is a perfect confidence on both sides. There is true fellowship between them. Each delights in the other. We have become sons of God because Jehovah has freely justified us upon the basis of the precious blood of Jesus Christ and has begotten us by his spirit, thus adopting us into the house of sons, if so be that we continue to fulfil our covenant, rejoicing in the hope even to the end. Now we can truly and delightedly say: “Jehovah, thou art my Father; and thy will I delight to do.” This spirit of sonship impels us to look about earnestly to see what we can do to glorify his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord hath chosen, Zion: he hath desired it for hie habitation,—Psalm 1S2: IS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For Jehovah to desire a thing means that in due time that thing shall exist. In due time he founded Zion in his faithful Son Jesus and chose it, having desired it for his habitation. Habitation means a site or seat of government, a permanent place of operation. Such Zion is; for it is Jehovah’s organization for the purpose of carrying into effect the various provisions of the divine plan. Thus in poetic phrase the Lord’s prophet states that God’s seat of government for the establishment of order in the earth, and for the gathering together of all things in heaven and in earth under one head, is Zion. Hence the church, now in the pinnacle of her earthly experience, is no longer in doubt as to the Lord’s purposes towards all his creatures; but she exercises herself that she might eventually stand victorious with Christ Jesus on Mount Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.—S3 Tim. 4:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Christian finds it necessary to battle unceasingly against the unholy influences of the world. He is misunderstood by his friends, and deliberately misrepresented by his enemies. At times he finds himself standing seemingly alone; all have forsaken him except the Lord. He must fight on, consoled with the assurance that many indeed are the afflictions of the righteous, yet these afflictions shall not prevail over the faithful but Jehovah will deliver him out of them all when the time is ripe. For Jehovah is true to his side of the contract. Having called us to his kingdom and glory, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font6">will preserve through the hottest of the conflict those who enthrone him in the chiefest place in their affections and who make it their effort unto the end to please and glorify him. Courage, then; the church approaches ihe last stages of the battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">For whom the Lord Iciveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.—Hebrews 12:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s love is of the Tare sort that does not hesitate to chastise, to wound deeply, if thereby the loved one is to be brought to a proper course. When about to send fleshly Israel into the seventy years’ captivity, he does not hesitate to say, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font6"> have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.” Throughout the Gospel Age Jehovah’s little ones have been chosen and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font6">been undergoing testing as to their faithfulness and love. Their journey has been through a vale of tears. But amidst all the trials and tears that have lined </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">thejp </span><span class="font6">pathway, Jehovah has exercised his loving power in their behalf, turning their sorrow and tears into joy, and proving throughout that they are his sons. His love planned it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Of his own will begat he</span><span class="font6"> wa </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—James 1:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This begetting is likened unto </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">contract. At the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">time </span><span class="font6">one is justified and accepted as a part of the sacrifice of our Lord, he is begotten by the holy spirit. For God to will means for him to exercise his power; therefore, it is the power of God, or his will in action through nis Word, by which the begetting is accomplished. By his Word he brings to Christ one who desires a knowledge of the truth. Such a one sees his privilege of mak</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font6">a consecration to do God’s will. Voluntarily submitting himself to the exercise of the will of God, and hav</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font6">faith in the merit of Christ Jesus, he is received and justified. God’s will is that the right of such a one to live as a man shall cease; and that there shall begin in him a newness of life, that is to say, a life upon the spirit plane. Begetting means beginning, and the exercise </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">oi</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Jehovah’s </span><span class="font6">will begins the new creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“This is the day which the Lord hath made; ... let us he glad.&quot;—Psalm 118:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HIS text and context disclose a class rejoicing and at the same time praying for complete victory. The members of the body of Christ are the ones who are speaking. Whenever a text shows these rejoicing, its application is at the time when the Lord is present, gathering his own unto himself. The text therefore specifically applies to the time when the Lord comes to his temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is the day when the Chief Corner Stone is completely laid; to wit, a time when God sets his Beloved upon his throne and offers him as King. The nation is born, and the King begins his reign. It is the day that the great King is finally rejected by those who have claimed to walk in his name and he becomes the Head and Chief Corner Stone. It is the day in which some are falling upon that Stone and are being broken, and in which others are being ground to powder by the Stone. The Lord has come to his temple and has invited the faithful to enter into his joy. To these he gives greater light and shows them the wonderful privilege of being witnesses in his name. It is the day in which the message of truth is being proclaimed with boldness and in which the Lord holds back the evil powers until the testimony is finished. The time of deliverance is at hand. The saints lift up their heads. They rejoice because it is the day foretold by the prophets. It is the day which the Lord has made and in which his name must be magnified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.—Isaiah 25:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Both contemporaneously with, and also since, the World War the earth has borne great famines, and more millions have died from want and scarcity than from </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the war. </span><span class="font6">But not far distantly the new covenant will be inaugurated; and Jehovah will bless the people in their homes, in their corn, their wine, their fruits, their herds and their flocks. He will relieve them of profiteers. He will bring them to an accurate knowledge of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">truth </span><span class="font6">and bless them with health, happiness and life abundantly. It will indeed be a feast of fat things; and all the people, being comforted in their hearts, will learn to sing the praises of Jehovah. It is now the blessed privilege of the church to inform the groaning creation </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">these marvelous blessings that are just ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord</span><span class="font6"> J</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">esus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.—Ephesians 1:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has made us to sit with Christ in heavenly places. The spiritual blessings that he has bestowed, and daily does bestow, upon us there exceed anything that we can sum up in human language. Never may we forget that we were originally taken from fallen humanity, justified, begotten as children and heirs of God, and anointed as partakers of the body of Christ. Those who fail to progress with the light or to keep abreast with Jehovah’s advancing work remain as it were stationary in their blessings. But what blessings, both of understanding parables and spiritual things not previously illuminated and of joys of service not previously experienced, the Lord has blessed those with who are keeping his commandments since his temple was opened </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in 1918! </span><span class="font6">They are heard saying today: “Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">he </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Oolossians 1:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah is the Father of lights. How variegated these lights must be we can slightly apprehend in that dyemakers have been able to make thousands upon thousands of variations of color, each color representing a hue of light. Wonderful and entrancing beyond degree must be the light in which Jehovah dwelleth! In that place of light he hath prepared an inheritance for his saints, No pian can approach unto this light, so radiant is it; but Jehovah has made his saints meet for their inheritance in light by translating them now out of darkness into the kingdom of his dear Son. When their earthly course is run, he will usher them into their inheritance by resurrecting them as divine characters of light. Oh, let us give thanks unto the Father, and faithfully “walk in the light, as he is in the light!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[The Lord] satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Psalm 103:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Pointing forward to out day the Prophet Daniel wrote: “Oh, the blessedness of him that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days!” Are we not blessed? Has not the Lord satisfied our mouths with good things, even the most precious things of his Word? How much more true is God’s promise since the Lord has come to his temple and has bidden the faithful members thereof to enter into his joy! The strength of those who had been engaged in the Elijah work needed to be renewed, that they might be adequate to the requirements of the strenuous Elisha work that lay before them. Jehovah duly renewed our strength. He gave brighter vision; he put his choice Word into our mouths, and has made us as youths again—strong, vigorous and clear-eyed like the eagle. Shall not our soul and all that is within us bless God out of Zion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">November 28</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with thee. . . . And the Lord shall be Icing Over all the earth.—Zechariah 1%.: 5, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When all the nations under the command of Satan have gathered unto the place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon, in other words, when they have assembled against Jerusalem and launched their fearful attack against it, then Jehovah will come with vengeance. His Son, in martial accoutrements, will be active in the forefront of the engagement; and the army of those saints already in the glory of their resurrection will closely follow him into the battle. The saints who will abide the onslaught of the enemy and refuse to leave their posts on the battlements of Jerusalem shall dwindle to a remnant; yet the foe shall not prevail. The attacking hosts of the enemy shall be smitten with the plague of destruction, but the remnant shall be delivered and honored with elevation to the kingdom glory. Then, all the saints being with him, Jehovah shall be King over all the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">They shall be mine for a treasure, saith the Lord of hosts, in the day that I make; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.— Malachi 3:17, R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“This is the day that the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.” Why should we not rejoice in this day ? It is the period of the Savior’s second presence, in which he begins his reign and has arrayed those who are approved of him while still this side of the vail with the robe of righteousness and the garments of salvation. To these Jehovah has said: “Ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people. . . . And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.” They are very dear unto his heart; and he confesses them as his before the world by openly manifesting his favor toward them, because they confess him in testifying that Jehovah is God. Because they as sons obediently serve their heavenly Father, he spares them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Jehovah hath called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people.”—Isaiah 1ft: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HIS prophecy applies to the members of the body of Christ who compose “the servant class” while on the earth. God’s precious promise to such is i “I will hold thine hand, and I will keep thee.” These words show the application is at a time fraught with great danger to the ones performing service in the name of the Lord. The proof therefore shows that the application is while the saints are on earth and not after their glorification. The enemy goes forth to make war against the remnant of God’s people because these are the only ones who expose him. Except for divine intervention the enemy would destroy them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God makes these faithful ones his witnesses and gives them for a covenant or solemn guarantee that the people shall have the opportunity to hear the truth. Particularly does he commission these faithful ones to carry the message of truth to the great company class, who are held in the prisons of the denominational systems. He commands his servants to say “to the prisoners, Go forth; and to them that sit in darkness, Show yourselves”. The work of Jehovah in establishing his kingdom is drawing to a close, and the remnant is commissioned to declare this fact to the people that they might know that for them there is relief near at hand.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ye </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Peter 2: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each Christian was once in darkness, even as the world is in darkness; but now Jehovah has brought him out of darkness into a really marvelous light, forasmuch as in that light he sees things which the natural man cannot perceive. However, the mere fact that a member of the church has been translated out of darkness. does not mean that he will not continue to have </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">battle with the powers of darkness. There is a battle-fround now existent in his mind; and he must needs </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ght </span><span class="font6">against principalities, powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this world. He must avail himself of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">{he </span><span class="font6">provision Jehovah has made to keep him in the light, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">thus walk in the light. He must also turn the rays </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">this light outward from himself and reflect it upon others, because everything in harmony with Jehovah, the great Source of light, must shine out like him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">To be loved by Jehovah, the eternal God, what a blessed privilege 1 How shall we express our deep regard </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">high valuation of his unusual manner of love be</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">stowed </span><span class="font6">upon us in begetting us and calling us sons of the divine family? Love begets love. “If God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.” We ought to have an unselfish love of our brethren that shall prompt us to lay down our lives for them that they may be aided in proving faithful unto death and gain the crown of life. Yea, and “if God so loved us” and was the first </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">demonstrate love in this now mutual interchange of !ove between the new creation and himself, we ought to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ove God </span><span class="font6">above all.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord, thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing.—Zephaniah 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the pouring out of his spirit on his servants and handmaids and the coming of the Adonai to his temple, Jehovah is in a special sense in the midst of his people. The vicious Dragon would harm those who keep God’s commandments, but Jehovah protects them like the mountains round about Jerusalem and promises early to deliver them. Jehovah’s love for them is not the demonstrative, shallow kind. It is the deep love that floweth like a river. He will rest, that is, “be silent” (margin), while his plans of love are working out. He will rejoice when they come to fruition. Everybody in heaven and in earth will rejoice then, even including the Father himself, who will joy unto the point of singing. Then God will be “all in all”-—everything to everybody. Then all will be God’s family, united for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to hattie; . . . and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not he cut off from the city.—Zechariah 1^:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All the nations of the earth belong to Satan’s organization. Jehovah God is gathering them against Jerusalem, his organization; because he is choosing their delusions for them, having decreed that the time of their destruction has come. As Joshua of old wrote: “It was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favor.” Under the stress of the assault against those who take their stand on the Lord’s side, a part, and doubtless the greater part, shall fall to the enemy; but the remnant who will refuse to budge from their position of holy devotion to Jehovah shall have the Lord’s protection and shall be delivered. Let us look to our course of action that it always be one of allegiance and holiness unto the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">will come near to you, to judgment; and</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> J </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">will, he </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">swift witness against the sorcerers, and against those that . . . fear not me, saith the Lord of hosts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Malachi 3:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has come near to judgment against nominal spiritual Israel, Christendom, in that his Son, the Lord whom they profess to seek after, has come to his temple to cleanse it. The judgment is not limited to the antitypical priests, the “sons of Levi”, but to the entire religious system which calls itself by the name of the Lord. The sorcerers, the adulterers, the false swearers, the oppressors of the hireling and the widow and the fatherless, and the defrauders of the stranger of his right, draw near with a profession of fear of the Lord on their lips and in their sanctimonious ways; but their heart is far from him. They have denied the coming of the Lord and his kingdom to bless mankind, and have openly allied themselves with the Devil’s scheme of salvation by human effort and leagues. The Lord has not delayed to expose them, but has been swift or prompt to witness against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.—Matthew 21: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many have expressed surprise that the war stopped so suddenly. Jehovah wanted it stopped. In due time the Lord saw that his servants in various parts of the earth were released from prison that preparation might be made for the Elisha work, the witness to the nations of the earth. A knowledge of this fact should thrill ths heart of every Christian. The fact that the great Jehovah God and the Lord Jesus, the King of kings, should intervene and stop the warring nations and command peace, in order to give a little handful of Christians in the earth an opportunity to be his witnesses, is too marvelous to be expressed in words. It should humble every Christian in the presence of the Lord and cause him to tighten up his armor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“All thy works shall praise thee.&quot;—Psalm 1J/.5:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE evil things are no part of Jehovah’s works. Whatsoever he does is done perfectly. The Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the Devil. That done, and the Devil himself destroyed, there will be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> clean universe; and every living thing will be then in harmony with God. Then all creation will praise the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As God moves forward now in his great work of establishing the kingdom for the blessing of humankind, it is his will that all true Christians bestir themselves. He commissions them to do something more than merely wait the receipt of a crown of life. They are now to represent the Lord by being witnesses. This requires activity. “They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.” Let the consecrated bear in mind that a mere passive course on their part will not bring the approval of the Lord. The Lord expresses his pleasure concerning those who love him. To love him means to obey his commandments, which are to proclaim the message of truth and to lift up his standard to the people that the name of the Lord might be made known amongst men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">D ecember 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 thank thee, 0 Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Matthew 11:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s secrets are with them that fear him. They are hid to those who are wise and prudent in a worldly sense. Jehovah has so arranged it that if any one would he wise in the things of the Lord he must become a fool in the eyes of the world, and he must become as a babe in receiving the milk of the Word. To such the Lord reveals the deep things, the mysteries of the kingdom, by his spirit. This should be a cause for thanksgiving. Yet it follows that greater knowledge brings that much greater responsibility. A knowledge of these mysteries requires everyone to whom they are revealed to use his faculties to the glory of the One who grants him this privilege. Blessed is the' portion of the Christian now, when &quot;none of the wicked . . . understand”, to know the mysteries of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pray to thy Father in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Matthew 6: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you desired a special favor at the hands of some earthly ruler, you would not wish to call a public assembly of the people, and loudly announce in their presence your requests addressed to the ruler. You would prefer to have a secret audience with him that you might present your matter in a better and more direct way. Since prayers are addressed to Jehovah, the effectual prayer is that petition which is secretly presented to Jehovah God in the name of Jesus Christ. Long prayers uttered in the presence of others, and praying openly with a sanctimonious attitude that can be seen of others, are generally intended to attract attention to the one praying and not io God. We may be sure that Jehovah does not hear and answer such prayers. Let us Jemember that Jehovah sees and hears us, even though we but come to him in prayerful attitude in secret.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, wt we were like them that dream.—Psalm- 126:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah anointed Jesus with the holy spirit to proclaim liberty to the captives. In harmony with this proclamation Jehovah sent him in 1874 as the great Cyras or Sun to bring “deliverance to the captives” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">mystic Babylon, who longed for freedom and who would gladly avail themselves of the opportunity to leave Babylon and go up and build the house of the Lord God. There Jehovah turned the captivity of Zion. The Psalmist had previously composed a song of gladness which now they could sing: “Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.” That which first made glad the hearts of Christians then was the revealing of the great truth that Jehovah had provided restoration blessings for all the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; not to all the people, hut unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us.—Acts 10.-^0,^1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the apostles’ day Jehovah did not openly display the resurrected Jesus to the vulgar gaze of the people who three days before had cried for his crucifixion, nor to the priests and other chief religionaries of the time to convince them of Jesus’ resurrection and thereby constitute them his witnesses. Jehovah authorized Jesus to manifest himself to the few faithful ones, whom he thus made his witnesses in behalf of the rest of the people. This illustrates Jehovah’s order of dealing; namely, to favor the approved ones and make them competent and reliable witnesses to the peoples of his manifold works. His witnesses are never the mighty, the haughty or the proud. He does not choose evil men to represent him. His witnesses at this time are, like the apostles of old, the meek and teachable ones, who </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font6">moved by love in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 12</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">'Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—I Peter 1:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus, the Head of the new creation, was begotten by his heavenly Father’s spirit at Jordan river. Inasmuch as begetting means to give a start in life, here was the beginning of the new creation. For three and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">half years he taught Ids disciples. Though fully consecrated, they could not; however, become new creatures before the great ransom, sacrifice was presented to divine justice as a sin-offering. When Jesus was resurrected from the dead and ascended on high, this was presented; and evidence of the presentation and the divine acceptance was given at Pentecost, when the holy spirit was poured out upon the disciples. Now the disciples were justified, and begotten unto a hope of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 13</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which, ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 am the Lord, saith the Lord God, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.—Ezekiel 36:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people of Israel, as organized by Jehovah, were typical of real Zion. They were unfaithful to God, for which reason he removed his name from them and permitted them to go into captivity. As only a remnant of the Jews returned in due time from Babylon thus to testify for Jehovah, so now only a remnant of those professing to be Christians will be faithful and true witnesses of our God. Now all the nations calling themselves Christian have defamed God’s holy name; he will bring upon the world a great time of trouble, and will make for himself a name that the people may know that he is God. He is having a witness of this fact given now, and this witness he has privileged Zion </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">give. Thus Jehovah is being sanctified in Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me.&quot; —Psalm 138:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font6">HAT is it that concerneth me? Eternal salvation to the glory of God. I was born, like all other sinners, with no right to live and destined for certain destruction. Jehovah began his good work for the salvation of men, including me. By the inexpressible gift of his beloved Son the redemption price was provided. I was permitted to hear the good news. When I believed and consecrated myself to the Lord, he justified me and begat me to a hope of life on the divine plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The good work was there begun in me. Now can I work out my own salvation by developing a character which the Lord will approve and which will guarantee my eternal salvation? The Scriptures do not so indicate. If I could do that, then I would not further need the work of the Lord. On the contrary the Scriptures say: “Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh effectually in you to will and to do his good pleasure.” My part is, with the greatest care and concern, to perform my covenant. The more of the Lord’s spirit I have, the greater effort I will put forth to obey and to please him. God, exercising his power in my behalf, will perfect my salvation; but this he will do upon condition that I am faithful to my side </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the covenant. The promise is: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.—Romans 6:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It seems to be a clearly settled rule of Jehovah to compel no one to accept life; but he provides the way whereby eternal life may be gained, and then offers it as a gracious gift. There can be no gift without knowledge and without consent and acquiescence on the part of the recipient to the terms governing the gift. In harmony with this fact, the great God of love has so arranged it that in his own due time all men shall be brought to a knowledge of divine truth in order to furnish them an opportunity to accept life on the generous terms offered. 0 truth-favored ones, give thanks to the Giver of every good and perfect gift, for this boon of life 1 Oh, bear the knowledge of the truth which you now possess to others that they too may rejoice in knowing of Jehovah’s loving provision for eternal life!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall he joyful in my God: for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness.—Isanah 61:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The garments of salvation and the robe of righteousness are Jehovah’s; and he furnishes them to his loyal Sdn, the Bridegroom, that he may invest the prospective members </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font6"> his bride therewith. The company of approved ones, manifested since the great Refiner began his purifying of the antitypical sons of Levi in 1918, now stand gloriously arrayed in these vestments of divine approval, favor, and protection. It is a time of great rejoicing on their part; and their joy is not in themselves but in Jehovah, who has so highly honored them. They are zealously striving to manifest their appreciation to their great Benefactor by being true to the insignia of office conferred upon them. The high praises of God are in their mouths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before thd coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Malachi Jp: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has sent Elijah. Consistent with this fact, restitution began in 1874. Restitution is not confined alone to the restoring of man to his original state of perfection. Jesus said: “Elias [Greek form for Elijah] truly shall first come, and restore all things.” (Matthew 17:11) Elijah pictured the work of the church on this side the vail done prior to 1918. About 1874 began the restoration of the great fundamental truths of God’s plan. This same thing was pictured by the restoring of the golden vessels to the house of the Lord in Ezra’s day. The church has been doing a restoration work under the supervision of the King, Christ Jesus; and now all the great fundamental truths long hidden from view have been restored. For mankind to accept Jehovah’s gift of life, they must first come to an accurate knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.—Isaiah 65: IT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s announced purpose is to plant the new heavens and lay the foundation of the earth; and this he does through his organization, Zion. It is his purpose to establish his kingdom, both visible and invisible to man, which kingdom shall rule the people of earth and establish righteousness among them; and this work he does through Zion, whom he calls his people. While this work is proceeding, he has appointed his faithful remnant still on earth to bear witness to the inauguration of the new order. He has placed his message in their mouths that their lips might speak forth his praise. That they might be dauntless in the delivery of the message he assures them that they are sheltered under his overshadowing hand of power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Open to me the gates of righteousness: 1 will go into them, and I will praise the Lord.—Psalm 118:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A gate is a means of passage or a way through and into the wall of a city; A city symbolizes a government. The new government of earth was born in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1914; for </span><span class="font6">there Jehovah placed the government upon the shoulder of the Prince of Peace. That new government or city is Scripturally termed Zion. Of it the Prophet Isaiah writes: “Thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.” Since 1918 those who desire to serve the Lord in pointing the people to the way that leads into the kingdom have called upon the Lord to clear the way for service. Jehovah has opened the gates, opening the avenues of service; and they have entered into them by publicly showing forth the praises of the Lord. Thus they offer the Lord an offering in righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 20</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: 0 death, I will be thy plagues; 0 grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.— Hosea 13:llf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By virtue of the ransom which Jehovah provided in his obedient Son, Jesus., the redemption from death has been accomplished. Soon the immortal ones, the Christ, Head and body, will begin the great work of bringing the dead back to life. Out of tombs the Lord shall bring the millions that are sleeping there, and thus work the destruction of the grave. Millions of these shall come unto him with songs of joy upon their lips. He will gain for them the victory over death by restoring them to life. When his reign is finished, death will have received its plague, its death blow. It will be swallowed up in victory. May we tell this good news to the sorrowing ones of earth, that their hearts may be comforted now in this time of stress I It is our privilege so to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Behold, I lay in Zion ... a tried stone.&quot;—Isa. 28:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Z</span><span class="font6">ION is God’s organization; and one of the chief purposes thereof is to recover mankind and to establish and rule the world in righteousness. The Stone mentioned in the text is God’s anointed King. He is the One appointed and anointed to carry out God’s plan. The anointing took place at the time of his baptism in the Jordan. For three and one-half years thereafter he was subject to severe trials. He was then offered to Israel as King, and was rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prophecy has a double fulfilment: In miniature at his first advent, and in completion at his second advent. In 1914 he began the ousting of Satan from heaven. Three and one-half years thereafter he came to his temple. Thereabouts he offered himself as King to all Christians. Nominal Christendom rejected him. Other professed Christians fell over The Stone, while upon others The Stone fell and ground them to powder. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He </span><span class="font6">is now the Head and Chief Corner Stone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jesus was born to be King, there the heavenly hosts sang to the glory of God and prophesied concerning the blessings that were to result to man. Now that blessed One is King, and is proceeding to plant the new heavens and new earth that shall completely f</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ulfil </span><span class="font6">the prophecy sung by the host of heaven. Those of the temple class, being living stones and being built into God’s organization, now join in the song of praise testifying that Jehovah is God and that the beloved One is the King upon his throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Fear thou not: -for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Isaiah J/.1: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What a consoling and strengthening word this is! What a repellant of fear and dismay it is! Jehovah is with us. Blessed thought! And why ? Because we have made him the God whom we worship; we are his servants, and he has chosen us and not cast us away. He has taken us from the ends of the earth, and called us from the extremities thereof. He has called us to be his witnesses. Surely then, his righteousness would prompt him to be faithful to his calling and to uphold us in our capacity as his witnesses. Were it not for his support and defense we could not continue to carry on </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">this world of hateful enemies. But the right hand of his righteousness bears us up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">0 sing unto the Lord a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.—Psalm 98:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord Jesus Christ is the great Executive Officer of Jehovah to carry into action the divine plan. Therefore he is the Bight Hand and Holy Arm of Jehovah, the Most High. Christ is the One whom Jehovah uses to get the victory for the church; and in the great war in heaven against the Dragon, it is this same Bight Hand and Holy Arm of God that gains the victory. In the fight on earth between the beast, the Devil’s organization, and the Lamb, it is the mighty Executive Officer of God that is triumphant. The victory over the Devil and his organization will be complete; and when that victory is won there will stand with the great Executor of Jehovah the one hundred and forty and four thousand called, chosen, and faithful ones. The victory is God’s, which he gets in his own due time through his “holy arm”. With faith in the coming victory, oh, let us sing the Lord’s praises throughout the earth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 24</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever he mindful of his covenant.—Psalm 111: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was the love of Jehovah and faithfulness to his covenant that caused him to provide “whatsoever things were written aforetime . . . for our learning”. He did not provide that all the meat or food should be served to his household of sons at one time. He provided it as it was needed. “Thou givest them their meat in due season,” writes his prophet. As the perfect day has drawn nigh, Jehovah has caused greater light to shine upon his Word, thereby increasing the provision for those that fear him. He has given meat to the household through the Head of the house of sons, Jesus; for all things are of the Father and all things by the Son. Let no one flatter himself into believing that the Lord has specially authorized him to provide food for the household of faith by interpreting the Scriptures; for the Scriptures axe not of private interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and hear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.—Isaiah 1:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God promised over seven hundred years beforehand that he would give a sign or token of coming deliverance. It was to be that by divine power a virgin handmaid of the Lord would conceive a son in purity. His name Immanuel would indicate that Jehovah God was with him and was with the cause of the people. Nineteen hundred years ago Jehovah gave the sign in the birth of the man child Jesus, and the angels of heaven glorified God in song and interpreted the sign to the lowly shepherds. It was the greatest event of human history up to that time. A far grander event now outshines, nay, rather has grown out of, that event of nineteen centuries ago. For chaste Zion has conceived; and in due time, in 1914, the birth of the man child, the new nation, took place. It is the greatest sign yet of deliverance, and Jehovah’s anointed ones now jubilantly announce the glad tidings to all the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Revelation 21:</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">4-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s plan reveals him as the great Comforter. He is not unmoved by the sorrows and sufferings of others; he even has no pleasure in the death of him that dieth. Infinite joy it has given him to arrange plans to right all things in behalf of those whom sorrow and death have made to cry out in anguish and to shed hot tears. Greater </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">joy</span><span class="font6"> will he have in actually using those who have already received of his comfort, and who have displayed his spirit in promptly trying to comfort others, to swallow up death in victory and to wipe away tears from off all faces. Then Jehovah’s restored creatures will be happy in him, and he in them; and they will again be members of his great family in heaven and earth. All who would participate in this heart-soothing work with Jehovah, impart ye the comfort of his kingdom message now to all those that mourn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God standeth in the congregation of God</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> [22. V.]/ </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">he judgeth among the gods.—Psalm 82:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s great Deputy, “the messenger of the covenant,” has come to his temple and now stands in the congregation of God. His judgment is not confined to Jehovah’s congregation, the true saints, but extends to the gods of Satan’s organization. The word “gods” means mighty ones, and is often applied to judges. The ecclesiastics have assumed to judge everything concerning the church and the Word of God, and to pronounce judgment concerning the world. The great opportunity was given them from 1914 to 1918 to defend the poor, to do justice to the afflicted and needy, and to tell the truth to the people concerning the Lord and his kingdom. Now it is God’s time to judge them. The church must fulfil her commission by declaring the judgments of God and his day of vengeance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty.”—Revelation 15: S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE fulfilment of this prophecy seems to be after Jesus Christ was placed upon his throne. (Psalm 2:6) The ones singing are those who have received a vision of Satan’s beastly organization and who hold themselves entirely aloof from every part thereof. They are wholly devoted to the Lord, and as his servants they together lift up the voice and sing. Harmoniously and joyfully these engage in proclaiming the praises of Jehovah and his beloved Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The song of Moses was a song of deliverance. The fall of Egypt was typical of the fall of Satan’s empire. The saints by faith now see that redemption through the blood of Jesus will soon be complete; that the new creation is near completion; that the King is upon his throne; that Satan is cast out of heaven; that the restless sea of humanity is greatly disturbed, and all the forces of Satan are gathering for Armageddon; that Armageddon will make for Jehovah a name in the earth, and that the people in due time will come to know that Jehovah is God. They see that all of these marvelous things are works of Jehovah, and they laud and magnify his name and the name of his beloved Son. Seeing the complete deliverance of the church, near at hand, and of the human race, these faithful witnesses cannot keep back the song of praise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—Zechariah 3:</span><span class="font6">4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The travel-stained garments that the faithful wore on their return from captivity in mystic Babylon will not do, now that the Lord has come to his temple. They are not suitable for the church’s condition during the presence of her Bridegroom. Satan accusingly pointed to these soiled garments worn by the faithful church, pictured by Joshua the high priest (Zechariah 3:1), and by this means accused her. The Lord rebuked Satan, and through his own messenger says concerning the faithful: “Take away the filthy garments from him [Joshua, the church]. ... I will clothe thee with change of raiment.” This pictures the faithful ones as a company receiving the robe of righteousness when the Lord comes to his temple. The receiving of the robe of righteousness is marked by a time of rejoicing by all who are faithful priests under the great High Priest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.—1 Corinthians 15:57.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah believes in victory for himself, for his cause, and for his people. Victory means the overthrow </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of that </span><span class="font6">which is opposed to him. It means the triumph of righteousness. It means the vindication of his name </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">honor. It will result in blessings to those who </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">benefit </span><span class="font6">by the victory. It means the climax of joy and the dividing of the spoil on the part of those who share in the battle and stand on the victor’s side. It was by the exercise of God’s power through Christ Jesus that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">great accuser of the brethren was ejected from heaven; and it is through Christ Jesus that God’s remnant, by remaining unequivocally loyal to Jehovah’s organization, get the victory in this day over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name. Through Christ also will Jehovah give us the victory over death by the first resurrection. Can </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we not </span><span class="font6">then take our harps and sing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Thou crownest the year of thy goodness [margin]; and thy paths drop fatness.—Psalm 65:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The year” evidently means the period of time in which the goodness of God will be manifested toward all; that is to say, all will come to a knowledge of the glory and goodness and loving kindness of our God. When that year, namely the Millennium, is done, that year will be crowned; and its crown will be God himself, who is the perfect expression of goodness. Then will the prophecy spoken by David have its complete fulfilment, and the way of the Lord will drop with fatness or showers of blessings and joy for all of his creatures. Now the temple class of the Lord see by faith the glorious prospect; and they cannot keep the vision to themselves, but act upon their privilege of being witnesses for God and telling the people of the goodness that he hath in reservation for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">■—Isaiah 9: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord is never slack; he performs all his work with zeal and intense earnestness. But he likewise bides his own times and seasons for the various features of his work. &quot;Whatsoever he has promised he puts such energy of spirit behind it that his word does not return unto him void, but accomplishes that which he pleases. Is it any wonder therefore that Jehovah takes no pleasure in those who are lukewarm and deficient in zeal in his service, but expresses warm appreciation of those who are hot and “zealous of good works” ? Full dedication of one’s faculties and strength and time, yea, one’s entire being, is what is required of those who would now manifest “the zeal of the Lord’s house”. Thus shall we be like Jehovah.</span></p>

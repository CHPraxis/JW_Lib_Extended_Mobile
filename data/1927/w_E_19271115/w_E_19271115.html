<p><span class="font4">The Society has decided to discontinue the publication of the Sunday School lessons. These lessons, as everyone knows, are arranged by tiie International Sunday School committee of ecclesiasticism: and to follow their arrangement causes us to publish things at times that are not meat In due season.

<p><span class="font4">Because the supply of the 1927 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tear Book</span><span class="font4"> was exhausted early we had to print a second edition. There are now on hand about one thousand of that second edition. If </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">any of </span><span class="font4">our readers desire a copy of this, please order immediately, price 50c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The 1928 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tear Book</span><span class="font4"> Is In course of preparation. We would appreciate If the classes through their secretaries will write in the number that they will require as this will enable us to determine how many to print The price will be 50c per volume because of the limited edition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You may send in your orders now. Shipment will be made </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font4">soon as the books are ready, which will be in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A WHOLESOME WARNING</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Daily </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font4">are reminded of the fulfilment of Revelation 12: 17, the Devil making war on the remnant There are wars without and wars within our ranks. For some time D. Chomiak worked at the desk of the Ukrainian department in the Society’s office. He was formerly a Catholic priest He became wise In his own conceit Quietly he went about </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font4">work of getting out something in opposition to the Truth. He used the Society's time and the Society’s machines to print his own matters. As soon as this was discovered he was expelled from the office. He now gets out a paper in English called A </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Study,</span><span class="font4"> which is signed Brooklyn Ecclesia, and mails it about to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> subscribers. The fact that this is signed Brooklyn Ecclesia is misleading and Is not the truth, not even the Ukrainian Ecclesia; but it is wholly Chomiak and one other who are getting it out. The</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark3"></a>THE PASSING OF THE POWERS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.”—Dan. 2: 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH through his Word reveals that Armageddon is “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”. The inference to be drawn from the name used is that in that great day the Creator of heaven and earth will exercise almighty power in battle against his enemy. If, then, we are correct in the conclusion that the battle of Armageddon will be fought by Satan and his forces on the one side, and Jehovah of hosts on the other side, then it is of greatest interest and importance to the Christians now on earth to have a mental vision of both organizations. It will also be of great importance for the Christians to go forward in harmony with God’s organization and to faithfully perform the duties God has laid upon them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> It seems quite certain that we are approaching the greatest crisis of all time and that in the .conflict of Armageddon the powers of evil shall fall, never again to secure a solid footing on the earth. That fact alone should thrill the soul of every lover of righteousness. It will mean the vindication of God’s holy name, the triumph of his Christ, the deliverance of the people from oppression, and the opening of the plain highway by which the people may fully return unto God. Truly we are entering into a grand and awful time. To be living now is sublime!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> It seems profitable at this time that we take a mental vision of the history of the nations or world powers found recorded in the Word of God, and such part of profane history relating thereto as is in full harmony with the Word of God. Undoubtedly God caused the record thereof to be made in his Word for the benefit of the Christians On earth at this time. The understanding of the same in harmony with God’s will is therefore meat in due season to strengthen all those who are striving to do the will of God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DEFINITIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Power, as used herein, means a potentate or authority exercising jurisdiction and power over others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> World, as herein used, means mankind organized into forms of government acting under the supervision and influence or control of an invisible overlord, potentate or authority. There is both a visible and an invisible part of the world. The invisible part of the organization is termed “heaven”. The visible part thereof is called “earth”, and the authority of the visible part thereof is exercised by men. In the Scriptures the earthly part is symbolized by a beast because a wild and ferocious beast fitly represents earthly governments or powers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> A world power therefore is defined as an organization on earth of men into forms of government, which government possesses and exercises supreme jurisdiction, power, and the controlling influence over various powers or nations, and which is under the supervision of the invisible overlord, Satan the Devil. World powers have been permitted by Jehovah in order to put men to the test and to teach them lessons which they could not otherwise learn. Many nations have arisen and quickly-fallen again, but world powers have been limited in number and have existed until God’s due time for such to fall.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>T</sup> God permitted man to follow his own devices in organizing governments. He placed before man righteousness and truth, and then permitted him to choose good or to go in the way of evil and unrighteousness. Man changed the truth into lies, reproached God and worshiped the creature rather than the Creator. (Romans 1:25) Men were induced to take this wrongful course by reason of the evil influence exercised over them by Satan the enemy. By fraud and deceit Satan turned the mind of man away from God. The Devil induced some to worship him, and others he induced to worship any object except Jehovah. By this means Satan became the god or invisible ruler over men, and has influenced and controlled men’s organization of governments or powers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> The Devil’s organization therefore consists of himself and the evil angels that he drew away from the paths of rectitude, and of men under his influence organized into earthly systems and governments. The majority of men have not cared to retain God in their knowledge,</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">339</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">and therefore God permitted them to go in the way of evil and to do those things which are unrighteous. As the knowledge of men increased they have turned that knowledge into selfish and wrongful channels. Satan, seizing upon the opportunity, has builded a mighty organization on earth. In the latter days, due to the great goodness of God, knowledge has increased; but this knowledge has been used among men under the influence of Satan to strengthen his organization. The commerce of the earth, the political machinery of earth, and the organized religion of earth, are all under the control of Satan. He has united these into one mighty organization, which organization is cruel and oppressive. He stands opposed to God and evervthing that represents God. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> Throughout the ages only those who have been faithful to God have stood aloof from the Devil’s organization and refused to yield thereto. Many of these have suffered martyrdom, and over them Satan’s organization apparently has triumphed. Many others for a time have stood in opposition to Satan’s organization, but under his subtle influence have fallen into his snares. Today upon earth there is but a remnant that is true and faithful to God. Against these Satan and his organization now make desperate assault with the determination of destroying them because they keep the commandments of God and have the witness that they are the Lord’s.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GOD’S ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> God’s organization is unknown to all except a few. It consists of Jesus Christ, his beloved Son and great High Priest, and a host of true and holy angels, and the members of the body of Christ in glory, and of those anointed ones on earth who are yet faithful and true to the Lord. Over all of these is the great Eternal Jehovah God. The fact that one of his names is Jehovah of Hosts means that he has a mighty army of holy angels that delight to render complete obedience unto him. These not only carry out his purposes in general, but under his direction furnish protection for the faithful ones on earth. God’s representatives on earth are small in number and meagre in power. In themselves they have no strength. The faithful ones have entered into the secret place of the Most High; and dwelling there in the shadow of the Almighty God they are safe while the battle rages. With confidence and with a complete sense of security they can perform and do perform their duties.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DIVINE RULES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> It appears that God has fixed rules of procedure concerning world powers: (1) He manifests toward such his own goodness that the people thereof, and particularly the rulers, may see evidences of his righteousness in contrast with the wickedness of the evil one. (2) He serves notice upon them of his purposes to punish their evil com s: (3) He magnifies his own name by a manifestation of his supreme power that all may know that there is no Almighty God besides him and from him alone proceed all things that are good and righteous.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">“ It also appears that another fixed rule of God is that where there is greater knowledge, or opportunity to obtain the same, there is greater responsibility resting upon those who do know or who might know. Having in mind these fixed rules will enable us to more fully appreciate what are the present duties of the remnant and what Armageddon may mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BEGINNING OF WORLD POWERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> Nebuchadnezzar succeeded his father upon the throne of Babylon, a nation that had existed for many years. In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar he had a dream. Daniel the Hebrew was brought before the king and gave the interpretation of his dream. In that interpretation Daniel, the prophet of God, specified four kingdoms or world powers. (Daniel 2:36-40) From the description given, however, and from other facts that appear on the Sacred Record it is manifest that these four are not all the world powers revealed by the Scriptures and that Babylon was not the beginning of world powers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> The Gentile Times began under the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. When Daniel stood before that potentate to give interpretation of his dream he said: “God mak-eth known what shall be in the latter days.” Those words w'ould indicate that God would reveal to his people in the latter days a better understanding of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream and of its interpretation, which was in fact a prophecy. God’s purpose in making the dream and its interpretation appear so prominently in the Bible must be of greater significance merely than to record a historical fact to be thereafter remembered by the people. It now appears that the primary purpose of the record concerning that world power was and is that God thereby serves notice on the ruling factors of the world that he is the only true God, that his name shall be magnified notwithstanding the enemy, and in his own due time he will demonstrate this to all creation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">EGYPT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> It is an indisputable fact that long prior to the existence of Babylon as a world power there were two other great world powers. The first was Egypt. God permitted Joseph to be sold into Egypt, and then to be elevated to a position of great power and authority in that government There was a divine purpose in this. It was through Joseph that God gave Egypt evidence of his own goodness. That nation was the predominant world power then. That nation received many blessings from God ministered to it and its people through the hand of Joseph, the servant of Jehovah.—Genesis 41.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>19</sup> The rulers of Egypt learned of God and his good</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ness. </span><span class="font5">Joseph died, and another king arose who </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font5">against God and forgot the favors that the empire had re</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ceived</span><span class="font5"> from Jehovah. (Exodus 1:8) God's chosen people were then domiciled in Egypt. They were being persecuted and oppressed by the rulers. Their cries came up before Jehovah. God then went to Egypt to make for himself a name. (2 Samuel 7: 23) He did this by sending his servants, Moses and Aaron, into Egypt. He told Moses in advance what he intended to do. (Exodus 3: 20) Through Moses God served notice on Pharaoh that he is the Almighty God and of his purpose to deliver his people. After full and fair warning God slew all the firstborn of Egypt, delivered his own people, and then destroyed the army of that great world power. Thus he cave a demonstration of his power that he is God, that his name might not be forgotten for the good of men.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> Egypt was the first world power; and what came to pass concerning it foreshadowed what shall happen to the last of Satan's world powers. Moses, who served as deliverer, foreshadowed Christ, the great Deliverer. The overthrow of Egypt foreshadowed the time when Ged through Christ would dash to pieces Satan’s organization in the latter day. From that time forward Egypt as a world power became typical of other world powers that should follow. Students of Scripture have long recognized Egypt as a type and its king as the representative of the Devil and a part of the Devil’s organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ASSYRIA</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Later and next in order Assyria arose as a dominant world power. That nation was the dominating organization of Satan on earth. God recognized Assyria as a world power, and specifically showed his goodness to that nation by sending Jonah his prophet to them to give them warning. And that world power recognized Jehovah as God and acknowledged him as such. (Jonah 3: 6-9) Because of their knowledge of God the rulers of Assyria were responsible. Not only did the rulers of Assyria forget God and worship Satan and his angels, but openly defied the Almighty and brought reproach upon his name. (2 Kings 18: 22; 19:10-13) Then God manifested his power against the empire of Assyria and demonstrated that he is the Almighty God. Assyria fell, and ceased to be a world power.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BABYLON</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> The next world power that appeared on the scene was Babylon. It existed as a nation long prior thereto. Early in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Babylon became a world power or dominant national organization of Satan. Because of the unfaithfulness of the nation of Israel, which formed the typical kingdom of God, that nation was overthrown and God even permitted Nebuchadnezzar to become “a king of kings” or dominant world power to be used for his own purposes. By the dr</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">pam</span><span class="font5"> of Nebuchadnezzar and the interpretation thereof by Daniel God brought notice to that ruier tnat Jehovah is the only true God: and Nebuchadnezzar recognized that fact when he said to Daniel: ‘Of a truth thy God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings.’ (Daniel 2:47) Later Nebuchadnezzar was forced to undergo certain ordeals by which he was compelled to acknowledge the supremacy of Jehovah. (Daniel 4: 25-37) The goodness of God was made manifest to Babylon. Later that nation forgot God and persecuted his people and fell.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> By the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream which God gave to him through the Prophet Daniel Jehovah was serving notice upon Babylon, and upon all the nations that followed, that he is the great and on. y true God and that in his due time he will destiny all powers that oppose him even as he had destroyed Egypt, and that he will do so through his righteous kingdom, and that his kingdom shall stand for ever for the Lies =-ing of mankind. The facts therefore show that Babylon was the third world power in the order in which thev actually came into existence. The Lord through Danrl did not say that Nebuchadnezzar was the head of tne first world power. He described an image, which Nebuchadnezzar saw, the head of which was gold: and then said to the king: “Thou art this head of gold.” He then srated that after Babylon there should fallow a second, third and fourth kingdom or world power.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> It clearly therefore appears that such powers in the order named were numbered from Nebuchadnezzar forward. The second was the Mcdo-Persian kingdom, the third Greece, and Home is recognized as the fourth. Counting Egypt as the first world power, which indeed it was, then Rome was the sixth from Egypt but the fourth from Nebuchadnezzar. The fourth world power mentioned by Daniel covered the time or interregnum between the overthrow of the typical kingdom of God, and the coming of the real kingdom; to wit. Ch ri-: Jesus, who came and declared, “The kingdom of he aven is at hand.” He is the one “whose right it is” to reign. (Ezekiel 21:24-27) He was crucified during the time that Home was the dominant power of earth, the fourth in the order named by Daniel. Daniel the prophet did not then disclose the world powers that preceded Nebuchadnezzar nor those which should follow Home end which should exist until the establishment of God's kingdom under Christ</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER WORLD POWERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> While Daniel specifically named only four world powers, yet his prophetic description shows there were to be more. The image which he described to Nebuchadnezzar had legs of iron, which represented the fourth world power or kingdom named by Daniel and which is recognized by all as Borne. Iron represents a cruel military power that breaks to pieces and subdues all others. The military history of Rome fully meets this description.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">*’ The image had </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">feci</span><span class="font5"> and toes, which are no jiarts of the legs any mor’ '.nan the thighs are parts of the legs. The two feet had ten toes; and while the toes grow out of the feet, yet they are separate from the feet and are described separately. The description therefore shows that the feet represent a great world power to follow Some, and then later another would arise which is represented by the toes growing out from the feet and which form a part thereof. The prophet’s description is: “And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes part of potters’ clay and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. And as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken. And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is net mixed with clay.”—Daniel 2: 41-43.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">-<sup>4</sup> Then in the forty-fourth verse follows the prophet’s statement that God will set up his kingdom and will completely destroy all these world powers, and that then God’s kingdom shall stand for ever.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> The time of the fulfilment of this prophecy, which is the time of the complete fall and destruction of world powers, is indicated by the words of the prophet: “They shall mingle themselves with the seed of men.” Otherwise stated, at that time there shall be an effort to ally the two things represented by the iron and the clay. Iron symbolizes military power, while clay symbolically represents the democracy or common peoples of the earth; and the mingling of the two represents an effort to unite all the peoples and nations including the democracy into one great military camp or war machine, and therefore corresponds with the statement concerning Satan’s gathering together all his forces for the great battle of Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>26</sup> In 1799 Rome fell and ceased to be a world power. At that time Napoleon was desperately attempting to establish a universal world power which would completely ignore Jehovah God and push him out of the mind of men. He was following Voltaire’s theory of evolution, which is another evidence that he was acting under the direction of the Devil. It is manifest that the Lord God interfered to prevent him in establishing such a universal power. At the great naval battle of Trafalgar and in the land engagement of Waterloo the forces of Napoleon were defeated and his power broken. That marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the British Empire, which is the seventh and without doubt the greatest world power that has ever existed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> Peculiar to that world power is this, that the chief part of its political body is the House of Lords, consisting of the lords spiritual and lords temporal. The Archbishop of Canterbury is first peer of the realm and therefore next to the king. The bishops and other ecclesiastics are large owners of the lands and mines. The empire claims to represent Christ on earth, and at the same time it is the greatest </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">military</span><span class="font5"> power that the world has ever produced. It fully meets the description of the two-horned beast that has the appearance of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">lamb, because it is diplomatic, pious in appearance, sanctimonious, and speaks like the Devil. (Revelation 13:11) Its dominion encircles the earth. America is really </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">part of the British Empire because both countries are controlled by the same money power, and that is the power that is responsible for the military and the political! machinery.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> The British Empire or world power, together with ber colonies and allies, is represented by the feet in the image described by Daniel. The iron represents her great military strength, while at the same time the clay represents the democracy or common people of the empire, all of whom she counts as a part of her great military system. The battle cry during the war of Britain and her allies was: “Let us use the military to make the world safe for democracy.” Such is a mixing of iron with miry clay. It was and is a subtle attempt to amalgamate the military with the common people. The scheme will deceive the people for a time but not for long, because God through his prophet so states.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> The ten toes of Daniel’s image symbolically represent all the rulers of Christendom.. These have united to form a League of Nations, which is the eighth beast, and which comes from nowhere and goes into perdition. It is the final desperate attempt of Satan to make all the peoples of Christendom stand together as a great and warlike body preparatory for the great battle of God Almighty and which the enemy expects to launch against the Lord God and against his Anointed. The British Empire is therefore the seventh world power; and the League of Nations, which is combined Christendom, including of course the British Empire, which is the real life-giver to the League, is the eighth; and both the seventh and the eighth function at one and the same time and both seem destined for the same fate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> The British Empire is the strongest and most powerful nation on the earth. She is the greatest world power that has ever existed. Her dominion extends from east to west and north to south, and reaches almost every part of the earth. Because of her strength .she is weak. It is her numerous colonies that make her strong as an empire and as long as those colonies remain entirely loyal her strength continues. If a break should start with one it might easily extend to all others and the empire would quickly go down.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> The British Empire claims to be the most liberal on earth with regard to freedom of speech. That claim is probably true. The English have learned that it is a good policy to let the people vent their feelings by giving expression in words. At the same time she is the strongest military power on earth. Her effort is to draw the common people into her military organization. Her financial power works the political and ecclesiastical elements for all they are worth; and these in turn impress upon the people the great necessity of the military strength of the nation. There is a constant burden of taxation laid upon the people to further the preparations for war. While America is separate and independent from Britain, yet she is more dependent than many of her citizens think. The commerce of the British and American nations is closely allied, and therein lie the strength and power of each. Should Britain fall, America could not long continue her commercial enterprises. Her markets in Europe would fail. She would also be greatly menaced by Japan and China. Commerce, therefore, holds the two great nations of Britain and America in close alliance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> America is likewise pursuing the same policy concerning war preparations. This is induced by the commercial element or Big Finance. When one of America's sons, little known, flew across the Atlantic that marvelous feat accomplished by him was seized upon by Big Business to boost war preparations. Great sums of money were spent apparently to honor this young man. That was not done because the spenders had any love for the young man. They love no one but self. Millions were spent to enthuse the common people concerning war and to draw them into the war arrangement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> Other nations are doing the same thing. All Christendom, which really forms the League of Nations, is talking about disarmament but at the same time increasing that armament. There are more armed men in Europe today than there were in 1914. Every possible effort is being put forth to make soldiers of the common people. What is now called a temporary army composed of young men is being trained and drilled in the United States, and the real purpose is to increase the military power and to encourage the common people to be a part of it. The action of the nations is clearly in fulfilment of Daniel’s prophecy. The military and democracy are mingling themselves together with the purpose of getting all the common people in Christendom into the great war camp. “They shall mingle themselves with the seed of men.” That is being done. “But they shall not cleave one to another.” This is certain proof that the common people will break away from the military.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> Satan sees his time is short to prepare for Armageddon. He knows that he has the people blinded concerning God; and now he is carrying out his scheme to get the common people into his military trap and hold them there for himself and use them for his own purposes. He is possessed of so much egotism that he believer he can defeat God. The time has come for God to make for himself a name, and for the complete passing from earth’s stage of all the world powers that the kingdom of righteousness may be given full sway.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE STONE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>85</sup> Daniel described a Stone cut out of the mountain without hands. Manifestly that Stone is God’s Anointed King, who was born out of God’s organization. The Stone is seen to smite the image upon the feet, made of iron and clay, and to break them in pieces. “Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">together,</span><span class="font5"> and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.”—Daniel 2:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>36</sup> The description here given by Daniel shows that the Stone smites the feet and that then the entire image together at one and the same time is ground to pieces and becomes like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors. Undoubtedly this is a brief description of the battle of Armageddon, in which God through Christ shall grind these world powers into a powder and destroy them for ever. Daniel states it in another form when he says: “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed : and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.”—Daniel 2: 44.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>37</sup> In 1914 the Gentile Times ended, and the due time there arrived for the great Executive Officer of Jehovah to take charge. There the new nation was born, and God set his Anointed King upon his throne. (Psalm 2:6) The ousting of Satan from heaven followed. In 1918 the Stone, God’s Anointed King, was laid in Zion; and there the judgment throne was set, and in due time all the nations of earth shall be brought before that judgment bar. The overwhelming weight of evidence therefore shows that we stand now almost in the shadow of Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> Because of Egypt’s knowledge of God there was great responsibility upon that world power, and God held it to account therefor. Likewise there was great responsibility upon other world powers that followed. The British Empire and all the nations of so-called Christendom must bear a greater responsibility before God than any powers that went before them. The British claim to rule by divine right, and as a part of so-called Christendom claim to represent God and his Christ on earth. The clergy of this great world organization claim to represent God; but they do so hypocritically, and in fact they represent the Devil. For this reason they are more reprehensible before God. We may conclude, therefore, that that which befell Egypt will be carried out upon Christendom on a far greater scale and shall affect the uttermost ends of the earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ISSUE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>89</sup> What was the issue in the crucial hour of Egypt in the time of her power and glory ? The question at issue was: “Who is God ?” What is the issue today in Christendom’s most crucial hour ? The question now at issue is: “Who is God?” Jehovah demonstrated his powe&gt;» against Egypt that men might not forget that he is God, but that they might remember that he is the One from whom all blessings flow. Likewise he demonstrated his power against the other world powers, including Rome, and for the same purpose. Now in the time of the enlightenment of the nations of earth so-called Christendom has disregarded the name of the Lord God, and pushed it aside and hypocritically used his name as no other power ever did. Christendom is the very zenith of the Devil’s organization. God declares his purpose that such organization shall fall amidst the greatest time of trouble ever known, and that such will be the last.— Matthew 24: 21, 22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVING NOTICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> In keeping with the fixed divine rule, before dashing Christendom to pieces Jehovah will have it duly served with notice of his purpose. Acting under his rule he sent Moses and Aaron to serve notice upon Egypt. He sent Jonah to serve notice upon Assyria. Through his prophets he served notice on Babylon, Medo-Persia, and Greece. He served notice upon Rome through Jesus and his apostles. Now shall God perform his great and terrible act in a corner without due notice being given to the world powers of Christendom? No; he declares that notice must be served upon her.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WITNESSES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> Whom then will God have to serve notice upon Christendom ? Keep in mind that the issue now is, Who is God? To the faithful anointed ones who delight to follow in the footsteps of Jesus at this time God says, “Ye are my witnesses that I am God.” (Isaiah 43:10, 12) God commands his people to go and give this witness, and says to give it until the battle is on and until Satan’s organization shall fall, never to rise again. If you are one of the anointed ones and love the Lord you will delight to have a part in obeying his commandments and participate in giving the witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> The events that have come to pass since 1914 have been brought sharply to the attention of Christians. These events constitute the good news to the faithful and to all who love righteousness. The Lord tells the faithful who love him to go and give this witness to the peoples of the earth. Undoubtedly the World War ceased that the witness might be given; and when it is given, it may be expected that the battle of Armageddon will follow.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> Last year there was sent to the ruling powers of the world due notice that God had set his King upon his throne and that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. As was expected, they have ignored and disregarded that notice. Now notice must be given to the people that go to make up Christendom. Those who love the Lord God and who have opportunity to give this witness will regard such as the greatest privilege that has ever come to them. With joy and with boldness let each and every one who is anointed prove his love for God by availing himself of every opportunity to testify that Jehovah is God, Christ is King, and that the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>REVIEW: THE EARLY PROPHETS OF ISRAEL</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">---December 18---</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;God, 'having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners, hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in his Son.”—Hebrews 1:1, 2, R.</span><span class="font5"> V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HE lessons of the past quarter have taken us through that period of the history of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah which must be known as the time of their decadence. The glory of the kingdom, seen first in the strength and justice under David, and then in its opulence and peace during the earlier part of Solomon’s reign, was specially typical (1) of the setting up of God’s kingdom on earth, and the preparations therefore which God made for that kingdom, and (2) of the Millennial kingdom of Christ’s rule on earth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> From the time when Solomon began to fall away from the high place which his wisdom and the blessing of God had given him, the history of the kingdom of Israel began to make another series of pictures, which partly illustrate the history of Christendom. There is, however, no regular sequence of events which can be noted as type and antitype or fulfilment. Rather, certain events in those periods, first in the northern kingdom and then in the southern, are brought into relief, and are set forth as typical of some special features in the work which God would do in the latter days in connection with the establishment of his kingdom; more particularly those which represent the breaking down of the things which really oppose the kingdom, whether of the powers which are outside the churches or those disintegrating forces which are within.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> While the northern kingdom remained it carried the name of Israel, and in it rather than in the southern kingdom God wrought out his types. It pleased God to have it so, though as the temple was at Jerusalem, and it was in that city that the sons of David were to sit upon the throne of David, it would have been a natural expectation that God’s types would have been made in the southern kingdom, especially in view of the fact that the northern kingdom at once openly departed from the commandment to worship no other God but Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> The sin of Jeroboam the son of Nebat in causing the golden calves to be made and to be set up at Dan and Bethel, was specially dangerous to Israel; for there was no profession of departing from the worship of Jehovah. The calves were professedly to represent him, so that there was a pretence of avoiding idolatry as such, and also that of helping the mind to realize the God it worshiped. That it was hypocrisy and sham is shown by the fact that Jeroboam took of the basest of the people for his priesthood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> A prophet of Jehovah was sent to Bethel to witness against this. He declared of Jeroboam that his house should be cut off from the throne. A rebellion was started then; and one after another the first kings of Israel were deposed in bloodshed. After nearly one hundred years had passed, Ahab was king over Israel. He married Jezebel, a daughter of Tyre, a clever, dominating woman. She determined to establish the worship of Baal in Israel. As Ahab had little respect for Jehovah he became as a tool in her hands. She had gained her end.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> But at that time God raised up Elijah to be his instrument to destroy this abomination out of Israel. The sin of Jeroboam was heinous; but the sin of Ahab and Jezebel was something which God could not permit, for it was open defiance. How Elijah was used of God to gather Israel to a demonstration as to whether or not Baal, who was worshiped as the god of nature, had or had not any power, our studies have shown us. The trial on Mt. Carmel was a disclosure of the mockery of the worship of Baal, and it resulted in the reestablishment of the name of Jehovah as the only God. The priests of Baal were slain there and then. But despite all that was done on that day, the work was negative rather than positive in character. Baalism had received a shattering blow, but the worship of Jehovah was not reestablished.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> After Elijah’s particularly strenuous day on Mt. Carmel, and then his running for twelve to sixteen miles before the chariot of Ahab from Mt. Carmel to Jezreel, his spirit seemed as if it had exhausted itself. He had done his work in the strength of the Lord. Now he appears in a moment of reaction to have trusted to his own strength. Just at that time the threatening message came from Jezebel to say that by the next evening she would treat him as he had treated the prophets of Baal. Elijah fled for his life. He made his way, a lonely man, far south to Mt. Horeb, where seven hundred years before Moses had met God. There God spoke to him by convulsions of nature as to Moses and Israel. There were the shaking and breaking of the rocks, and a violent earthquake, and fire, phenomena similar to those which came when God was before at Sinai. God dealt kindly with Elijah, who in some petulence of spirit expressed his loneliness, as if God was not caring for those who serve him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> As at the first with Moses, so now with Elijah, these things were made symbolic of things to be when God establishes his kingdom on earth. Elijah’s two experiences, (1) on Mt. Carmel, the slaying of the priests and God’s demonstration of himself, and (2) this at Horeb of the forces God would use, become united as one type. Elijah represents those who stand for God in the day when God will break down the worship of idols of which Christendom is guilty; namely, the worship of its creed systems by which before men it has professed to worship God. The Baalism of Israel’s day represents the present day worship of, and cooperation with, human forces in the religious world; and the power of God manifested at Horeb represents the powers God will use in the break-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">down of the present order of things, which is so contrary to his will, and which has kept men in the bondage of darkness in all things concerning God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> Thus in this great work there are two pictures: (1) The witness for God by his people, and (2) the ordering of circumstances of human life and events which together bring about the destruction of the present order of things. God says through Haggai, a later prophet, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font5"> will shake the heavens, and the earth”; and the Apostle Paul declares that these things are shaken so that there may remain only those things, the everlasting things of truth and righteousness, which cannot be shaken.—Haggai 2:6; Hebrews 12: 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Elijah and Ahab met once again, and their meeting was personally a more violent contact than at Carmel. Ahab, by accepting Naboth’s vineyard after that man had been violently done to death, had assented to the evil done. As Ahab went into the vineyard to take possession, God sent Elijah to meet him there. The king was denounced. The destruction of his house was foretold, as if God would mark thereby that such a bad servant as Ahab had proved to be should meet with an untimely end; his sins would bring him disaster. His wife Jezebel was included in the sentence of doom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> This corresponds with the end of great Babylon, both political and religious. Christendom has misused its privileges, has dishonored the name of God; it is not allowed to die, but is brought to a violent end. Great Babylon is lifted up by the angel of God, and is cast like a heavy millstone into the great deep.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> The subsequent lessons of the studies call attention to the manner in which God calls and uses his prophets. Sometimes, as in the case of Amos, he gave them a direct word; sometimes, as with Isaiah, he called them by a vision; sometimes, as in Hosea’s case, he both gave them a message and caused them to pass through hard experiences; for God demands of his servants that they should yield themselves to him, and that not merely with such abilities that they have, but so that they and their lives are his in the fullest sense. They become types of those who in later days were permitted to give themselves to God in full consecration for his service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> The studies show that the condition of Israel during the days of the Prophets Isaiah, Amos, Micah and Hosea were typical of the days when Christendom comes to maturity, and is brought into judgment before God. Christendom, of which men have boasted, has not brought mankind nearer to God, despite all its great profession, but rather has turned men away from the true worship. It has led them into formality; it has led them into hypocrisy; it will lead them into destruction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Amos was one of the earliest of the prophets after the days of Elijah and Elisha. Like them he was a man of courage, as is shown by his refusal to be intimidated by Jeroboam’s chief priest when, obeying the command of Jehovah, he stood before the idolatrous altar in Bethel denouncing the altar, the priesthood, and the professed worship of Jehovah there. Amos saw the inevitable desolation of Israel which must follow their sins against their covenant. He also saw that the nations which God would use to waste Israel were alike worthy of punishment, even though they had not sinned against their Creator as Israel had against Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> But Amos foretold the time would come with blessings to his people, and would restore them to their place of favor with him. He would btiild again the house of David to rule over Israel. Then that kingdom of God, whose King would be the Prince of Peace, would possess all the land of the enemy; that is, all those powers of evil which were represented by the enemies of Israel would be broken down, when the people who had been under their rule would be given blessings to enjoy such as God’s people had.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> The Prophet Micah was not called upon so much to denounce sins of idolatry as to rebuke God’s people for their sins against each other. He says they lay awake at night, devising evil upon their beds, thinking how they could gain something from their neighbor. They gave scant measure; the traders carried deceitful weights in their bag. For this and other sins against Jehovah, God would punish the house of Jacob till “Jerusalem should become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest”. (Micah 3:12) But Micah, like all the holy prophets, tells of the time when God will bless his people. His closing words are comforting. He says, “He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities: and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.”—Micah 7:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> Thus each prophet, however much he has been used to denounce the sins of Israel and to speak of evil to come, is given a message of restoration. God will save his people, but will destroy those men and institutions that have misled them.—See Revelation 11:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> These prophecies are intended of God to guide his people in these last days of human history into his will that they may do his work and may serve him as did the prophets of old. The experiences of the prophets may be expected to be repeated now; for those who carry the message of the King and the kingdom are certain to find opposition. But they are days of the greatest gladness to God’s servants; for now is come the end of every vision, and they know that immediately following the trouble of these days comes the time of gladness for all men. His servants enter into their reward; the world is brought out of its distresses into the quietness of the reign of righteousness, which shall bring peace to all men, and under which the dead shall be raised, so that those who have appeared to be taken from God, and from all hope of enjoying his blessings, will yet be brought back to him.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE BIRTH OF JESUS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">----December 25---</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Thou shall call his name Jesus: for it is he that shall save his people from their sins.”—Matthew 1: SI.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5">T WAS several hundred years after Jehovah had last spoken to his people Israel by the Prophet Malachi when he once again manifested himself to them. The long period of silence must have been a trial of faith and patience to many in Israel; for all the time they were under the bondage of the Persians, the Grecians, and then the Romans without tokens of Jehovah’s favor towards them. Some, like the Maccabees, held to the belief that God would be with them if they endeavored to throw off the foreign yoke and restore the ancient order of things in Israel. But God did not manifest his favor with them, and the effort failed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> The establishment of a kingdom under the Romans, with Herod the Idumean as king, had done something to help to revive a national spirit; for lierod, wishing to secure his kingdom to his family, tried to secure the good will of the Jews by rebuilding the temple. Apparently some saw in that a revival of God’s favor to them. But there was no light in Israel. That which the prophecies would have given was hidden under the bushel of the traditions of their fathers. And their leaders in Herod’s day were self-seekers. Thus it may be said that with the outward revival the true hope of Israel had receded to a very low ebb.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> It was at such a time that God again manifested that he had, not cast off his ancient people. About twelve years after Herod had begun the rebuilding of the temple a messenger from heaven appeared to Zacharias as he was serving his course in the temple. Zacharias was a priest now old in years and childless. The angel promised that.a son should be born to him, and that he should be a forerunner of another child to be born who should be called the Son of the Highest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Not understanding all that God was about to do for Israel, but quite well understanding the promise made to him, Zacharias and his wife Elizabeth were blessed of God; and the child, known in later days as the man John the Baptist, was born to them. Six months after the conception of the child, the angel Gabriel was sent to Mary of Nazareth, a virgin, espoused to Joseph, who was of the house and lineage of David. She was told that she was the accepted of God of whom the expected one of Israel should be boro. In due time her son was born, begotten of the holy spirit, and, according to the word of command, was named Jesus; for in the announcement of his birth it was said that he should save his people from their sins.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> There was not then any announcement that this child should be the Savior of all men; for the immediate purpose was to bring God’s people Israel to himself, necessary before his further purpose of blessing the world could be accomplished. But on the night of the child’s birth, to shepherds in the fields of Bethlehem a fuller announcement was made. While watching their flocks they were startled by a light shining about them; it did not shine on them from heaven, as is so commonly understood ; the angel stood by them, and the light shone round about them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> The heavenly visitor announced the birth of Jesus in the neighboring city, and said that the child was Christ the Lord. (Luke 2:11) Then suddenly there was round about them a company of heavenly beings who, breaking forth into song, sang the praises of God, telling of his purpose through this child, to bring good will between heaven and earth, and among all men.—Luke 2:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> How the child was dedicated to God by his mother, being circumcised according to the law; how he was preserved from Herod’s wicked destruction of the children of Bethlehem; how Jesus was brought up in Nazareth, is a story known to every child whose parents give attention to this sweet story of old.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> The birth of the child rejoiced the hearts of those who were waiting for the consolation of Israel; for though there were not such demonstrations to all Israel as might naturally have been expected, there was that ■which showed to the true-hearted that God had remembered his people Israel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> When Jesus was thirty years of age he realized his Father’s call. He presented himself to John the Baptist, who for six months had been busily engaged with his work as the servant of God preparing the way of the coming One. John did not know that Jesus was the One he was to immerse, and the Scriptures indicate that Jesus understood his call through his reading of the Word of God. It is said of him that he presented himself to God, his Father, saying, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“ho,</span><span class="font5"> I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, 0 God.”—Hebrews 10: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The perfect man Jesus, without a spot or blemish in his life, without any flaw, but perfect in mind and heart and body, was accepted of God. From that time on he lived in consecration to God, now charged with the Father’s message and anointed with power for the service. His -life’s ministry ended in being rejected by those to whom he was sent, and by being put to death by the Jews and the Romans together, the Romans being represented by Pilate the procurator of Rome in Jerusalem. Thus God had sent his Son, his chiefest messenger; and those people who had had the mercies and favors cf God for so long a time, rejected him, and God who sent him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> But in all this, and in his being put to death, crucified on the elevated cross according to the then Roman custom, prophecies were fulfilled even as they were fulfilled in the time and place of his birth and in the facts of his life. He was born in the fulness of time (Galatians 4:4); he died exactly on time according to the foreknowledge of God (Romans 5: 6, margin), and exactly in the manner intended of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> All this tells that the other prophecies spoken for God by his servants were to have fulfilment. God had said that he would send one who, being innocent, should have “laid upon him the iniquity of us all”. (Isaiah 53:6) Thus Jesus died “on the tree”, being made a curse for the Jews, that the curse upon them might be lifted; and he died a ransom price for all men that the original sentence, which had brought man into death, and with all that appertained to it might be cancelled, and thus a way to reconciliation and restoration be opened to all men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> The child Jesus came to be the Savior of the world, first by dying for it, that God, having a ransom price, might cause sin atonement to be made, and might be just while yet the Justifier and Deliverer of him who accepts his salvation in Christ; then, accounted faithful for what he had done, and being received back into heaven, and having received the glory of the Father as his reward, he should in God’s due time receive the power of the kingdom of heaven to deliver all those for whom he died.—Ephesians 1; 11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Thus the child Jesus not only was a token of God’s good purpose towards man, and a Savior for all those who believe on him; he is appointed to be the Prince of Peace, to hold the power of God’s kingdom on earth in order to bring about good will among men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> The birth of the child Jesus in all that it meant as the fulfilment of God’s word given through his servants the prophets, and as the outward evidence of God’s love towards man, is not in itself the greatest of God’s gifts to man. Nor is the death of Jesus the greatest of all things; nor even is his resurrection from the dead to be accounted the most momentous event in human history and in God’s revelation to man. These events, however great in themselves, must be considered as parts of a purpose which was to be brought to maturity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> The greatest of all things in human history is the coming of Jesus in power, when God again sends his Son into the habitable; for with his coming comes man’s deliverance from sin and death. (See Hebrews 1: 6, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font5"> Christendom makes much of Bethlehem and the birth of the child, and makes the cross the symbol of the Christian religion. Christendom looks back to the events of long ago in Palestine. It does so rightly. But it fails to perceive that the things done then were means to an end. It is too late for Christendom to save itself; it has been judged and found wanting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> Organized religion has failed both to realize God’s purpose and to live up to its own obligation. It is cast off from God’s favor. But all those in Christendom who will break from its bondage and will look for that for which the first advent was a preparation, namely, the return of Jesus Christ in power, and who will turn their faces forward to the kingdom, may save themselves from the trouble which is fast falling upon Christendom, and may enter into the protection of him who was born into the world to be the Savior of all men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> The privilege of the servants of God in this day in declaring the presence of the King corresponds with that of the shepherds of Bethlehem who heard the angel’s message. They speak as confidently as the shepherds told of what they had seen in the fields, and of what the angel said. It is given to God’s servants now to declare an even greater message than that the shepherds bore when they told of the birth of the child in Bethlehem. To God’s servants now comes the joy of carrying the message of the birth of the greater Son of God, seen as the nation born; and to proclaim to all that the time has come; that God has set his King upon his holy hill of Zion. Theirs is both the privilege and the responsibility of calling the attention </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">bf</span><span class="font5"> all to this fact. And they speak more confidently because they speak with much more understanding. For now the Word of God is made plain, and these know they have a message to deliver which is the necessary fulfilment of the angels’ song. Those who listen will save themselves from the darkness of the day of wrath now fast falling upon human affairs; those who decline are warned that God has visited his people, and that the time is come when he will no longer permit evil men to hold sway, or evil things to continue.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>19</sup> The shepherds’ message was given in the beginning of things; there was then to be a development of events in Israel before the people could be brought into judgment by the message which the child Jesus would carry. Now the days are urgent; for the end of all things is at hand, and it behooves all men who profess to love God, but who have not yet obeyed the message of the King, who have not separated themselves from the systems of organized religion, to hasten to do so. The word is made plain that he that readeth it may run. (Uabakkuk 2: 2) He who runs will find sure ground for his feet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> From Bethlehem’s fields when long ago the angels sang the words of praise to God, the message of God’s love will go until it has resounded through all the earth, and until the strong voice of the Son of God has quickened even the dead to life, that they may live again and receive their opportunity of hearing this word of grace.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> Jesus is the central'point of all God’s works for man. As a man he was in correspondency with Adam; for as a perfect man had sinned and brought condemnation into the world and all became sinners, so by the grace of God a perfect man voluntarily gave his life to be a ransom price for all. Thus it shall be that where sin has abounded, grace shall much more abound; and as sin has reigned unto death, righteousness will reign unto life; and so shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, “Death is swallowed up in victory.”-—Romans 5 : 20, 21; 1 Corinthians lb : 51.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>INTERESTING QUESTIONS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">Q</span><span class="font5">UESTION: Please explain the difference between being begotten to the divine nature and being partakers of the divine nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: The word begotten means beginning of creation. It is written by the Apostle James: “Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.” (James 1:18) And again by Peter: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.” (1 Peter 1:3) When a person makes a full consecration to do God’s will, and God accepts that consecration and justifies him, God gives to him his word of promise; and from God’s position the man is certain to have the divine nature if he performs his part of the covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Apostle Peter again says: “According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.” (2 Peter 1:3, 4) This text means that Jehovah, in the exercise of his divine power, has given to the consecrated one all things that pertain unto life. He has given to him his own exceeding great and precious promises that by these he might be a partaker of the divine nature. There is a condition attached hereto, and the condition is that the one thus begotten must perform faithfully his side of the covenant. Many have been misled by thinking that they could develop character and get into the kingdom. But here is a scripture which definitely shows that the condition of reaching the divine nature depends upon the performance of the covenant. God is certain to perform his side of the covenant. The creature must perform his; and if he docs, he is certain to ultimately receive or be a partaker of the divine nature. To be a partaker of the divine nature means that he will have a divine organism or immortal body that cannot be destroyed; that he will be like the Lord and see him as he is and dwell for ever with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question: In 1914 Christ began his activity </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">priest of the Most High God and Anointed King. Will you please harmonize this with the understanding we have of the activities of Christ during the Gospel Age as High Priest sacrificing the offerings of his body members ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: When our Lord was the Logos and before he came to earth, he was Priest of the Most High God. When he was anointed of the spirit of Jehovah at the Jordan he was from that time forward Priest of the Most High God. This Priest had been pictured and foreshadowed by Melchizedek. As Priest of the Most High God he was performing the duties of that office in harmony with Jehovah’s will. Throughout the period of sacrifice he, as the High Priest after the order of Melchizedek, the Agent and Representative of Jehovah, has been offering up his body members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are different duties of this High Priest, however, to be performed. It is written concerning him that when he ascended on high God commanded him to sit down at his right hand until the enemy was made his footstool. (Psalm 110:1) This could not be understood to mean that Jesus Christ did nothing throughout the centuries that followed, but in harmony with other scriptures must be taken to mean that it was not the will of God that he should become active against Satan in ousting him from his position until God’s due time. When he began that activity he began the work as the Representative of Jehovah, therefore as Priest of the Most High God, and is acting in that capacity, and will continue acting in the capacity of Priest of the Most High God foreshadowed by Melchizedek. He continues in that official capacity even while he exercises the office of King. When on earth he said: “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” By that he meant that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘I am</span><span class="font5"> the kingdom’. But of course he did not begin to exercise the duties of office until God’s due time, and then Jehovah set him upon his throne. (Psalm 2:6) It cannot be said that Christ Jesus is Priest after the order of Melchizedek to serve the people, but that as such Priest he is the Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question: In the study of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> difficulty arose in harmonizing the thought of the birth of the nation with the thought of the resurrection of the saints in 1878. How can we harmonize these statements?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer : There is no Scriptural evidence to warrant the conclusion that the sleeping saints were resurrected in 1878. The birth of the nation has reference to the kingdom or government. It is manifest from the statement of the Apostle Paul in Hebrews 10:12, 13, and in Psalm 110:1, that the Lord did not become active against Satan’s organization and did not take his great power prior to 1914. The birth of the nation means the functioning of the government. Zion, God’s organization, gives birth to the government represented by the man child and also gives birth to the individual members of the kingdom class. It seems reasonable that the kingdom itself would be born before the children of Zion would be brought forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question : In Psalm 31:23 we read: “0 love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.” Please explain this verse, and state particularly what is meant by the words, “plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer : The Lord God always metes out exact justice. His Word declares that he resists the proud and shows his favor to the humble-minded. (1 Peter 5:5) Lucifer was filled with pride, and his reward shall be destruction. Amongst the things which God declares that he hates is “a proud look”. (Proverbs 6:17) The proud think more highly of themselves than they ought to think. They are presumptuous before the Lord. They are disobedient. Pride and arroganey are the results of an evil motive. The reward of such is destruction. (Proverbs 16:18; Isaiah 25:11) This is another way in which the Lord has stated what shall be the final destiny of those who are presumptuous before him and who are proud and disobedient. He is contrasting the destiny of such with that of those who love and obey him. In the time of great distress and trouble those who love the Lord will be unselfishly devoted to him. If they love him they will be faithful to him; and the Lord here gives his assurance that he will shield, protect, preserve and save all such.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark11"></a>LETTERS FROM AFIELD</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BLEST </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">by house-to-house canvassing</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">De \r Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I write this to express my appreciation of the article, “The Great Multitude,” which ends with the “Duty of the Remnant”. It is one which helps us to appreciate our privileges and brings Joy to know that many will in due time rejoice in the kingdom message. A worldly cartoon was perhaps the cause of making us think that Samson pictured Socialism and Anarchism. His being a Nazarite from the womb seems to prove that his experiences foreshadow those of the consecrated who become of the great multitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning the “harvest” our Lord said that some would be “grinding at the mill; one would be taken and the other left”; one class brought into present truth, the other left in Babylon to “grind” even as Samson was used to grind for the Philistines so that the lords might have an easy living. —Ezekiel 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is said that in olden days captives were blinded by holding a red-hot iron before the eyes. A great multitude in the systems manifest a blindness caused by the red-hot theory of eternal torment, and in some cases the less severe one of making a bonfire of our planet at Christ’s second coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “pillars” which held up the building where the Philistines made a feast unto their god, may represent the unfaithful bulwarks of ecclesiasticism. Samson could not see the pillars, but at his request was led to take hold of them. The great company by means of knowledge of the Devil’s organization must be led against these pillars so that they might give them a shove to the destruction of the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dagon, the god in whose honor the Philistines made the feast, was supposed to have been shaped upper part human and lower part fish. Having rejected the Bible and the redeeming blood of Christ, the modern lords have substituted the from-fish-to-man evolution God. As Dagon of old fell to pieces, so this god of evolution will come down with a crash when the Samson class takes a final stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Delilah might picture the Federation of Churches, the daughter of a heathen mother. The Federation Is betraying the Samson class by joining in the beastly order in opposition to the Anointed King upon Zion. (Psalm 2:6) The spirit of anointing comes from the Lord through the Truth. Like Samson, the great company have been foolish enough to reveal to the clergy the secret of spiritual strength, the understanding of the Word. For many years the Lord has sent to them the message of the kingdom. Time and again they have asked the clergy whether they should read the Truth. The clergy, discovering the source of spiritual power as exemplified in the zeal of the “remnant” class, and feeling that their slaves might flee from the mills, have systematically warned the great company against present truth; and thus they have brought about the cutting off of the anointing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Later on Samson’s hair began to grow. This may prove that he renewed his vow and remembered his mistakes; and the Lord did answer his prayer for the final ordeal. The great company will receive some understanding sufficient to assist them to prove faithful. The Lord will extend this help to them through the faithful “remnant”. Then in the great tribulation they will wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb and receive God’s approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Samson and the lords of the Philistines died at the same time. Isaiah 34: 6 speaks of the slaughter of “lambs [great company] and goats [lords, the leaders of Christendom].” According to the Scriptures “goats” represent headstrong leaders doing wickedness on a gigantic scale. See Ezekiel 34 and Matthew 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For a number of years doubts have arisen in the minds of some friends as to the existence of a great multitude of spirit-begotten ones in the denominational systems. One of the best ways to remove these doubts is to go from house to house, regularly; and you will meet people whose professions and experiences absolutely correspond to the many scriptures given in The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Speaker's have often made the remark: “No great company on this side of the vail.” According to the Scriptures God will consider all who “wash their robes” during the great tribulation as of that class before they go beyond. What they do here determines their place there. “Blessed are they who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb.”— Revelation 19: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We meet many Italians and Catholics who do not seem to know that the “first pope” had a wife. Nevertheless, an Italian woman said, “I no change my religion if you cut my head off.” No wonder God has determined to overthrow these systems!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While a brother was canvassing with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> and booklets at an Italian house, the lady opened one of the booklets where it said, “The Lord planted a pure vine.” Then she looked up to the brother and said earnestly, “Pure Vine; vet, vet?” The brother said, “Yes, wet.” “I’ll take the books,” she said, and bought </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort.</span><span class="font4"> We are glad that these people will have some good wine under the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In canvassing a colored preacher before his church, he asked me if I could get his money back for four volumes of Pastor Russell’s books, which he had purchased from one of our sisters, saying very solemnly and piously, “I, I don’t handle dem books, I, I don’t handle dem books; they are Russell’s books.” I looked into his eye and said, “You mean to tell me that you do not need the books of such a great man as Pastor Russell? You got them almost for nothing, and you know you need them.” Then he said, &quot;Have you got the holy ghost?” I said, “Yes; I have the holy ghost!” “Can you speak in tongues?” “Yes,” I said, “I speak English, Armenian, Turkish and some Greek. How many do you speak?” He turned around, and ran with his long pious coat, to the surprise of members of his congregation outside. He never again asked the money back. As he ran into the church, I canvassed some of his church members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May the Lord continue to use you, and all the faithful, until God’s holy will shall have been accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With best wishes for your good health, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brother in Him, David Da vidian, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Calif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MARKED CHANGE IN THE PEOPLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Deab Brethren :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have just concluded the “best ever” convention in Erie, during which a very heart-cheering public witness was given by canvass and lecture. We found practically no opposition. We had about fifty-seven workers out and G25 books were sold. Forty copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> were sold at the public meeting, and a number of booklets and two full sets of volumes; in all, 192. I never have experienced such keen interest. There seems to be such a marked change having come over the people during the last two years, since I had the privilege of addressing them before. I am receiving such a rich blessing from the service in both canvassing and serving the friends. The Lord is good! I feel so sorry to have wasted two whole years. Two items might be of interest to the Service Dept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We canvassed a territory that had been done just a year before and placed thirty books where four had been placed before and to the same people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We had two service days during the Erie convention. A street was canvassed the first day with fairly good results. The next day two brethren did the same street by mistake and sold all they had. Truly the Lord is doing “a marvelous work among this people”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yours in the Master’s service, M. A. Howlett.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A WHOLESOME WARNING </span><span class="font4">(Continued from page 338) purpose is, of course, to draw away followers after them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let the brethren take warning in these perilous times that when the Society has anything to say, it will say it officially through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A letter written to Brother Litwin and signed by the president of the Society is photographed and sent out. While there is nothing in the letter that we object to, yet it was suggested in the letter that the brother wait for further consideration until </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> published a more detailed explanation. It should be kept in mind that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font4"> copy must be prepared in advance, and we cannot publish everything at one time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society diligently tries to safeguard the subscription list, including the list of those reading </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower. It</span><span class="font4"> is assumed that everybody in the office is honest and will not take advantage and get copies of the subscription list. It has occurred frequently in the past when someone left the Society he turns up with a mailing list which must have been Improperly taken from the office. We suggest the friends disregard all private pamphlets or sheets that come through the mail, and wait for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower. </span><span class="font4">What the Lord’s witnesses on earth must do is to cooperate and go forward shoulder to shoulder in representing his cause. Being forewarned by the Lord through the Scriptures of the attempt of the Devil to destroy the remnant, we should be forearmed. Anybody who wants to draw followers after himself of course is privileged to do it, but those who are really devoted to the Lord should not be deceived or misled by any such action.</span></p>

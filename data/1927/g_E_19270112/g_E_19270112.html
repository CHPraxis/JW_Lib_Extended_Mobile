<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark5"></a>rhirty^Five Hundred Tongues</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HIRTY-FIVE hundred languages and dialects are spoken in the world. It would take about four pages of The Goijjex Age merely to give a list of them. A child would as soon learn one language as another; hut today the children are busily engaged learning thirty-five hundred of them, deftly twisting their little tongues about sounds that to most of us resemble human. ideas no more than do the sounds made by birds or beasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The words &quot;language” and &quot;tongue” come from a common root, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">lingw.,</span><span class="font7"> By common acceptance certain sounds come to represent certain ideas, and the transmission of these sounds from one person to another constitutes human speech or language, the tongue being the principal organ involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For some strange reason America is said to lead the world in the number of its languages, which are estimated at 1,625; Asia has 937; Europe has 587 and Africa has 276. Many families of languages exist, giving evidence that originally they came from one parent tongue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The most important parent language or group of languages is what is called the Indo-European, comprising most of the languages spoken in Europe and some of those in Asia, including the great peninsula of India. It. has nine grand divisions; Indian, Persian, Greek, Slav, Armenian, AUmman, Celtic, Latin and Teutonic. lu’Jian, French, Spanish and Portuguese are languages; while Dutch, Geminn, Danish,. K« ruegbn, Swedish and English are </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Teutonic l&amp;i</span><span class="font7"> mages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">b * c rmd grand division is the Semitic group: Fhamfeian, Hebrew, Babylonian, Assyria^ Aramaic, Arabic and Ethiopia Same of these languages have ceased to exist. Other groups are the' Hamitie, Chinese, Turanian' Mongolian, Ihmimh, South African, Central 'African and American, which latter includes the many dialects of the American Indians,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Origin of the Alphabet</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE letter “A” is the picture of an Egyptian ox yoke, turned upside down. &quot;B” was the picture of a Louse. &quot;C&quot; was the picture of a camel. &quot;D” was a door. “E” was the picture of a lattice window. &quot;F&quot; was a hook. &quot;G” is another form of &quot;C”. “Il’’ was a fence, originally with three bars across, instead of one. “I” and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“3” </span><span class="font7">are one and the same. &quot;K” was the hollow of the hand. &quot;M” represented the waves of the sea. “N” was a fish, hung up by the jaw. “0” was an eye. “Q” was a head and neck viewed from, the back, and “R” the same in profile. &quot;8” was a molar tooth. &quot;T” and &quot;X” were crosses. &quot;Y” was a crossroads. <sup>B</sup>F’ and 'A™ are one and the same. “W” is simply “UU”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The English alphabet has three letters which are useless, namely €, Q and X. They might as well bo dropped. But it needs several more letters. The dictionaries show us that we have eight sounds for “A’’, five for &quot;E”, three for &quot;I”, four for “0” and six for “U”. Then we have two sounds which we spell with an &quot;00”, an &quot;OU”, an &quot;01”, a &quot;CH”, an &quot;NG”, a ‘WIT”, an &quot;SH”, a “TH”, etc. We would be better off if we had at least thirty more letters to take care of these sounds. Thon if we keew how to sjjell a word we could pronounce it, which is something nobody can he sure o? now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are plenty of words, however, which can be made out of the 26 letters we mv have. Somebody has figured out that these can be combined in 6401,733,239,439,359,000 ways, which is enough for a start, anyway; and we can add the rest, after we get the other thirty letters.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">EW people realize how great a burden rests upon a proofreader, or how rapidly that burden is increasing. Almost anybody ean read proof after a fashion; but to read proof well</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">quires an excellent education, a, great fund of knowledge on an infinite variety of subjects, and a sense of the value of punctuation and capitalization that is almost intuitive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How important punctual'on is to the meaning of a sentence is laughably illvslrrted in the case of a woman who meant to write, tragically: &quot;Woman! Without Ivr. u'er is a a.xage’’; but failing to properly prneluW t'r statement she actually conveyed to papm d.t rather unfortunate thought: “Woman wiikoi. h*r man is a savage.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Chicago author spent $12 tit 3:15 A. M. telephoning to his Nev York p-Alisher t<sup>n</sup> insist that a comma b&lt;- put into a certain hue in his hook which was to go to press the next day. H e claimed that the omission of the eoimna destroyed the rhythm of the sentence vhkh r^nd: &quot;If all women v. ere like yon, there would be no had men.” Perhaps in this instance d e importance of the comma was unduly emphasized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Standards in typoquphy, spelling and punctuation are charging constantly;and everypub-lisher has certain rules of his own, all of which go to make the lot of 11 e proofieade” more difficult. One English w’der put all bos punctuation marks at the end &lt;ri h’.s book and told his readers to insert these to suit themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">English Tongue</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">E</span><span class="font7">NGLISH is becoming the dominant language of the world. It was the language used at the peace conference at Versailles, and when M. Clemenceau was called to account for it in the French Chamber he reiterated that it was not his fault if two-thirds of the world spoke the English tongue. However, it is not so dominant as that; for it is spoken by only about 180,000,000 of earth’s population, or about oneninth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">English is what it is, not so much because in the last two centuries the British people have overrun the earth and imposed their will upon one-fourth of the human family, as they have done, but because in preceding ages Britain itself was overrun by Celts, Romans, Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Danes and Normans, and each brought in their quota of words and terms which have combined to make the English language the finest medium of human expression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">English is Japan’s language of commerce, and its position as the language of trade is so secure that when Germany was figuring on eon-quoting the world she schooled ail her boys and girls in English, believing that in the readjustment of things this knowledge would prove invaluable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many linguists deplore what they cal! gross inconsistencies in English grammatical rules. It is feaid that bri'oro Profrs«or Smith, the English lecturer at the Moscow University, opened his course in En°hsh grammar, he prefaced it with the remark, ‘Before we start on our slud-its, I want you to grasp firmly the fact ihat there is no grammar in English, There i&amp; anarchy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tt is claimed that Englislmien stand well up among the world’s linguists. In England it is said that the ros'dents of Neweasfle-rpou-ryne speak the purest English of any dwellers in Britain proper. In America it is claimed that 1 hr purest English in the world is spoken <sup>;</sup>n t!;-o vicinity of Rochester, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The translation of the Bible did mi'ch to rvrv-form tho hodgepodge of English into a permanent tongue; but there has been considerable change in the tongue since Wycliffe made his first translation, as is quickly reveaW by comparing his rendering of Matthew 8:1-10 with the Authorized Version which was made 231 years afterward, and is now itself 315 year* old, Wycliffe’s translation reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Forsothe when Jhesus hadde comen dotm fro the H, many cumpanyes folewiden hym. And loo! a lepronse man cummynge worshipide hjm, sayinge: Lord, if thou Molt, thou maist make me dene. And Jhesus holdyuge forthe the bond, touchide hym, sayinge: I </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">m</span><span class="font5"> ole: be thou maad dene. And anoon the lepre of hym was clensid. And Jhesus saith to hym: See, say thou to no man: but go, sbewe thee io piestis, and offer that gifte that Aloyses comaundide, m to witnessing to hem. Sotheiy when he hadde entnde in to Caphamaum, centurio neighide to hym, preyinge hym, and saide: Lord, my child lyeth in the ho us site on the palsie, and is yuel tourmentid. And Jhesus saith to hym: I shad eiune, and shal hele hym. And centurio answerynge saith to • hym: Lord, I am not worthi that thou entre vadir my roof: but oonly say bi word, and my child shal i» helid. For wlii and I am a man ordeyud vndff yowr, hauynge vndir me knightis: and I say to this, Go, and he goth.: said to an other, Come thou, and he someth? and to my seraaunt, Do thou this thing, and he doth. Sotheiy Jhesus, heerynge these thingia, wentiiisfe, and. saide to men suynge him; Trewly I say to you, I fotti nat so grete feith in YsraeL</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">No American Language</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HERE is no perversion of English in America worth mentioning. The British people have no trouble in understanding Americans and the Americans have no trouble in understanding the British. There are a few odd usages of certain words, some of which have been mentioned in our columns previously, but their meaning is readily comprehended on both sides of the water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few other words may be mentioned. Americans speak of druggists, hardware stores, dry goods stores, suspenders, canes, boardwalks, chickenyards. gasoline, undershirts, lumbt r and molasses, ■while their British cousins prefer to call these chemists, ironmongers, drapery shops, braces, sticks, promenades, fowlruns, petrol, vests, deals and treacle; but the only one of these likely to cause any confusion is the word • vest, which has the double meaning in Aim nca of a man’s outer garment and a woman’s under shirt. The American' “guess” was used by Chaucer and Sh'ikespeare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are more than a hundred languages Spoken in New York City, but these are not jumbles of English and something else. They are the languages of all the principal nationalities of the world, just as those languages are spoken bv the natives in their home lends. The English remains pure, kept so by the teachers in America’s public schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The teachers have their troubles teaching English to the cosmopolitan youngsters, too. One teacher who asked a pupil to write the flag salute had the following handed in: “I pledge a legion to the flag and the Republican for which it stands One nation invisible with liberty and injustice for all. Amen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The kid-&gt; do not make all the mistakes, either. &amp;&nbsp;furniture dealer in writing to a customer gave him the cheering information, “We can offer you a dining-room table that will seat twelve persons with round legs or one in mahogany which will seat fourteen persons with square legs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To accommodate and aid the foreign language newspapers of America, the government maintains a Foreign Language Information Service which supplies information in sixteen languages. It averages to give out about a thousand items a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Addition of New Words</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">E</span><span class="font7">VERY day sees new words added to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">English language. Sometimes these start as slang, such as the words cab, mob, fad, cad, crook, dude, crank, pep; and, after a time, by common use, they become an accepted part of the language. There is a time when the words are slang, another when they are vulgar, and finally a time of acceptance or abandonment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The World War brought a great number of new words and terms into existence: blimp, blighty, eamouflige, dud, slacker, hooch, etc. A London dictionary gives some others which are net &amp;o well kiomn here: clobber (clothing), conchy (consc '<sup>1</sup> ous objector), cushy job (good pay and 1 &lt;&nbsp;to de), dixie (field service kettle), eyewash ( o humbug), fed up (to have had more than enm&lt; h). no flies on one (no fool), strafe (punish)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">America has nnmeious terms of Indian origin winch have been •&lt; ken over and given a modern meaning. Thus the Algonquin term </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">mugii urn/p<sub>t </sub></span><span class="font7">originally a capmni or superior person, has come to moan a * r&gt;u of derision for those who consider themt^-K - superior to their party and then leave it or &lt;&nbsp;i&lt;e pretext.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Political cornl lions abroad bring in new words which soon cr.me into general use; as for example, the uom- Bolshevild, Czecho-Slovak, Fascismo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fascists.. The last three</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">words stand foi tA curious brand of anarchy developed m Itch, which glorifies personal violence in the na •&gt;! the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The woid w m i is said to have W.*n taken over from tin i. of the natives of the Carib Islands. These natives had the unpleasant habit of eating stranueis. At first called earibules, the term was &lt;•!.• t md to cambales and then ts cannibals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Very often l&lt;&lt; -Sators, educators mid others attempt to fasten mu words on the language; but unless the public “catches on” and approves by frequent or constant use, it is all in vain. The late President Harding’s coinage of “normalcy” is an example of a new word that found favor. There are stales in words as there are in clothes, but no one regulates the style except the people themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Changes in Meanings of Words</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font7">LL who are familiar with the Authorized</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Version of the Bible can remember numer-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■otM instanees of words which have changed their meaning. The word prevent once meant to go before, suffer meant to permit* charity meant love* hell meant the tomb; but these and many Other words are now used differently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word girl once meant an infant of either sex. The word wife, from the Anglo-Saxon </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">weve,</span><span class="font7"> once signified any woman, married or single, who had woven her quota of bed and table linen and was therefore a graduate ww, ready for marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word ferry once meant to drag out or to carry. Its application to a boat or vessel for carrying goods or passengers was an afterthought, but finally came to be the principal meaning of the word. The word earmark comes from marks actually put on the ears of cattle in olden times to distinguish their ownership. Exploit and red are new meanings of old words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Words sometimes get bobbed. Thus the word vanguard has been shortened to van, hobby* horse has bean shortened to hobby, distillery has been shortened to still, attending has been shortened to tending, disport has been shortened to sport, acute has been shortened to cute, withdrawing room to drawing room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Seme words are forbidden or held in great ‘disfavor in specified places. In London theatres the word fire is forbidden; brewery workers dislike to mention water; hospital employes avoid disease; Herr Krupp forbade the use of the word death in his presence or about his works. Scottish fishermen are said to avoid the words rabbit, salmon and minister while they are at sca</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Jw® of</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE early dictionary makers traveled an uncharted. sea and they made many mistakes, which provide no small amount of amusement to the lexicographers of today. They copied one another’s errors, and thus showed that they are like all the rest of the human family, which is still engaged in that pastime. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bullokar’s dictionary, published in 1616, had 5,080 words; Phillips’ dictionary, in 1658, had 13,000; Johnson’s dictionary, in 1756, had 50,000; Noah Webster’s, in 1828, had 70,000; the Standard, edition of 1924, contains 500,000, and the editors compiled 250,000 more that could have been used if thought advisable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sub>t</sub> It to said that in order to keep the Standard up to date about 1,000 persons are constantly scanning the newspapers to note any new words that are used, white about 500 expert etymologists and definers, professors in the greatest universities, stand ready to assist with definitions, etc., as needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Perhaps the greatest of all dictionaries is the Oxford Dictionary, which has been in process of preparation since 1857 and is now completed. This work is really a history of the English language, in ten volumes, giving quotations which illustrate the first and last appearance of every notable point in the life history of every word. The work is of a permanent nature, contains 425,000 words and has cost in the neighborhood of $6,2S0,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The origin of the English language is put at 60% Saxon, 30% Latin, 5% Greek and 5% from all other sources. One oddity of language is that the word “sack&quot; is found in some form in almost every language under the sun, and means the same in all languages. Some of the fon» are Egyptian sok, Latin sancus, Greek saridms, Hebrew saq, Italian sacco, Spanish s&amp;co, Dutch zak, French and Irish sao» Swedish sack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is said that the origin of the term “getting the sack”, meaning thereby the discharge of a person from his employment, reverts to the gentle Turkish custom “of getting rid of undesirable persons by sewing them up in a sack and tossing them into the Bosphorus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lmgaaga</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Wit&amp;fi® the £an«e</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE Lip Langwage is a language within the English-(and every other tongue). In its highest form this language is a part of life in the Lancashire cotton mills. The roar of the machinery makes human speech almost impossible, but by long experience the girls get to understand one another perfectly across the room by merely watching each other’s lips.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Tt was evident that the miners would be forced by starvation back to work, and under conditions even less favorable than what they had previous to the strike. The government passed the bill increasing the working day from seven to eight hours on the theory that i.with the extra hour there would be more output and that thus all the mines could be made to pay dividends. But if any pit or mine becomes a non-paying enterprise, why should it not be closed down like any other business that does not pay? AVhy should the whole industry be forced to suffer because of certain non-productive companies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mine owners refused a national agreement as regards wages, although the government warned them, announcing that if it had known that the owners did not uesire a national wage agreement the Eight Hour Bill would never have been passed. And so they wrangled through it; the miners demanding a national agreement, and the eoeJ owners a district agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The government finally proposed to pass an Act of Parliament, setting up a National Arbitration Tribunal; but it is questionable if this will do any good. The coal owners were determined to win the strike by starving the miners until they submit to the conditions named— lower wages and longer hours. So the men</span></p>

That is one new and vital link in the ccmi ng world-air-chain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The other item, which was recently communicated to London from northern Europe, is that a complete scheme has now been drafted for a trunk airway, more than 5,000 miles long, extending from Moscow, via Vladivostock, as far as Tokyo, Japan. At Moscow this great airway is to connect with a service of metal aeroplanes which already flies via Konigsberg to Berlin; while at Berlin a stretch of German-operated airway extends to Amsterdam, wdiere it establishes a daily connection with the British Imperial Airway service flying regularly to and from London. What this Moscow-Tokyo line will mean, therefore, as soon as it begins operating, is that a traveler will be able to ascend from London and fly eastward as far as Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Already a provisional time-table lias been worked out for this great section of the Round-the-World Airway, measuring nearly 7000 miles; and, reckoning actual flying time, a passenger will be able to travel from London to Tokyo in about 80 hours I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nor is this all. Already there is planned a service of multi-engines air-boats, which are to span the Pacific between Tokyo and San Francisco. These machines, flying at a high speed, will have their time-tables so arranged as to connect accurately at Tokyo with the winged craft which have borne passengers from London. This will mean that, in only about 50 hours after reaching Tokyo world-voyages from London can land in San Francisco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From there their journey may be confirmed eastward at unabated speed. Awaiting ttam at the San Francisco air-port will be a ne<sup>v</sup>’ and luxurious type of passenger land-plane which is now being developed for the United States Continental Airways. In one of these immense machines our travelers of the new era v ill be carried across America at such </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">s.</span><span class="font7"> r^ce tb'<sup>,+</sup> ’’•’'thin 30 hours after leaving San Frnn&lt;-is&lt;'o they will be gliding down into New York Cny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here, moored to a tall steel tower, rei dy for their ai rival, will ho one of the colossal oceantype airships, veritable liners of the sky. Ascending the mooring tower in an electric elevator, the travelers will enter the airship through a covered-m vesffble, and tta i icmter ship will then cast off and head out acioss the Atlantic for Europe, maintaining such a luecd that within not more than about 60 hours after leaving New York she will be over London, where she will be moored to another gioat tower, 200 feet high, and her passengers discharged. Without reckoning time spent at stopping-places the globe will thus have been girdled completely by air within a total flying period of approximately 200 hours, which is a little over eight days, or one-tenth the time suggested by Jules Verne a while ago hen he startled the passing generation will* the •’unbelievable'’ idea of “around the world in eighty days*’.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Thomas Muir, The Romantic Career of a Glasgow Man </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Peter Bunn (Glasgow)</span></h6>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">N THE beautiful cemetery of Chantilly, near</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Paris, is the grave of Thomas Muir of Huntershill, who in his short, unhappy life of thirty-four years, passed through adventures such as have fallen the lot of few outside the pages of fiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">His name will ever be honored for the work he did in social reform; but it is rather the extraordinary incidents in his career, especially following his sedition trial, that we here wish to relate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Muir was born in 1764, in an old landmark in High Street, Glasgow, long since improved out ©f recognition. He studied for the law, and became one of the most promising advocates at the Scottish Bar. Very soon, however, he was denouncing the corruption of the times and urging the need of social reform. The Reform Association, which he established in the Star Hotel in Ingram Street, Glasgow, attracted much attention; and the Ayrshire branch numbered Robert Bums among its members for a time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Banishment</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">HEN Muiifo fiery speeches reached the ears of the government his friends warned him of the danger he was incurring; but he would not desist. Going to London to consult some friends there, he was tempted to visit Paris also, then in the throes of the French Revolution, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his hero, Lafayette. During his absence from Scotland he was summoned to appear in Edinburgh before the&lt;uthorities, on a charge of sedition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With undaunted courage Muir returned (but not without great difficulty, for war meanwhile had broken out between Britain and France) and faced his accusers. In spite of his brilliant speech in his own defence, and in spite of the efforts of good friends in the House of Commons, he was convicted, sentenced to fourteen years banishment; and vias sent from Ins native country to Botany Bay, Australia, a convict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Muir arrived in Australia in 1794—being then thirty years of age—to begin his fourteen years exile. The governor and he soon became the best of friends, and the cultured young prisoner settled down to his new life in the convict colony. He taught many of the convicts to read and write. His father’s parting gift to him, a Bible, was the textbook used by him in teaching this strange class. The same Bible served </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him </span><span class="font7">well on another critical occasion in his life, as will be mentioned. The two years spent in exile in Sydney were probably the happiest years of Thomas Muir's life, and his banishment came to an end in a most dramatic manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One day in 1796 an American ship, the &quot;Otter sailed into Botany Bay harbor, ostensibly to take on water and supplies. Iler officers came ashore and made themselves agreeable with the governor, and also met some of the prisoners ; and when the &quot;Otter” left next morning Muir’s hut was found to be empty. In a letter pinned on his pillow lie ll.anked the govexuor for his kindness. President George Washington, having heard of Muir’s hard lot, had sent the &quot;Otter” al] the way from th Pacific Coast of America specially to rescue him from exile, </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">an</span><span class="font7">d the mission had been carried out as planned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">In The Hands ef Indians</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270112_files/g_E_19270112-10.png" alt="" style="width:19pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">UIR was fated never to meet George Washington, however. The voyage which had begun so well ended in disaster; the “Otter” being completely wrecked near Vancouver, B. C. The unfortunate Scotsman escaped the waves, but fed into the hands of the Indians. But they, strange to say, treated him well, and he lived for several weeks among them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Muir then set out southward, actually walked over 4.000 miles, alone, unarmed, taking his bearings from the stars, and finally reached the city of Panama. There the Spaniards, who were then at war with Great Britain, arrested him and took him by way of Vera Cruz to Havana; and from there they put him aboard one of two frigates sailing for Cadiz, Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We now come to one of the most remarkable incidents in this remarkable life. Nearing Cadiz the two Spanish frigates fed in with the British fleet; and as Britain and Spain were at war, a fight followed. The Spaniards surrendered; but the last shot fired in the action laid low five men on one of the ships, and Muir was one of the five. The captors then boarded the Spanish vessels; and a young British officer, turning over the dead with his foot before ordering them to be cast over the side, saw a Bible fall out of tha blood-stained clothes of one of them. He was surprised to see that it was an English Bible, and looking at the man. saw that he was still alive. He was more amazed, on a second glance, to</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">recognize in the wounded man an old college chum, none other than Thomas Muir! He had his old friend sent ashore and delivered to the care of the Spanish Governoi of Odiz; for he knew that the British government had get a price on Muir’s head since his escape from Bor any Bay, and that this was the best means of saving his lite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thanks to Napoleon, Muir finally reached the French capital once again, after having traveled at mind the weild during four wri <sup>p,</sup>il yearsf and m Paris he was received with every honor, be was iw <sup>t</sup>-nfe at last; bin aley lie enjoyed his <sub>M</sub>metms-s mM reedom for em\ G dit short me; tl&lt;s.

<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Small Business Going to the Wall</span></h6>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE trend of the small business is definitely toward the wall. The chain stores are adding link upon link. The larger factories are taking over more and more of the smaller plants and closing them down, to rust away. Any person traveling much around the country can hardly, fail to see the truth of these statements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The small business is doomed. .No matter how well it is organized it cannot produce goods as economically as the larger unit. In 1923 the per capita production in the larger plants was 48.1 percent greater than in the plants of less than $1,OOO,(XX&gt; output of product per year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1923 the plants producing $1,000,000 of product employed 57.1% of all wage earners and produced 6G.4% of all manufactures. The small manufacturer is doomed. The jobber is doomed. The giants with their chain stores will soon have everything in their hands, to do with as they will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The giants are sure to put up prices more and more as they get things more and more under their control. They will add on &quot;service charges” for this, that and tile other thing, gas, water, electricity, telephone and other necessities, until they will literally have the common people eating out of their hands. This is no prophecy. It is fact, based upon the accumulated evidence everywhere available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord’s kingdom is the only way out of the dilemma; and unless all indications fail the giants are bound, soon or late, to try to put into effect some stringent regulations against any questioning that their diabolical arrangement is not itself Christ’s kingdom for which He taught us to pray.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Fundamentalism in Alabama</span></h6>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">F</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">undamentalism, like everything else, is to be known by its works. Alabama is a sort of center of fundamentalism in the United States. Nearly every good Alabaman is a Fundamentalist; that is to say, he is a believer in eternal torture. How this works out in practice is disclosed by the following testimony of what happened at the Flat Top, Alabama, prison eamp. The account was published in the Memphis </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Commercial Appeal’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ ■•Pugh ■said Knox came to Flat Top with several other prisoners on. Aug. 8, and went down in the mines on Aug. 9. That night, he said, the cheek runner came out complaining that Knox didn’t or couldn’t do any work on account of his heavy weight. The warden the next morning kept Knox out of the mines and let him do some whitewashing. That was on Saturday, according to Pugh, who stated that the warden told Knox he would have to go into the mine on Monday. Knox went into the mine Monday and he understood that “some of the men in the mines beat him up that day&quot;, lie said that Knox had marks on him and' came to the hospital every evening when he came out of the mines. Prisoners told him• Knox was “beaten up” practically every day that lie had been in the mines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pugh said Knox went down to work Wednesday morning and the same thing happened that day. Knox, lie stated, came out of the mine Wednesday afternoon and the warden had the doctor examine him that evening. The dWor d’do’t see any reason why Knox should have come out of the mine. Knox, he sain, was sent back to Work Thursday morning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thw-day rih-rmen, Pugh stated, the men came out as u.-trrl uh r A w r. ibrmi -.b wi'b th-b- tub—the time b '' c ■&lt;&gt;' h -ii </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">t\ &gt;&gt;&nbsp;. </span><span class="font5">.a&quot; ip m W m &lt;* f D Houston came from the &lt;-L t.&gt; ~ t at <sup>;</sup>' 11&lt; wr^on yard used for , «. <sup>h</sup> m I i't ' a , uU &lt;&nbsp;‘h vat full of cold water.

<p><span class="font5">Shortly afterwards, Pugh said eight or ten men came, bringing Knox from the mouth of the mines. Knox was being dragged, he said.</span></p>

I went through the hall and went out at the backdoor and when I got to the door the warden asked me ‘What the h— I waa doing coming out there?’ or &quot;'What the h— I wanted?? I told him I had come out to plead for this man’s lif® and that they ought to be ashamed for treating him like that. I walked on out there. Mr. Davis’ son told me that they had held Knox under water for five minutes at the time and it didn’t even faze him. Well, I stood around there and, of course, th-&gt; v -in r kept getting hotter and he kept begging more pitifully and looked to ,mel like he was screaming loud enoiight to have everybody; hear in the whole country around.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pugh stated-in his testimony that all the wbiffi prisoners had collected in the lower end of the white coll of the prison to see what they could—that they ‘‘couldn't see exactly how it was carried on, hut they could hear the man begging for his life”. Pugh said there wasn’t any whipping there at that time but stated: “This man was begging the warden to take him out of that hot water and beat him to death, or shoot him to death, Knox saying, ‘Any kind of death besides this? He begged the warden and told him that he bad a mother a”d he would love to see his mother again. The waidtu told him, ‘No, you want me to take you out and beat you up and put you in the hospital where you can show i our bruises and injuries to everyone that comes amuud ami tell them I did it? He added, ‘Pm going to wind ymi up and bury you? ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pugh further charged that, as the “ducking” wm tinned, they would pull Knox’s Lead above water .aiic .h.y it on the curb of the vrt and that, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span class="font5"> i th * lab r. ho ,e ; his mid v.u- rei.'hl.'

He said they were all at Flat Top with the exception of Homer Anderson, who had been paroled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pugh said that Knox lay with his head on the curbing for some little bit and that he wasn’t able to make any fuss at ail. But it could be seen he was breathing. After he had lain there for some seven or eight minutes, Pugh testified the warden said: “Boys, lie is just possumiag on us.

Knox was carried by negroes into the hospital and in the bathroom there, he said, afior he, Push, had carried out mstruetiouB to go in and run all the premiere into the negro ward and close the door between the wards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the body of Knox had been carried into the bathroom, Pugh alleges, it was set down in a bathtub of water. He s-aul as soon as that was done, ‘'■'the warden told the- negro, Homer Anderson, to get ‘■time poison and fix it up and pump it into his stomach, which he did. He went into the dressing room and I suppose took eight or ten or wajhe more tablets and put into a gallon wa«hpan and filled it full of water aod took a stomach pump cut of the drug room and ran it through his mouth and down into his stomach and poured this poison into his stoath ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aftei the poison was pumped into the stomach of the dead man, Pugh said that every one went off and that Warden Davis’ son came back to sec him and sa’d that his &quot;'father warted to know if v&gt;? ihoiipld ve had enought of that stuff in his stomach”, adding “You want to be sure about that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pugh alleged that Harden Davis came back to see him a little later “and told me that if I ever opened mv mouth about it that, of course, it would mean a lifetime sentence for him and probably at the same time a long sentence for me. 1 told him I didn’t figure that I was in any way responsible for what had happened and t’mii I didn't feai that part at all.&quot;’ it was at this point in his statement that- Pugh testified that “everywhere you would touch the skin on Knox's body the skin, ■would slio off, and a finger nail would eouie off, or half off.” *</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pugh said the death certificate vh'ch he partly filled out had been tampered with, a piece of paper having been pasted over the original line railing for the cause of death. Pugh said a letter written to Knox's next of kin uas returned in the mails as undeliverable because of improper address. lie “didn’t know whether the letter was intentionally misdirected”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pugh said the warden went over to see the prison doctor after <sup>-</sup> Knox died and told him the man had committed suicide and that there wasn't any use for him to come up. The doctor made the certificate the next morning on what the warden had told him. H« stated the doctor looked at the body, but did not mad® an examination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pugh said the vat was of concrete, five feet wide, seven feri long, and three fe~t deep. He said Knox wa4 put into the cat vifh his mining clothes on and that his hands were not handcuffed. or tied. Pugh declared he win n itlun five feet of Knox and was looking at him when “he was protesting against them ducking him any more’’. He said Knox was standing practically still; that the negroes had him by the hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Afiied to derer <sup>K</sup>o Know Pugh said he would think he weighed something over ?&quot;&gt;o pounds, was about five leet live inches tall and that he had light hair. In anwr to a que^+'on, Pugh -a.d he know that Knox’s head had been put under v»aler; that the negroes had hold of him, b'd he didn't know what part of his'body they had hold of Tn reipome to a request, Pugh described the place vheie the body of Knox was interred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pollowing the alleged forcing of poison into the body of the dead man, Pugh testified that Homer Anderson, the negro, smashed the bottle of tablets on the radiator, scattering the tablets and glass over the room, in an effort to make it appear that he had struck it from Knox’s hand. Pugh stated that it was first planned to make it appear that he, Pugh, had struck the bottle from Knox’s hand, but when he refused to sign a statement given him by the warden, the responsibility was placed on Homer Anderson. At the bottom of the statement Pugh said, “lie just put it ‘'Hospital Steward.* Well, I was known as the hospital steward and he my assistant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The testimony above given was supported by that of several other witnesses, all of whom agree that this man, who wa‘s too stout to work at mining, n as cooked alive. One witness stated that wherever the skin was touched on the body it would slip </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">off,</span><span class="font7"> and that the fingers were burned so badly that when the skin came off some of the meat came with it.

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">N The Golden Age No. 178, issue of July 14, 1926, I read with interest the article entitled Air-Pockets” by J. A. Bohnet; and with the author’s permission I would like to go into more detail. It is not my desire to be unkind or critical, but merely to express some facts based on actual flying experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I am not proud of it, but must admit the fact that I was a flying officer in the U. S. Army ilir Service during the “war to end war”. Thus I gained first-hand information concerning air currents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are, actually, no spaces in the firmament in which there is no air; but where a downward convectional current comes m contact with an jpward coiiveclional current, there is a disturbance of more or less magnitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The air over a ploughed field, a lake or a swamp falls rapidly, -due to the cool surface of the earth, which condenses the air and makes </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">it </span><span class="font7">heavier. But the air over a field of grain, corn or grass, or over an expanse of sand or stone, rises, due to the warm surface of the earth, which expands the air and makes it lighter. These upward and downward movements of air are termed “convectional currents”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For a crude illustration: If an airplane is flyrag at an altitude of say 4000 feet over a field of grain, using the upward convectional current to help support it and then suddenly enters an area over a ploughed field where the eon-vectional current is downward, the ship will rock and roll; and a green flyer will enjoy anything but peace of mind. This is what flyers call “air-pockets”. In other words, the air f</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">alls </span><span class="font7">out from under the ship, with the result that the ship drops down until it gets into one or the other of these air currents where it becomes jerkily righted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another thing that causes a ship to drop under the described conditions, is that over one-half of the lilting power of the wings is due to the partial vacuum created on top of the wings by reason of the ship’s motion; and descending air currents fill this vacuum, causing the ship to lote ever fifty percent of its floating efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many people think that an airplane wing lifts because it is thrust along at such a speed that it skims and thus raises the ship. This is only partially true. A cioss sectional view of an airplane wing reveals a camber, or curve, from front to rear, and the top surface has mors curve than the bottom. By thrusting this through the air a vacuum is created on the rear half of the top of the wing, and it is this that lifts the greater part of the load,</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">F</span><span class="font7">OR the past fifteen years I have been cultivating grapes. Earii year the yield was practically the same until 1925, when the yield suddenly increased about three hundred percent. My vines became so heavy with fruit that I had to tie them up or prop them. Where I had formerly found one bunch of grapes on a twig, last year I began to find three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Several of my friends noticed it and asked me how I accounted for this startling and sudden increase. I told them that I did not know, because I had done nothing in the way of earing for the grapes that I had not been doing in previous years. The more I thought over it the more puzried I became.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One morning, as I was cleaning away some trash under the vines, I noticed in this trash thousands of dead insects. This was unusual; for in former years I had observed that the ground around the vines sometimes seemed alive with insects. I followed up this clue, and each morning I looked around under the vines and found the same thing—miltitudes of lifeless insects which had manifestly died during the night. And running my hands through the'vines in the daytime I could find but few bugs which in former years had appeared in abundance, hiding themselves from the hot sun by day and sucking and injuring the vines by night But what I did find was a lot of gnats and insects which were dcs-i and which had not yet fallen off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I was mystified, even though knowing that W are entering into the Golden Age wherein the earth shall yield her increase, and realizing also that this increase would doubtless come about in a perfectly natural way. Therefore I continued my investigation of this phenomenon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font7"> wondered why thetj insects which daily came to the vines should there meet their death before the next morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Finally I noticed that my neighbor’s radio aerial parallels my lot on the v hole length of my vineyard, and it occurred to me that the tension on this aerial, when he turns on his radio set each evening, and the vibrations thereby set up, have a destructive effect upon insect life in th&amp;imme-diate vicinity. I consulted a radio expert and ho confirmed my conviction. It is also likely that these radio waves have a beneficial effect upon the growth of the vines aside from the destruction of the parasites which sap their vitality. No doubt the ultimate benefits of radio are now little suspected. It is yet only in its infancy.</span></p>

They never attempt to move off-—they can’t. One blow from the sharp end of the club and the baby is weltering in its gore. The skinning takes place immediately, the blubber and skin being removed together, and often pieces of the dark and quivering flesh.

<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">HEN Jehovah God makes a promise, that promise is certain of fulfilment in His due time. Through His prophet Isaiah (46:10,11) He says: “My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure. . . . yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among the promises God made long ago was this one through His prophet (Isaiah 65:17): ’ “For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The new heaven and new earth will result beneficially to man, and of this we are sure, because the same prophet of God said: “Be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is reasonable that when the time approaches for the establishment of the new heaven and new earth God would have the people informed concerning this great fact. It is also reasonable that God would have those who really believe His Word, and who lovo and serve Him, to be His witnesses to give this testimony to the people. Zion means, God’s organization made up of those who love the Lord God. The Scriptures prove that these conclusions are correct, because it is written in Isaiah 51:16: “And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In order that these texts and others relating thereto may be understood it is essential that proper definitions be given to some of the words used in connection therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Hemm</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">rpiIE word heaven is defined as that which is lofty and high, that which is looked up to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To men the things of heaven are invisible. The invisible powers of heaven are exercised over men, influencing and controlling them. The righteous man, made so by reason of being in Christ Jesus, is influenced and controlled by the Lord God. The glory of the Lord is set above the heavens. (Psalm 8:1) That would mean that Jehovah is above all things that are lofty and high, and greater than the heavens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Certain scriptures show that Satan for a long while had access to heaven, and that at times he appeared with the righteous sons of God before the Eternal One. (Job 1:6-8) This was true because God did not prevent him from being there. But the time finally came for the Anointed One of Jehovah to act and to exclude Satan from heaven, and this he did.—Psalm 110: 2; Revelation 12:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan, being cast out of the presence of Jehovah and no longer permitted to appear there nor to carry on his operations in the realm of God, must henceforth confine his operations to the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Devil is yet invisible to human eyes. His earthly organization looks up to him. In the eyes of the peoples of the world he is still lofty and high; and although his operations are confined to the earth and to the peoples of the earth, his heaven and the heaven of the world in connection therewith still persist. This is the heaven which must pass away with a great noise, and the Scriptures dedare that this wall take place during the battle of Armageddon.—2 Peter 3:10; Revelation 19:11-21; 20:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It must be remembered that God does everything orderly and according to His schedule of time. When Israel was overthrown in 606 B. C. ' Satan there became the god of all peoples, because prior thereto he cent roll'd nil nations aside fr&lt; in Israel. It was al th t! time that the Gentiles began universal rule of the earth, and the Scriptures show that it is Gods pimos to permit the Gentiles to rule Without intermuition for a specific period of time, lint p rd of time marking the end of the GeaiiJ'L uninterrupted rule was in 191<sup>J</sup>.

It m now a matter of history that this prophecy began its lull]huent in 1914 with the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Jesus ascended on high He mm com mnnded to sit down; that is to say, .! &gt;&nbsp;to remain inactive agamst the Devil rniHI God’s due time for Him to act.

<p><span class="font7">The new heavens here mentioned could not have reference to the righteous organization of Jehovah that has existed from th*<sup>1</sup> Leginn’ng. It must have reference to the government of the peoples of mankind. Satan’s invisible organization has long conrtitutid the heavens of mankind. Now the time lies arrived when God will establish a rmhtcous. invisible rule for mankind, and that invisible ruiinc power will constitute the new heavens. Christ is the invisible ruling power for the saints on earth. God, threnjj Christ, will artabl; h a rrtirtous rum for all mankind op earth. Before that is done the v. i&lt;_ked invisible ruler must be restrained and his rule destroyed: heme the prophecies foielelling the destruction of the old heavens and me old earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This work d «cribed under d'iTerent figures of epeoeb. tor instance: &quot;Lift up yoor ews to the heav&lt;-m, ai d <sup>11</sup> &gt;k upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish awav like smoke, and the earth shall v ax old like a garment, and they that dv.ell therein dia’l 'lie in like manner: but my salvation sh.-dl he for over, and my righteousness shall not b« abolished.'<sup>5</sup> (Isaiah 51:6) When something “goes up in smoke’’ it means it is at ar end. When a garment grows old it is put aside for ever. Then again the prophet says: “And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.”—Isaiah 34:4; Revelation 6:14-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is Jehovah who establishes the new heavens and the new earth. Christ, at His first advent, was anointed to be King. He took His power and began His operations as God’s Anointed during His second advent, in 1914. There the heaven was planted. Heaven, in this instance, refers to the invisible ruling powers that ultimately shall rule and control all the nations of the earth. That heaven was planted when Satan was expelled and Christ began His reign. The foundation of the earth is the basis for the new organization of righteousness amongst men of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is God’s purpose to have a witness given to the people concerning this new heaven ami new earth before He completely destroys the old. To accomplish this purpose He jmts His message into the mouth of those who are of Zion. To them TTe says: We are my witnesses tha: I am God; go now and tell the people what my purpose is; by performing this commission fa .nfdiy you will pw-ve that you are of Zion, and therefore I may say unto you: “Thou art my people.” ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">HpHE testimony concerning the new heavens and new earth must be given by the saints while on the earth. This testimony must beghen to die nations and peoples, that some at least Fc’p be prepared to receive the kingdom and be ready &lt;.o walk upon the highway of the Lord. God puts into the mouths of His anointed ones His voids and directs them, to “say among the. nations that the Lord reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously”.—Psalm 96:10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The time for the giving of this testimony is fixed when the Lord takes His porver and begins His reign. The promise then is that the world, to be composed of the new heavens and iww earth, shall be established that it cannot be moved. That means that the peoples of the earth shall become subject to Christ instead of subject to Satan, and that the organization of God on the earth will be a righteous one; for the Lord shall judge in righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people have for a long time been called upon to rally to various standards, all of -which are false standards. The enemy has caused these various standards to he raised up that blindness might result to the people and they be turned away from the true God. Now it is the duty of the anointed, to whom God has committed His Word, to lift up the true standard of God. This they do by telling the truth concerning the Devil’s organization and concerning God’s organization, and now God is going to deliver the people from their oppressors and bless them with everlasting life and happiness. The Lord God lias provided this message and will have it delivered. The truly anointed ones will give this testimony. This is one of the present works for the church..</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is often wondered by some why God has</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">caused His Word to be preached so long. Water dropping upon a rock for a long period of time will wear the rock away. Truth stated from many viewpoints, time and time again repeated, will ultiuiattly make an impression upon some minds. It seems therefore that it has pleased God to have His plan stated time and again that some might hear and profit thereby and might join the small company of His avJik s.- in the earth before the passing away completely of the ©Id and the establishment of the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The anointed ones of Cod are those who are really cobm crated to do God’s will, who are begotten of tl li ily spirit, and v,ho frt- i!.' rtforc real Christrnns and follow in the fooritops of Jesus.

<p><span class="font7">EALTH is one of the things that the people have long desired. AU have suffered from lack of health. All the efforts that man has been able to put forth have not brought lasting health to the people. There is nothing in the standards held up by the various systems or governments that contain any basis for a hope of health. Look now to the standard of the Lord and se® what it promises to those who walk humbly before Him. The Lord says: “Behold, 1 will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.” (Jeremiah 33:6) “And the inhabitant shall not say, 1 am sick; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.”-— Isaiah 33:24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">1FE in a state of peace and happiness is the greatest desire of man. For sixty centuries the human family has been racked by disease, and bullions have gone down in sorrow to the grave. All the schemes that men have ever put forth concerning eternal life, all the statements •upon the standard of men or institutions promising lift, have been and are false. Satan declared thet there is no death; and his representatives on earth have been preaching for centuries that man does not die. But human experience proves that this is entirely false. Why longer be deceived by the false standards of men? Turn now to the standard of the Lord and seo uhai it holds as a hope for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus Christ declared: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.” (John 17:3) Keep always in mind that originally God gave life to man and that God took away that right to life because of disobedience. Remember then that God alone provided for the redemption of man from death and the grave according to His promise; that these provisions for redemption are through the merit of the ransom sacrifice of the Lord Jesus; that God has appointed a day or period of time in which He will give all men an opportunity to reap the benefits of this ransom sacrifice and an opportunity to be restored to perfect human life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is in the Messianic kingdom on earth that this opportunity shall be given to man; and this kingdom is now beginning. The apostle states that the second coming and reign of the Lord is for the purpose of giving an opportunity first to the living and then to those who are dead; and that this opportunity shall be given in His kingdom. (2 Timothy 4:1) The kingdom is now beginning, and that is w<sup>r</sup>by these truths are coming to the knowledge of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Prophet Job, in poetic phrase, describes the miserable condition in which man finds himself, and shows how va*n it is to follow the standards of men; and then he turns his words to the Messenger of the covenant, namely, the Lord Jesus Christ, the King of kings. He shows that this great Messenger is the One among a thousand and altogether lovely; and that if man hears and obeys this great Messenger, who interprets and makes the Word of God plain, God then “is gracious unto him, and saith, Delivery him from going down to the pit [grave]”; and the response of man is: “I have found a ransom.” Then what shall result to the one who is obedient and wrnlks humbly before God? The prophet answers: “His flesh shall bo fresher than a child’s; he shall return to the days ofi his youth.”—Job 33:19-25.</span></p>

The Lord Jesus Christ declares that he who accepts and obeys the truth shall be set free; and wdien the Lord sets him free he shall be free indeed.

<p><span class="font7">man has enjoyed on this earth has been temporary. There have no real joy and happiness resulted, nor can such ever result, from heeding and following standards of men. Why now should we longer hold to those withering standards ? Let us turn our minds now to God's standard, which He has commanded to now be held up to the people, and seo whether or not it furnishes a basis of hope for happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What could produce happiness? The answer is: To enjoy everlasting peace, everlasting plenty, everlasting health, everlasting life. All these things are guaranteed by the Scriptures,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If all the blind eyes should be restored so that they could see; if all deafness should pass away, all lameness or crookedness of body should cease; if there should be nothing in the land io harm; if the governments always were righteous and the people righteous and love the motive directing their actions, would not that be </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> happy time? Is not this really what the people desire? God’s Word furnishes an absolute and certain hope for the realization of this desire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">L</span><span class="font8">ITERALLY </span><span class="font7">the term disease means lack of ease. Applied to the human body it means a disturbed condition of body interrupting the proper functioning of one or more parts of the human organism, threatening or causing pain and sickness. Unless the difficulty is removed and the disease cured death ultimately results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Figuratively the term may be applied to the mind, and when so applied it means that one has a disturbed condition of mind, causing disquiet, distress and mental anguish. Insanity is the result of a diseased brain which fails to properly function.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Death is the great enemy of man. It is the final result of disease. Naturally man fights desperately against that which would take away his ease and comfort, and his life. In all ages man has put forth strenuous efforts to destroy disease, relieve himself from suffering, and to bring about, a condition of ease and comfort. All peoples have sought means to eradicate disease and keep men alive. One who is greatly diseased becomes a burden to himself and a burden to others. Without ease and comfort life cannot be enjoyed even for a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When one becomes sick and is suffering he senas for the doctor. The savage has his medicine man who distills herbs and administers these, or applies various kinds of oib. He does the bes' lie can for the sufferer. Some good usually results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The allopathic physician makes an examination, finds his patient suffering, and prescribes a catlmrlle and other strong drugs to relieve his pair. These for a time destroy the pain, and the patiem T inks lie is well. Temporary good results,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The chiropractic doctor adjusts the spina! vertebrae, relieves the impingement of nerves, stimulates the circulation, and causes pain to cease. He too brings some good results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the disease has produced some abnormal growth, in the body, the surgeon’s knife is often resorted to. When the abnormal growth is removed some ease results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Other schools of doctors, finding their patients in a bad condition, resort to dieting. Some good results from proper eating; evil results from improper eating. A comparatively well man -will become sick from improper food or overeating of proper food. A sick man may be greatly benefited by using some good common sense concerning his food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All these methods of treatment of disease result in some temporary good. Every man desires his doctor when he is sick. He does not wish to suffer, and he is anxious to have the doctor come and do the best he can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While it is true that many doctors are more interested in making money than they are in making the sick well, yet I am sure that the greater number of doctors are honest in their efforts to benefit mankind. Let us proceed upon the theory that all are honest, that their methods of treatment are honest, and that they are putting forth their best endeavors to bring about a healthy condition of ease and comfort for mankind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It would seem to be far better if all the schools would try to ascertain all the good that is in each method of treatment and then combine them, that at least as much temporary relief as possible may come to mankind.

My purpose is to call attention to God’s way, and to show my audience that the time is approaching when disease will be eliminated, when sickness will be unknown, when the people will no more say, IVe are sick,’ but when health, happiness and joy shall come and abide with the people for ever-, and man will live upon this earth for ever and not die at all. I submit that this is worthy of the consideration of all men, even of the : <sup>: </sup>preachers.

But I remind you that when Jesus was about to take His departure from the earth He stated that He was going away to prepare a place for His ehnreh, that He would return and would set up His kingdom, and that when the kingdom is set up then He won]J heal the people and Hess them with 'health awl strength, even as He had shown by the samples or examples of healing which He performed while on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The death of Jesus was not for ths benefit of merely a few, but He gave His life a ransom for all to be testified to all in due time. (1 Timothy 2:5, 6) By the grace of God lie died for every uian, (Hebrews 2:9) Ifot in order for man io have the benefit thereof he must have kvo vledge of Jesus* death and resurrection, and of the value ot His socrifwe, and have an opportunity to accept and render hiwc-lf in obedience to God's law. The time for giving the world that knowledge is just now beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dining the past nineteen hundred years the Lord has been merely taking out from amongst the woild a few people who, because of their faithful devotion to Him unto death, are prom-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">feed a part with Him in this heavenly kingdom. The mass of mankind have not even Iwn taken into consideration. Their time now is drawing nigh. And why do 1 say that I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kmffd&amp;m Here</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE evidence show’s that the kingdom of heaven is at band. The chuieli is about completed. The promise was that the heavens should retain Jesus Christ for a ceitain time, and that His second coming world nwk the beginning of the restoration of all things. (Acts 3:19) Every one of God’s holy pi ophets foretold this coming time of restoration. 'Restoration in ibis text means to restoif<sup>1</sup> that which was lost. Adam lost his right to life. Jesus bought that right to life for mankind, and restoration means that the Lord Jesus Christ, as God's great representative, will restore all the obedient ones of mankind to life and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because of this fact the second coming of Christ has been looked forward to by Christians with, the greatest interest, and now when the time has arrived it becomes the duty and privilege of every true Christian to tell the people about this glad fact. To them Jehovah says, &quot;Ye are my witnesses”,—go and tell the people of my plan. The only excuse for a Christian now being on the earth is to inform his fellowman about the Lord God and about His plan of redemption and restoration to life and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Great Physician</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">T MUST be conceded that until man has the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font7"> to live he could not fully live. If the Lord Jesus has bought this right to life for mankind then it is His privilege, by God’s grace, to give it to man. A gift is a contract. The giver must be able and willing to give; and the receiver must have knowledge of the gift and be willing to receive it. It is written:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘'For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which .receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness, shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ. Therefore, as by the offence ‘of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.”—Homans 5:17-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every righteous creature has the right to live, Righteousness will come to man through the Lord. When Jesus was on earth, and speaking of the coming time of His reign, He said: &quot;If a man keep my s.ajdng, he shall never see death.® &quot;Whosoever livoth and briievelh in me shall never die.” (John 8: 51; 11: 26) Man must first be brought to a knowledge of these truths, and then obey the laws of the Lord. Ho will then receive the benefit of the great ransom sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The book of Job is an allegorical statement of the course of man. Job was a good man and therefore represented man in his perfection. Then Job was afflicted by a great disease. He was covered with boils all over his body, and suffered great agony and pain. Wide he thus suffered his neighbors came and reviled him, and said many unkind things. This well pictures the suffering of the human race throughout the ages. During that period of suffering Job declared: ‘T know’ that my Redeemer liveth.” As shown by the foregoing statement by the Apostle Paul, a man must know about his Redeemer, accept Him and obey Him as the great Savior, if he would be restored to health and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then Job describes a sick man, and this well represents all the sick human family. He says: &quot;He is chastened also with, pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain: so that his life abhorretli bread, and his soul dainty meat. His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen: and his bones that were not seen, stick out. Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his .'life to the destroyers.”— Job 33:19-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The whole human race now is in a miserable condition. The doctors are doing their best, but they can give only temporary relief. When the people know the great Physician and submit to Him, and He heals them, they will stay healed. This great Physician is called the .Messenger of the Covenant, the One whom Jehovah provides for the blessing of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Job continues: &quot;If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show unto man his uprightness; then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. His flesh shall be f resher than a child’s; he shall-return to the days of his youth,” (Job 33:2325) .When the old and sick and decrepit and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">withered return to the days of their youth and when their flesh becomes fresher than a child’s then they will be well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The great Physician, Christ Jesus, will teach the people how to eat and what to eat, how to exercise and how to care for themselves; and all these things will be set forth in the new law covenant which God will make for man. The law covenant that God gave to Israel provided what they should do in order to live. Now, says the Lord, He will make a new covenant for the benefit of mankind, and in that He will teach man what to do in order to become well and live. Man’s legal disability having been removed by the merit of Christ Jesus, then the Lord will put His laws in the minds of men and write them upon their hearts and He will be their God and the people will be His people. “And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know ye the Lord: for rdl shall know me from the least to the greatest.”—Hebrews 8: 8-11</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord will teach the people how to come back to Him, and this way is pictured by a &quot;great highway. Through His prophet He says: “And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called, The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: tlm wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.”-—Jsaiab 35:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the people start back to the Lord in the right uay, believing Him, believing His Word, and being obedient to God and His law, * Th in the ey^s of the hfin-J shafl be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped; then shall the lame leap as an buri, and the tongue of dumb &amp;irg: because men will know the wav to life.”—Isaiah 35: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Amongst other bfosmngs whwh the Lord says He will giant to Uie people then is to give them health. Through His prophet Jeremiah (33:6) lie says: “Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will mire them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.” The healing ©f the people ’ at they ihea n reive will be complete: “And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.”—Isaiah 33: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord Jesus has provided a ransom price for the entire human family, and all the people must have an opportunity to have a knowledge of the truth and receive the blessing that God</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SC. Xs</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">intends for them. “And the ransomed of th© Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.” (Isaiah 35:10) Zion here means God’s anointed kingdom class, Christ Jesus and His church. This is the means for man’s return to God, and as man returns to God he will be at ease and come with rejoicing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">AU of men’s interests will then be under the supervision of the great Messiah. Jehovah God shall be the God of the people and the people shall be His people. “And God shall wipe away all lears from thoir eyes; and there shall bo po more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither slfall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write; for these words are true and faithful.”—-Revelation 21:4,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, when the time comes that there is no more sorrow and crying, no more pain, and no more death, there will be no more sickness; there will be no fear of such a thing. Those of mankind who are sick m mind will be made well. Having an organism made well they will know how to think well, Fear and dread causes many to be mentally sick and also physically sick. Ender the great and righteous Messiah's reign this difficulty will he removed. No longer shall the people fear wars or famines or pestilences, nor hospitals, nor profiteers, nor anything of the kind. They will be saying in the language of the Prophet Micah to each other:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Come, and let us go up ro the mountain, [kingdom] of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and be will teach as of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for tim law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree: and none shall make them afraid: for th@ mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it.”— Micah 4:2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And now we see that the real cause of sickness is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">sin,</span><span class="font7"> the transgression of God’s law by Adam, and we see the inherited results by all</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">23. God has all power in the universe, for it ■was He who made the universe. &quot;Is anything too hard for the Lord!” (Genesis 18:14) The stars, the great spaces, the deep waters, the high mountains, yes, and the tiny, tiny animals which are found in drops of water, are the works of God’s limitless power. “In the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.”—Isaiah 26:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">24. When we realize this fact we shall readily see that God has something wonderful in store for humanity when the proper time comes to reveal it. Jehovah has a great plan, formed from the very beginning of things, which He only could think of or carry out. “With God all things are possible.”—Matthew 19: 26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">25. In following lessons we are going to study this plan, step by step, that we may enjoy the blessings it will bring. Nothing can stop the plan of God, nothing can alter it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">26. God’s great plan in being fulfilled in many ways at present. As time goes on we shall be enabled to see more and more of it, like the unfolding of a beautiful flower.</span></p></li></ul>

King David, a very wise man of long ago, felt the Lord’s love so keenly that he wrote many psalms, or songs of praise, about it. “Because thy loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.” (Psalm 63: 3) Thus sang David, in the Book of the Bible called “Psalms”.</span></p></li></ul>

<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark34"></a>STUDIES IN THE “HARP OF GOD”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">issue Number 00 we began running Judge Ratherord’s new book, |T&quot;| “The Harp of God”, with aecampanying questions, ta&amp;tng place of both frlrf Advanced and Juvenile Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the other faithful prophets doscrih<sup>0</sup>-! by the Apostle Paul in Hebrews 11 are promised a bettor resurrection; because of the slid eiuent of the prophet that they shall be princes or rulers in all the earth (Psalm 45:16), it is to he expected that they 'will be the first ones raised under the terms Gi the new covenant. Therefore it is reasonable to enpe, t them tc- be hack -n crith at the beginning of the restoration <sup>1,lf</sup> -sings. Hence these faithful ffi“n nmy be expected on earth within the nevt few years. T1 ey will constitute the legal x'evu seiJtativos of rim Christ in the earth. They vill be die visible xepreseniatives of the king-dim of hea-T-n. These are the ones who shall administer the affairs of earth under the direction of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">” We therefore Sv? that there are two phases 01 God’s kingdom: The heavenly, which is invisible: and the earridy, which is visible, the faithful prophets of old, namely, the ancient worthies representing the Lord in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>r</sup>'<sup>2</sup> The Lord through His prophet Zechariah gives a woodcrful picture of the establishment of th's kmg l©m and of the blessings that will come. The piopheey is written in highly symbolic phrase. It reads: “His feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toAvard the east and toward the west, and there shall be a vi. ry gn at valley: and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south. And ye shall flee to the valley ©f the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azai: yea, ye shall flee, like as yc- fled from b&lt; fore the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah; and the Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.” (Zechariah 14: 4, 5) “His feet” in this prophecy represent Jehovah's feet, while mountain symbolizes kingdom. The olive is a symbol of light, peace, and divine blessing; hence the picture is that Jehovgh’s authority, represented by His feet, will bo established upon earth, by a kingdom of light, peace, and blessing. The cleaving of this mountain in the midst, showing &gt;&nbsp;part on the north and a part on the south, pictures the two yl-ams, heavenly and earthly, of the Messianic kmgihiu; and the valley between represents the valhy of blessings. Into this valley the sin sick, sore, feeble, oppressed, yea all, shall floe ami there receive the blessings of the Lord, which will make them rich in health and peace and happiness for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">’S'Twin v one, then, who believes God's Word and v. ho confidently expects the kingdom to bring blessing? to mankind and who sees .it now being ofablished should watch for the return of Abraham and the other faithful prophets and get into communication with them as soon as possible after their return. And acting under their advice, all such vwill doubtless find early and many opportunities of service, which will bring to them blessings and happiness.</span></p>

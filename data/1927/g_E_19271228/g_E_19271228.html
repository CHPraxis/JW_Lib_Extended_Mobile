<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Water — The Sine Qua Non of Life</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">r</span><span class="font6">' A' normal, weight adult human.’being there are about seven pails of water. Even the bones and the teeth contain water, and eonld not do their work without it. Every day about five pints is lost through the various organs of elimination, and this loss must be made up if the human machine is to do its work properly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Water softens tteJoKWe^Making it more easily digested and absorbed. It so dilutes the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">— Aigg</span><span class="font6">astiw</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">uj-miMAttt</span><span class="font6">- they can reach and react particle of food. The stomach is a ipusde, jtwonderful churn. It is not intended to —-rwujk-un dry lumps, nor on a pasty mass, but on food which is in a reasonable condition of liquefaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no objection to drinking water with meals provided there is no food in the mouth. The reason dieticians advise against drinking at meals is because of the tendency to wash the food down without sufficient mastication. Coffee is poison. Tea is poison. Many people like poison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no poison in.good drinking water. On the contrary, a reasonable quantity is essential to good health. For the average person eight glasses a day is about right, one of which should be taken before breakfast. Fat people require more water than thin ones. It is just as necessary to drink eight glasses a day in winter as in summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a mistake to wait until thirsty before drinking. When thirst comes the tissues are suffering, wasting from lads of moisture. People have been known to live for two months without food, but no one can get along many hours without water. It is the sine qua non of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A proper amount of water taken into th© system aids digestion and elimination and automatically regulates the body temperature. It is remarkable how quickly a drink of water reaches the skin and by evaporation cools the bo'dy. This takes place more quickly with hot water than with cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By dilution of the blood, water aids the circulation ; by dilution of the food, it aids digestion ; by dilution of waste-products it aids elimination. Every tissue of the body demands water for the performance of its functions. The Hood, the lymph, the gastric juice, the fluids of the brain and spinal eord, all need constant replenishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Common Seme Must Be Used</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font6"> ROBUST man, working at a task which causes him to perspire freely, can drink ten quarts of water in a day without injury to his system; but for most people eight glasses, which is two quarts, is sufficient. Most people drink less than half what they should.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A person with a weak digestive apparatus should avoid drinking too much water, especially cold water. Dropsical persons can overdo it. Persons inclined to colic should favor hot water, plenty of it, and avoid cold water. Persons troubled with dilation, of the stomach should drink in smaller quantities and more frequently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Chemically pure water is tasteless and is useful only in chemistry. Iced water is usable, if sipped, but should never be gulped. </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Tn</span><span class="font6"> hot weather water in any form helps to distribute the heat of the body and makes life tolerable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An insufficient quantity of water taken into the system lessens the quantity of digestive juices secreted, and breaks down the digestive apparatus. Many people suffer from headaches and indigestion who have nothing the matter with them except that they do not drink enough water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not true that water drinking makes fafc person* fatter. On the other hand a fat person who drinks enough water and exercises properly will gradually reduce his weight, and his flesh will become firmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” Boiling water should not be taken into the stomach. It is provocative of cancer of the stomach, it having been learned of late years that no part of the body can be subjected to excessive heat frequently or continuously without liability to develop cancer in the part thus misused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the Stmdpoint of Seieme</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">P</span><span class="font6">10M the standpoint of science water is a composition of two gases, combining in the proportion of two volumes of hydrogen to on® volume of oxygen, or by weight two parts of hydrogen to sixteen parts of oxygen. Water is 770 times as heavy as air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Water has its greatest density at 39.2 degrees Fahrenheit and boils or vaporizes at 212 degrees Fahrenheit The point of density is important, in that cool water sinks before it readies the freezing point, thus delaying the formation of surface ice, while ice, being lighter than cool water, floats and delays the downward progress of frost. Were ice denser than water, as is the ease with most corresponding liquids and solids, it would sink to the bottom as fast as made. Northern waters would freeze from the bottom up and would never thaw out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Water is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> constituent of nearly all minerals, even to the hardest stone, and of all vegetable and animal tissues. Absolutely pure water is also invisible, and we are aware of it only by feeling it; but absolutely pure water does not occur in nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ordinary water is impregnated with minerals. Arctic snows and alpine lakes in granite beds contain, the purest waters in nature. Lime and many other minerals make water taste and sparkle, and make it healthful to users. Water that contains over eight grains of mineral matter to the gallon is called hard water and is more conducive to health than soft water. Water that contains animal or vegetable matter is dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bain water is heavily charged with dirt and soot from the air. Most of the water that we humans drink has come, perhaps for miles, in dose contact with the earth, picking up all sorts of salts on the way, and salts that are good for us to have; for man is of the earth earthly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Water changes the ’direetfea ©2 riant lights Unless @n® is looking directly down into ths water, a fish is lower and nearer the observes than seems to be the ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Springi and Geysers</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font6">N SCIENTIFIC parlance a spring of file first’ magnitude is one which pours forth an aver® age discharge </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font6"> 100 cubic feet of water a see* ©nd. This is 65,000,000 gallons a day and is pable of supplying with water a city of &amp;&nbsp;half's million inhabitants. It is a river in itself. It is® surprise to know that there axe sixty-five such springs in the United States. &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thirty-eight of these springs issue from volcanic rock, sixteen of them in Oregon, fifteen in Idaho and seven in California. Enough water issues from eleven of these springs, located along the black lava walls of the Snake river in Idaho, to furnish all the people of the United States with all the dmKhg water they need and sixty gallons each besides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Three of the springs of first magnitude issue from sandstone rock. These are all located in Montana. The remaining twenty-four issue frow, limestone rock. Eleven of these are in Florida, seven in Missouri, four in Texas and one each is in Alabama and Arkansas. There are no springs of the first magnitude east of the Missouri river, except in these far southern states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the West is the region of big springs it is also the principal region of hot springs. In a geyser there is a long tube extending deep into the hot rocks beneath. The water next to the rock becomes heated far beyond the temperature at which water ordinarily boils, but the weight of the water above for a time prevents boiling in the lower part. At last, however, a little steam is formed, some water is shot out; and, the pressure being relieved, the water below flashes into steam instantly and shoots up, carrying the water with it. Nearly every country has some hot springs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Big Hom Hot Spring, near Thermopolis, Wyoming, is twenty-five feet in diameter and has been sounded to a depth of 1,000 feet, and n® bottom found. It pours forth every twenty-four hours about 18,000,000 gallons of 135-degree hot water containing a natural admixture of suL phur, lime, magnesia, iron and silica which has been found extremely beneficial in the treatment . of rheumatism and of Hood and skin diseasefc</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Wb </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">okmJ </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">W&amp;terh&amp;les</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">P</span><span class="font6">F THE deserts of Western Australia there are sources of water supply called waterholes, usually found in the solid rock. Some of them are the shape of a gigantic water-bottle and hold thousands of gallons of water. A few are known as night wells, dry during the day but filled with water at night This phenomenon is caused by the expansion and contraction of slabs or plates of gneiss: they expand in the day and contract at night. When they expand bow-shaped the water gets behind them; when they contract, the water is forced to the front. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every Bible student is familiar with the importance of wells to the civilization of Abraham’s tune, and wells are of no less importance in that country and in many other countries now. By selecting a suitable -site,, isolated from the drainage _of Jmrayards, house sewerage and fertilized garden®; an excellent quality of water may be obtained from u well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bfealth Service put down 500 wells in a tract of open country and made a careful study of the subject of well location. It was found that bacterial pollution made its appearance in wells as far away as 232 feet from the nearest point of infection, while chemical pollution was carried 414 feet. But as a general thing, in soil of a more or less homogeneous sandy nature, a well is considered safe from contamination if it is 100 feet from any source of such contamination, due allowance being made for the slope of the ground, which is assumed to be the same beneath as on the surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A simple test for sewage contamination is to take half a pint of water, place it in a clear, colorless glass-stoppered bottle, add a few grains of the best white lump sugar and expose the bottle freely to daylight in the window of a warm room for a week or ten days. If the water remains.clear, it may be.considered safe; but if it becomes turbid, it is contaminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The digging of Wells</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE walls of a well should made watertight to a depth of at least eight feet below the surface of the ground, in order to prevent the entrance of water from the upper strata, which are generally subject to pollution. The walls should be carried at least one foot above the surface of the ground, to prevent polluted matter from being washed into the well. Water</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">may be clear and sparkling, and yet dangerously contaminated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The best fresh-water wells are found along the edges of the ocean. Underground streams at these points are in fullest volume; and as their flow is outward they are not subject to pollution by salt water unless purposely pumped so dry that the flow is reversed, when they become rained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a fresh-water well at Longport, N. J., the water in which rises and falls with the tides and yet always remains fresh. It is believed that the weight of incoming tides on an underground stratum of clay causes the latter to bend and forces the fresh water from underground sources higher in the well, while, ebb tides, lessening the weight, reverse the result. The water in this well has a rise and fall of about sixteen feet</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In various places there are vast subterranean reservoirs in which the great rain percolations are stored and which may be tapped by artesian-wells, which thus furnish an inexhaustible supply of pure water. Artesian waters that percolate through or over granite, gneiss, serpentine, trappean, mica, slate, silicious sandstone or drift formations, are usually quite pure; limestones and chalks impart objectionable qualities; carboniferous rocks are often composed largely of mineral salts, and the water penetrating such strata is briny and unfit for domestic use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the most notable instances of large volumes of water from deep-rock wells is in the supply of the city of Indianapolis, which obtains its water from twenty-five wells drilled into the water-bearing limestone which abounds in that section of the country. Cologne, Dresden, Leipsic, Stockholm and Copenhagen obtain their water similarly. Indianapolis, Dayton and Columbus all pump their water supply directly into the distribution mains without the intervention of stand-pipes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Other Pumping Systems</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">M</span><span class="font6">ANY cities are so situated that they get their water supply from nearby lakes or rivers, and pump the waters which they use to reservoirs placed at an elevation sufficient to supply under pressure water for domestic purposes. Works typical of this system are found in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Louisville, Omaha and Kansas City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other d&amp;es have mo elections near them which Mould be suitable, and accomplish similar results through the use of stand-pipes. Such cities are Chicago, Milwaukee and Detroit</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some of the large cities which depend upon advers as their source of supply are London, (Rotterdam, Hamburg, Bremen, Berlin, Leningrad, Warsaw, Albany, Philadelphia, Washington, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Nashville, Pittsburgh and Louisville; but London gets some of its supply from wells. There are eight water companies operating in the London area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some of the large cities which depend upon lakes as their source of supply are Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, Zurich, Buffalo, Cleveland, Chicago and Milwaukee. Glasgow depends on Lock Katrine, 26 miles distant. Manchester gets its supply in Lake Thirlemere, JOO miles distant, and is taking in another little lake called Haweswater at a cost of $50,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Gravity, The Oldest of All</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE -oldest method of all is the gravity method. The aqueducts of Solomon and Hezekiah still supply the waters for Jerusalem. Of the fourteen stone or brick aqueducts which brought water from the spurs of the Appenines to Home, three still supply the modern city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even now Rome uses more water -per capita than any other city in the world, due partly to the fact that there are 430 fountains in operation in the city. The Rome consumption is 110 gallons per capita per day; New York comes second with 84j gallons. Paris uses 78 gallons, London, 35J gallons. In the ancient cities of Jerusalem, Rome, Byzantium and Alexandria, vhen Roman baths were all the' rage the consumption amounted to 300 gallons daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among the American cities that are supplied by the gravity method are New York, Boston, Baltimore, Scranton, Rochester, St. Paul, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Paris obtains part of its supply in the same manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first municipal water-supply system in ’America was that of Boston, in 1652. Of 1,475 water systems in America which were reported recently, 661 were owned and operated by private companies. There is nothing so essential to the life of a city as its water supply, and it is a Bisgrace to have this in private hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the desert of Chile there is an odd method ®t obtaining good drinking water from brackish waters which neither human beings nor stock can drink. Twenty thousand square feet of glass are arranged V-shaped over shallow pans containing the brackish water. The heat of the sun evaporates the braekish water, the glass collects it, it runs down into little channels at the bottom of the V and in this way nearly 1,000 gallons oj fresh water are collected daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New York’s Water Supply</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TN 1799 Aaron Burr installed New York’s first water supply system. The water was obtained from deep wells. Then came the Croton Dam, which was enlarged until it delivered the city 336,000,000 gallons a day. Then the Hudson river was crossed by a vast syphon 12 feet in diameter which drops 1,000 feet to get beneath the river, and the Catskill Mountains were invaded for their water treasures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hardly had the ten villages been cleared away from the site now occupied by the great Asho-kan Dam than it was evident more water would be needed than the watershed tapped could supply. A tunnel eighteen miles long was driveji to the other side of the mountains, and the Schoer-harie was made to flow in an opposite direction from what nature had intended. Now, after twenty years’ work, and an expenditure of $182,000,000, -New York has 800,000^000 gallons of pure mountain water every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But even this is not enough; and a treaty has been signed between New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania which provides that each state shall have one-third of the waters of this river; and there is no doubt that New York City expects and intends to execute another great improvement which will send Delaware river waters under the Hudson down to thirsty New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the great Delaware river project is being developed New York is planning to drink a goodly share of the forty-three inches of rainfall which visits Long Island every year. This subterranean water will be-used to help out in Brooklyn and Queens. New York uses every day eight times as much water in weight as the weight of the population itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Purification md Comma</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">rpWENTY-FIVE hundred years ago Cyras J- the Great earned boiled water with him in Ms campaigns, and Aristotle advised Alexander the Great to follow his example. The water was transported in silver vessels, on four-wheeled wagons. Some people are only learning now what these men knew centuries ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Ashokan Dam the water for New York is aerated by being forced high in the air through 1,599 nozzles. Thence it passes into the aqueduct, where it is treated with a minute quantity of chlorine gas sufficient to kffl any germs that may lurk in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot; The Water from Ashokan Dam enters New York so pure that it cannot be economically distributed. That is to say, if it were slimy it would coat the interior of the water pipes and preserve them; but it is so pure and so well aerated that water pipes have to be replaced every twelve years on account of being rusted out This is a splendid fault, if it is a fault</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Three methods are used to delay corrosion.. The deactivator renders water non-corrosive by permitting it to produce all the corrosion of which it is capable before it enters the piping system. The deaerator removes the dissolved oxygen from the water by heating and passing it through a deaerating diamber. By the third method sodium silicate is mixed with the water so as to form a thin coating on pipe walls. All these methods are faulted by engineers who seek something better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">People will not drink water which has been over-doctored, if they know it Even during the World War, when too much hypoehloride of soda was put into their water supply the French troops at the front itself refused to touch it until but-one-tenth of the quantity was used; and the latter amount, it was found, was quite sufficient for the purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The world’s greatest artificial lake is now being made by the Alabama Power Company in a remote part of Alabama. It will be known as the Cherokee Bluffs Lake, will have a shore line of 700 miles and win impound three times as much water as is needed to supply New York city. This water will be used for power purposes only.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">THE disingenuousness of the apostate clergy •*• becomes manifest in this spurious gospel, where the plain statements of the Scriptures ar® warped to subserve paganizing innovations. In brief synopsis the career of Mary in its salient incidents is given as follows : Mary was in infancy committed to priestly raising and brought up in the temple, where she was administered sustenance by an angel. On public festivals she 'danced with her feet on the temple-steps<sub>f</sub> eham-ing all hearts by her innocence and purity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But when she arrived at maidenhood’s estate, her guardians, jealous to preserve uncontanm-ated the sacred precincts, summoned all the eligible Judaean widowers to appear and bid for her hand. They came accordingly with their rods, and Joseph was designated as the celestial choice by his rod miraculously budding. So far, the legend only mildly transcends plausibility? but the obsolete point of view which dictates what follows is harder for modem matter-of-faetness to readjust itself to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Mary’s pregnancy became obvious, 'Joseph was perturbed, not, as the Scriptures indicate, because he suspected her of unfaithfulness to himself, but in apprehension test the priests would accuse him of seducing a holy virgin entrusted to his care. In this manner did the clergy invent a Jewish precedent for their own unhallowed institution of celibate nunhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Modem Oswwe® JMirt </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hmrnr&amp;m P@nmwm</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">QEVERAL prominent divines, notably the late</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Talmage, have striven to rehabilitate the popularity of the long obsolete Apocrypha. Talmage was quite enthused over the “Infancy of Jesus”, remarking, “Christ was the joyous boy of the fields. We are not permitted to think that the shadows of Calvary darkened his pathway in youth, and the Apocryphal books of the New Testament show a great deal of the early life of Christ not to be found in the Four Evangelists.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This appraisal of the Master’s character, during His minority, is about what we would expect from th© renowned Talmage who, staunch upholder of incarnation though he was, could nevertheless be so illogical as to fancy Omnipotence assuming the role of romping, irresponsible juvenility I</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Perhaps unwittingly the reverend 'doctor detracts from a reverential attitude toward the Redeemer by crediting Him with conduct unworthy of His sublime character. For instance Jesus is made to play mischievous pranks on His elders to gratify His boyish self-importance by “showing off”. His playmates fashion day images of frogs and birds, and H® commands them to hop and fly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> He disconcerts a dyer by piling all his customers’ clothes in the furnace and then gleefully astonishes him by taking them out unconsumed, each piece dyed as per order. Joseph is represented as a bungling workman who took Jesus .along, with him to pull out or push into shape the awkwardly-fariiioned milk pails, sieves, gates, etc., which he </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">had made</span><span class="font6">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus rebukes the fiarmfess joke of some women by a startling verifieattatOhe-same, turning into kids His hiding cpmpanioM, whom the women had spoken of as “kids”. He makes us© of His superhuman powers to compel rsOrpent which had bitten a child to crawl back, suck Girt the poison and explode. Being accused of pushing another child off from a roof and causing its death, H® constrains the corpse to speak out and acquit Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Th® life of Jesus was meaningful, serving in every incident as an eternal lesson to mankind.; then what place in it should there be for such paltry anecdotes as here narrated? In general the Apocryphal Jesus is made to comport himself like a Sunday school boy on the rampage, if we may be forgiven th© simile. Any affront to His youthful autolatry is promptly visited with condign punishment. A playmate breaks down His fish pool, and is sentenced to have hi® life waste away with the vanishing waters. Death is decreed to whosoever thwarts His whims and caprices, quite in character with, what w© would expect from an avatar of Talmage’s brimstone deity!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One school master is properly abashed by a display of superior enidition; another’s hand, raised in the act of chastisement, is withered. How the much-whipped mediaeval school boys must have secretly gloated over these episodes I But after nonplussing all the venerable doctors by His comprehensive knowledge of the law, He meekly abnegates His omniscience to settle down to study the Hebrew A B O’s I</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This gospel was accepted by the Nestorians, Gnostics and Zoroastrians and made use of by ■Mohammed in compiling the Koran. It is transparently the source of certain incidents in the <sub>f</sub>Krishna myth. In fact, the gospel throughout is stamped with a pagan, impress. The new-born infant, like Buddha, utters a cradle proclamation of its own divinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Magi, whose names, according to a tradition cherished in the Boman Catholic Church, were Gaspar, Melchior and Balthasar, render obeisance to His swaddling clothes, which prove non-inflammable on the altar. The Romanists extol the Star of Bethlehem, comparing it in holiness to the red star of the-sanctuary lamp before the Eucharist. -- =--- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the flight to Egypt, an oraqular idol announces thatjtt® Unknown God has come, vhereat the other idols topple over. Numerous lepers are- cleansed by the infant’s bath water (We are reminded how devout Hindus drink water which has collected in hoof-prints of the Sacred Cowl), and a balsam tree springs up from the sweat which Mary wrung out of His eoat. Judas Iscariot, possessed of a devil in youth, strikes the divine infant and thereby lays the foundation of his consummate sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Is it not surprising that an eminent molder of public opinion like Talmage should attach any serious weight to such a product of sacerdotal anilism; for what rational purpose is served by these grotesque and superfluous miracles, so dissimilar to the meaningful ones of the inspired text?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Disrepute Comparatively Recast</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font6">E SUBMISE that the reader may have become satiated with our quotations, enough excerpts having been given, we trust, to sustain our contention as to the important role played by the Apocrypha in the formulation of {Nicene orthodoxy. And let not this influence be underrated because of the obscurity and disrepute into which these books have lapsed in our times. Using a geological figure, our age represents merely the superficial “till” that overlies many thick strata of church history, during which time religious opinion was being solidified and crystallized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Though, among thousands familiar with the sacred text, very few today are acquainted even superficially with the Apocrypha, it is nevertheless true that their understanding of the text is colored by traditions handed down from their forefathers, whose own interpretation was biased by false views inculcated through the Apocrypha. Probably a majority of church peo* pie are unaware that the Apocrypha have only been definitely excluded from their Bibles sine® 1827 by a decision of the British and Foreign Bibi® Society, which was then arrived at. They, were first pronounced of no authority by the Westminster Confession of 1648, though previously they had been scornfully opposed by Puritang and Presbyterians as pertaining to the “dirty linen” of the scarlet woman; however, the Puritans Jacked the discrimination to abjure all the doctrinal errors which these works sanctified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Greek Church, as early as the Council oft Laodicoa in 360 A. D., had ruled them out of the Canon; the Latin Church, on the other hand, always highly favored them, retaining them as an appendage to the sacred text until the Council of Trent (1545-63) when the Apocryphal Old Testament was placed on an equality with the rest. The Church of England still uses them in part “for edification”, but not “for the establishment of doctrine”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There can be no question that the influence of these false scriptures in molding religious thought has been tremendous, and especially so during the long night of papal supremacy, when ’ the Bible was virtually inaccessible to the laity, whose sole religious instruction came through their pastors, many of whom themselves were illiterate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As late as WydifPs time, not only ignorant friars, but high prelates, were grossly unacquainted with the apostolic writings, though frequently compensating for this lack by being well versed in monastic lore, such as questionable chronicles of the saints and martyrs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Investigation shows &amp;&nbsp;pr@pondera.tion of these legends to be drawn from the Apocryphal books, which likewise furnished plots for papal pageants for the populace, and monkish mysteries performed as dramas. Some of these are almost verbatim representations of the stories related in these books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Similarly, many pictures of old masters, prints of German and Italian engravings of the Renaissance period, wood-cuts in block-letter illuminations of missals and monastic MSB. are unintelligible save as elucidated in the Apocrypha.</span></p>

In the main, church attendance has become with the majority a formalistic observance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Worldly people go to church as a part of their </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">= a</span><span class="font6">social duties, expecting to be recompensed for their condescension by entertainment.

Biit a feudal society presupposes stability of population. The industrial revolution dislocated populations temporarily, but merely to redistribute _ them into new industrial groupings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the rapid development of machinery perpetually unstabilized these groupings. Machinery changed the whole face of human inter-relationships. Unperceived by humanity at large, it is accomplishing the dissolution of society. It has made old home life, which was an economic unit, impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The impermanence of the home has disrupted the age-old code of ethics which was calculated to insure and safeguard home life. The rising generation has become emancipated by machinery from immemorial standards, ideals and institutions. These were a heritage from an agrarian past; but contemporary people are remote from the soil; they exist oblivious of wind and weather. The urbanite is a bottle-fed infant, nursed by concrete and steel, almost estranged from his mother, who was Adam’s also, to begirt with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That is what the social economists tell us. They speak of the new freedom and the electrical recreation, of our habits and institutions. They stigmatize our present capitalistic organization of society as a vestige of expiring feudalism. The plane of cleavage, they point out, is not between plat© armor and gunpowder or even between the hand loom and the steam-engine</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">'(these were but the first symptoms of the transformation), but between latter day machinebased industrialism and our entire historical past</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While preoccupied with his conventions and the routine of his daily affairs, the average person has been only dimly aware that through subtle and almost imperceptible changes a complete reordering has been effected of his scheme of life. He is in the habit of quoting with enthusiasm that science has &quot;remade the world”, but considers this remaking in a superficial sense; but science is the handmaid of the machine, being justified by the machine. It was not science but the great inventions that inaugurated the revolutionizing of society. These inventions were not always, nor tiadeed often, the creations of brilliant mmete^but were bestowed, here and there, somewhat haphazardly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our-age represents a new world, a world whose community &quot;fife, institutions, conventions, and cade of ethics have beeu realigned to suit the exigencies of existence for a race of machine tenders, In which category must be properly included office-worker^ and even the housewife. Today we are still in a transitionary stage, still experimenting with the new electrical equipment, reluctant to east on the dump our outworn feudal culture, which social economists, at least, recognize as parasitical and wasteful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rising generation has been bred in the machine shops or their subsidiaries. The excuse for an office building is the manufacturing plant. Besides, is not a stenographer a machine tender? The rising generation becomes increasingly intolerant of our antiquated “horse and buggy” standards. Our ancient morality appears to it ‘as prudish self-deception. It confesses to scant veneration for fossils, unless they date from the early Cambrian, but has a boundless admiration for the ephemeral present. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is unconscious of the need to be religious, believing religion to be undemonstrabl®, so it makes science its religion because it has learned out of its school textbooks that science represents mathematical certainty. To youth, electrons are tangible realities, but the Bible consists of a collection of archaic folk-lore. Youth’s church-going is purely perfunctory and its motives devoid of pious significance. It is not interested in the supernatural.</span></p>

They see the ancient landmarks disappearing, bit by bit, but it-is a comfort to them to persuade themselves that the old order prevaileth interminably, though of course greatly modified and ameliorated by machine technology, or, as they conceive it, by science. They are rather flustered and bewildered by these rapid changes, but console themselves with the reflection that it is all improvement, all-for the best. &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They dare not even chide the insubordination of youth, but dotingly imagine that the antidote is increased church attendance. They themselves cannot dispense altogether with religion, but they want their religious draughts diluted by strong infusions of scientific theories. They have acquired a taste for scientific jargon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Churchianity now finds itself in a difficult position. Its tenure of office latterly has meant a series of readjustments to conform to popular prejudices. Protestantism has been rent by a schism into two groups, Old Fogeyism and Scientific Religion. The one deifies Moloch; the other, Rama, the monkey god. Protestantism is trying to re-adapt itself to the machine age without antagonizing its old customers, the elderly. So it must perpetually compromise. It retains sectarian trappings, but makes large concessions to juvenile exuberance, toward which it affects a jovial sympathy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The church cannot compel its old patrons to compromise with their consciences; but youth, not bound to it any longer by ties of tradition and reverence, it is fain to coax back into the fold. So the church opens its portals to the new freedom, letting in divorce, sex-equality, women evangelists and what not. It would be impolite to offend the ladies and impolitic to antagonize youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A dynamic religious sentiment is not very; current in the world today; which makes it hard to visualize the intense preoccupation of our forefathers with polemics. We read uncompre-hendingly and with mental reservations of skepticism of their acrimonies and iconoclasms and ecumemeal councils.

<p><span class="font6">* V non of religions revivals. During the early centuries of Christianity, a strong current of revived religious feeling had set in, keeping even pace with the material breakdown of antique civilization. Impotent to arrest the decay of culture, the church turned the hopes of humanity to mansions in the skies. The prevailing sensuality was sublimated into ecstatimsm. Sexworship was exalted into a higher plana ofjtEuH__ religious fervor. Christian enthusiasm -stayed<sup>-</sup>the moral rot of a decadent culture^ in spite of the -perversion of- the Master’s teachings by the -clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The influence of the Man of Galilee reawakened the slumbering conscience of humanity, persisting century after century through the long night of mediaeval ignorance, the Renaissance down, the era of exploration and colonizing, the age of inventions, softening the asperities of the struggle for existence, mitigating human cruelty and rapacity, restraining tyranny, rebuking unbridled mendacity and licentiousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The dominant European type of man, the type that was imposing its own ideals on all the planet, called itself in the aggregate Christen-'dm It was nominally Christian, so in remaking the world at large into its own image, it -carried the gospel whithersoever its influence extended.

So by degrees it amended world-old abuses which were glaringly inconsistent with its Christian profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only in these latter days ar® the Christian ideals being thrown aside as no longer valid.

The improvement that has taken place is very well told in the following editorial appearing in the Toronto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Star:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Late in 1922 Sir Henry Thornton assumed</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">•ontroL In that year the deficit was $58,000,000; in 1923, $52,000,000; in 1924, 56,000,000; in 1925, $42,000,000; in 1926, only $30,000,000. In 1926 the net operating revenues of $48^)00,000 were sufficient, for the first time in history, to meet the debt charges due the public. For the first seven-months of lft87 the gross revenues showed an increase of nearly $4,000,000, but the net revenues were down $2,500,000, due to wage increase and expenditures upon maintenance. There is hope, however, of repeating tile record of 1927, with a deficit only half as large as that of 1922.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“This decrease has been accomplished in the face of increasing private and public motor ear and motor track competition. And there has been a decided betterment in service and morale as</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">well as in finances. The publicly-owned railways are today a thorough credit to Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The credit is not all Sir Henry’s. A foundation had already been laid by the previous management The country has enjoyed good crops and prosperity. But the fact is that he has accomplished what opponents of public ownership 'described as impossible. He has set the National system on its feet and, while reducing its deficit, has made it second to none in service.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">months ago to redeem their spare time on Sundays by canvassing from place to place and door to door withrtheir publications in explanation of the- conditions in the world in the light of the Bible teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They found everywhere the public glad to re-~ eeive them and talk^about the Bible. Particularly was this so in the country districts, whei'e the farmers were free for a day and glad to have ‘ some call </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">on</span><span class="font6"> them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Were the clergy glad to see the Bible Students teaching the Bible thus on what they call the Lord’s day? By no means. In place of crying “Sedition” as they did during the war because some determined to be faithful to their God and' not kill their fellow man, they cried “Law-breakers” and wrote letters to the press calling attention to a law that they caused to be passed some years ago, entitled “The Lord’s Day Alliance Act”, arid stating that the Bible Students were violating that Act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Did they cause that act to be passed in the interests of the people or for monetary gain? The following reported by one of the local papers as a news item from Ottawa will answer. The article is entitled “Kids Blow Collection on Ice Cream so Churches Assail Sunday Selling” and reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“As a result of complaints laid before last night’s meeting of the religious education council of Ottawa, steps are being taken by its executive to secure a more rigid enforcement of the Lord’s Day Affiance Act with respect to sales to children of candy, ice cream, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The reason supporting the complaints is that such sales deprive local Sunday schools of funds which would otherwise be theirs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TAe </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Plan far Canada</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">T TNDEB the caption “The French Ambition”, U </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sentinel</span><span class="font6"> has th© following to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The tenacity with which the French Canadian leaders stick to their objective of making this country French-speaking must be admired. It is a pity that British opposition to the movement is not more energetic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The movement has a broad outlook, not limited by the boundaries of the Dominion, but overflowing into the adjoining Republic. The vision of the French leaders was indicated by Henri Lemay, who, a few years ago, contributed a long article to the organ of Laval. University. In that he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“*At the rate of increase in our population there will be in a century, to judge by the century that has elapsed since the cession of the country to England, 40,000,000 Freneh-Cana-dians in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">North</span><span class="font6"> America.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Keeping that ambition in mind the sending of French nuns to the New England States to teach French in the schools is significant. A despatch from Montreal appeared in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Sentinel</span><span class="font6"> a few weeks ago stating that .a considerable group of French-teaching nuns left that city for the factory towns of the eastern states for the avowed purpose of teaching French to the children of the expatriates from Quebec. This gives the French movement an international aspect that reveals the horizon of the French visionaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It is not the desire of the Quebec leaders that the habitant should leave this country. Canada is after all the promised land they aim to possess. But when they are unable to prevent the exodus to New England, they send religious missionaries after them to encourage them to preserve their racial identity in the foreign land. If they follow their compatriots to the Republic, how much more zealous will they b® to keep control of those who remain in the Dominion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Another paragraph in Mr. Lemay’s article is worth giving as a part of his sweeping vision of Canada’s future. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“‘Let us stop for an instant to consider the future map of Canada. From Cape Breton to Lake Superior, the whole country will have become a land almost exclusively French. It will be only in the south of Ontario and certain parts of Nova Scotia that French will not be generally spoken.’ ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font6">FTOEY ecane to me from time to time, to© «*■ questioners, Hey are middte-aged, work-hardened and a little stooped ; they aw plainly dressed, wry plainly sometimes; tor when there is a family to he educated father and mother eannot go about like miffionmres. They are kindly, earnest, moderate; somewhat dfimexd about asking what they fear may seem a stupid question; but out it comes, prompted by a keen desire to do the beet they ean for a dear child. &quot;My daughter is about ready to graduate; shall I give her a business education! You ought to know. You work in an office ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>K</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hw it happens that I love such earnest pan-ents.and I can readily understand how they sum up the situation. A business education; a little more sacrifice, a little more self-denial, and daughter will be ready to do her bit. That is the great attraction about the business course, It is short and inexpensive, and this is an item when one considers that a girl’s money-earning career usually ends (either happily or unhappily, but none-the-less surely) when she says “I do”. Most girls who start a business coarse are able to finish it, and most of those who finish find work without much trouble. That is another nice thing about it Experienced stenographers and bookkeepers get married and go to housekeeping, and it keeps the market lively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The world of business possesses a universal appeal. To enter it an unusually high intelleeta-afity is not required and a common or grade school education is sufficient preliminary preparation for a business course, which course need not take longer than from six to nine months. When completed, aposition may be had that offers year-round employment with short hours, a salary paid regardless of absence due to sickness or holidays, and a vacation of from one to four weeks a year with pay. Socially, a stenographer’s position carries with it no opprobrium. In the office she is a veritable autocrat, ronridering heroelf much abused if she is required to do anything more menial, than a ligjht dusting of the office in the morning after the serub-womcn have gone through at night. Compared with the money expended for her course of preparation, a girl’s opportunities for advancement in both position and salary are large; for the good stenographer’s notebook is merely the key that gives access to a mighty world of promotion which may carry her eventually into</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">the management or presidency of some great corporation in a field that is practically unlimited; but—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About one stenographer in one hundred and fifty is worthy of toe name. Just to illustrate: I heard the manager of my firm dictate a letter in which occurred the phrase; “The man </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">wm </span><span class="font6">formerly in our employ/’ When transcribed it read: &quot;Th® man was formally in our employee” The same girl, when she could not get the word &quot;Telephone” on one line, hyphenated it as follows: &quot;Tetep-hone.” And such work is the rule, not the exception. A good worker is so rare that she is prized above rubies. Just how highly she is valued is well 'shown by toe following story;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A friend of mine wished to change her position. She was warned that wor^ was scarce and she would better stay where'' she was until conditions improved. Undeterred, she tendered her resignation to take effect in two weeks and advertised in the &quot;Positions Wanted” columns of a daily paper. She did not say how many years’ experience she had had, nor did she go into detail as to what she could do. She simply stated: &quot;Quality of work above average.” fn two days’ time she had good offers from a ma-ehinery manufacturer, brewery (Perish the thought!), a law firm, a water-meter manufae-,tarer and several others. Bid she accept any of these offers? She did not. When the man for whom she worked found out that she really intended leaving he gave her stock and made her a member of the firm to keep her. Quality work is the important thing, and quality work in any line comes easily to the person who is naturally fitted for toe work'he is doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The little girl whom you would like to send to business college—ean she spell? Is her knowledge of grammar good? Boes she know the difference between &quot;affect” and &quot;effect”, between &quot;excess” and &quot;access”, between &quot;to and too or two”? or does she only think she knows? Will she he able to improve a sentence or a paragraph badly gttmbled in dictation and do it'so well that her employer will smile gleefully at toe finished fetter and consider himself a marvelous grammarian? Ability along these lines is not so general as one might think. I have had &quot;experienced stenographers” in my office who have asked me when to capitalize wards and how to punctuate sentences! It is no wonder that</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We business man grumbles: *T don’t want a stenographer ; I want a good stenographer F</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Is your daughter's mteOeet at least moderately good ? She doe® not have to be iwpaw ly briffiant, alttomght briffimwe of course will stand her in good stead; but if you love your little daughter and want her to be happy » h» work do not train her for the offioe If she is ths practical type that prefers sewing or millinery or cooking to brain work, I mi^tet go into extended detail in explatning how to find out what she is fitted for; but this would make an article in itself. There is one general and simple test that I will mention in passing, and it is this : ’A person whose forehead is wide (not necessarily high) Is likely to find brain work of some sort enjoyable or at least bearable; one whose forehead is very narrow and low is not at all fitted for much mental effort</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Granted now that the young lady is by nature fitted for office work, let us draw aside the curtain® that hang between business college and the business world and view for a little while the scenery In that enchanted land where notebook and typewriter .are the Open Sesame to unlimited supplies of money and fame, catering to the greedy desires of eager youth. Such a view, by showing what sort of development is necessary, mpy help both parents and daughter to decide the important question that heads this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just in passing, let me state that if a girl is genuinely bright and industrious she can get a satisfactory business education in a night school while working by day, preferably in an office of course, as office girl or file clerk To go even a step further in the pathway of economy: I know a girl who started as file -clerk jn a large office,, obtained the use of an old typewriter, wrote to a typewriter manufacturer for a free hook on touch typing, made a splendid typist of herself and then took a correspondence course in shorthand which cost her twenty-two dollars cash. That was eight years ago, and today she holds &amp;&nbsp;position of responsibility with an aggressive’ firm of which she is a member, draws a good salary, is her employer’s right-hand man and anmedly corrects the mistakes of fellow employes who are high school and college graduates. Her shorthand is now the least pari of her work, which is executive mainly. All of this merely proves that if a person would reach the highest point of efficiency and usefulness in his work he must enter a field for which he is fitted, Let me say again: Do not send daughter to business college simply bemuse it offers quick and easy returns. The tomium world is choked with thousands of just such workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fmo’* </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">P^ i® the Bwinew</span><span class="font6"> Wrfd</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">W</span><span class="font6">OMAN’S place in the business world is</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">much like her place in the home. Broadly speaking, she is the shock absorber. When an Mated employer rushes her in the preparation of sales letters and speeifications, her imruflfed disposition and calm fingers on the keys must guard against mistakes. She should have confidence in the ability of the men who must necessarily take the offensive in the fight for an existence. A woman’s desk in an office can be, and often is, a haven of refuge and help for discouraged salesmen. A thoughtful girl who site quietly at her desk each day and through whose fingers passes all the eorrespondenee on a *big deal® is wuafly competent to give eaten ®d good counsel on the handling of that same tog deal; and her advice is frequently sought Good judgment and a reposeful spirit are therefore assets to the business woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tad is another quality thqt makes a woman valuable in the business world, and tactfulness is as much a part of the average woman’s character as are good judgment .and a quiet spirit. A naan likes to have the girls in his department in charge of an older woman; and I have known such older business women to be veritable Gibraltar of encouragement and help to the younger element, whq idolize and quote them at every turn, A tactful woman can very often handle an irate customer better than the Big Boss himself. (Don’t </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font6"> know I How many times have I not said: &quot;Leave him to me. I’ll calm him down”; and he calmed down quite nicely.) -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the telephone, too, a woman can do better than a man. Her voice is more likely to be pleasant. Her aptitude for detail is of help. When she gets the wrong number, strikes a busy line or chances upon a verbal entanglement with -sopie bristling porcupine (usually male) at the calling end of the line, her vocabulary is more likely to be limited to such words as are admissible in polite company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All this would seem to show that a woman’s place in business is a strictly feminine one. If she affects masculinity she defeats herself at</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the start If an employer wants masculinity, there is still plenty of legitimate masculinity to be had. If a woman is to be valuable in business she must possess the qualities that make for true womanhood,’ viz., cleanliness, orderliness, economy, gentleness, courtesy, kindness, cheerfulness, honesty, intelligence. Why should a woman try to imitate a man when there is so much he does easily that she never can do at all and ==-—when she can do so much, that it would appal a — </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">wm</span><span class="font6"> only to consider? Fifty-fifty was the ar-—zrangement when the Lord separated Eve from</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font6">dam, and fifty-fifty it is to this day wherever men. and women work together and get the best results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Importance of General Knowledge</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font6">N THIS age of extreme specialization it is doubtless wise to emphasize the need of general knowledge. General knowledge cannot be taught. It is the result of self-cultivation. It is _____ general knowledge that makes a person fit for Tmy line, any position, in the hurrying business ——world, where opportunities for advancement open .Ike whirlpools in a rushing stream and disappear as quickly. Fail a busy executive 'once, last once, 0 ambitious woman; and the are that he will not have time to try you pz; .out again. General knowledge is what a person supposed to get in high school and college;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">tat these are not the only places, nor even the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">_y</span><span class="font6">-</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">jes</span><span class="font6">t places, to obtain it. An intelligent person can</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">get much general knowledge in educational in-■ but he can get it outside of them, too, fFhe is intelligent. It conies most quickly and naturally to the avid and observing reader of good literature of any kind; to those fortunate </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">_ one</span><span class="font6">s who are blessed with intelligent and highly zrzjedueated parents and who therefore absorb knowledge from babyhood; to those brilliant, restless ones Mho analyze everything they see ami demand THE TRUTH. A business man said to me: “T would rather have a stenog-rapher who reads much than a university grad-uate. A person who reads is merely wasting time going to a university.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">—Apropos of the usefulness of general knowledge: A girl I know got a 100% mark and warm commendation for good work at her business college .one day. The lesson, printed in shorthand which was to be transcribed, was on a subject considered cleverly obscure; and perhaps it was, being about the Colorado Beetle. How many persons in an average shorthand would know that'Colorado Beetle was the name formerly given to the humble potato bug? Well, this girl did know: and while the rest of the class floundered helplessly in a lot of little pothooks which they could not possibly decipher because they could not get the connection, Miss General Knowledge triumphantly transcribed the article and won her laurels. A girl who has much general knowledge can. take and correctly transcribe any kind of dictation because she is able to grasp the thought of the dictator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course, the kind of reading one does has much to do with its usefulness. Personally, and I say this in all sincerity, I have found the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> articles very helpful in my business life. They cover many subjects briefly, thoroughly and accurately. I have dumbfounded the Big Boss many times by talking to him, for instance, about conditions in Canada, the waterworks system in New York City, the transportation problem in London, the iniquities of the Federal Reserve System, the Russian situation, all in one brief lunch hour while we rested from our arduous toil; and all this information gleaned from the good old </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">G. A.</span><span class="font6"> in the street car on the way to work. (Yes, Mr. Editor, it would make you smile to see him scratch his head and look mystified.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">How to Choose a Position</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">C</span><span class="font6">HOOSING the right kind of position is important. Do you like detail work? Enter the retail line. Do you like legal work ? Go into a lawyer’s office. Engineering? Try machinery manufacturers^. the architects or large contractors. Does the medical field attract you ’ Try a hospital office, a dentist’s or doctor’s office or a manufacturer of medical supplies. The field is unlimited; and it pays to be rather careful in choosing one’s work so that, once chosen, yon may settle down and proceed to enjoy it. Hating your job is a tragedy that should not be endured if you can possibly avoid it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Having picked the right line of work, the next consideration is the personal element. In no other line, it would seem, is there such a close personal contact as there is between a stenographer and the man or men she works with. Day in and day out there is the closest conceivable coworking, which brings with it a necessity for mutual understanding and forbearance. li there is a violent personal antipathy between a man and his stenographer their work is bound to suffer. Study your man when you apply for a position. Remember, you cannot do justice to yourself or your employer if you work with a man whom you cannot stand. With the right sort of man for your temperament you may do brilliant work; with the wrong sort, you may soon consider yourself a failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What to Avoid When Looking</span><span class="font6"> for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font6">VOID an office where the girls look harassed and driven. No one can do good mental work when he is driven at top speed all the time. Mental work is a matter of brain, not muscular exertion. Avoid an office where the window's to the street or factory court are of frosted glass or are painted white. An employer who is so stingy that he begrudges you an occasional glance out of doors is of no good. Avoid with all your might and main an employer who •says easily, when you inquire about the hours: &quot;Oh, we get here about eight or eight-thirty. We are not slave drivers; we don’t care if you are a little late in the morning; but [And here’s the rub.] we stay at night until all the work is done.&quot; Depend upon it, you will stay. For every fifteen minutes you are late in the morning he will get an hour or two hours out of you at night. Find out what the starting hour is, and get there on time or a little earlier. Find out what the closing hour is and leave on time; and don’t let any penny-pinching Shyloek of employer keep you after hours except on rare occasions of great urgency. OVERTIME WORK IS NOT NECESSARY. No business ever is so excessively important that a girl needs to be afraid to make an engagement for an evening because she probably &quot;will have to work overtime!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There! I feel better now I have that off my chest. Many times have-1 said it to the tired girls whom I have seen toiling at their desks after five o’clock because they have been taught at school to toady to an employer. The average employerwill take advantage of a girl to just exactly the extent that she will let him. Keep your upright independence, little Business Woman. And w hile we are on the subject of avoidances, let me suggest that you avoid uncertainties of any kind. Let it be definitely understood before you take a position what is starting time and what is closing time: how much time you have for lunch; what your salary is to be; how soon you can expect a raise. Then ntiefc to the hours set, work with all your might and run a, race with the Boss’plans to gel that ratio quicker than he said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Details that Help</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font6">BOUT ninety-nine office typewriters out of a hundred are shockingly dirty. </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font6"> new typewriter costs from sixty to one hundred twenty-five dollars, and it seems that a proper consideration of an employer’s investment would cause a girl to take very good care of her machine, But not so. She fails to clean or oil her machine, hacks and pounds aw’ay at it till it is out of order and then demands a better one. When you take a new position, seo that you get the right oil, then oil a very little every day if you use your machine steadily. Just a drop on the wearing parts is enough. Clean your machine every day and clean it thoroughly. Keep a proper brush for this purpose and renew it as often as necessary. You cannot expect to clean a machine with a piece of wire from which all bristles have departed. Do not permit the type to accumulate lint and ink until the open spaces in the o’s, a’s and e’s write solid. This seems like a simple warning; but oh, how many letters come into the office crying out all over the face of them that their writer did not clean her type! Shocking! Yes. Unbelievable! Yes; but it’s true, although five cents worth of gasoline and a piece of rag would correct the difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Be careful, too, of strikeovers, of untidy erasures, of carbon smudges on the original copy. Throw away a ribbon that has been permitted to wear unevenly and produces an ugly, uneven letter, dark in spots and light in spots. Do not use a ribbon that is worn until it leaves a very light impression, hard to read. Be super-careful of the little details that make a neat-looking letter, such as proper spacing of lines, proper placing of letter in the center of the sheet, proper punctuation and capitalization. Let every letter be a work of art. Keep your pencils sharp. _ Keep an extra notebook where you can grab it if the one you are using is filled while the Boss is dictating. If you have to jump up for a notebook’ while he is dictating, his disposition is sure to suffer a terrible breakdown. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Be courteous. Though every telephone call represent a scolding, though the business seems bent on going on the rocks and the Boss is ready to eat nails, though for -weeks every day is the worst day, be courteous. Keep your temper. Lots of times things turn out much better than you would think. A. pleasant “If you please” or “Thank you”, a friendly greeting, will mean a better salary for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mental Inertia</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">H ERB are some girls who come into an office with the .faculty of absorbing information as a blotter absorbs water, and there are some who repel all attempts to teach them. It is too much effort to learn. Are they not all through school, and wasn’t that troublesome enough? Why learn any more? Almost unconsciously they shed information as a well-made roof sheds water. Afental inertia is a great hindrance to advancement. It is true that teaching days are about over when you leave school. After that you have to learn without teaching. You are not advanced to a better position until you are able to handle it. When you enter an office, grab information. You can get it anywhere. Listening to telephone conversations is very illuminating; a careful reading of office correspondence and advertising matter is good, as are talks with older employes. Devote a little time to thinking about the business. Be willing to grow. Your employer will be glad to help you. As you grow, cultivate the ability to see both sides of the questions that constantly arise in every business. This will enable jou to come to correct conclusions. In a coniroversy between your firm and a customer it is well to sec the latter’s point of view as clearly as your own. In Hie age-old quarrel be-tcwmi ccq-ifnl and labor, with its cruelties and stupidities on both sides, put yourself occasion</span><span class="font5">ally in the </span><span class="font6">workman’s place and be moderate. When shipments consigned to your firm are slow </span><span class="font5">in </span><span class="font6">arriving, remember that your firm may some-tmv'« be pretty slow in filling its orders, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To develop good business sense, to be able to approximately forecast business conditions, Tndy the financial page of a good daily paper. L&lt;-arn as much as you can about stocks and bonds, study the world’s markets. Yon do not haw- to be a wizard at this; but you will find that even a slight knowledge along such lines will btf of great help to you, and a pleasure as well. I shall long remember the thrill I got when I suggested to The Big Boss a way of realizing money on some second mortgage bonds that ha had not thought of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">T ASTLY, let a girl be honest with her job. Ai sleepy girl, a sick girl, an improperly dressed girl, cannot be at her best. You owe it to your work to get plenty of sleep and to get it at home, not in the office. You owe it to your work to keep well. This means that you must eat right, avoiding too much of greasy or oversweet foods and eating plenty of raw fruits and vegetables. It means that you mud live right. Remember that your work is very hard on brain, nerves and eyes and counteract it with outdoor exercise such as walking, swimming, skating, whatever yon like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You owe it to your work to dress right. It is a maddening fact that many times I have been unable to get production in my office because the girls were not properly dressed for work. Heavy clothing on warm days and too thin clothing on cold days reduce the ability io work, and the queer part of it is that those who are uncomfortable frequently ascribe their discomfort to conditions in the office instead of putting the blame where it belongs. High-heeled shoes are the worst offenders of all. How many, many times the file case or the height of counters or the length of aisles is maligned by a nervous, irritable girl when the trouble is entirely with her shoes. No girl imeds to look dowdy in order to be comfortable. She can be clean, neat and stylish and her employer will like* her better for it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">But it is the will of the Devil that such men should he persecuted, and God permits it, that those who have the Devil’s spirit and desire to be his children and to serve him, may thus be separated from those who have the opposite spirit, the holy spirit, the spirit of God, and who are determined that nothing shall swerve them from the service of the King of kings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">November 3, 1927 Mr. C. J. Woodworth,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Editor, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My dear Brother Woodworth:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It grieves me greatly to note how maliciously Brother Rutherford is being slandered from time to time by enemies of the Troth, Very manifestly those slandering ar® not oi the Troth or they would obey the Masters words: &quot;Speak evil (whether true </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ot</span><span class="font5"> false] of no man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The latest attack brought to my attention is by one Wuttge and surely if anything was ever inspired of the Devil it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By reason of my many journeys with Brother Rutherford, and further by reason of my official position in regard to the Society in Canada I have the honor of being somewhat more intimately acquainted with him than most others and therefore think I am in a better position than many oihers to know how grossly untrue are the statements made in these attacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In recent years it lias been my privilege to accompany him on different occasions to Europe and to note how manifestly God’s blessing has rested upon his efforts to direct the activities' whereby the message of the kingdom is going to all the world as a witness. And what is true in Europe is equally true in the United States and Canada as elsewhere throughout the work! To my mind the Lord’s favor is so manifestly resting upon him that a wayfaring man though a fool should see it</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only did I see the work of the Lord in Europe prospering on every hand, but on no occasion did anyone even so much as mention to me that he had nils-conducted himself in any way. On the contrary the testimony of all was as to how wonderfully God had used him in the blessing of His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Knowing how quick people are to spread evil reports, surely if such statements as made by Wuttge were true I would have been informed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brother Rutherford’s appointment to the position of President of the Society was surely of the Lord. Should He wish to remove him it is a very simple thing for Him to do; and my admonition to those who are indined to find fault is, “Touch not the Lord’s anointed”; that is, refrain from, slandering those whom the Lord is using: honor them, at least for their work’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I admire greatly Brother Rutherford’s abounding faith in God, his love for God’s people, and his burning zeal for His cause, a zeal so great that it will not allow him to stop in fiis battle against Satan and his forces to answer the attacks the enemy is making against him,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am. writing you this letter with the thought in mind that possibly you in your position might be able to use the testimony herein to the comfort of the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Praying the Lord’s guidance and blessing upon you and with kind personal regards and much Christian love, I am by divine favor,</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Th® Nation Born</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New York, by Judge Rutherford-]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">rpB'ERK is nothing more prominently set forth X in the Bible than the kingdom of God. There has been much misconception concealing that Icingdom. It is not a kingdom to be established fa heaven. It is a government or nation to be established on earth in righteousness and which, shall take charge of the affairs of men and conduct them in righteousness for man’s benefit. It is God’s provision to give man that which he desires, to wit, life, liberty and happiness on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the history of men kingdoms are commonly spoken of as nations. The duly constituted authority that rules an organized people is called a kingdom, a nation, or a government. These terms may be used interchangeably. Government and empire mean the same thing. If there is a shade of difference it is that empire is more comprehensive. It would be proper to say that a kingdom or nation may begin on a small scale; but that when it is extended so as to embrace many peoples, and exercises absolute and supreme power and sway, it may then be properly termed an empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures refer to The Christ as &quot;a holy nation”. (1 Peter 2:9) To be born means to be brought forth or to begin to function. It is here used in a figurative or descriptive sense, and as applied to a nation it means that that nation Mas begun to exercise authority. It is a woman that gives birth. &quot;She was delivered of a man child.” (Isaiah 66:7) Zion, God’s organization which gives birth to the man child, is symbolically called a woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a government or power the right to govern Tests upon some duly constituted authority. It is written of the Messiah: &quot;The government shall be upon his shoulder.” (Isaiah 9:6) “The kingdom fgovernment] is toe Lord’s; and he is the-governor among toe nations.” (Psalm 22: 28) When Jesus was on earth He spoke of Himself as “the kingdom”, because He w<sup>?</sup>as appointed to rulership. (Matthew 10:7) The prophet, referring to the kingdom and showing that it is separate and distinct from toe individuals composing it, said: “And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.” (Daniel 7:27) The ones exercising the kingdom, as the Scriputres show, are Jesus and those whom He associates with Himself as members of His body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time of the overturning of His typical kingdom, the nation of Israel, God indicated that a definite time was fixed when he whose right it is shall come and shall rule, and at which time he will take his power and begin his reign. (Ezekiel 21:27) The one who comes with right to rule, and who in God’s time begins his reign, is the Messiah. (Genesis 49:10) It follows then that when he who has the right, to rule takes his power and begins his reign, the world, under the supervision of Satan the enemy, would end. Basing their conclusions upon numerous prophecies God had given them, the devout Jews understood and believed that with the coming of the Messiah the world would end, and that Messiah’s kingdom would function and would bless them with the blessings which they desired. The eleven disciples of Jesus who were faithful to the end believed Him to be the Messiah. Peter had expressly so stated and had received the commendation of Jesus for the statement, and doubtless the other disciples heard and believed the same thing.—Matthew 16:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These disciples believing and expecting that the world under Prince Satan would end and that then the Messiah’s kingdom would succeed to authority, they approached th&amp; Master privately and propounded to him this question: “Tell us, . . . what shall be the sign [proof] of thy coming, and of the end of the world Matthew 24: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What world was meant in this question propounded? World means mankind, organized into forms of government, under the supervision of an invisible overlord. Symbolically it is spoken of in the Scriptures as heaven and earth. (2 Peter 3:7) Heaven means the invisible part of the world, functioning, operating and directing both the invisible and the visible. Earth symbolically represents that part of the organization that is visible to human eyes. At the time the disciples propounded this question Satan was god, prince and ruler of toe world.—2 Corinthians 4: 3,4; John 14:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus plainly stated: “My kingdom is not of this world.” (J ohn 18:36) Of necessity His kingdom or nation or government could not be of the world there mentioned, for the reason that</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan was in control; and it was not God’s due time for Jesus to take control. The disciples understood that Satan’s world must end and that the Messiah’s world, at some future time, must begin; and for this reason they propounded to Jesus the question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The answer given to the question propounded by the disciples was put in prophetic phrase. The answer could not be fully understood or appreciated until the time for its fulfilment, and then the physical facts would enable those who saw and discerned them to understand the prophecy. Having come to the time for the fulfilment of the answer prophetically given by Jesus, those who are watching and comparing the physical facts with the prophecy see and understand the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus, in answering the question, first cautioned the disciples not to permit any one to deceive them. He said to them, in substance: ‘There will be wars and rumors of wars before the end comes. Do not be disturbed about these, because the end is not yet.’ Then He stated to them the first evidences or proof that the end of the evil world had been readied. He said: “For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.&quot;’ —Matthew 24: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And now let us examine the physical, facts and see how well they fit the prophetic words of Jesus. He said that the beginning of sorrows, that is to say, the death-pains of the old world, would be marked by nation rising against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. He meant of course a great war, for the reason that He was just speaking of wars. Prior to 1914 all the wars that had ever been fought were army against army and elan against clan. Never before in the history of man was there a war like the one from 1914 to 1918. Every part of the combatant nations was called into action. Men were sent to the front, and women also; while the men and women who remained at home were obligated, under command of their government, to supply the sinews of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Everything of the nation was commandeered for war purposes. Even the babes had to perform their part in the conflict, because their food was officially curtailed in order that there might be a conservation of food for the armies at the front The quantities of flour, meal, sugar and other necessities were rationed to the people at home, to the end that the war might be won. It was nation against nation, kingdom ag</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ains</span><span class="font6">t kingdom, involving practically all the nations of Christendom, and there was never another war like it. Then followed great famines in Russia, in Austria, in Germany and in various parts of the Orient. More people by far died from famine than were killed in the war. Quickly cams a pestilence known as the “Spanish flu”; and as this moved from the fjozen to the torrid zones it swept before it the people in great multitudes. More people died from this pestilence in one year than were killed in battle during the four years of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Call to mind also that since 1914 there have been more disastrous earthquakes than in any other time of the world's history. These are physical facts which any man except a preacher can understand. The clergy have literally dosed their eyes to all this array of evidence. The Lord made it so plain that “wayfaring men, though fools”, can understand. But some of them will not understand.—Psalm 82:5; Daniel 12:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On November 11,1918, with the signing of the armistice, the war suddenly came to an end. No one could give a good reason why it there ended, because no side had won a victory. The real reason w<sup>r</sup>hy the fighting there ceased is clearly indicated by the Scriptures. The Lord desired that the World War, tire famine, the pestilence, the earthquake, persecution of Christians, etc., should serve as a testimony to those who should come to know’ that Christ is present, that His kingdom is at hand, and that the old world had reached its end. But this testimony could not be freely declared unto the nations and peoples while the war rvas in progress and while many of the Lord’s witnesses were languishing in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord caused the war to come suddenly to an end in order that His declaration contained in Matthew 24:14 might be fulfilled, to wit: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.” Beginning in 1918 and up to this time (1927) this little company ofi Christians have proclaimed the good news ofi the presence of the Lord, of the end of the world, and of the beginning of Messiah’s kingdom, in all the nations where the name of Christ is named; and without doubt this wit raws has been given in fulfilment of the prophetic words of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Master, as</span><span class="font6"> another proof of the time in which man is now on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other further testimony was given by Jesus, corroborating what He had previously said and further showing that the world has ended and that His kingdom has come. “‘And Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.” (Luke 21: 24) 'Jerusalem here undoubtedly refers to the Jewish people, because the text distinguishes them from the Gentiles. For nearly two thousand years the desire of the Jews has been that they might return to Palestine. It was about the time of the end of the war that the British Empire, having then assumed a protectorate over ilm land of Palestine, spoke through her representative, Mr. Balfour, and decla vd it to be the purpose and policy of the British Empire that the Jews should return to their homeland and there establEh themselves. It is true that there had been previous preparations towaid this end, but lids was the first lime that any authoritative action had been taken to reestablish the Jews in their homeland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Accordingly, in the spring of 1918, Dr. Chaim ‘Weizmann, at the head of a Jewish organization, opened offices at Jerusalem and began the formation of a Jewish polity. Since then there has been a gradual and healthy increase of the population of Jews in Palestine; and dearly in fulfilment of prophecv they have acquired title to lauds, have budded houses, colonies, factories, installed irrigation plants, dedicated their great university in the city of Jerusalem, and have done many other things looking to a rebuilding of Palestine for the Jews and by the Jews. Thi&lt; is so clear that no one can doubt that it is in fulfilment of the prophecies of Jesus and of the other holy prophets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fenthmmm-e Jesus said concerning the end of the world: “And there shali he signs in the sail, and in the moon, and in the stars: and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; -the sea and the waves roaring; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall he shaken.” (Luke 21 : 25, 2(<sup>:</sup>) Sun is a symbol of fhe light of the divine plan. The moon is a symbolic expression used to represent the divine law; whereas stars symbolically represent ecclesiastical leaders. Since 1918 the clergy in the various denominations have practically repudiated God’s plan for the establishment of His kingdom. They have repudiated and refused to walk according to the di* vine law; therefore these, symbolically represented as stars, have fallen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although several years have elapsed since ths World War ceased, yet it is fully appreciated by all the people that “upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity” continues. Nations, in this scripture, clearly refer to the organized governments of the earth; and all these governments are now in perplexity and distress, not knowing what to do. They are in fear and trepidation of losing their power. Continuing, the Lord said: “The sea and the waves roaring| men's hear Is failing them for fear, and for looking aftei those things which are coining on tho earth.” Jjuke 21:25,26) The “sea” represents the restless element of humanity; and these are dashing against each other and against the governments, and are roaring. The common people even fear for vhat things they see coming upon the earth. All these things further testify that the world reached its end and began to pass away in 1914; and that there, in the time of tha Lord’s presence, the birth of The Nation occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Prophet Daniel described the kingdoms of this world, or world powers, from the time of Nebuchadnezzar to the time of the end. He then stated, in substance, that while these world powers or kingdoms arc still in existence the kingdom of God shall be set up. “Aud in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.” (Daniel 2:44) This kingdom of God is described in prophetic phrase as “the stone cut out without hands&quot;, which exorcises its power against all other world powers. (Daniel 2:34,35) This stone is the new nation born. The Scriptures therefore definitely show that at the end of Satan’s world, when the nations and kingdoms would begin to war, the Lord would be present and that the new and righteous kingdom of God 'would then be born.,</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">KITOVA II God is the Father or Life-giver of the empire or kingdom, because He begets and gives life to each one of those who are to make up the reigning house. Zion “the city ofl</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God” Is His organization, which is also described <sub>|</sub><sup>&lt;</sup>under the name of Jerusalem, and is the mother of the new government as well as of the individuals who make up the government. It is writ-!ten: “But Jerusalem which is above is free, ‘which is the mother of us all.”—Galatians 4:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prophet of God, in figurative phrase, de-, scribes the Messianic government, nation or 'kingdom as a man child born from Zion, figuratively represented by a woman; and says that this birth takes place before her labor-pains; or, otherwise stated, without labor-pains she brought forth. “Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child. Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.” --Isaiah 66: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The kingdom or nation was not born with a great blare of trumpets and the rolling of drums and the'firing of cannon. Jesus had said: “The kingdom of God cometh not with observation.” (Luke 17:20) “The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night.” (2 Peter 3:10) Zion gives birth to the kingdom or nation quietly, unostentatiously and without pain. The government in America, the United States, was bora in tribulation or great pain, because those who composed the governing factors were put to much trouble and distress in the bringing forth of this nation. But the government of Messiah, the kingdom, the new nation, was bora without pain. When the due time came God set His beloved Son upon His holy throne.-—Psalm 2: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then the prophet propounded the question: *‘Who hath heard such a thing?. . . Shall a nation be born at once ?” The man child represents the nation or government that is born. At the time of the birth of the government, who was Governor? The Lord Jesus Christ, in whom resides all power and authority in heaven and in earth. Those saints who had died prior to the birth of the nation had not participated in th© chief resurrection (1 Thessalonians 4:16) and were not then a part of the kingdom; and surely the faithful followers of Christ then on the earth in the flesh, could not be classed as a part of the man child or kingdom, until the Lord came to His temple and examined them and approved them. Therefore, “as soon as Zion travailed she brought forth her children” She brought forth</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">her other children, those who were granted the privilege of becoming a part of the kingdom or nation or government. Zion gave birth both to the government and to those creatures who form that government. Christ Jesus is the Head of the new creation, and He is the Head over the . church which is llis body.-—Colossians 1:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ Jesus the divine was born three days after His crucifixion. The other members of His body are horn when they participate in the first resurrection. (Revelation 20:6) The natural order of birth of a child is first the head, and . afterwards the body. Even so with those -who make up the body of Christ and who are th© ones participating in the holy government or nation. The government or nation was born when the Lord Jesus took llis power and began His reign; and since that time other children o£ Zion are being born into the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We must make a distinction between the government and those individual members who go to make up the government or nation. The year 1914 A. D. is definitely fixed by the Scriptures as the time for the birth of the nation. In that year the nations forming the Devil’s empire became angry and engaged in a World War. The Revelator fixes that date as the time when God Almighty, through His beloved Son, would take His power and reign; or otherwise stated, the time for the birth of the nation or government. —Revelation 11:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A symbolic description of the birth of the na? tion is given in Revelation, twelfth chapter. The woman there mentioned clearly is Zion, the same woman mentioned in Isaiah 66:7. The sun is a symbol of the light of ‘the divine plan, while the moon represents God’s law. Around Zion, God’s organization as symbolized by the woman, shines the light of the divine plan; and thus she is en-vetoped with the sun. “The moon under her feet” symbolically represents that the course o| action of the woman, Zion, is always in harmony with the divine will as represented by God’s law. Th® Head, the Chief Corner Stone of Zion, is Christ Jesus; and upon that Head is the crown, representing complete and absolute authority.-The twelve stars in the crown correspond to the twelve apostles of the Lamb.—Rev. 21:14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the earth are some of the faithful followers of the Lord Jesus Christ These have had a mental vision of His kingdom; they were anticipating that it would be born in 1914 and were in great expectation and anxiety until the birth.</span></p>

This is in harmony 'desiring the delivery of the man child, which is- with Peter’s words: “The heavens shall pass - - - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~ away with a great noise, . . . the heavens bei</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">the kingdom. The man child, to wit, the new government or nation, was ordained by the Lord 'i from the foundation of the world; but now it was about to begin to function, and those who were waiting and praying for its birth were in anxious expectancy for the birth. Thus the matter appeared to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her ehiId was caught up unto God, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font6"> his throne.” (Revelation 12:5) The man child here is the same man child mentioned by the Prophet Isaiah; to wit, the nation or government which is to rule all the nations of the earth. It is the same kingdom described by Daniel, in chapter t.vo, verse forty-four. This man child or fiW government is symbolically represented as being caught up to God to His throne, because it constitutes God’s kingdom, now beginning to function by virtue of His will and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">War </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">with the Enemy</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font6">ATCHING the preparation of the empire and observing that the day was approaching for the birth of the nation, symbolically represented by the man child, Satan the enemy was on the alert, with the avowed purpose of destroying this new nation or government if possible. In the Revelation picture, he appears under the name and title of Dragon. He is there represented as a “red dragon”. The word “red” here used means fiery red, and particularly pictures Satan’s devilish, wicked and gory organisation, murderously bent upon the destruction of the new government. In this the Dragon was thwarted, because God prevented him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new’ government or nation thexe began to function; and the first 'work thereof necessarily was the expelling of Satan, from heaven. “And there was war in heaven: Michael </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font6"> his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were east out with him.”-—Rev. 12: 7-9, In this great fight Michael, who is Christ Jesus, together with His angels, fought against the Devil and his angels; and the result was that Satan the enemy was expelled from heaven and</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">ing on fire shall be dissolved.” (2 Peter 3:10, 12) The heavens here mentioned clearly mean the Devil and his angels, the invisible rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan the Devil now finds himself, together with his evil associates, expelled from heaven . and cast out into the earth. “Woe to the inhabited of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” (.Revelation 12:12) The inhabited hero mentioned clearly mean the ruling factors of the nations of the earth. They are in for much trouble. The sea represents the restless elements of human society, and they are in much trouble. The Devil has great wrath against Zion and against her children, and will gather together the inhabiters and the mass of mankind in a great and final trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Devil and all his wicked assistants are concentrating their powers and forces in the earth, implanting in the minds of the rulers, as well as in the minds of the people, devilish, wicked thoughts. The profiteers selfishly reach out for themselves, against the common interests of mankind. The politicians selfishly seek their own purposes; the preachers look after their own selfish interest; and the people are oppressed on every side and afflicted. The cause of all this distress and suffering is that the Devil’s empire has come to its end; he knows that his time is short and he is therefore desperately seeking to rally his forces for a great and final conflict. The peoples of earth are in great fear and trepidation, groaning in pain and desiring to be delivered; they are waiting “for the manifestation of the sons of God”, meaning that they are waiting for the manifestation in their behalf of the powers of the new government. They wait, they know </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">not for what; but they all</span><span class="font6"> desire deliverance. Let the people now take courage and have hope, because the time of deliverance is at hand.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Corroborative Proof</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font6">HEN Jesus arose from the dead He declared that all power in heaven and earth was given unto Him. (Matt. 28:18) That was more than eighteen hundred years ago. It was not the will of God that He should at that time begin to exercise His supreme power. Jehovah God <sup>4</sup>hen eaid to Him: “Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” (Psalm 110: 1; Hebrews 1:13; Acts 2:34,35; Matthew 22: 44) After Jesus had appeared in heaven and there presented His sacrifice as a sin-offering, He remained inactive against the Devil’s institution until God’s due time. “But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.”—Hebrews 10:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time mast come when God would subdue the enemy, Satan the Devil, and his institution. We read: “The Lord [Jehovah] shall send the rod [sceptre of authority and power rightfully reposed in His beloved Son] of thy strength out of Zion [God’s organization, saying,] rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.”(Psalm 110:2) This is the same time mentioned by the prophet: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.”— Psalm 2: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new government is now born. Jesus Christ, the King, now stands up and assumes His power and authority and begins Hus reign, even while the enemy still exercises power; but the enemy’s right to that power has expired, his world having ended. Necessarily this would mark the beginning of the battle in heaven; the King of glory and His angels on one side, and Satan the old Dragon, the disloyal son of God, and his angels, on the other side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is really the fight of God Almighty against the Devil. The fight on God’s side is led by His beloved Son, and in this fight He subdues the enemy. The Psalmist thus describes the Lord Jesus Christ moving into action: “Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, 0 most Mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.”—Psalm 45:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This marks the time of the birth of the nation or government. God’s prophet puts it thus: “In the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning [the woman, Zion]: thou hast the dew of thy youth.” (Psalm 110:3) The new nation, the government, pictured by the man child now born, is in the vigor of youth and strength and HOW goes forth to rule; it is the beginning of God’s kingdom in action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy of Christendom, or organized Christianity so-called, have rejected God’s kingdom. They now reject the Bible as His inspired Word. They reject Christ as man’s Redeemer and as earth’s rightful King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Psalmist, the prophet of God, referred to this same time and event, to wit, the birth of the nation and the rejection of the Chief Corner Stone by the pretended builders, when he wrote: “The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. This is the Lord’s • doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.”—Psalm 118: 22-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy, instead of heeding the truth and proclaiming it to the people, and advising them that the time had come for the reign of Christ, repudiated Christ and His kingdom, rejected Him v.ho is the chief corner stone of Zion and openly and boldly supported and advocated the Devil’s substitute for Christ’s kingdom, to wit, the League of Nations, and proclaimed that League of Nations as the political manifestation of God’s kingdom on earth. Otherwise stated, they ignore God’s plan and manner of establishing His kingdom and willingly ally themselves with the Devil, supporting his “image of the beast”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Jewish clergy in their time rejected Christ, the Chief Corner Stone. Now the clergy of modern times do the same thing. They, together with the principal of their flock, being disobedient to the Word of God, stumble and fall upon the stone or new government now born. Mark how well the prophetic words of Peter fit the present situation: “Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient; whereunto also they were appointed.” (1 Peter 2:7,8; Psalm 118:22; Isaiah 8:14) Thus the kingdom of God waS taken away from those who pretended to represent the Lord, and the words of Jesus were fulfilled. (Matthew 21:42-44) Those who rejected it fell upon the stone and were broken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The nation of righteousness is born. Gods kingdom has begun to function. The Lord is in His holy temple. Let all the nations and peoples of earth take note! (Psalm 11:4-7; Habakkuk 2:20) “The Lord hath a controversy with the nations” who have given themselves over to the Devil. (Jeremiah 25:31) “The great and terrible day of the Lord” approaches.-—Joel 2:31.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Why Did Jesus Die?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">[Bros,denfrom Station WBBR, New York, by F. W. Franz.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">G</span><span class="font6">OOD evening, boys and girls! It is a pleasure to greet you again. Tonight, if I re-Viember aright, is the night I promised to talk to you about “Why did Jesus die?” Most of you, I'm sure, have seen pictures showing Jesus stripped of all His clothing except a loin cloth an I nailed to a tall wooden cross.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It rather makes you sad -when you look at that picture, doesn’t it? Really it was the saddest time there ever was or ever will be in heaven and earth, when Jesus died. Of course, people had bemi suffering and dying for over four thousand years before Jesus died, and that was enough to make the beings up in heaven who Avere looking on sad; but if God was'ever sad He never was sadder than when Jesus died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God, whose name is Jehovah, knew why Jesus was dying; and He also knew the good that was going to come from Jesus’ death; but still, when Jesus was actually hanging to the cross by nails hammered through His hands and His feet and was feeling so much pain, and wicked people and ' priests and preachers were passing around the cross and mocking and making shame of Jesus, that surely was enough to touch God’s heart with sorrow. Every proper father loves his boy, and God’s heart is bigger and more loving and tender than all the hearts of all the fathers who have ever lived on this earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God and Jesus Once Alone</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ESUS loved God His Father above anyone else, and Jesus said: “The Father loveth the</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Son.” (John 5:20) Jesus and His Father in heaven had been a very long time together. The tune once was that God the Father and Jesus His Son were the only two Beings alive anywhere. The seraphs and the cherubs and the angels had not yet been made, neither had our sun and moon and the stars been made; and of course no people were living on our earth at that time, because the earth on which we now live was not made for a long time afterward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why God and Jesus, God’s Son, were once alone with each other was because Jesus was the first being or person that God created. That is why the Bible, God’s Book, says that Jesus was &quot;the beginning of the creation of God” and also “the first born of every creature”. (Revelation 3:14; Colossians 1:15) You see, it says that Jesus was a “creature”, which means that He was a created being or person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He was not like God, who always was and who therefore never had a beginning. 'But Jesus had a beginning; for the time came that God, who had been all alone, created and made Jesus. At that time God called His name Logos, which means Word or Speaker for God. That is why in the book of John’s Gospel the Bible says (1:1): “In the beginning w’as the Word, and the Word was with the God, and the Word was a god.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When it says: “In the beginning was the Word,” it could not mean God the Creator, because God never had a beginning. But God’s work of creation or making persons and things did have a beginning, and in the very beginning of God’s making persons He created this heavenly person whom He named Logos or Word. From then on “the Word was with the God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Logos, or The Word, 'was God’s Son and naturally He was made in God’s image and was a spirit person just as God is. That is why it says (Philippians 2:6) that Logos, or The Word, was “in the form of God”, and that is why it also says that Logos or “The Word was a god”. He was not God His Father, any more than one of you boys could bo your own father and yourself at the same time; but Jesus, whose name up in heaven was Logos, always spoke of himseli as being “the Son of God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Master Workman</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">OGOS or Jesus was God’s first Son, and on this account He is called God's ''firstborn”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">God alone, and without anybody else’s help, made Jesus, and that helps us to understand why Jesus is called “the only begotten Son of God”. He is also called “The First and The Last”, because Ue is the first Son that God made by Himself and He is the last Son that God made by Himself; for after that God used Jesus as a fellow worker to make all God’s other sons and all other things that have been made. The Bible says (John 1: 3) that “all things were made by him.; and without him was not anything made that was made”. For this reason Jesus was </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">dif</span><span class="font6">ferent from all other sons and children of God in heaven or on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus always did the work just as God wanted</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark28"></a>w &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the QOLDEN AQE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>BBOO,!ira</sup>'<sup>x</sup></span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">it done; this pleased God His Father. Jesus said ■: *&gt;I do always those things that please him.” (John 8:29) No wonder God loved Jesus best of all. No wonder He was sad when Jesus died, so that He kept the sun from shining while Jesus was dying and He sent, a great earthquake which shook the city of Jerusalem and frightened all the people there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But why did Jesus die? Well, first of all, because God’s will was for Jesus to die as a man. Maybe you are surprised that it was God’s will for Jesus to die; but do not be amazed any longer, because God was not doing wrong in letting Jesus die, but He meant good for you and me and all human beings by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">How Could Logos Get Back to Heaven?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">O</span><span class="font6"> BE born as the little baby in the stable at Bethlehem Jesus had to come down from heaven, leaving His Father and all the angels up there; and if Jesus had kept on living as a man and had never let wicked men put Him to death. He would never have been able to go back to 11 i s Father in heaven and live with Him again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He wouldn’t 1 you say. No; and the reason is this: God is a spirit, and ail who live up in heaven are spirits. They do not have bones, and flesh, and blood, and skin, as you and I have; and that is what Jesus was made of when He was down here on this earth as a man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Speaking about the time when He was born as a baby, the Bible (John 1:14) says: “And [Logos] the Word was made flesh.” He was made a human being of flesh just the same as you are, only He did not have any sins or anything wrong about Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">People having flesh and bones and blood cannot live in heaven, and nobody who will ever go to heaven can take his body with its flesh and blood with him to heaven. He must leave that behind for ever. Did you ever think of that before? At any rate, the Bible says, in 1 Corinthians 15:50, that “flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God”. When Jesus died He stopped living as a man or human being for always and ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How then could He become alive again? you ask. Why, as a spirit being, of course. The 'Apostle Peter says Jesus was “put to death in the flesh, and made alive in the spirit”; and the Apostle Paul speaks of Jesus as lie now is, and says: “Now the Lord is that spirit.”—1 Peter 3:18; 2 Corinthians 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was not a man or human being before He was born as Mary’s baby boy; neither was He a man anymore after He died on the cross and was raised up from the dead on the third tlay afterward. That is why His disciples or learners rauld not see Him after He was raised up from fife dead, except when Jesus showed Himself to them by putting on a human body for a little while just as you would put on a suit of clothes or a dress. Forty days after Tie was raised from the dead Jesus went back to heaven, and nobody who stays living here as a human being will ever see Jesus again. A few hours before Jesus div-d He said: “Yet a little while, and the world seem, me no more.” —John 14:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What is Death?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font6">ESUS did not die just to be able to go bm-k to heaven. Why then did He give up His 1 , e, as a man? Because Adam, tlierirst man who i God put on this earth, vas dead, and because r 11 of us who come from Adam as his children </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">r -</span><span class="font6">dying. God does not enjoy it to have people d *. God tells us so Himself. He says (Ezekiel D : 32) : “I have no pleasure in the death of him +1 t dieth, saith the Lord God: therefore turn jo selves, and live ye.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God does not like it for Jidam to stay J&gt;u !, nor for your dead grandfathers and grandmo ers to stay dead, nor tor jou and me to die a I stay dead for er er. He vould rather have them and us all live and come back to Him and he happy in Him for all time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ymu know vhat to die means, don’t you? It means to stop living, to stop breathing, to s' ') talking, to stop eating and drinking, to s ■ J smelling flowers and sweet perfnmes, to s’ m seeing your fathers and mothers and y. ■ r friends and the wonderful tbinws all about r u in sky and water and earth, to Hop feeling th <sup>v </sup>good things, and to stop hearing everything, such as your mother's loving voice, the pre' y song of the birds, or the beautiful music of instruments ; it means for your heart to stop beating for good, and your mind to stop thinking. The Bible says that dead people do not, do anything or know anything that is going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course God wanted Jesus to die as a man, because He wanted Jesus to take Adam’s place and the place of everyone who was dead and buried or who was dying as you and I are. But God did not want Adam and Eve to die at the time He made them. He told them that to d® Wrong would be punished by death, and He told ■JAdam that he should do right in order that h® jtnight never have, to die but might live in his paradise on this earth for ever and that he might rai.se a big family of children who were not sickly and dying but who were perfectly well and who might do perfectly right and live with Adam on this earth in happiness always.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After Adam and his wife Eve had done wrong, God told them He must punish them by letting them, die outside of the garden of Eden, He did not mean that Adam, and Eve would have to Stop living as a man and woman on this earth and would have to go to some unseen place to live and suffer; because then in that case they v otod not be dying or stopping to live, but would merely be moving off the top of the earth to live in some other place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If Adam and Eve had simply moved off to some other place to live, then it would not have b &gt;en at all necessary for Jesus to come down from heaven and die as a man in order that Adam and Eve and all their children might live again on this earth. God meant that Adam was to stop living altogether; and that, unless something was done to help him, he and everyone of us Avould stay dead for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If Jesus Had not Died</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font6">O YOU see that, if it had not been for Jesus’ dying and taking our place, Adam and Eve mid all the dead could never be raised to life again; and all. of us who are alive today would have to get sicker and weaker and older until at last we should die and he buried, and there would be no hopes of our ever living again, and seeing our fathers and mothers and loved ones once more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So you see it was a case of either Jesus’ dying and stopping being a man for ever or our dying and never being raised to life again. Jesus knew that He had come down to earth to take the place of us who are sinning and dying; so He said; &quot;The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.” “I am come that they might have life, and that they xnight have it more abundantly.”— Matthew 20:28; John 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God could have let Adam, and Eve and all of us, His sinful children, die off and stay dead, and He could have made a new man and a new woman out of the dust of the ground and that । way God could have started raising a new family of human beings on this earth. But God loved Adam and Eve and all of us, even though we are now sinners and do wrong and deserve to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was more to God’s liking to save us all from death and the grave and to start us out right again on this earth that we might come back into good standing with Him and be made perfectly well and 'whole and able to do His will and might receive the gift of everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And that is why God sent Jesus to earth to di® as a man for all of us. And that is why He has now sent Jesus unseen to be King over all the people, to set up His kingdom, to chain the Devil and stop all his w’icked doing, to raise the dead to life again, and to bring whosoever wills and tries back to God and to perfect life again. Should we not be thankful to God that Jesus died?</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">After King Solomon received his first anointing, David called all the people of Israel together and explained to them his greatest ambition which was that a temple should he built in Jerusalem as a permanent- dwelling place for Jehovah, taking the place of the tabernacle constructed by Moses in the vdlderness long years before. At the same time he gave the children of Israel the opportunity of voluntarily contributing money, gold, silver and precious stones for use in this wonderful temple. And the people gladly gave all they could. It had been David’s ambition to build this house himself and to dedicate it to the Lord; but because he had been a warrior and had slain so many people the Lord would not permit him to build Him a house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Afrer David had explained to Solomon and the people of Israel the plans which they should follow, he prayed to God in the presence of all the people, asking His continued blessings upon them. The people then acknowledged Solomon as their new king and offered sacrifices to the Lord. They concluded their meeting with a great feast and within a few months thereafter David died, “full of days, riches and honor; and Solomon reigned in his stead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first thing Solomon did after becoming the legal king of Israel was to go up to the tabernacle and there offer a thousand burnt offerings to Jehovah. That- night the Lord appeared to Solomon and asked what great blessing he most desired. After recounting the blessings the Lord had given to his father David, Solomon replied: “Thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people.” T</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">his</span><span class="font6"> re« quest pleased Jehovah because it was not a self J ish request for riches, wealth and honor, nor for a long life. The Lord told Solomon that because it was in his heart to ask for wisdom and knowledge that he might properly judge the Lord’s people, his request would be granted. In addition God said, “I will give thee riches, and wealth and honor such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Solomon returned to Jerusalem, it took him about three years to get all arrangements made and his forces organized for beginning the construction of the temple which was to become the Lord’s house. The inside walls of this wonderful building were overlaid with gold; and for trimmings, precious stones of every color and hue were set in a most artistic maimer. It is doubtful indeed if there has ever been another temple or building so richly furnished as was Solomon’s temple. After seven years of continuous work the time finally came when the Lord’s house was completed and Solomon called all the elders and heads of the tribes up to Jerusalem to bring into the new temple the ark of the covenant which was constructed by Moses at Mt. Sinai about. 486 years before. When the ark of the covenant was placed in position, the house was filled with a cloud, and the glory of the Lord appeared and filled the temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Solomon was busy building the temple and other buildings, yet his time was given to other matters also. Among these was that of judging between the differences of the people in a manner somewhat similar to the judges in the courts of our day. Even kings and queens and rulers of others countries heard of the wisdom of Solomon and came to visit him and to hear his wisdom. The time finally came when Solomon was the richest man in all the w’orld, not alone in wisdom and knowledge, but in worldly possessions of gold, silver, horses, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Solomon’s reign lasted forty years and during all that time not a single battle was fought by the Israelites, for he was a king of peace. His reign and the temple which he built were pictures of the great kingdom of the Prince of Peace which is yet to be established on this earth.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Little Studies for Little People</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">(Study Thirty)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">246. Our heavenly Father wants each of us to study for ourselves and find the great beauty of his plan as it is concealed in His picture book, and then, when this marvelous plan has unrolled before us, to help others who are seeking it and show them what we have learned. In this way the Lord wants us to meet together.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">247. It does not matter if we hold a Bible study in the barn, in a field, or in our own homes. “Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I,” saith the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">248. The Lord’s blessing is on all who truly love Him and who gather together in any place for the purpose of studying His Word and expressing their thanks and praise to Him for it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">24®. Now all such groups of Bible students may be properly called churches, but out of each of these the ones who really love the Lord the most are selected by God for a very special purpose. They form the church, the real church, the church of Christ, and are those who by reason of their love for Him and obedience to Him ■will be given the very great favor of sharing His power and glory. This of course means they will share His nature, too.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">250. We have learned that Jesus has the divine nature, which makes Him a spirit being, so that we cannot see Him, although we know He is here, selecting His church and setting up His kingdom in the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">251. So therefore those whom He selects for members of His church will be given the same nature, and will become as He is. How this will be done, we shall see in the Lord’s due time, when &quot;all the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee: they shall sing unto thy name”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the World Christian?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">252. First we must find out the meaning of this word &quot;Christian”. We discover that a Christian is a believer in Christ, a follower in His footsteps, and one who practises the teachings of Christ to the best of his ability.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">253. So a Christian i.s always eager to serve the Lord’s cause, and is generally quiet, humble, and kind, although firm and stedfast in his views about God and the plan, and cannot be made afraid nor forced to forsake those views at all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">254. Most of the people whom we meet &quot;will tell us that they are Christians. Yet if there should be a war, they would forget the Lord anti His cause, and would get busy to help along whichever side they happened to be on, with' money, and guns, and maybe by doing some of the fighting themselves. But Christ is called the “Prince of Peace”. So of course these people could not be Christians.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">255. Also, it often happens that we hear people claiming to be Christians, wjio neglect the Lord’s cause and quarrel and fight with each other, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">tell lies and</span><span class="font6"> wicked </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">things</span><span class="font6"> about each other. But Christ said, “Love one another.” So of course these people could not be Christians, either.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">256. So we see that although there are many people who say they are followers of Jesus, still it happens that most of them do not follow in the ways of the Master at all, but make believe to do His will when really they are doing their own wills or Satan’s will.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Questions on Study Thirty.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">216. Does the heavenly Father ■wish His people to each of them personally study His Word? Does He wish them to help show it to others?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">247. Would it be all right for the Lord’s people to meet in a bam if there were no better place? Would it be all right to meet in a field?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">248. If a company of those who truly love the Lord meet together to study His Word and to praise and adore Him, does the place make any difference ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">249. What is it that makes the church, the building </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">or </span><span class="font5">the people ? What kind of people go to make up the true church? What will be their reward?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">250. What kind of nature does Jesus now have? Can we see Him with the natural eye? Could He be here with us now in this room unseen?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">251. What kind of nature will the true church have in the resurrection? Would it be possible, for some of them to be now present here and yet unseen ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">252. What is the meaning of the word Christian? Give as many meanings as you can. Must a true Christian </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">be</span><span class="font5"> all four o.f these ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">253. Is a true Christian always eager to serve the Lord? Is he usually quiet, humble and kind? Is he firm in his views about God and His plan?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">254. Do most people about here think they are Christians? In case of war are these people ready to help kill somebody? Are they true Christians?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">255. Are most of these people even willing to forget the Lord’s cause and to fight among themselves?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">256. Do most people who claim to be Christians really follow in the ways of the Master at all? &quot;Whose will do they follow instead?</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New Yor H's Theatre Excitement</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">EW YORK is stirred because the stage is now so bad that, according to reports, a new code which, holds nothing sacred is being taught the younger generation. The clergy are having much to say on the subject, as they do on every subject. Not having any regular employment except collecting money they have time and strength to give to other people’s business, which is beyond the power of most of us. There 'does not seem to be any law requiring the clergy to attend the theatres so that they can find out how bad they are, nor any law requiring them to tell what they think on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Heaviest Stake</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">'American</span><span class="font4"> reminds us that</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lord Acton wrote of legislation that “laws should be adapted to those who have the heaviest stake in the community”, and then defined the latter class as those “for whom misgovernment means not mortified pride and stinted luxury, but want and pain and degradation, and risk to their own lives and their children’s souls”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Plenty of Room for All</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">HELE STUDENTS always contend that the earth can be made to support all the people that have ever been born in it, and that this will actually he done when the resurrection occurs. This is pretty well backed up by an editorial by Arthur Brisbane in which he says: “The state of Texas, intensively cultivated, would feed all the earth’s people, and clothe them. The earth is not half or one-tenth populated. And the potential food supply is a hundred times greater than any possible demand.” In another editorial, in similar vein, Mr. Brisbane recently Said of a mountain, of cement rock in Arizona, “From this car in Arizona you see enough rocH to supply houses for all the sixteen hundred million people on earth. And there is enough good land to feed them, with water added to it.’*</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Home a Dangerous Place</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A CCORDING to a report of the National Safety Council 6,000 persons met death during the past year from falls in their own homes. This is three-quarters as many persons as were killed in railroad accidents during the year. There are thousands of other deaths in the homes from burns and scalds; in many of these latter cases babies are the victims.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">C</span><span class="font4">ITIES with over 100 automobile fatalities in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1926 were New York 988, Chicago 622, Detroit 325, Philadelphia 290, Cleveland 238, Los Angeles 206, San Francisco 190, St. Louis 167, Baltimore 159, Pittsburgh 149, Boston 137, Buffalo 132, and Cincinnati 115. There were less than 20 each in Cambridge, Des Moines, El Paso, Fall River, Lynn, New’ Bedford, Somerville, Tacoma, Utica, Waterbury and Yonkers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">How Do We Know They Would Not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">OMMENTING upon the practice of putting poison into the alcohol of commei’ee, to discourage the use of intoxicating beverages, the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font4"> says: “The rank and file of the churches, we may be certain, would never sanction such barbarism once the moral issue were clearly presented to them.” But how do we know they would not! They all know that war is wrong, yet it was the professed Christians of the world that made the World War possible, and it was the professed Christians that taught the savages of heathendom real barbarism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Big Fellows Getting It All</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE big fellows are rapidly getting control of everything. There are now 524 fewer banks in the United States than there were six years ago. Consolidation is the order of the day. One New York bank represents the consolidation of thirty-eight financial institutions. Kirby Page estimates that 20,000 bankers and business men really control about every enterprise in the country, including its polities. Twelve men now represent in the United States corporations having assets of more than ten billion dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Why Pick on the Insured?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">F</span><span class="font4">OR some strange reason the state governments seem to have it in for those who have taken out life insurance for the protection of their families. Last year the state governments collected from, policyholders $72,951,023, enough to pay the annual premium for 4,800,000 ordinary life insurance policies issued at age of 25 for $1,000 each. Of this sum only $1 in $27 was used for the maintenance of state insurance departments. The rest was used for state functions, for which the policyholders had already been taxed as citizens. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Need for Business Reform</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">F</span><span class="font4">IFTY-FIVE Chicago concerns have declared war against unjust returns of merchandise, failure to deliver at appointed time, misrepresentation of merchandise, unreasonable cancellations of orders, disregard of shipping instructions, the promising by salesmen of things which employers cannot fulfil, selling to competitors when the line is stated to be exclusive, overloading retailers with goods, failures to confirm orders, delivering merchandise not according to samples or specifications on the orders, accepting orders which cannot be delivered, delivering more than was ordered, taking discounts not earned, delivering imperfect or soiled goods, delivering invoice ahead of goods and making unreasonable demands for concessions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Philadelphia to Be Remade</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font4">T A cost of $42,000,000 to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and $16,000,000 to the city of Philadelphia, that city is to be practically remade. On the west bank of a beautified Schuylkill river will be located the main Philadelphia station of the Pennsylvania Railroad, the present Broad Street and West Philadelphia stations being discontinued. The station will be, as every railway station in every city should be, of the through train construction type and arrangement. Every train that comes into (he station will discharge its passengers and keep on going. Trains to and from the west and the south will all be routed through the new station, with no necessity for turning seats, changing power and generally inconveniencing everybody. The area now covered by the tracks to Broad Street station will be sold for business purposes, and a new and elegant street added to the city. The new plans involve a complete and comprehensive rearrangement of methods of handling suburban passengers. These will be carried into the city underground, the modem way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">17. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">S. Employment Offices</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">HDHE U. S. Department of Labor maintains -®- 225 employment offices for adults, ranging all the way from seventeen offices in Illinois to one each in several of the less populous states. In addition there is a Junior Division, for the placement of juniors between legal working age and twenty-one years. There is also a Farm Labor Division which places experienced hands on farms in territory tributary to its field offices, all west of the Mississippi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Increases in Railroad Efficiency</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">HHHE railroads of the country are now baud-ling forty-three percent more freight than in 1913, but with only two or three percent more employes. It is surprising in this country to see the relatively small number of railway employes about a great terminal station; while in Britain, in much smaller stations, the men are so thick that they are virtually in the way of everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">bosses of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deforestation</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">O</span><span class="font4">NE of the big leaks in America is the neglect of lands from which the original forests have been removed. These lands are nominally worth $2.50 per acre. If replanted with trees they would in a few years be worth $75 to $100 per acre, and would yield something in taxes which would help with road improvements and other necessary works. America will have to come to reforestation sooner or later, and should begin now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Future Forests Will Be Handy</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE forests of the future, if America ever gets down to business on the matter of reforestation, are likely to be right at the door of some of our greatest business centers. Even at this time, within a fifty-mile radius of Pittsburgh, thirty-tv<sup>T</sup>o percent of the land is forest land. Around Chattanooga it is sixty-three percent; around Albany, forty-eight percent; and around Springfield, Massachusetts, it is fifty-five percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Indifference to Religious Census</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font4">N THE Oklahoma city of Okmulgee, which claims a population of 25,000 to 30,000, one of the newspapers ran a questionnaire for several days; and the managing editor of the paper told one of his brother editors that less than fifty of the people of the city had sent in answers to the questionnaire and that more than half of those were employes of his own paper, who evidently did it to please the boss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Only Proof of Evolution</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE only proof of evolution that we have is that the evolutionists persist in making such monkeys of themselves. A little while ago they filled the Sunday specials with their loud and profusely illustrated announcements of the discovery of the missing link, the Pithecanthropus Erectus, as they called it. It was good of them to give ns this fancy name for the original monkey which they claim as their ancestor. But once more the so-called scientists who are eager to vlorify themselves and io discredit Almiqhty God in the eyes of men have been shown up on the front pages for what they are. Archeologists of the Nation?] Museum at VTashington have announced positively that the skull of the Pidiecav'fhropus Erectus is merely the kneebore of an elephant. And that’s that!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Twa Months Vacation a Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">D</span><span class="font4">p.. Charles B. Piper, medical director of the Guardian Life Insurance Company, advocates two vacations a year, the vacations to be a monih long and five months apart. He claims that this would result in vigor, happiness and longevity. The doctor is right. With machinery able to do the bulk of human drudgery the old idea of human slavery must go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Michigan’s Supreme Court</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TMT </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ICHIGAN’S</span><span class="font4"> supreme court has ruled that 1VJL <sub>a</sub> fireman did not meet with an accident who was drenched twice with sudden gushes of water and subsequently died of pneumonia; also, that a worker in a dye factory does not meet with an accident who dies as the direct result of putting his hands into a dye, a part of his daily tasks. It holds that an accident must be something unusual, within the meaning of Michigan’s compensation act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Holdings of Employe Stockholders</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THE present and prospective employe stocE-holders in twenty of the largest corporations of the United States are one-fifth of the total number of stockholders, but they own only one twenty-fifth of the stock The American Telephone and Telegraph Company leads with 57,000 employes owning or paying for stock of an average value per employe of $1,500.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cheap Labor Does Not Pay</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Progressive Farmer</span><span class="font4"> explains truly that the vicious cycle that curses the South is that the children are kept out of school to make a surplus of cotton; then the cotton surplus makes the prices so low that the farmers cannot afford to send their children to school; thus more cotton makes more ignorance, and more ignorance makes more cotton, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ad infinitum.</span></p>

Not </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a,</span><span class="font4"> law of the United States gives police anywhere any rig’-t so io treat prisoners. How is it possible to Luffiold low and order by ignoring and setting aside laws which were specially designed to protect the ordinary citizen from just such lawlessness?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New Industrial Machine</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, a® a result of examining nine important manufacturing industries, that for every hour a man works he is now producing from one-tenth to</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">twice as much as before the war and in most cases from a fourth to a half more. This increase is due in part to managerial expertness, in part to new inventions, in part to a speeding-up process and in part to more experienced and better-paid labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">American Farmera Disadvantaged</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font4">MERICAN farmers are disadvantaged by the fact that freight rates are still fiftyeight percent higher than before the war, wliile farm commodity prices are only thirty-four percent above the pre-war level. This fact is brought out in the report of the Secretary of +he Department of Agriculture of the United States government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Illegal to Blacklist Seamen</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE United States Supreme Court has ruled that the maintenance of employment offices by shipping associations on the Pacific Coast which amounted, in effect, to the black-listing of some of the most efficient men in the service, , interferes with interstate commerce and violates the anti-trust act. The practices complained of must be discontinued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hudson Bridge a Certainty</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE Hudson River bridge, which is to connect</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">New York and New Jersey at a cost of $60,-000,000, may now be said to be a certainty. Bonds for the building of the bridge have already been marketed to the extent of $20,000,-000, the remainder to be raised as needed. Work will be begun at once. This will be one of the world’s greatest engineering undertakings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Registration of Aliens</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">C</span><span class="font4">ONGRESS now has before it several bills for registration of aliens, some of which would take away practically all the liberty of the class of people that have made America what it is. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font4">erica is a land of aliens. No one here can trace his ancestry in this country more than three hundred years; most of them trace back less than a hundred years, and some of the best people in the land come direct from other lands. The only effect of a law requiring registration rf aliens would be to give jobs to a lot of worthfess politicians, and to make the government in-tteaaingly unpopular*</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Senator Bruce Goes After Methodism</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">UNITED STATES Senator William C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bruce, himself a lifelong Presbyterian, in an address at Washington denounced the Methodist church as fine of the greatest menaces of constitutional government, dedaring that from the Methodist headquarters, only a few pices from the front steps of the national capitol, there is complete domination of the p&gt;olitics of the country, so that our boasted separation of church and state is practically a dead letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">What We Owe the Preachers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A NEW YORK newspaper, commenting on the results which it secured in its part of the so-called religious census, taken under the auspices of the Federation of Churches, calls attention to the fact that while six out of seven who replied had been brought up in religious homes, less than half believed that the Bible is inspired, only a few more believed that prayer is of any avail, and over a third doubted the existence of a God. As these people were brought up in a religious atmosphere it is evident that somebody is to blame; and the ones to blame are manifestly the religious teachers who, instead of teaching the Word of God, have been reaching evolution and the ecpually foolish theories of themselves and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ministers to Stand for Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">O</span><span class="font4">NE hundred and sixteen Congregational ministers have signed a pledge in England that in the next war they will stand on the side of Christ and have nothing to do with the war. This will be a new position for the clergy, a-® hitherto they have been the blessers of every war ever fought. It will be interesting to see how the 116 stick to their pledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pledges to Refuse War Service</span></p>

Arthur Ponsonby, prominent British publicist, has secured over 100,000 signed pledges refusing to support or render war service to any government that resorts to arms Although several thousand persons attended the Ponsonby meetings in the Royal Albert Hall, the London newspapers all ignored the meeting and the premier refused to see the many-signed pledge.</span></p>

We quote two paragraphs:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So rapidly are we progressing in our knowledge of bhort radio waves that it is sate to predict that in a very few years there will be established on the table in every home and office a neat little low-power transmission set attached to a telephone instrument, and near it a frame aerial six inches or so square which will be so directional that we shall b® able to turn it upon the compass-card below and call any particular friend or office who ifl tuned to us. This little instrument will be portable^ its power being generated by turning a geared handle, and usable on a steamer, in a train, in a car or out in tha country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Contracts, when time presses, will be made and witnessed aH over the world, signatures identified, douu- ’ meats exhibited and general commercial business conducted between far distant cities as though the parties were together in the same office, for both will be able not only to see each other, but to hear each other’s voices in their discussion. ... It is quite within th© bounds of possibility that a radio beam of an X-ray type may be turned upon a building and everything within revealed as though walls, doors and shutters did not exist. &lt;</span></p>

Their message is spoken into the ear of the microphone: it is done in a closet or studio fitted up for the purpose; the aerials are fitted, upon the housetops. It is all just as the Master said.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">H</span><span class="font4">ERETOFORE it has been the custom for the thousands of Mexicans who visit annually the Catholic shrine at Guadalupe to crawl on their hands and knees for long distances as they approached the building. The laymen, who are now in charge of Catholic affairs in Mexico, have changed this custom; and this year the pilgrims are coming forward in an upright manner as human beings ought to do. The Scriptures say that “God hath made man upright”; and there is nothing in the Bible to show that he was designed to crawl in the presence of anybody or anything. There is no record that Christ or the apostles ever crawled toward, the temple.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font4">MERICAN labor is trained to the thought and practice of using more and better machinery, so as to obtain a larger production of goods, with more to divide all around. British labor views the whole subject of production askance, fearful that if too much is produced today there will be no job tomorrow and therefore nothing to divide. While in America the production is steadily and rapidly increasing, the claim is made that in Britain the production per worker is from twelve percent to tweury percent less than it was twelve years ago. The logical outcome of these opposite policies is that Britain is lagging in her race for the world markets.</span></p>

Similar meetings were held on the same date in six other large American cities. As an indication of how Jews in Rumania are treated, the following incident is told, of a recent occurrence: A trainload of Rumanian students seized and bound th© Jewish engineer of their train, dashed through the town of Calarsi, laying hands on all Jews and Jewesses found, and flogging them mercilessly. Returning to their train they released the engineer; and when he had safely'taken them to their destination at Jassy several of th© students rewarded him by spitting in his face.

<p><span class="font0">from Watchtower, Station WBBB on a wava length of 416.4 meters.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Q</span><span class="font4">UESTION: Do good people go Straight to heaven when they die ? or must the Christian remain dead until the time of resurrection?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: Christians, the same as all others, remain absolutely dead, in every sense, from the time of their death until their awakening in the resurrection. The Scriptures are positive on this point. In 1 Corinthians 15:13,18 we read, &quot;If there be no resurrection of the dead . . . then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle’s argument is that unless there I is a resurrection from the dead even the Christians who have died in Christ have perished, and would be extinct. Jesus Himself said that He would raise His faithful followers at the j last day, when He would return. We read His i words in John 6:40: &quot;Every one which seeth the &gt;&nbsp;Son, and believeth on him, may have everlast-I ing life: and I will raise him up at the last day.” j But some will say, It is the fleshly body that r is raised at the last day and not the spiritual body. This is not true-—the Christian comes j forth in the resurrection a spirit being, for the J first time. Let us turn to the positive scripture j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on this point. In 1 Corinthians 15:40-44 we</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">( &nbsp;&nbsp;read: &quot;There are celestial bodies [meaning</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">j spiritual bodies] and bodies terrestrial;... so ■ also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown j in corruption: it is raised in incorruption: it is ! sown in dishonor: it is raised in glory: it is sown ! in weakness; it is raised in power: it is sown a natural body,* it is raised </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> spiritual body.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">। Even the Apostle Paul did not expect to be I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raised immediately at death, nor did he expect</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ids reward, the crown of life, before the Lord’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">| return. In 2 Timothy 4: 8 we read: “Henceforth ) there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.” Life beyond the grave, in any sense, depends upon the awakening from the tomb by Christ Jesus </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font4"> the resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question: Is it true that salvation is found &lt;&nbsp;only in the Catholic church </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">j Answer: No. At no place in the Bible does it say so. Salvation is the path to life, and this belongs to God. In Psalm 37:39 we read: &quot;But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord: he is their strength in the time of trouble.” The Lord will show salvation only to them who do His will The win of Jehovah God is expressed in the Scriptures; and unless the individual reads, studies, and applies the Scriptures to himself he cannot have salvation. In 2 Tim. 3:15 we read: “The holy scriptures ... are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.” Again, in Romans 1:16 we read: &quot;For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God. unto salvation to everyone that believeth.” It will be well for all who wish salvation, including Catholics and Protestants, to study the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question : Please explain Matthew 18:3: &quot;Verily I say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer : Jesus did not mean that heaven is filled with little children, infants one and two years of age; but He did mean that in order to enter into the kingdom of heaven one must have a meek and teachable disposition, much as a child has toward his parents. Showing that this is the correct thought, Jesus said concerning His disciples, while praying to the heavenly Father, in Matthew 11:25: &quot;I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes.” The fact is that no infants will ever get into the kingdom of heaven; infants will come forth in the resurrection, upon this planet earth. To enter into the kingdom of heaven one must do the will of the heavenly Father; and to do this, knowledge and resolution are necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question: Jesus said, as is recorded in Mark 12:30,31, “Thou slialt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with, all thy strength: this is the first commandment. And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.” The question is, If I try and endeavor the very best I can to follow these commandments, relying upon the Lord’s help, can I hope for life hereafter and salvation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: Yes. Absolutely. The secret in being a successful Christian is in doing the will of the heavenly Father, Jehovah God. Jesus said,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">as is recorded in Matthew 7:21, “Not every one who sayeth unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.&quot; In other words, Jesus said that there would be many who would call themselves Christian; but that this would not entitle them to entrance into the heavenly kingdom. It is necessary to do the will of the heavenly Father. Now if the individual loves th© Lord with aU his heart, he will be anxious to do the will of Jehovah God. In order to know the will of God he must obtain such knowledge from the Bible or such literature which is in harmony with the Bible. He will not be satisfied with what he merely hears or reads except that it agrees with the Bible teaching. Topical studies for Bible students are published by the International Bible Students Association, which have helped thousands to an understanding of the Bible. One who loves his neighbor as himself will seek to do good to others ; and the best good that you can do for others at this time is to tell them about the truth, tell them about the kingdom of Jehovah. God that is shortly to bless mankind, tell them of God’s promise to return their dead ones by th© awakening of the resurrection. This message should cheer their hearts, should inspire a real hope in. their minds and hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question : Are individuals who are born into the world today the sons of God in the same sense in which Jesus was the Son of God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer : No. Absolutely not. The difference is this: The individuals born into the world today are the descendants of Adam, who in a dying condition could not give to his children perfect life. On the other hand, while Mary the mother of Jesus was of the race of Adam, the Father of Jesus was Jehovah God. Being plain in this matter to obtain the truth, it was the power of Jehovah God that started the new life in Mary at the time of conception. The father is the life-giver, the mother is the one who nourishes that life. The perfect life organism begun in Mary had the power to eliminate all imperfect refuse and to absorb the substance to mature as a perfect babe. Thus Jesus was born into the world perfect. Thus we read in Hebrews 7:26 that Jesus was “holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question : Is it wise to study the Bible with &amp;&nbsp;view to seek its oneness with all other religions ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: No, absolutely not the Bib® is separate and distinct from all other religions and knows no compromise. This has been the dhief difficulty with even the clergy, both Catholic and Protestant. They have tried to find harmony between the Bible and their creeds. The result is confusion. The creeds are opposed to the Bible and are saturated with erroy. The Christian accepts the Bible only, as being .the infallible Word of Truth. The Christian accepts as truth only such other literature as conforms to the teachings of the Bible. If the writing of any individual, priest or minister, does not conform to the teaching of the Bible, the Christian throws it out as error. It is indeed pleasing to the Lord to have His Word used as the standard of truth. In Isaiah 8:20 we read, “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no truth in them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question: Do the Bible Students celebrate Memorial Day! And if not, why not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer : The Bible Students do not celebrate a day in commemoration of the dead soldiers, because the Bible does not authorize them to do so. But if a holiday is granted, it is generally used in doing others good by telling them the message of the kingdom. For instance, the Bible Students may use this day to comfort others by telling them that the dead soldier boys will come back in the resurrection, that they will come back when the nations will lay down their arms in the kingdom, when the will of the heavenly Father will be done on earth. Th® preaching of this good news to the people inspires hope in their hearts and comforts them. This does infinitely more good than sermons on war, cannons and blood-dripping sabres. The world should be sick of the memories of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Question: How is immortality gained?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer : Immortality is the gift of God, and may be obtained through obedience in doing God’s holy will. In Bomans 2:7 the Apostle Paul told the Christians to seek immortality. Of course they would not seek it if they already possessed it. Even the Apostle Paul while here on earth did not possess immortality. No man that ever lived on earth possessed immortality. If he did he would never die. The Apostle Paul looked forward to the resurrection and said, as is recorded in 1 Corinthians 15:53, “This mortal must put on immortality.&quot;</span></p>

The little country has a history running back four thousand years. It has always been under the subjection of stronger nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the last fifty years many whites have invadbd Korea, with promises for its betterment,-conditioned upon permission to work the gold mines in its mountains. The Japanese fought two wars for the independence of the country, but at the conclusion of the second one they took possession of the land themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today most of the useful lands of Korea are in. the hands of the Japanese, and although the Koreans still do the work of cultivating the soil more than half of its products go to the Japanese. Hence instead of the Koreans being able to eat rice, as hitherto, many of them have to live on Manchurian millet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Indeed, thousands of Koreans are going to Manchuria every year; but the Chinese treat them cruelly, and force them to go farther on to the colder lands of Siberia and Mongolia. The Koreans have been looking in vain for help from any earthly source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">KT OW let us see what religion has done for Korea. For many centuries Buddhism had been the prevailing religion. About sixeenturies ago a Korean king encouraged Confnriamwn, with some resulting benefit to the people, for a time; though after his death matters went on much toe same as before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At length along earns the white missionaries of toe Christian refigiom The Catholic missionaries made servants of their followers, and now wherever there are Catholic missions in'Korea there you will find the native sons acting as carriers of ihtir sedan chairs and doing all toe drudgery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Presbyterians and Methodists came with hospitals and schools; but now toe Koreans have better hospitals and schools than those provided by the Christian missionaries, and even the Korean Christians themselves toil* it is wy foolish to educate their eMtdren in the mission schools. The missionaries are trying to tickle toe ears of toe Korean children with evolution theories, but since the children can get that also in the common schools the power of the sects is gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Seventh Day Adventists came along and circulated thousands of copies of their monthly papers and books saying, in effect, that only those who keep Saturday sacred will be saved, and that all others will perish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some missionaries forget that the Koreans are ancestor-worshipers, and that if the true Korean believed that his fathers were in the fire because of some supposed evil god of fire, he would gladly choose to jump into the fire with them than to go to heaven and enjoy the music alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But some of the missionaries are not content to wait until the natives die before beginning their torture. Last year a Seventh Day Adventist got hold of &amp;&nbsp;small Korean boy who had stolen a few of his apples, and wrote on his face with poison the Korean word for thief. In vain toe Korean doctors have tried to remove the sear. The boy must carry it for life. The white “Christian” who did this has been imprisoned, and toe incident has furnished another occasion for many Koreans to attack Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font4"> of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">fpHE latest to appear as the saviors of Korea «*• are the Salvation Army. These came at a time of Korean unrest; and many Koreans, misunderstanding the terms Salvation and Army, eondnded that the time had come for their deliverance or salvation from oppressors, and proceeded to join the Amy in considerable numbers. There were- many hasty withdrawals when they learned that toe Army is merely an association for carrying on evangelistic work. Some, however, retained their membership, expecting great things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As time went on the unrest became more pronounced, until at length came the arrival of Commander Booth from England, via Japan. His coming had been widely heralded, and some Koreans foolishly expected him to do great things for toe country, although many Korean “converts” had seen enough to begin to be disappointed in the Army. On the day of his arrival Booth reviewed toe white contingent of his</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Army in a hall, and no Korean member was ah</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">lowed to &quot;be present. This action was resented by the Koreans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Korean soldiers of the Army prepared a petition, containing twenty grievances, for submission to General Booth; but could get no opportunity to present it. Af length, in one of the subsequent Salvation Army meetings, a native Korean Christian tried to offer prayer in English, and made some reference to the unfair play of the Army, when his prayer was forthwith stopped by the beating of drums, after Which the offender also was beaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Unable to get any redress, the native Korean Salvationists then went on a hunger strike. While this was in progress General Booth left quietly on a south-bound train, after -word had been given out by his white representatives of “truth and righteousness” that he was to leave by a north-bound one. The foreign (white) staff all knew accurately when he was going, and were on hand to see him off ; but the poor Korean members were conspicuous by their absence. When they learned that they had been thus treated the Korean Salvationists gathered in protest. They were then told to go to their homes and wait, with the “Christian” assurance that their living expenses would be paid for a time—they had forsaken ail to work for the Army, and were dependent thereon— but nothing was sent to them except a letter saying that the promised funds could not be paid. This additional broken pledge was too much. Rebellion broke out. And now for several weeks the Salvation Army in Korea has been unable to have any meetings, except under police protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By telegram Mr. Booth finally ordered the head of the Salvation Army School in Korea to kick out all offending native students, but forgot to instruct him to give back to them the guarantee money which they had deposited with the Army when they enrolled. Tins has created </span><span class="font5">a </span><span class="font4">very bad impression in the minds of the Korean public who, by the way, are not savages, as many whites suppose, but gentle, God-fearing people. And this is but one instance of how the missionary brand of Christianity is killing itself in the various “heathen” lands which they would “convert”. The natives abominate hypocrisy.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Pope Looks to United States</span></h6>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE Cincinnati </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times Star</span><span class="font4"> tells us that the pope looks to the United States for funds, because he realizes that this Protestant country has today the greatest prosperity on earth. This seems like a good idea, to look for the money where the money is; but sometimes it does not pay to think of the money alone, either. Now there was the case of the Chicago Historical Society, heirs of the tl'anther estate, which had up for gale twelve more cases of the bones of the twelve apostles. Of course the bones are genuine; for Cardinal Mundelein of Chicago says they are, and he ought to know. But the Cardinal has decided that such holy relies ought not to be exposed for sale in such an ungodly city as Chicago; so he made a generous contribution to the Historical Society, wliich did not want the bones; and they presented them to the Cardinal. The newspapers seem to think that Cardinal Mundelein will send these Chicago bones of the apostles direct to the pope as a present. But our guess is that the bones w ill be sent to the fertilizer works, as they should be; and that the money for them, some of it, may finally get to the pope if the ushers and doormen do not got it first.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Christ in the Book of Exodus</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">[Radiocast from Station WBBR on a wave length of 416.4 meter® by ft® MltwJ</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HROUGHOUT his life Moses, the man of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God, was a type of Christ. Let us notice some of the incidents and see how clearly this is the case. Exodus, chapter two, opens with the observation that Moses was a goodly child. Stephen says of him that he was &quot;exceedingly fair”. Josephus says that he was so handsome that passersby turned to gaze at him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In his personal appearance, then, he was like the One “altogether lovely”, “the chiefest among ten thousand”; like the One whom the Roman officers came to take, but returned empty-handed to their rulers, because Jesus so impressed them; like the One who was mobbed in his home town, but in simple dignity moved through the rabble unharmed, because He was the Son of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Moses’ activities, as recorded in Exodus 2:11-15, we have a number of illustrations of the career of our Savior. As Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, but went out to east in his lot with God’s people, who were in affliction, so we can see how Jesus laid aside the glory that He had with the Father before the world was, and “though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the outcome of Moses’ efforts resulted in his being rejected by his brethren and his life thereby endangered, so our Lord Jesus came to His own and His own received Him not; and not only was His life endangered but it was actually taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As Moses, after his rejection by his people, went into a far country, where lie remained for a long time—forty years—so Christ Jesus, after His rejection by His people, went into heaven itself, where He remained throughout the long period of the Gospel Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">SIgscs Marries</span><span class="font4"> an </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ethiopian</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">S MOSES while in the country far remote from his people chose for himself a Gentile bride, so during the Gospel Age Christ has been engaged in selecting His &quot;bride”, and for the most part this bride class has also been selected from among the Gentiles.—Acts 15:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the bride whom Moses selected was unlike himself in color, being an Ethiopian with a dark skin, go Christ selected for His bride not the holy angels nor any other sinless beings, but made His choice from among those who are stained with sin, illustrated by Zipporah’s dark skin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As Moses at length returned to deliver God’s people, so the object of our Lord’s return is the blessing and deliverance of all who shall ultimately be the people of God; and as, in the type, this deliverance was accompanied by grand exhibitions of God’s power, so, in far greater degree, it shall be in the thousand-year day of deliverance now dawning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now please turn to the fourth chapter of Exodus, verses 6 and 7. Moses was caused to put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out it was as leprous as snow. Again he was caused to put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out it was restored to its original condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This hand of Moses represents the power of God put forth to recover humanity out of sin and death. Christ Jesus is the personification or living representative of that hand. In the hand of Moses, in its original purity, we see our Lord Jesus at the time of His first advent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the condition of Moses’ hand, after being first thrust into his bosom and brought forth, we see a representation of the members of the mystical body of Christ, as they have appeared throughout the Gospel Age. In the condition of Moses’ hand after it was thrust into his bosom the second time and then brought forth and used to deliver God’s people from Egypt, we see represented the perfection of the Christ, Head and body, as that perfection will be revealed to all during the thousand-year reign of the Messiah when lie will bring deliverance to the whole world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">VJe shall see many other similar instances in which Moses represents Christ Jesus alone, also ths complete Christ, Head and body; but let us follow the book of Exodus in its historical o^der, and we will take those up as we come to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After his return into Egypt Moses and Aaron went time after time into the presence of Pharaoh and demanded that he should let God’s people go. In each of these appearances Moses represents the Lord, now present but unseen, while Aaron represents the living members of the body of Christ, the church, who serve as the spokesmen of their Lord and Head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Passover Picture</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I</span><span class="font4">N THE twelfth chapter of Exodus, verses</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">3 to 28, is given the account of the Passover lamb. Concerning this lamb the Apostle Paul tells us that &quot;Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us”, and thus helps us to see that God intended this lamb to represent our Savior and Redeemer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This lamb was selected on the tenth day of the month Nisan. Its selection on that day was intended to point forward to that tentii day of Nisan, A. D. 33, when Christ Jesus rode into the city of Jerusalem and offered Himself as the anti typical Passover Lamb of the Jewish nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The lamb w*as kept until the fourteenth day of Nisan, the full of the moon, and then slain; and not only was Christ crucified on the 14th of Nisan, but even as the full moon, which represents the Law Covenant, immediately after the 14th of Nisan begins to wane, so Israel’s national decline began from the date of Christ’s death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We might go further and point out that as the moon waned for as long a time as it had increased, so Christ’s death was the turning point between the two equal periods of Israel’s history. There began the “double” of Israel’s disfavor, which is referred to by several prophets, and which ended in 1878 with the Berlin Congress of Nations, which began to restore favor to that people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The paschal lamb was to be killed ‘between the two evenings’. (See the marginal reading of Exodus 12:6.) These two evenings of the Jews were (1) from noon to 3 p. m., and (2) from 3 p. m. until sunset, respectively; and Christ died at 3 o’clock in the afternoon midway between the two evenings, at the same time when the paschal lamb &quot;was slain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The blood of the paschal lamb was to be sprinkled upon the door posts and lintels of the homes of the Israelites. This represents that the only safety for any, while the angel of death is abroad in the land, is to abide under the blood. In other words, there is no other name given under heaven or among men whereby we must be saved, but the name of Jesus only. Without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins; and it was the shedding of blood on behalf of the sins of our first parent, father Adam, that makes possible the recovery of the human family out of sin and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This paschal Iamb was to be eaten with bitter herbs. This is intended to show that the lot of the true Christian during the Gospel Age has not been an easy one. It has involved the acceptance of many bitter experiences; but these have been beneficial in one way, inasmuch as they have sharpened the spiritual appetite, even as St. Paul says: T count all things as loss, that I may know him and the fellowship of Iris sufferings, being made conformable unto his death.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">None of this paschal lamb was to be left over until the morning. It was all to be eaten in that night, just before the deliverance from bondage was to take place. And so in the antitype, it is during the night time, before the full dawn of the Millennial Day of deliverance, that the people of God are to constitute the body of Christ, partake of Him in the very special sense here indicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This paschal lamb was to be eaten with the loins girded, the shoes on the feet and the staff in the hand; and it was to be eaten in haste. All this has been true in the antitype. While the church, the body of Christ, has been making ready for the day of deliverance, she has been partaking of Christ with the loins of her mind girded up, with her feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace, and with the Word of God, the staff of life, in her hand. And she has eaten in haste; that is, she has realized that there is work to be done, and that the time m which to do it is limited. And now, thank God, the dawn of the day of deliverance has come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We notice further regarding the paschal lamb, that in the eating of it, and subsequently, not a bone of it was to be broken. The same thought is evidently referred to by the Psalmist when, in speaking of Christ Jesus, he said: “Many are the afflictions of the righteous; but the Lord, delivereth him out of them all. He keepeth all his bones; not one of them is broken.” (Psalm 34:19,20) It was the custom, at crucifixions, for the soldiers to break the legs of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">dying, </span><span class="font4">so that they might expire the quicker; but on account of the fact that Jesus died sooner than expected, the record is that when they came to Him and saw that He was dead already, they did not break His legs. This was in direct ful-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">filment of the Scriptural command regarding the treatment of the paschal lamb, representative of ths Righteous One of whom the Psalmist here speaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TAe </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Wilderness Experiences</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font4">FTER Israel had passed over the Red Sea, they wandered three days in the wilderness and found no water. At the expiration of that time they came to the waters of Marah, but when they came to taste of them they found the waters could not be used because they were bitter. Moses thereupon was shown a tree which, when he cut it down and cast it into the waters, caused them to become lifegiving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are not apprised of the shape of this tree, but have the opinion that it represented in its general form the cross upon which Christ was crucified, and that thus it was intended to picture Him. The Scriptures tell us that all that happened to fleshly Israel happened to them for types, and was written for the instruction of spiritual Israel. This was one of fleshly Israel’s experiences; and certainly it well illustrates that Christ is the one way to life. At this moment the world is standing on the edge of the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Mill</span><span class="font4">ennial kingdom of our Lord, but only a recognition and a hearty acceptance of Christ will make its blessings available to anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Going on from Marah Israel at length came to Elim, where there were twelve wells of water and seventy palm trees. In these arrangements at Elim we can see foreshadowed the ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ while on earth. The twelve wells of water represent the twelve apostles of the Lamb. The seventy palm, trees were probably date palms, and the food which they bore represents nicely the food which was given in spiritual form by the seventy whom our Lord sent out to declare the kingdom of heaven at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even though the greatest economy were practised, it required a vast amount of food to supply the needs of two million people. When the Israelites left Egypt they brought along with them considerable quantities of bread, baked and unbaked; but in about six weeks this food was gone, and hunger struck the camp with all its fury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This need of the people for food had not been unforeseen by Almighty God, but the food itself was withheld until the people should feel their need of it At length it eame, in A® form of • small round grain, evidently deposited in o» from the dew by some power of God working m harmony with the natural laws of chemistry not yet thoroughly understood. This food, which the Israelites called ‘“manna”, was literally bread from heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Israelites were compelled to gather the manna fresh every day. What was gathered on one day was not good on the next; and yet, by a miraculous interposition of divine providence, that which was gathered on the sixth day of the week remained good on the seventh; and the manna which was originally put in the ark of the tabernacle remained fresh and sweet throughout all the years of Israel’s pilgrimage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This manna represented the flesh of Christ Jesus our Lord. Our Lord was the true bread from heaven, in the sense that His life was from God; and when He took Adam’s place in death He thereby purchased for Adam and his race an opportunity to gain life everlasting. As the Israelites had t© put forth their hands and gather the manna if they would continue to live, so the world of mankind, throughout the Millennial Age, will ever need to seek fresh supplies of the Bread of Life, without which they may not gain life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The incorruptible manna which was hidden in the ark represents that for which our Lord’s flesh stands, does not see corruption; and also, possibly, the body in which He lived and suffered and died is preserved somewhere in the universe as an everlasting testimony of infinite love and perfect obedience. Certainly we know that the glorified Lord has a different body now. The Scriptures say that He was put to death a fleshly being and made alive a spirit being. Th® two are as different as anything can be. Th® apostle tells us that in death &quot;thou sowest not that body that shall be”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">AS </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ML Sinai</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font4">T LENGTH the Israelites arrived at Motml Sinai, where the Law Covenant between God and the people of Israel was to be ratified in a formal manner. As the people drew near the mountain God cautioned them through Moses to prepare their hearts for what would take place on the third day, and especially not to attempt to break through certain boundari®® which were established. Subsequently, amid great convulsions of nature, the mountain quaking and smoking, the thunder pealing and the lightning flashing, God gave His law. The central figure in the picture was Moses, the mediator, standing between God and the people, who were forewarned of death if they should break through the bounds and attempt to deal with God directly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In tills stupendous panorama we see a picture of mankind waiting for the establishment of God’s kingdom in the earth. As heretofore shown, Moses was a type of Christ. As Moses required the Israelites to recognize for three days certain bounds which he set for them, so, during the fifth, sixth and early part of the seventh thousand-year days of man upon the earth, the Christ, Head and body, has been marking out the bounds of those who may approach the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ordinance that whoever would pass beyond the limit set should be put to death shows the destruction of whatever should come in conflict with the kingdom, which we now declare is in process of being set up. The commotions of nature represent the awe-inspiring events which began with the World War and will continue until the New Covenant is fully in operation in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At this point it seems well to say something about the sounding of the trumpet, which we are told waxed louder and louder, so that, at length, the people begged that they might not hear it any more. This trumpet was, without doubt, a literal sound on the air; but it represented something far different—it pictured something that is now going on in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most people are somewhat familiar with the Revelation of St. John. They know that it is a book of pictures or symbols. It is so declared to be, in its very first verse. St. John has much to say about seven trumpets. They are sounded one after another, until finally the seventh one is sounded; and at that time the establishment of the kingdom of God takes place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In these trumpets we see pictured, not literal blasts that may be heard on the air, as some have imagined, but certain great movements toward religious liberty and away from religious tyranny—six of which are already in the past, and the seventh is now on in dead earnest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This seventh </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">symbolic trumpet is variously </span><span class="font4">called &quot;the trump of God”, “the last trump,” and &quot;the trump of jubilee”. It is the trumpet call of truth, blowing in your ears this very minute. It is the trumpet call of liberty, not only from ecclesiastical tyrants and oppressors, but from all other forms of oppression, political, financial, military or what not. These trumpet sounds will wax louder and louder. That is because it is the message of God, and no man can stay it if he would. The kingdom of God is here, already making itself felt as a power among men; and soon it will be so recognized by all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Tabernacle</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">W</span><span class="font4">E HAVE already seen how Moses represented our Lord Jesus in many of the earlier experiences of his life, and that at the time of the giving of the law and the ratification of the Law Covenant at Sinai he prefigured Jesus as Mediator, ratifying the New Covenant for mankind. We now notice that when Moses went up into the mountain he was gone forty days and forty nights, during which time he received full instructions regarding the tabernacle to be erected in the wilderness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Everything about that &quot;tabernacle in the wilderness”, and all the sacrifices which centered there, represented Christ Jesus in some aspect or other. The ark in the Most Holy represented The Christ complete. In it was the table of the law, the- pot of manna and Aaron’s rod that budded. Each of these things represents Christ, the one as the Law<sup>T</sup>-Giver, the other as the Life-Giver, the third as the TruthGiver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another way of stating the matter would be to say that the rod, the manna and the law represented The Christ as earth’s Prophet, Priest and King. The Most Holy, in which the ark was located, represented &quot;heaven itself, whither Christ our forerunner- has entered for us”, as the apostle tells in the Book of Hebrews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Adjoining the Most Holy was the Holy, within which were the golden candlestick, the table of shewbread and the incense altar. Each of these represented The Christ while in the heavenly minded condition, though still actually in the flesh. The candlestick represented The Christ as light-givers; the table, as holders forth of the Bread of Life, God’s Word; and the incense altar, as offerers of loving devotion to God. Each of these things represents not onlg Jesus alone but also the members of His body, the body of Christ, the true church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even the golden pillars, of which the walls of the tabernacle structure were made, represent The Christ, as also does the cloth of whit® and blue and purple and scarlet, which constituted the ceiling and the entrance. These colors, in their turn, represented the purity, faithfulness, royalty and redemptive blood of the Savior of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Going outside of the tabernacle structure into the Court, the two articles of furniture there also represented Christ. The brazen altar represented the ransom sacrifice of our Lord; and the laver represented the Lord in His capacity as Purifier of His brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The three gates or doors or vails entering, respectively, the Court, the Holy and the Most Holy, represented Jesus as the one and only way to God, by the path of consecration, spirit begetting and, finally, birth into the spirit nature itself, which can tale place only at the end of one’s earthly career.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Outside of the Court, and indeed outside of the camp itself, we see Jesus represented in the burning which was there made of the hoofs, horns, entrails, etc., of the animals that were offered up on the brazen altar in the Court. We have the clue to the meaning of this, in the apostle’s exhortation, “Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.” —Hebrews 13:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Seeing that the offering outside the camp represented the sacrifice of Jesus as it appeared to those who were in the camp, namely as a stench and a reproach (which was what Jesus’ sacrifice of Himself appeared to the scribes and Pharisees of His day, and what the sacrifice of His faithful body members appears to the clergy of our day), we are helped to see that the sacrifice in the Court, and the incense offered in the Holy and Most Holy represented those same offerings as they appear from the different viewpoints of fellow-sacrificers and of God Himself. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">High Priest </span><span class="font4">lyroBEOVEB, the one who actually offered &quot;JL <sub>D</sub>p the sacrifices, namely the high priest, represented our Lord Jesus in a very special Sense. In fact, everything about the high priest represented “the high priest of our profession,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus Christ the righteous”, as say® the apcstla</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The anointing of Aaron the high priest rap* resented the pouring out of the holy spirit on our Lord Jesus at the time of His baptism. As the holy anointing oil which was poured upon Aaron’s head ran down to the skirts of his garments, so the holy spirit which descended upon Jesus at Jordan came down upon the members of His body at Pentecost; and is even now, symbolically, falling down upon the feet members, the last members of the body of Christ on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Aaron’s white linen coat represented the purity of our Lord; while the embroidery upon that coat represented the outgrowth of that purity in works of grace. The mitre worn about Aaron’s forehead, and to which his crown was fastened, was of white linen and shows Jhat the crown, the right to rule, is righteously the Lord’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The inscription on the crown was “Holiness t® Jehovah”, a condensed statement of the object of the kingdom of which our Lord is to be the Ruler. It was a fitting description of our Lord Himself, whose whole object was to know and to do the will of His Father in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The linen girdle of Aaron indicated that our Lord thinks of Himself as a servant. The girdle speaks of servitude as plainly as the linen speaks of righteousness. Our Lord is indeed the righteous Servant of Jehovah, His Messenger, “the messenger of the covenant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Aaron’s upper robe of blue represented our Lord's faithfulness. The fringe of bells and pomegranates shows that in clue time the attention of all the world will be drawn to the fruitage of our Lord’s redemptive work. The bells indicate that the tiling cannot be hidden beyond Cod’s due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The front of the ephod, which covered Aaron’s breast, represented the Abrahamjc Covenant. The back of the ephod, covering his shoulders, represented the New Covenant. The golden clasps which fastened the two ephods together, and which rested upon the shoulders of Aaron, represented that the fulfilment of both the Abra* hamic and the New Covenant rests upon om Lord Jesus Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Atonement Sacrifices</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font4">LL of the sacrifices which were offered on the day of atonement represented Christ The bullock, which was for Aaro® and Ms</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>&lt;0</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QOLDEN AQE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooch,</span><span class="font0"> N. X.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">represented our Lord Jesus as a perfect man. When Aaron laid his hands on the bullock it represented the holy spirit coining upon our Lord at the time of His baptism. The slaying of the antitypieal bullock was finished at Calvary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord’s goat, the sacrifice of which followed the sacrifice of the bullock, represented the sacrifice of the church which is the Lord’s body. When Aaron laid his hands upon the head of the Lord’s goat it represented the holy spirit coining upon the church at Pentecost. The slaying of the antitypieal Lord’s goat is not yet finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The destraction of the scapegoat in the wilderness represented what happens to those members of the body of Christ who do not retain their anointing and therefore do not continue actively engaged in the work of sacrifice. This scapegoat class is at this moment in the wilderness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ram of burnt offering, which was burnt on the brazen altar, shows how the sacrifice of Jesus the Head and the members of His body appears in the eyes of Jehovah. The ram was cut in pieces, and the pieces were washed and laid to the head. All were consumed together. From this point of view the ram of burnt offering is now blazing furiously and is nearly consumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The holy anointing oil which was poured on the head of Aaron the high priest was composed of four ingredients, myrrh, cinnamon, calamus and cassia. These four ingredients represented respectively wisdom, knowledge, understanding and service; and it is significant that when the prophet speaks of the holy spirit coming upon 'Jesus he describes it as a spirit of wisdom, knowledge, understanding and &quot;counsel-and-might”, which latter expression is a very good definition of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The very name of the chief worker who was used to rear the tabernacle structure is significant of Christ. He was Bezaleel (Shadow of the Almighty), son of Uri (Light), son of Hur (Grace), of the tribe of Judah (Praised). Jesus Christ was indeed the Shadow of the Almighty, the Light of the World; and though He was rightly praised in His prehuman estate He humbled Himself unto death and the grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Lord’s Return Foreshadowed</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">W</span><span class="font4">HEN Moses and Joshua came down from the mountain with the tables of the law Moses found that the people had corrupted themselves before the golden calf ■which Aaron had made for them. Tills necessitated another trip into the mountain, and the bringing a second time of the tables of the law. This second trip into the mountain represents the ascent of our Lord into heaven after His first advent, and Moses’ return from the mountain the second time with the new tables of the law represents the second advent of our Lord, who returns to rewrite the law of God in the hearts of the people. The prophet puts the matter thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with, the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the Lord; but this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel: after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and w<sup>T</sup>ill be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”—Jeremiah 31:31-34. ।</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE city of Edinburgh, Scotland, has officially refused to be governed by the precepts of Christ Actually, it is no different from any other city, because none of them is willing to be governed by those precepts. The official act came about through the necessity of disposing of the motion of a member of the Town Council, who moved that Edinburgh should b«r governed in strict accordance with Jesus’ teachings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">[Radiocast from Station WBBB on a wave length of 4164 seton by B. 8. SkneryJ</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE history of man’s effort to gain liberty is interesting to follow, although rather discouraging in that every attempt which has for the moment appeared as being a success has ended in bondage. Man lias placed his confidence in kings, only to have them rule with a high hand and grind him down to the ground in order that greater splendor might be enjoyed at the royal court. He has placed his confidence in “benevolent” despots who have quickly risen to power through having brought about social reforms and temporary relief for some of our woes, but reforms which have since passed away—the power which the reformer benevolently exercised having fallen into the hands of successors filled with wholly&quot; selfish desires to get all and give none.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mankind have even formed democracies of their own, holding the right of control in their own hands through the ballot. This indeed seemed to he the final step in the liberty of humanity, but practical experience has demonstrated that a monied aristocracy controls in Bpite of all man’s efforts to have it otherwise-— waste and graft in public offices being even greater than before. Hence where man himself has enjoyed the greatest personal liberty he has usually suffered the greatest inefficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore the cry everywhere in this present flay of turmoil and upheaval is for a true leader who will lead the people out of their distress into their desired haven of rest, peace and prosperity, to be forever freed from war, wrangling and strife; for a leader of leaders whose authority might not come to the sad conclusion of all the former ones by being succeeded by those who are filled with selfishness and greed. In Vain mankind has searched to find such a leader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible holds forth the only real King of kings, whose reign will bring the desire of all nations and fill the aching void in the .hungry heart. This great King of kings is none else than Jesus Christ; and His reign, according to Revelation 20th chapter, is to be for a period ©f 1000 years. Over 4000 jmars ago, to Abraham, the promise was made that the blessing of the human race should come through his seed. In Galatians 3:16 the apostle shows that this seed is Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the birth of Jesus the angels of heaven burst forth with that grand chorus, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men!” (Luke 2:14) Great was the rejoicing in heaven, for it was realized that the plan, of God was there being unfolded for the redemption of the human family. This was the event long foretold, and one that was being looked forward to by those true Israelites who were seeking to serve the Lord in spirit and in truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many were then expecting Him to come as ths King of kings and to begin His reign, but Jehovah’s due time was not yet; for, as the 110th Psalm shows, upon the resurrection of Jesus the command was given to Him to be seated on His Father's right hand until Jehovah God should make His enemies His footstool. When this due time would arrive then Jehovah would say to His Son, “Rule thou in the midst of thin® enemies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Prophet Isaiah, tells of the greatness of this King of kings: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from, henceforth even fox* ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.”—Isaiah 9: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let us therefore consider the reign, of this mighty One for whose kingdom Christians pray, and whose birth even the world claims to yearly commemorate. Before a kingdom of rightcovs-ness can be established, the unrighteous order must be abolished. This is the first great work of the King of kings. Then comes the inereas® of His kingdom, ippon the principles mentioned by the prophet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Old Order Doomed</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE idea of the destruction of the present organized forms of government is very repugnant to some, and the mere mention of such a thing fills them with horror. This is not because they are in sympathy with the existing evils but because they, in the majority of instances, are order-loving people who would rather tolerate the present imperfect conditions than to think of a worse state that might follow the overthrow of present institutions. All such inquire, Why is it necessary that before the kingdom of righteousness is established in the earth, the present order must be destroyed? With all the Christian churches now in existence, is it not possible for them to convert the world and thus usher in this kingdom without such a terrible upheaval?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is not my purpose to preach revolution or to attempt in any way to incite trouble; for such a course would be contrary to the position which a Christian should take. But it is my purpose to show that this work of destruction of the old order shall he done, not by man but by the King of kings, as His first great act preparatory to the establishment of the era of blessing which shall come as a result of His righteous reign. Before that time comes the complete destruction of the present order is absolutely necessary; for it is evil and based upon unrighteousness and selfishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the Lord Jesus and also St. Paul, the whole world structure is now under the supervision of the Devil. Even, though a large portion of the civilized world is posing as Christian, Satan is actually blinding the minds of men who believe not, lest the glorious doctrine of Jesus Christ should shine into their hearts. Satan is the great unseen spiritual force who has thus been ruling in the hearts of the children of men, according to the Scriptures; and he has such, control over men that St. Paul wrote to the Ephesians, chapter 6 verse 12, “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against Spiritual wickedness in high places.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here St. Paul states that the real opposing force is not human but spiritual—the great adversary, the Devil and his hosts. It is he and his evil angel associates who constitute the symbolic “heavens” of this present world. This being true, as St. Peter argues, these heavens must pass away, to be replaced by the new. And in Revelation 20th chapter it is stated that this shall be accomplished through the binding of Satan himself, in order that he might not be able to continue in his nefarious work of deceiving the nations and keeping them from learning the truth and following after it</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But would it not be sufficient for the King of kings merely to bind this great enemy of mankind and then to pour out upon the people the blessings which they have so long needed? Is it necessary for the Lord to completely destroy the world organizations which have been formed 1 Let us see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Strenuous reform efforts have been made by some people, with sincere desire to see the present order benefited and the moral standard of their fellow men improved. Many have been induced to thus lend their support, financial and otherwise, to such a cause as prohibition; but instead of accomplishing the desired result it has worked the other way. Instead of improving the moral conditions of the country, bootlegging lias been encouraged, and a general spirit of lawlessness has come as a consequence —to the lamentation of all concerned. A patch has been put on the wornout garment of civilization; but the entire cloth being so old, worn and rotten, it has dropped off and exposed other defects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">An Unholy Trinity</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THE present elements which govern the peo-J- pl© may be divided into three main groups —financial, political and religious. An examination of each of these phases reveals the same thing, that selfishness is at the bottom of each group, and therefore that every attempt at true reform is doomed to the same end, failure— a patch on a worn garment is of but short duration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">financial</span><span class="font4"> structure is based on the selfish desire of man to surpass his fellows in the attainment of wealth. Money is the measure of success of practically every venture, and it is for this reason that socialism has been unable to make much headway. The human being has been so deceived by the great adversary that self is ever* uppermost, and the glitter and gaudy display of that which money can buy is ever held before him as the worth-while things of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the effort to surpass, great corporations and combines have grown up and squeezed out the small competitor because of the increased efficiency of large scale production. They have oppressed, and yet at the same time have inadvertently made possible to the people many things which might not have been enjoyed otherwise under the present selfish arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Anti-trust laws and legislation have all failed in accomplishing the desired result, because money talks; and it is the great trusts which have the money. The selfish instincts of man have thus been played upon, incited and increased. It is for this reason that the apostle says, “The love of money is the root of all evil.” Instead of man’s having a heart filled with love for his fellow creature, this great god—money— has forced him into forgetting all this in the effort to satisfy his devilish craze to shine before his fellow men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">political</span><span class="font4"> phase of the present order is so obviously selfish that it scarcely needs any comment. National barriers have been erected, and smouldering race-hatreds have been fanned into flames by conniving politicians who have sought either personal gain or that of their constituents, to the detriment of mankind in general. Wars have been waged; and thousands, yea millions, of lives have been lost, because of the selfish political ambitions of a few. A New York merchant has well said that the first function of government is the protection of the rich, so closely are the financial and political interests connected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In spite of the fact that practically every person on earth desires peace and does not want to see war, yet the political system of government is so steeped in selfishness, distrust and intrigue that, strive as one might, the nations continue to march on in their preparations for future wars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Loud has been the talk of making the world free from militarism by disarmaments. Conference after conference has been held, and limitations placed upon the various nations. The populace has hailed each such effort as a possible means for the salvation of the world, but each has resulted in nothing—the various national representatives returning to their homes and the nations secretly continuing in their preparations for future and greater conflicts. Why? Because the entire political structure is one of selfishness, each man seeking to get the most he can for himself, each, business enterprise endeavoring to surpass its competitors and amass for itself huge profits, and each nation pitting itself against all others for the supremacy of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Turning now to a consideration ©f the re-</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ugions</span><span class="font4"> phase of our so-called civilization, what do we find! Surely here the appeal is that of love and unselfishness I If the Word of God, the Bible, were strictly followed by the clergy no other motive would dominate them. But instead of the high principles as set forth therein actuating the great religious system, the main motive is that of sdfirings, we® as in the other two factors of this ^orld which we have just considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Instead of the truth and love of God being their theme, the churches have sought to gain and maintain the financial support of the peoples by erroneously telling th wn that if they do not stand by the churches they will go to a place of eternal torture when they die, there to bake and boil, sizzle and fry, for ever and ever. Thus they have totally ignored the Scriptures, which plainly state that “there is no knowledge nor wisdom nor derice in the grave whither thou goest”, and that “the dead know not anything”. •—Ecclesiastes 9: 5, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Instead of “in honor preferring one another”, as the Scriptures teach, certain ecclesiastics have set themselves up as the leaders, claiming for themselves special titles and special deference. Instead of acting as servants to the people, as Jesus who “came not to be ministered unto but to minister®, they have demanded the attention, the money and the servitude of the people—-the pope of Borne, for example, who permits a favored few to see him in the Vatican and to kneel and kiss his toe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ecelesimtieal Depravity</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">INSTEAD of preaching the gospel of the king-* dom, the churches have launched off into a woik of “moral reform”, so that their appeal to the people is now confessedly one of selfishness. They say, “How would you like to live in a community where there is no church! ’ Indead of instructing the people concerning ibt love of Ghd and the message of His kingdom, the clergy have joined hands with the politicians and financiers to perpetuate the institutions of the Devil. They have preached the boys into the trenches, saying to them that if they died on the battlefield they would go straight to heaven; and now the Federation of Churches hails the League of Nations, which is clearly a device of the selfish financiers and politicians, as the “political expression of God’s kingdom on earth”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of uts, living in this land where we have become more or less accustomed to such things, sometimes fail to appreciate how totally foreign such, practices are to the principles set forth in the Bible. In so-called heathen lands, however, the errors of Christendom are more manifest, so much so in fact that the young Chinese have publicly expressed their views, reported in the press as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of all religion Christianity is the most detestable. Its greatest sin is its collusion with capitalism and militarism. Its influence is becoming stronger daily as force becomes triumphant and capitalistic methods become more drastic. Like imperialism and capitalism, Christianity is an enemy to mankind, the three having one object in common—namely, to exploit the weak countries. Realizing that China is an object of foreign exploitation, Christianity utilizes the opportunity to extend its influence. It is the intelligence officer of the capitalist and the hireling of the imperialistic countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How foreign these conditions are to the teachings of the Master! But the truth of these charges is difficult to deny; and since they do exist can we not see what would be the result if the Lord were only to bind the great deceiver, Satan, and then attempt to pour out upon the people the wonderful blessings promised tinder His kingdom? Instead of each nation seeking the Lord they would seek to gain, all for themselves. The various corporations and trusts would seek to obtain a monopoly on the various inventions that come to light, even as it is today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the present world arrangement were wiped out, then instead of the Lord’s kingdom being a blessing to the people, the very goodness of the Lord toward them would but bring about a condition even worse than it is today, wherein each nation would hate the other more and more because of the riches which it possessed, and each individual would be dissatisfied, because he did not have all that his neighbor possesses. The Lord sees that such would not do, and thus He has set forth in His Word that He shall not only destroy the power of the great invisible ruler, Satan, but that He shall also destroy his entire organization upon the earth along with, all its false standards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To further show His justice in the matter the Lord has granted the people, together with their rulers, an opportunity to learn of His purposes, to accept Christ as their King, to turn from their service of the unrighteous ruler Satan, even though they may have served him unknow* ingly, and thus be spared from the terrible de-j stru.cti.on which is to come upon the Devil’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cfarfefs Retom </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Begun</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE Scriptures show that the time for Christ to begin His reign was in 1914. Judge Rutherford in his latest book, called Deuvekanct, quotes the Scripture passages which show this, and gives abundant convincing proof of the fact. At that time the Devil’s organization was in full control of earth’s affairs. The command came to Jesus, as the new spiritual Ruler, to rule in the midst of His enemies. Revelation, 12th chapter, shows how His first great work was to cast the Devil out of the position which he had occupied in heaven, hurling him down to the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This same chapter also shows how the Devil has come in with great wrath, not against the world in general, for the world represents his kingdom, but against those who are faithfully representing the Lord. He comes in like a flood, says the prophet (Isaiah 59:19), and puts forth a mighty effort to muster all his forces together, preparatory for the final struggle against the Lord. But before the final battle takes place, as Jesus foretold in Matthew 24th chapter, a worldwide witness must be given concerning the establishment of the Lord’s kingdom, so that if the people would hail Him as King, and sever their allegiance with the unrighteous order of the Devil, they might be spared the suffering which the destruction of Satan’s empire will of necessity bring to those who adhere to it</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the Psalmist says, “Be wise now therefore, 0 ye kings [not crowned heads only but all those who are in a position of authority and rulership among the people, financially as well as pohtieally]: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.’’—-Psalm 2:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Year after year the message has been given that “the time is at hand”; but, as the Lord said, “as in the days of Noah, so shall it be in ths days of the presence of the Son of man.” The clergy and rulers have heeded not, but have kept the people in ignorance of God’s plan. Therefore, even as the Lord shows, all nations are heedlessly marching to Armageddon, which signifies the complete destruction of the cause of unrighteousness and the great triumph of the King of kings and Lord of lords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is in this great and final conflict that the Lord Jehovah shall make for Himself a name, which shall forever be remembered; for then He shall make a great demonstration to prove that He, and not the Devil nor his false idols, is God. He shall make known to the nations His great power, which is symbolized by His “arm”. Then shall be fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah 52:10, “The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this great and mighty struggle the people will be awakened to the realization that the present order of things is entirely unsatisfactory, that those things which the Devil has been holding before their eyes as the things really worth while are nothing but vanity, and that happiness comes only as one puts his faith and trust in the Almighty and seeks to please and serve Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Psalmist describes the present situation, in the 107th Psalm, verses 27 to 29: “They reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken mail, and are at their wit’s end. Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a ealm, so that the waves thereof are still.” Before the people themselves are ready to receive the blessings of the kingdom they must be in the right heart condition; they must seek the Lord in order to be the recipients of His favors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through this mighty demonstration of the Lord the hearts of men will be humbled, as the Prophet Zephaniah, in 3:11, foretells: “In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in toy pride; and. thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain for kingdom].” In verse 9 the Lord promises, “For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may call upon the name </span><span class="font5">of </span><span class="font4">the Lord, to serve'him with one consent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prices</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">S</span><span class="font4">ATAN having then been restrained of his power, and the hearts of the people turned to the true Jehovah, great will be the blessings which the righteous King, Christ Jesus, shall then begin to administer to the people. With righteousness instead of selfishness being the foundation, justice will be rendered, minus the corruption and fraud which mark many of the courts of today. In place of men of small capacity, with their own selfish interests at heart, ruling over the people, the Scriptures indicate that those old ancient worthies who demonstrated their loyalty and obedience to God in ages past, such as Moses, Samuel, David, etc., will be resurrected as perfect human beings right here on this earth, to direct its affairs.— Read Luke 13:23,29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“But,” yon say, <sup>£</sup>T thought that those ancient prophets are in heaven.® No, they are not. They are in their graves, awaiting resurrection. It is written that the heavenly phase of God’s kingdom is to be made up of those who have been faithful to the Lord sines the time of Jesus. Those Jiving prior to His time are to have thia earthly resurrection. “Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist; not-withstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.”— Matthew 11:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Under their able administration there will he no need to be fearful of one’s fellow mon; there will be no race hatreds and jealousies to plunge the human family into war and turmoil; for it is written, “They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not. lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war ar;” more.” Why? Because (Jhrist will then have destroyed the power of the Devil and will be reigning as the great Prince of Peace. ’Pho hearts of the people will be turned to the Lord rather than to their own attainments, even as it is written, <sup>C</sup>T will put my law' in their inward parts and write It in their hearts; and will bo their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more everyman his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord; for 1 will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sins no more.”-—Jeremiah 31:33, 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gradually, as the people come into harmony with the Lord’s righteous arrangements under the supervision of the ancient worthies, Abraham, David, Jacob, Noah and all the holy ones of old, mankind will begin to receive the long</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bought blessings of life, free from the aches and pains which so fill our present existence. The Prophet Isaiah says that then “the inhabitant shall no more say, I am sick”. With man’s efforts then being spent toward things constructive rather than destructive, great will be the progress, and wonderful will become the beauties of the earth. Concerning it the prophet foretells that the “desert shall blossom as the rose” and that the “parched ground shall become a pool” of water.—Isaiah 35; 1, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Divine Purpose</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font4">HE purpose of the reign of the great King of kings is to bring the world of mankind back to perfection, the same as that which was enjoyed by Adam in Eden before he fell, as is stated in Acts 3:19-21: “And he shall send Jesus Christ, . . . whom the heavens must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Christ’s great reign, the Scriptures say, is to last for a thousand years, until He has put all enemies under His feet; and the last enemy to be destroyed is to be death itself. At the end of Christ’s reign Satan is to be loosed for a little season, in order to grant the people an opportunity to make a final decision as to whether or not they choose to stand for ever on the Lord’s side. If their love for Him is supreme, then forever shall man enjoy the privileges of perfect life upon a perfect earth. If they choose the evil course, then with Satan they shall be destroyed in the second death, from which there is no resurrection. Then, throughout the endless ages to come, there will be nothing to mar the great harmony which will exist in God’s great realm; for it is written, “But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.”-—Numbers 14: 21.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark23"></a>The Most Wonderful little Boy That Ever Lived</span></h6>
<p><span class="font1">[Juvenile Bible story radiocast from WORD on a wave length of 275 meters by 0. D. Nicholson.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">E</span><span class="font4">VERY little baby is, of course, just the finest baby in the land; and no boy or girl would part with a baby brother or sister for millions and mil</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">li</span><span class="font4">ons of dollars. So it may be difficult for some of you to believe that there was ever a boy who was any nicer than the one that now lives at your own home with you. It is perfectly all right for you to feel just that way toward your little brother or sister, if you have one. But I am now going to tell you about a boy who really was different from all other little boys that have ever lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I suppose that all of you know that every little boy or girl is a gift from God. The Bible tells us so. It says that children are an heritage from the Lord, which means that God gives them to the man mid the woman whom we call their parents. When the time came for our Heavenly Father to give the little boy, of whom I am now speaking, to his parents, He sent an angel from heaven to tell the baby’s mother about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now, this little boy’s mother was a very nice, kind woman who loved the Lord and who studied the Scriptures and talked to God every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">She was not greatly surprised, apparently, when the angel came to tell her about the little baby which was to be given to her, although at first she was just a little bit afraid. But the angel assured her that she had nothing to fear because he had. come on a special mission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">First of all, he told her that God knew what a good woman she was and had noticed her devotion and love for Him, and that as a reward He would give to her the most wonderful gift in His power—a very special baby boy. Do you know who that little boy was? I suspect that all of you can guess His name. The angel was very specific about the little baby. He even told the good woman what she should name the child, and what He should do when He grew up to be a big man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The good woman was given to understand about the time the little boy would be sent to her, and of course she was very happy while engaged in making preparations for receiving the wonderful baby. In fact, I think she was happy all the time; because most good people are happy. The circumstances surrounding the birth of this particular little boy were very, very peculiar and most interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God sent the little boy to His parents while they were on a long journey, and when the baby arrived they did not have a nice bed or cradle in which He could sleep. The best arrangement they could make was to lay Him. in a manger, from which cattle and sheep eat hay and grain. This did not make any difference to the parents of the little babe, however; they were so glad and happy that God had sent Him to them that even a stable was better than a palace to them. All of us would be very much happier if we thought more of the wonderful blessings which God gives to us than of the little, petty things that happen every day to make us discontented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The night that this little baby was born, the most wonderful thing happened that anyone ever heard of before or since. God sent a whole company of angels from heaven to announce to the world that He had sent this little boy to the earth for a very special purpose. The angels were so happy after telling the shepherds on the plains near Bethlehem about the birth of the little boy that they sang a beautiful song.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do you sing when you are happy? I should like to have been one of those shepherds and to have heard that wonderful song. I know you enjoy good singing, and how much you would have enjoyed hearing those wonderful angels of God singing that peaceful night on the still, calm air, a song such as was never before heard by mortal earl It must have been beautiful!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And what was that song? &quot;“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men/’ It was just a short, simple song; but every word meant so much. It was a special message of hope, not alone for those shepherds but fpr all the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the first angel appeared to tell the shepherds about the birth of the little boy, they were afraid; but the angel assured them that they had nothing to fear from him, and continued by saying, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font4"> bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be unto all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David [or Bethlehem] a Saviour, which is Christ, the Lord.”—Luke 2:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now you know who the little baby was, do you not? Before the little baby was born Jehovah had told His parents that His name should be called Jesus; and when the angels came to announce His birth, they told them that He would be the Savior of the world and that His name would be Christ, the Lord. So, putting the two names together, we have His full name—the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There was never a better boy than Jesus; and He grew strong and chubby, and everybody loved Him. You know, all good people love good boys and girls. Jesus had many unusual experiences even while just a little child. His parents once had to flee with Him from the country, because a wicked king wanted to kill Him; but finally the old king died and they were able to return to their own country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus enjoyed hearing His mother tell Him about our Heavenly Father, and she often read the Scriptures to Him. He too learned to read when quite young, and His greatest pleasure was in learning more about God and His will and plans. Of course, Jesus’ mother had told Him about the angels coining to tell of His birth, and of their announcing it to the world through the shepherds in the fields at night time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He always had a great desire to help others. He liked to work with His daddy in the carpenter shop, and I am sure that as they worked together He asked Joseph (for that was His stepfather’s name) many questions about God; and He remembered the answers, too. When He was twelve years old Jesus knew so much about the Scriptures that He could ask questions which even the wisest men could not answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Time flow swiftly by, and Jesus grew up to be a wonderful man. He was strong and sturdy, and always kind and considerate of others. He continued His studies, and when He finally reached the full age of thirty years—manhood under the law—-He began to travel about the country, telling the people about God; and at the same time He did many wonderful works. He became not only the greatest man of His day, but to tlds present time there has never been another man in the world equal to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Never in all the thirty-three and one-half years of His life did Jesus commit any sin. Furthermore, He was pleasing to God at all times; and after He had finished His work here on earth. God raised Him up to His own right hand in heaven, and He has been there with Him ever since. Let us strive to live as Jesus lived and to do as He did, and our Heavenly Father will be pleased with us, also.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">70. Adam and Eve would have gone right on living to this day if they had obeyed the one simple rule which God gave them. As it was, they began to die the very minute that they broke that rule; and although Adam lived more than nine hundred years afterwards, still God regarded him as only a one-day-old baby; for He said, &quot;In the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">day</span><span class="font4"> that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">71. In another place in the Bible, God says: *A day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.” Now, that makes everything plain and clear, doesn’t it? God is bo great and infinite that a thousand years (a very long time to us) is only like a day to Him. So we see that though Adam lived 930 years he did not live quite one day (as God counts time) after he had been sentenced to 'death.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">If Adam Died, Why Should We?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">72. This is a very reasonable question to ask. Adam disobeyed God. God punished him with death. Adam died. There you have it. He had done wrong, and received his punishment. But why should everybody else in the world have to die? Ah, listen! Do you not remember that Adam and Eve were the father and the mother of everybody!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">73. This couple did not have any children while they were in the garden of Eden. God saw that it would be better so. But after they were chased out of the garden, and had been condemned to die, God sent them, several boys and girls, who grew up and had boys and girls of their own.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">74. There is a tiling which we call heredity, and which means that certain things which parents have belong to the children also. For example, if your father owns a piece of land or a house, it will belong to you when he dies, because you are his child; and you </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">inherit</span><span class="font4"> the right to own that land. And unless you sell th.® house or the land in the meantime, it will pass ©n to your children when you die, because </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">they </span><span class="font4">have the right to it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">75. Now we see how it is that everybody has to die. When Adam and Eve had theix* children, they were already beginning to die; so every child that has ever been bora, since that time, has begun to die from the time it was born.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">76. Although we grow up, and are strong and well, still we get old after a while and finally get weaker and weaker and die. This is because the same condemnation to death is on us that caused Adam and Eve to die. And why is it on us I Because we are their children, and we </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">inherit</span><span class="font4"> it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">What is Death?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">77. We have learned what life is—the wonderful gift of God. When God took life away from Adam, he died. When he di ed, his body crumbled into dust; and that was the end of Adam.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">78. Death is sad, and unpleasant to the friends of those who die; but the dead people themselves do not suffer after they are dead. The Bible tells us that “the dead know not anything”. When we stop breathing, then our heart stops, and our brains; and we stop thinking. In fact we stop altogether, like a clock that has run down, so that we are really nobody at all after we die.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Questions on Study Twelve</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<p><span class="font2">71. How old was Adam when he died, according to the way man keeps time? How old was he according to the way God keeps time?</span></p></li>

<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark27"></a>STUDIES IN THE “HARP OF GOD”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">B</span><span class="font1">With issue Number 60 we fc-egaa running Judge Rutherford’s new book, “The ATI Harp of God”, with accompanying questions, for use in individual or con- Sws gregational Bible Study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>614</sup> Death is a cruel enemy of the human race. Its sting has been felt for ages. It takes away beloved ones and leaves a burning dagger in the heart of the surviving friend. It has filled the earth with sadness, and the people with grief. But the sweet music from the Harp of God has cheered some sad hearts who have learned of the divine arrangement to restore their dear ones whom they have loved and lost awhile. By faith the Christian sees that in his own good time and way God will bring back their beloved dead and give them an opportunity for endless life and happiness, because He has promised thus to do. The Christian knows that God's promises are certain of fulfilment and that His power to perform is unlimited. Such faith, based upon the precious promises, helps now in a measure to allay the sting of death.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>615</sup> Besides the tossing billows of the mighty ocean one walks in silent meditation. Her mind turns to a beloved one who during the World War was taken away to serve in the navy. For a time he sailed the seas and returned, only to sicken and die, leaving behind a bleeding heart, which only time and the Lord can heal. As her feet silently tread the soft sands recently caressed by the waves, her mind is filled with thoughts of happy days spent with her beloved brother, whose laughter is now hushed in death and who sleeps in Jesus, waiting for the time of resurrection. The former joyful days were turned into sorrow because of death’s wicked hand. But the great Burden-Bearer lightens her load and helps her to bear her sorrow as there come to her mind the words spoken through his messenger; &quot;'Sorrow not as others, who have no hope; for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring by him. . . . Comfort one another with these words.”—-1 Thessalonians 4: 13,14,17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Gazing far out to sea, she observes a mighty ship being tossed by the power of the waves as though it were an empty shell. What marvelous power is thus displayed by those waves! Yet it is but a semblance of the power of God. He who made the great ocean and caused the moon to kiss its bosom at nightfall; He who hung the stars in the heavens, which serve to guide the weary and wave-tossed mariner in his stormy course, and who holds back the winds until he has reached his desired haven—Ho it is who is clothed with all power and authority in heaven and hi earth, and has promised to bring back the beloved dead from the grave. His promise He will faithfully keep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ Her meditations for a time sad, are now turned into silent joy because of the hope planted in that once troubled bosom by the precious promises of God. By faith she sees the blessed day, not far distant, when back to life shall come that beloved brother. By faith she sees him hurrying over the highway of holiness, until ha is made strong, vigorous, and returns to the days of his youth, and shall dwell in peace and happiness for ever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Lindbergh's Consumption of Fuel</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">L</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">indbergh’s consumption of fuel on his flight to Paris averaged 8.4 miles to the gallon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He left New York with 451 gallons and landed at Le Bourget with 17 gallons in the tank, enough to have carried him 200 miles further. This shows something of how narrow was the margin of safety, both for him and for Chamberlin and Levine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Lindbergh’s Snow Storm</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font8">HEN Colonel Llndbei„L went up Broad</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">way, New York shoveled him vitli such a volume of confetti and bits of paper that it required 110 motor trucks and 2,000 street cleaners to clear it up. The recovered bits of paper occupied a space of fifty thousand cubic feet, weighed 1,800 tons, and cost the city, for fathering, $16,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Elder Lindbergh</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE elder Lindbergh served ten. years as representative of the people of Minnesota in the United States Congress. While there he introduced a resolution in which he sought to have an investigation made of the Boman Catholic Houses of the Good Shepherd as they then existed in k'liwiesota and which he declared in a book were a disgrace to that state, to the United States and to civilization. The elder Lindbergh was as much a credit to L s country as the younger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Levines Finuneial Acuteness</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">N</span><span class="font8">OBODY but a ■member of Levine’s race would ever have thought of doing what he did before he sailed for Europe as the first airplane passenger. He addressed some two hundred letters to himself at various European cities, got a country postmaster to affix and cancel air mail stamps, and took the letters along with him in the Bellanca. These cancelled stamps are now worth $1,000 apiece to stamp collectors, so that Levine paid for his trip and made a fortune besides, though he may get into trouble with the government for unauthorized carrying of the mails. However, as the letters were addressed to himself, he has a plausible excuse. Theoretically, mail that is addressed to a person belong's to that person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Flight to the Persian Gulf</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">O</span><span class="font8">N THE same day that Captain Lindbergh flew from New York to Paris two British pilots flew from Lincolnshire, England, to a point on the Persian Gulf 3,400 miles distant. This great achievement ought not to pass unnoticed. The descent at 3,400 miles was made necessary by the exhaustion of fuel. The effort was made to reach Karachi, India, 760 miles farther on. The Chamberlin-Levine flight to Germany was considerably farther than either this flight or the 3,610 mile flight of Lindbergh. All of them were marvelous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Grandpa of All Airplanes</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">rpiIE German Professor Junkers has designed an airplane with a wing 240 feet from tip to tip which is intended to carry one hundred passengers and a crew of twelve. It is fitted with bedrooms, baggage rooms, smoking, drawing, reading, writing and wireless rooms, a kitchen, a pantry and cabins for the crew. In the diningroom. seventy two persons can be accommodated at one sitting. The one wing of the plane is forty feet wide and nine feet in depth. Four engines of 1,000 horsepower each will drive the machine 125 miles an hour for sixteen hours. The new plane is expected to be ready late this fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Gems from Mussolini’s Speech ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">F</span><span class="font8">ROM Mussolini’s speech outlining his plans for Italy, to which the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font8">gives ten and one-half columns, we quote a few interesting sentences. Mr. Mussolini says in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am convinced that, although a directing class is in formation and despite the ever-growing discipline of the people, I must take upon myself the task of governing the Italian nation from ten to fifteen years longer. It is necessary. My successor is not yet born. . . . Today, May 26, we solemnly bury the falsehood of universal democratic suffrage. . . . Fascist Italy is anti-democratic, anti-liberal, anti-Socialist, anti-Masonic. . . . Let nobody hope that after this speech he will see antiFascist newspapers appear again or that we shall permit anti-Fascist groups to form again. Never! . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Patting himself on the back for having engineered a good revolution instead of a bad one he gives a brief but terrible review ©f the French Revolution as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What terror was it that guillotined twenty heads on an average every day in the Place de la Madeleine? What terror was it that drowned thousands of persons in rivers, that cut the throats of thousands more in prisons, that guillotined a great chemist like Lavoisier and a great poet like Chenier, not to mention tens of jurists, and that destroyed whole regions and scattered death everywhere broadcast and spared neither young nor old, nor men nor women, nor children nor civilians, nor priests, and that had as its maxim that to carry out a good revolution it was necessary to cut many heads? Is it necessary for me to rehearse what that terror meant? No.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As to what he has in mind when Italy is strong enough he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We must at a given moment be able to mobilize 5,000,000 mem thoroughly armed, we must strengthen our navy, while aviation, in which I believe more than ever, must be on such a large scale and so powerful that the noise of its motors must surpass any other noise and the area of the wings of our airplanes must obscure the sun from our land. Thon, between 1935 and 1940, when we shall reach the crucial point in European history, we will be able to make our voice heard and see at last our rights acknowledged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Fascist labor charter provides an annual period of vacation with pay for each worker; preference in employment must be given to members of the Fascisti party; steps are being taken for the insurance of all classes against all kinds of disease. In many ways this greatest of tyrannies is accomplishing marvels. We looi on and wonder where it will end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, President Columbia University, says: “Fascism represent® an attack upon democratic theory much mor® formidable than the attack of Bolshevism; it 1» more subtle, more serious, more powerful, and more difficult to deal with by far.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are seven thousand Italian Fascisti in the United States, where on several occasions they have intimidated other Italians, ruined on® printing office, caused at least two riots and otherwise made themselves objectionable. Mussolini’s order is that Italians must remain Italians no matter in what land they live, even to the seventh generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Long Hours Versus Short Hours</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">MANUFACTURER of lamps had an output of 5,000 lamps per week. He wanted to reduce his output for a time and so shortened the plant hours from 50 to 44. To his surprise he found the production remained the same. The result was that he permanently shortened the hours of work in his factory and suffered no diminution of output.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">UNDREDS of girls are finding a new joy in life now that several of the women’s colleges are opening to them for two months in the summer, giving them opportunities to study astronomy, biology and zoology and some other subjects for which no special preliminary education is necessary. For seven weeks these poor girls have all the advantages of college life and their outlook on the world cannot fail to b® greatly broadened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Issuances of Injunctions Against Labor</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">N THE effort to prevent the issuance of unfair injunctions the American Federation of Labor in convention assembled have made a declaration insisting that that which is lawful when done by other persons shall not be unlawful when done by wage earners, either as individuals or in association. The Federation point® out that no injunction has ever yet been issued prohibiting a crime, and that injunctions in labor disputes should not be used to accomplish that for which there is no law, to prevent til® doing of that which is no crime.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270810_files/g_E_19270810-4.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ignorant Labor Is Costly Labor</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b. Winthrop Talbot, educator and social investigator, writing on the growth of illiteracy in Connecticut says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">America has long since learned its costly lesson that slave labor does not pay. The illiterate is a slave in chains of ignorance. lie is more liable to accident and disease. He learns more slowly, requires more supervision and instruction, and is easily swayed by unscrupulous outsiders. The comparatively slight saving in wage payments to ignorant laborers is more than offset by increased expense for accidents, illness, mistakes, misunderstandings, spoiled material, friction, irritation and that slowing down of production that goes with low intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Newspapers for Morons</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270810_files/g_E_19270810-5.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">HE growth of tabloid papers in New York, papers which are suited only to the infantile or moron mind, has stirred the journal </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Commerce and Finance</span><span class="font8"> to the remark that the millions who read the tabloid papers are not, after all, the people who direct public affairs, nor can they do so. The superior intelligence of those whose minds crave superior food enables them to retain their position of leadership, regardless of the numerical superiority of the morons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Man in America Before the Flood</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font8">ALL pictures discovered in Arizona by the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Doheny Scientific Expedition, under the direction of Samuel Hubbard, Curator of Archaeology of the Oakland, California, Museum, show an elephant attacking a large man standing in the water up to his knees. They also picture ibex and the dinosaur, the latter in an upright position. No ibex are now to be found in the western hemisphere, and the dinosaurs and all American elephants perished in the flood, so that it seems reasonable to hold that these wall writings or pictographs antedated that event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Negroes Grateful for Rescue</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font8"> NE GRO preacher, publisher of a little Mississippi paper styled </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Cotton Fanner, </span><span class="font8">writes feelingly of the rescue of the colored people by the whites when the levees about Clarksdale went down in the great Mississippi flood. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The white people, with but few exceptions, did nol flee to safety and leave us to perish. It required quick and intelligent work. The owners of the motorboats, from Clarksdale and other points, braved the raging waters to at were carrying a current almost equal to that of Niagara Falls, to’ reach Negro homes on the plantations and rescue them. The wiseacre Negroes of the North might as well stand and take notice, that tha good white people with their undying allegiance are our friends. Then, too, they have done something more than, talk. Had it not been for the white people many thousands of our race on the &quot;Scott Syndicate would have perished. They not only rescued their own &quot;niggers” but they rescued their &quot;’nigger” neighbors, some on their own homes and some on the plantations of other white landlords. The halt, the crippled and the blind were rescued; and, so far as we know, only three are unao-counted for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Mongol Invasion of America</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">N THE wall of a cave in Nevada there have been uncovered some ancient Chinese wall writings, identified immediately by a distinguished student of Oriental languages, Dr. John Endicott Gardner, of Berkeley, California, as the form of Chinese writing in general use about 1,500 years B. C. In this connection it is also of interest that in the gold rush of 1849 the remains of a Chinese junk were found in the Sacramento Valley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Real Rulers of the World</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">J</span><span class="font8"> A. Hobson, writing in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Foreign Affairs,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">* states what everybody is coming to see-&quot; more and more clearly, namely, that the real rulers of the world are the able international business men who utilize the machinery of government for procuring for them what they want in the way of markets, concessions, loans and labor. He adds:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mo-t national governments are so unpopular and international government so inchoate, that the normal attitude today is one almost of acquiescence in this strengthening of the capitalist grip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Court Establishes Right to Picket</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE New York Court of Appeals has decided that a labor union has the right to organize the unorganized and to use peaceful picketing as a means. As soon as this decision was announced forty strikers in the fur industry in New York City tried their new-found rights. Pinning labels on their breasts announcing that Lindbergh’s father was a friend of labor, they trmd picketing </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a few days before the Lindbergh </span><span class="font8">reception in the metropolis, with the result that the police landed the whole hunch in jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Little Fellows Stood the Cut</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">N HIS questioning of the officers of the Interborough Railway Company, Samuel Untermeyer brought out the interesting fact that just before the employes of that company submitted to the ten percent cut in wages in order to save the company from going into bankruptcy the </span><span class="font7">President and the General Counsel w»re granted such liberal raises of pay that when the ton percent cut came they were still alm ad of the game. The little fellows, the rank and file, were the ones that stood the cut. The big fellows not only did not suffer but actually profited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He.n&amp;eys </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Monkey with Matches</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font7">MAN in Neptune City, N. J., overly fond of pots, had as gnesis of his Lome two mon-ke.'-s which he kept in the kitchen. Ou an occasion recently he and his wife vent out and left the monkeys in chai go. Tn their absence the monkeys got hold of the matches, set the house afire, and although they were saved the house was burned to the ground.</span></p>

The Society whose premises were invaded has $50,000,000 to its credit in the Midland Bank, which amount it had expected to spend in Great Britain for British machinery and supplies. Much of this may now be spent elsewhere, and that is the net result of the raid made by these wise men. Also, the Russians now hate the British more than they did. That may be statesmanship, but it does not look like it from a distance. On the other side of the question there seems no doubt that the Russians have been and are provocative, and that their promises are no more to be trusted than are the promises of other diplomats.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">With, more than a million fresh, young, ardent Americans pressing forward into the battle the result was inevitable. America’s entrance into the war undoubtedly decided the war in favor of Great Britain, France and Italy. The tremendous superabundance of pent-up untapped nervous energy which America’s troops brought into the fray more than balanced the weakness of their allies, who were utterly exhausted. It was assuredly th® Americans who bore the heaviest brunt of the fighting on the whole battle front during the last few months of the war.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Madeira—The Gem of the Atlantic </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By a South African</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font8">HILE I was in Paris last year I received a cable to return to South Africa immediately. I went to the French airport to book an aeroplane ticket for London; but found that the French company had decided to take advantage ©f the strike in England, and were holding up the stranded tourists in Paris by deliberately doubling the fare from 700 to 1400 francs. Refusing to acquiesce to this profiteering and, after telling them what I thought of them, I went to The Imperial Airways, Ltd. (an 'English company) and happily found that they were still carrying passengers at the original rate of 800 francs, which at that time was equivalent to S5-10-0 English money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The following morning I checked out from the Hotel Edward VII in Paris and, after a pleasant Charabanc ride of about half an hour, arrived </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">at Le </span><span class="font8">Bourget Aerodrome. After going through the customs and declaring that I had no higher sum than £45 on me (if I had the customs tvould have levied a special tax), I boarded, the waiting aeroplane which, by the way, was under orders to hasten to London to fetch the Prince </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">Wales and his suite to Paris on account of the English strike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This particular machine was a large biplane with a spread of about fifty feet between the two wing tips. The body in the centre housed ths passenger cabin, which contained two rows ©f armchairs, alongside of which was a row ©f windows, through which the passengers could watch the scenery. Above the armchairs were nickle-plated cylinders containing cotton-wool for the passengers to put into their ears to deaden the noise and to prevent dizziness on ac-sount of change of altitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The machine had two engines; each containing twelve cylinders and, I believe, of about 450 h. p. Our luggage was carefully distributed to balance the aeroplane, the engines were then started to buzzing, our two pilots were at their posts, and we were now ready to leave the earth. By law every aeroplane carrying passengers must carry-two pilots, for service in case of one of them getting sick, and also that the one not actually operating the machine may act as observer, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Riding on the Air</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE signal was now given, and with a roar we shot into the air. Soon we had reached 3,000 ft., which later on was increased to 4,000 ft., and the speed was accelerated to 100 miles per hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Strange to say, neither the speed nor the height seemed to be noticed by the passengers; and the sensation was a soothing one, as we were literally riding on the air. Going upward is a delightful sensation; but when the machine drops into an “air pocket”, which, however, was on a very few occasions, the sensation was most peculiar. The whole of one’s insides then seem to rise, one finds Lis mouth automatically opening, and there is an instant tightening of the muscles, waiting for the drop to stop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The scenery was magnificent. The whole of France and England seemed to be under intense cultivation; and with the many irregular hedges and fences, odd-shaped pieces of green, numerous forests, ploughed fields, winding canals, and the many narrow, twisting white roads looking Ijke ribbons, it gave the whole country the appearance of a patch-work or a jazz pull-over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We passed two other aeroplanes going the opposite way, looking for all the world like two big birds. Finally we were dver the English Channel, which was another delightful sensa-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">tion; and our aeroplane seemed to ride the air over the water as smoothly as a ball on the surface of a halliard table, probably because of the absence of the undulations which are on the land surface, and which cause frequent changes in the air currents. In due time we arrived at Croydon field, from whence we were motored to London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">From London to South Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">U</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">PON</span><span class="font8"> inquiry at the London office of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Union Castle Company I found that the steamer “Grantully Castle”, upon which I had booked to sail for South Africa, had been cancelled, owing to the firemen’s refusing to work consequent to the British coal strike. But, fortunately, I was able to book on the “Kildonan Castle”, which left on May 7th; but we had to go from London to Southampton by motor, on account of no railv ay trains running during that period of the strike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On May 11th the “Kildonan Castle” arrived at Madeira, one of the large group of islands in the Atlantic Ocean. This island belongs to the Portuguese, and rises from the sea to a height of over 3.000 ft. The residential portion of Funchal, the township, is a very pretty sight from the ship's deck: most of the houses are standing by themselves, set in green patches of vegetation, and mostly covered with red-tiled roofs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On landing at Madeira the first thing I noticed was the absence of sand, the beach being composed of large pebbles. The landing stage was a very small, primitive affair; and the streets of Funchal are exceedingly narrow, tortuous and paved with cobbles; while the shops are extremely old-fashioned and odd in shape, size and appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I was surprised to find that most of the business men, though Portuguese, spoke fluent English and were very quick to ask profiteering prices when tourists appeared on the scene. Most of the buildings, business and private, were plain looking, poorly constructed and single story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In some of the open spaces there were avenues of trees covered with a most beautiful heliotrope foliage, presenting a very picturesque sight. Most of the traffic seemed to represent the two extremes; there were the latest models of English and American motor-cars and also very primitive bullorfc-drawn sledges. Those of the latter which were used for passenger transport, were very ornamental, having covered tops and side curtains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Regarding the people of Madeira: The majority were of a swarthy complexion, poor in physical development and awkward in deportment. The impression one gathered from their faces, both young and old, was that their fight for existence was a hard and precarious one; hardly a solitary handsome man or pretty woman was met with in the whole island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The most attractive item on the island is th® Mountain Rack Railway. It works on the Swiss system, of a steam-engine operating a central cog-driving wheel which engages in a rack rail lying between the two outer rails. The track runs from the outskirts of the town and winds its way through most picturesque scenery 1W the mountainside for over 3.000 ft., and every inch of the way provides a constantly changing, interesting view. As the train mounted higher, little Portuguese children were constantly running alongside throwing into the passenger carriage bunches of beautiful flowers and crying out for money; and the conductor was continually driving them off witli a stick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Alongside the line, on both sides, was a continual stream of little houses, each one set in highly cultivated patches of ground, containing tomatoes, grapevines, figs, sugar-cane, apricots, cabbages, beans, loquats, banana-palms, and most beautiful flowers, with little rivulets running down carefully arranged channels to supply water to each .little property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Where Farms Are “Built”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">T WAS wonderful to see the ingenious way in which the properties or little farms of Madeira were literally built into the mountainside. Every few yards a solid, high retaining stone wall had been built to hold the soil from being washed down the mountain, thus giving the appearance of a continual series of steps or terraced gardens. A tropical aspect was given to the scenery by many beautiful tall ferns, palms, cactus, sugarcane, bananas, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After half an hour’s climb we arrived at the top of the mountain, to find a most modem hotel, fitted with electric lights, ball-room, all modem equipment, and surrounded by beautifully arranged terraced gardens. At this hotel we had an excellent breakfast, and then prepared to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The return journey was a most unique, thrilling and exhilarating one, consisting of a toboggan slide down a winding chute for a distance of about three miles. The toboggan consisted of a wicker-basket with a seat for two, mounted on wooden runners, controlled by two Portuguese guides, with two ropes attached to the front of the toboggan. The chute itself was about six feet wide, build in shallow steps of cobbles. The smooth running of the toboggan was a surprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We went through forests, along the edges of precipices, through lovely gardens with many tortuous turns and corners, which provided all the thrills we wanted. Alongside the chute ran a gurgling little stream in which we occasionally saw women washing clothes; and now and then appeared the usual old beggar, with everready hat held out for a few coppers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">About two-thirds of th® way down we suddenly found ourselves stopped outside a wine shop, the proprietor of which came out and politely informed us that the guides were thirsty and wanted their tips with which to get some wine. And at the same time we were pestered with a dozen little boys and old beggars, all wanting pennies. From here the chute continued in th® form of back lanes and narrow streets till we got to the Mountain Railway Station, where we were put into a motor and driven to the </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">landin</span><span class="font8">g stage, ready for embarkation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On arrival at the steamer “Kildonan Castle” we found numerous small boys in bathing costumes, inviting the passengers to throw money into the sea. Then the boys would dive overboard and catch the coins before they reached the bottom. Madeira is an ideal place in which to enjoy a pleasant holiday. Its quaint attractions will linger in the mind for many days to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was quite obvious that the Portuguese inhabitants are under the control of the Roman Catholic Church; and the haggard, depressed, worn look on the people’s faces will no doubt quickly disappear when they know the truth about the Lord’s plan, and experience the blessings of restitution and the release from the yoke of the Devil’s organization.</span></p>

ALL THE FOOD WAS COOKED IN BRAND NEW ALUMINUM WARE.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Beaders of Th® Goldew Age who have paid attention to the articles of Dr. C. T.

<p><span class="font8">There is a reason for this. Every hardware store, and plenty of other stores, sells aluminum ware. Every newspaper advertises it It is like the straw hat bunk. It is no good, and plenty of people know it very well, but it is a part and parcel of our civilization. And moreover soma of our ‘“best” people have money in aluminum corporations. Therefore any “health authority”' would consider it extremely inadvisable, from the point of view of holding his job, of incurring the ill-will of merchants, newspapermen, stockholders and other beneficiaries to even admit, much less proclaim, the self-evidestd; truth that here is a proven ease of aluminum poisoning.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Missing Links </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Fred’k Scruton {England)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font8">CCORDING to the theory of spontaneous generation adopted by Dr. Haeckel the following stages must be passed through by.carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen and possibly sulphur and phosphorus, in order to form protoplasm, the physical basis of all life on this planet.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. The chemical elements must come together in their proper proportions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">2. They must then form the requisite chemical combinations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">3. They must form themselves into reticular textures, characteristic of protoplasm.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">4. Then the substance must form itself into a cell with a nucleus.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">How is this highly complicated series of operations performed without the assistance of intelligence? The answer to this question is an important link which is still “missing” in the chain of the evolutionists. It is missing link No. 1. Prof. Drummond quotes Huxley as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I know nothing, and never hope to know anything, of the steps by which the passage from molecular movement to states of consciousness is effected.—“Ascent of Man,” page 158.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The theory of evolution cannot account for the production of organs in living organisms. Darwin does not discuss this matter. Perhaps this is only a little link; and he, together with others, thought the chain could get along quite nicely without it. However, we include it here as another missing link.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Evolutionists are unable to account for the origin of paternal or maternal instincts, nor for the origin of consciousness. No one, not even Darwin, seems to know where these important missing links have gotten to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As yet no theory has satisfactorily explained the mystery of the production of a young an-mal out of an old one. No light has been thrown upon the question, What is the formative power which causes the whole process of gestation? The first living creatures which appeared on earth must have been already provided with means of producing creatures like themselves; otherwise at their death all life would have ceased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is almost impossible to conceive how the first rudiments of important organs could have been of any use; or how, if they were not of any use, they could have been preserved for further development by natural selection. But the evolutionist does not worry himself by making any such effort of imagination. He just shuts his eyes and carries on, until he finally comes to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">link that happens not to be one of the missing variety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The evolutionist cannot account for the absence of hair from the human back—the only case of its kind among mammals. Yet admittedly man is an animal, and one which easily may be stroked the wrong way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Prof. William Bateson, the highest authority on genetics, in his “Problems of Genetics” says that we must recognize our almost entire ignorance of the process of evolution. As president of the British Association in 1914, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Darwin speaks no more with philosophical authority. Knowledge of heredity has so reacted on our own conceptions of variations that very competent men are even denying that variation in the old sense is a genuine occurrence at all. The appearance of contemporary variation proves to be an illusion. Every theory of evolution must be such as to accord with the facts of physics and chemistry, a primary necessity to which our predecessors paid small heed. Of the physics and chemistry of life we know next to nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Scriptures stand for ever grandly inviolate and true, pointing the way to deliverance. Let us hold them firmly, while the evolutionists do a little more link hunting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Origin of Idolatry </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By 0. L. Rosenkrans, Jr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font8"> VIEW of the late Pastor Russell’s was that heathen mythology had its tap-root in vague and distorted traditions of the nephilim, those superhuman offspring of fallen angels and the daughters of men who suffered extinction in the flood. Of course such old-fashioned ideas are pooh-poohed by latter-day scholarship, and studiously ignored in our standard textbooks on mythology. According to the latter, polytheism represents one of a series of stops in the religious evolution of humanity—a step onward in the halting progress of the finite mind toward attainment of infinite comprehension!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, all scholarship is not in agreement on this theory of religious evolution, some considering sun-worship to represent the primitive belief from which has ramified the numerous religions of mankind. Certain it is that sunworship has had in its day a world-wide distribution, evidences of it disclosing themselves in India, China, Babylon, Egypt, Greece, Rome, among the Celtic and German nations, in Mexico and Peru, and elsewhere. Where direct adoration of the solar orb is absent, often indubitable traces remain of the concomitant phallic and serpent-worship. Almost universally, indeed, sex-worship is found as a phase of deification of the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In antique mythologies the symbols of sun, sex, and serpent are commonly interchangeable. Thus, the phallus is equivalent to the sun or fire emblem, variations of the symbol being a bull, stallion, torch, pine cone, or any tall tree. Throughout the world we find this symbol erected in obelisks, pagodas, minarets, the May Poles of our ancestors, the mysterious Bound Towers of Ireland, the menhirs of Cornwall and Brittany, and, disagreeable as the thought may be &quot;to some, m the cathedral spires and steeples of church edifices, which are recognized to be but conventionalizations of the phallic emblems which stood beside the doors of ancient heathen temples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since Luna is the female complement of the sun, her symbol is substituted by the negative attributes of his, such as waler, a cow, a mare, the date palm; also by a fish, dolphin, crescent, inverted triangle, ring, oval, ship, fountain, pomegranate, archway, cavern, rose or fig. The lotus is the characteristic female symbol, perpetuated by church ceremonial in the Eastw lily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the Hellenic mysteries and sacred festivals, the phallus, the egg and the serpent were carried in a basket. The first article typified the sun, the active generative power in nature; th® second, the moon, the passive fecund principle; the third, that mysterious force which acts to unite the first two, perpetually renewing lif® through its destruction. Pagan philosophy may have intentionally personified in the serpent those actinic properties of the sunbeam which promote germination and growth ever in correlation to decay and death. Apollo’s arrows become the serpent of zEseulapius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The widespread prevalence of sun-worship in antiquity is not difficult for even the modern mind to account for, since the solar orb is the source of terrestrial energy. But sun-worship becomes even more comprehensible when we assume that a canopy overshadowed the earih before the deluge; attended by a system of nature economy radically divergent from the present. Postdiluvian times witnessed an u’mr revolutionizing of the entire scheme of nature economy, ushering in such startling transformations in every aspect of nature as to leave indelible impressions on the imaginations of Noah and his family, and their seed after them, instilling in their minds the profoundest sense of the stupendous importance of solar phenomena and of the intimate relationship of solar-activity to every phase of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The annual cycle of the seasons, the diurnal intermittancy of light and darkness, the roseate flush of dawn, the splendors of the sunset, the waxing and waning of the moon, the apparent rotation of the starry sphere, the wind, the rain, thunder and lightning, the rainbow, all trite and commonplace to us through immemorial association, yet to the eight persons who emerged from the ark were strange and unfamiliar sights. Very soon they learned their owm absolute dependence on tire sun whose multifarious activities they were being continually reminded pervaded all nature, the whole of existence being inextricably involved therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When mankind went astray into false religion, sun-worship seemed the logical course to follow. Hence an elaborate polytheism was formulated, •with personifications of the manifold aspects of solar-activity. The fructifying agency of the sun-bearer suggested sex-worship as a subsidiary feature. The first liar found a place for himself as the mediator between life and death in the false hope of immortality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nevertheless, in spite of its solar basis, another element may have contributed to make up the characters of the heathen pantheon—the old gods may have been composite creations, partly solar, partly composed of vague recollections of the mundane antediluvian gods, the hybrid progeny of women and angel&quot;<sup>3</sup>, themselves perished but translated by hmrar ancy into pseudo-immortality in the sides, to reign invisibly as they had formerly regulated human affairs in the flesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The superhuman slrenirth and cunning of the nephilim, their remorselessness and aloofness from human sympathies and weaknesses, their transcending intelligence--all these qualities had inve-T.<sup>1</sup> them uitt- d.o attributes of dreaded terrestrial demi-gods, ineffaneably registering themselves on the consciouciiess of primitive humanity. Shadowy traditions of the nophdim lincored on after the flood, identified eventually as incarnations of the solar functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In seeming’ corroboration of this view we find in the Koran or so-called Mohammedan Bible, in the sura or chapter entitled &quot;'&quot;Noah&quot;, an account of how the reprobate antediluvians flouted the warnings of that worthy prophet, and contumaciously persisted in rendering homage to Wadd, Sava, Yaghuth, Tank and Nasr. These names are elsewhere given as those of eminent personages whose statues were reverenced at first with merely a civil honor, until time inSen-idly pm veiled the rite into an idolatrous ©ne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One legend relates that the image of Sawa, overthrown during the cataclysm and left lying Wider water for some time after the final subsidence, at length, had its whereabouts revealed by Eblis (Satan) to the inhabitants of Hodhail city. The latter established it as their tutelary god, and the idol urns made the center of pilgrimages from far and near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In other instances the Devil assisted idolmakers to sculpture faithful portrait effigies of these defunct antediluvian notables, which were deliberately calculated to ensnare the nations Into idolatry. It is said that in former times there stood in the city of Bamiyan, near Kabul,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">two huge idols, fifty cubits in height, representing Yaghuth and Yank. These were hollow inside, for the convenience of issuing secret oracles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Arabians are a very ancient nation, one of the earliest of historic mention. Their language is reputed to have originated at the Confusion of Tongues. Hence their traditions are not without value to the antiquarian, though many of these traditions obviously have been plagiarized from the Jewish and Christian Scriptures. The western Arabs were cousins to the Hebrews, revering Abraham as their common ancestor. The Koran relates that Mohammed when he took Mecca demolished in the Kaaba statues of Abraham and Ishmael, to vhich the tribe of Koreish accorded divine homo s. The image of Abraham was chiselled out of red jasper, having one golden hand holding spxen featherless arrows, such as the Arabs use for divination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even the Arabs of pre-Islami te days, during the “State of Ignorance” held many traditions in common with the Jews and Christians. Their religion at that time was Saheanism, or worship of the heavenly bodies, whoi’ein abode, as they imagined, angelic intelligences who exercised dominion over the earth as the divine deputies. Their sacred scriptures contained our “Book of Job”, besides their own spurious writings, which included a &quot;Book of Seth”. Seth and his sons, Enoch and Sabi, were acknowledged by the ancient A^ahs as tlm founders of their faith; so they made pilgrimages </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font8"> the reputed sepulchre of Seth at Mecca, and to the alleged tombs of liis sons in the pyramids of Gizeh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TAe </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Koran and Its Origin</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TOOLATRY is abhorrent to Islam, the taboo J- against “graven images” being extended to include statues and pictures of any animate object. The “prophet” Mohammed announced as the chief ends of his mission, to purge the world of idolatry and restore the unity of God. Arabian paganism in his day had already been greatly modified by the infiltration of Jewish and Christian ideas, and Jewish and Christian colonies were scattered here and there, especially along the western coast But it was the leaven of a corrupted Judaism and Christianity which was modifying the Arabian paganism. The Arabs were becoming familiarized, not with the pure doctrine of the Old Testament and the Gospels, but with the spurious accretions of the Talmud and the Apocryphal books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It wa^from the latter chiefly that Mohammed, in the seventh century, compiled his &quot;bible”. He possessed acumen sufficient to reject trinitarian-ism, though he endorsed hell-fire as a fundamental article of faith.. Islam, indeed, began as a reform of the grossly corrupt and controversy-distracted eastern church, with its saint and image-worship and associated mariolatry — so integral a factor in Nicene orthodoxy that the virgin was accepted as the “complement of the trinity, itself incomplete without her”. One heretical sect, the Marianites, went so far as to include Mary in the trinity; another, the Col-lyridians, worshiped her as the First Cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mohammedanism recognizes a true religion as distinguished from the many varieties of paganism. Mohammed is held by his followers to be the last of a succession of true prophets, including Adam, Seth, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David and Jesus, each one of whom has served in his day as God’s mouthpiece, the recipient of a divine message to mankind, even as expressed in the divinely-inspired Scriptures. Mohammedans believe that, in all, these Scriptures comprised 104 books, the major part of which have been lost, no authentic books surviving except those included in the Pentateuch, Psalms, Gospels and Koran. The last named, called “the Seal of the Prophets”, closes the divine revelations, they contend. They say that all the prophets enumerated above professed Islam, the “one true, indivisible, immutable religion”, but that the Jews and Christians have lost sight of this, and that their existing copies of the Scriptures are corrupted and unreliable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mohammedans comprehend themselves together with, the Jews and Christians, as the “people of the Book”, in contradistinction to the idolaters who place no reliance on any part of the sacred writings. They revere Jesus as a true Prophet and Apostle of God, but deny that He is the propitiation for our sins. They expect the Second Advent to occur as a prelude to the Resurrection, when Christ will destroy antiChrist, and then lie and Jewish adherents will reign for forty years over the earth—an era of unexampled peace and plenty, interrupted only by an inroad of Gog and Magog. But Christ will die once more before the Beast arises out of the ground to stamp in the forehead believers and infidels, separating them one from another, preparatory to the cool, odoriferous wind which will blow away every soul which retains even as little faith as a grain of mustard seed, with the Koran itself, leaving the world immersed in a night of ignorance and perplexity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But we have not space for a dissertation on the tenets of Islam, nor to discuss its grotesque jumbling together and misapplication of the Ezekielian and Apocalyptic prophecies referring to the last days. Suffice to notice that Gabriel blows three blasts on his trumpet, the first one spreading terror over all the earth, the beasts running together and milling around in a mighty concourse, and humankind pretermitting its usual business to mourn. The second blast will extinguish the material universe, with all life, including angels and demons. Gabriel will puff out his own candle, as it were, and must be recreated by a special act of God before he can blow the third blast, of Resurrection. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">More discerning, however, in one respect than Augustinian orthodoxy, the Koran recognizes a 1000 year duration for the Judgment Day; though, it is true that a contradictory text states it as 50,000! This discrepancy the learned imaums and mullalis have been puzzled to reconcile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The age which produced the camel-driver of Medina had forgotten even the rudimentary advances in science of the golden age of Hellenic thought. It had relapsed wholly into theological superstition, entertaining the most childish notions concerning natural laws. No other material was available for Mohammed to hew out his clumsy hammer from wherewith to demolish idolatry, except the rock of anile superstition which a decrepit and apostate church had been quarrying to reconstruct remodelled temples of Helios, disguised as Christian basilicas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The eagle-eyed son of the desert scornfully rejected the three-in-one and denounced as idolatrous the sacred images and pictures; his iconoclastic spirit yearned to purify the sanctuary for the one true God. Inadvertently he became the tool of the god of this world, who personified himself in Allah, as the incarnation of despotic arbitrary caprice in lieu of the divine attributes of justice and mercy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Rome’s Grip Upon Germany </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By E. Winterhalder</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE papal politicians are again hard at work at the present time to get a still tighter grip upon Germany, a work they started right after the close of the war, There is a tremendous battle going on, about which for the most part the public as yet is not informed. The little, however, that has become generally known is sufficient to illuminate as by a searchlight the entire situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The essence of the matter dates back to 1925, when the Catholic clericals succeeded in making a so-called concordat with Bavaria. This arrangement was only possible because the Roman See used its entire unparalleled cunning, and because the Bavarian Lutheran State Church for the sake of entirely temporal and earthlv financial gains assented to it, for Roman clericalism had only one-third of the votes in the diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Famous professors and teachers of constitutional law, amongst them Professor S. G. Anschuetz at the university of Heidelberg, university professor Dr. K. Rothenbuecher, Munich, and the Bavarian university professor Dr. R. Piloty, Wuerzburg, prove that article 5 of the concordat is a direct violation of th® constitution of the empire. But up to this day the entire concordat is yet in full force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every concordat is an entirely one-sided affair, but the Bavarian concordat is actually something new<sup>T</sup> in its one-sided aspect, since the pope obtains by means of it unheard-of financial and ideal concessions, the like of which can only be found in the dark ages. Let us consider here just a few’ things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The authority over the school, for centuries tenaciously fought for and gained by the state, has been turned over again to the church; the school has again been placed under the control of Jesuitism. The import of such a state of affairs to the country can only be seen by one w’ho on the basis of the history of civilization since the beginning of the dark ages know’s the final outcome of clerical school politics. It actually means to systematically render the masses stupid. I have given the evidence of this on the basis of incontestable historically proven facts in a booklet, “The Concordat; Germany’s Step Back to the Dark Ages.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the Bavarian concordat was only the beginning; now the other states, especially the empire itself, are to follow. The Papal See diplomacy is feverishly at work; it has sent th® Nuncio Paeelli, who effected the Bavarian concordat, to Berlin. The entire policy of the central party (Catholic) has stood for years under this influence, and has been endeavoring to promote a concordat with the empire. The confused internal political conditions are advantageous to help this move along, and Mr. Paeelli is verj; skilful in taking advantage of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Catholic central party in Germany is, in every government party coalition, the balancing factor, because no other party has without it a majority. At the present time this party has entered into an agreement with the conservative factions, and obtained in advance concessions with reference to a concordat; although one of these parties, the German people’s party, was always anticlerical. The latter party especially represents the great industrial interests; the clerical central party represents a part of the farmers and workmen. In order to make the German people’s party accessible to their wishes, the central party sacrifices the interests of their voters, a move that became especially apparent during the last Reichstag (house of representatives in Germany) debates, with reference to the treaty of commerce with France. The speaker for the central party, while debating this question, could not in the least cope ’with the loud interruptions referring to this matter, and the defense was weak and not at all convincing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ultramontan’sm (nanal polities) does not care in the least for the vital interests of its voters, when the interests of papal world dominion are to be promoted. The German people, sorely tried by foreign and domestic complies Hons and economical distress, are to serve as a reservoir to revive the decreasing influence of the Itoman church. The impoverished German people are to give to a madly ambitious and arrogant hierarchy the financial and moral foundation to pursue exactly these world power tendencies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The immense increase of religious orders and of the purchase of real estate by the clergy since the war, often under the pretext of relief for the poor (for instance on the part of the Karitas Society) are all serving this one purpose. The papacy operates especially just now along the same line as it did a thousand years ago, i. e., to establish instead of the Kingdom of Peace of Jesus Christ the papal kingdom, called God’s kingdom </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(T reuga Dei).</span><span class="font8"> All these efforts are nothing else but a new edition of the Augustinian “kingdom of God’’, whose operation during the dark ages horrifies the world even at the present day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Borne has for the second time the effrontery to establish of its own sovereign authority the kingdom of God, a wcik that God has expressly reserved to His Son; and this is done in face of the fact that the first attempt was such a wretched defeat that it may be designated as a distinct judgment of God. If public opinion and the people do net at the last hour trice a decisive stand against the concordat, its formation cannot be prevented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Are net concordat and church-plan, successfully carved out?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A Righteous Government Foreshadowed </span><span class="font4">[Radiocast from Station WBBR by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font8">ITHOUT a question of a doubt the Scriptures show that it is God’s purpose to establish a righteous government on earth for the benefit of man. He has promised it and He will bring it to pass. Before He establishes that righteous government, however, He teaches the people important lessons. Every time the people fall under the oppressive rulership of Satan and his earthly representatives and God rescues them that fact furnishes proof that God is the true Friend of man. The people must come to know that Satan is their enemy and that their help comes only from Jehovah. When this lesson is learned the people will appreciate God’s righteous government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The loving kindness, the long suffering and patience of Jehovah, are marvelous in our eyes. His perfect wisdom enables Him to know just what is the proper time to establish His righteous government. Long ago He began to make pictures foreshadowing His organization through which the people will be blessed. He organized the Israelites into a nation and gave to them a code of perfect laws. The fact that the Jews did not keep that law is no evidence that it was not perfect. What He did for them was not so much for their benefit alone but to teach lessons to all people to love righteousness and hate iniquity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An organization is a systematic arrangement of creatures or parties to carry into operation a fixed plan of action. “Known unto God are all his works, from the beginning of the world.” (Acts 15:18) Having a fixed plan of action from the beginning God of course would have a systematic arrangement of His creatures for the carrying of that plan into operation. (1 Corinthians 14:40) The very creation of God testifies that He does everything in order and with proper organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;The heavens declare the glory of God: and the firmament sheweth his handywoik. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun.”—Psalm 19:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Order is one of the hardest lessons for creatures to learn. A deflection from God’s way is displeasing to Him. Deflections of the human race are usually caused by weakness and by being overreached by others. A wilful and deliberate going contrary to the Lord’s appointed way is treason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Humility means to be submissive to God and to follow Ilis appointed ways. Humility is the very opposite of pride. “Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.” (Proverbs 16:18) God pushes the proud away from Him, and shows His favor only to the humbleminded. (1 Peter 5:5) He who joyfully conforms Himself to the way of God proves Ilis love for God. (1 John 5: 3) We may be absolutely certain that the All-wise God has one v a\ for carrying into action His plan. It would be inconsistent for Him to have divers ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It has ever bemi the policy of the Devil to induce men to believe that they have a sufficient amount of initiative and wisdom to make their own arrangement, and to carry it out without reference to the Word of God. Those who follow such a course come to grief. “Great peace have they which love thy [God’s] law: and nothing shall offend them.” (Psalm 119:165) Nor shall they be turned away from God’s organization and plan of action. If they love the Lord’s way and joyfully seek to do it they will trust Him implicitly, and thus doing will enjoy the peace of God that passeth the understanding of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The evidence is overwhelming and absolutely conclusive that God has a plan. Man must learn God’s systematic method of organization for carrying Ilis plan into operation. This is what we are studying this morning. Man should not spend all of his time in trying to learn if God has a plan. That should be easily understood. Man should devote himself to ascertaining how God is carrying out His plan, and then get himself in exact harmony with God’s way and joyfully follow therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From the time of Eden until the overthrow of Egypt the great lesson God was impressing upon the minds ot His willing and obedient ones was that the Lord is the Almighty God, in whom are vested wisdom, justice, love and power, in equal and exact balance. He selected the descendants of Jacob, otherwise called Israel, and organized that people into a nation in further-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ance of His own fixed plan. The first lesson that He taught the Israelites was that the Lord is God. For their benefit He got Himself a name when He overcame the Egyptians and overthrew iheir false gods. The lessons given Israel were </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font8"> their benefit and for those who should follow thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Shadow of Things to Come</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">SHADOW is a reflected image, as from a mirror or from the clear surface of still water. It is the representation of something real. The word type is sometimes used in a similar sense. It is a figure or representation of something to come. God’s dealing with the nation of Israel, and particularly in the law which He gave to that people, was to foreshadow better things coming later. As the Apostle Paul puts it: “Which are a shadow of things to come” (Colossi ans 2:17), and “For the law, having a shadow of good things to come”—Hebrews 10:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Referring then to the experiences of Israel the record is: “Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.” (1 Corinthians 10:11) Based upon these and corroborative scriptures the conclusion is reached that the nation of Israel, organized by the Lord, was His typical organization and foreshadowed something better to follow in God’s due time. For this reason the Lord’s dealings with Israel hold the greatest interest to all who desire life and who would know God’s way of leading men to life and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The beginning of God’s typical organization was Abraham, who was first called Abram. He •was the grandfather of Jacob, afterwards called Israel. He is known as “the father of the faithful”. He was counted a righteous man and the friend of God. As a man he was imperfect, of course, being one of the descendants of Adam; but his heart was right and he believed on and served God, and therefore his faith was counted for righteousness.—Romans 4:9, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Abram resided with his father Terah in Ur of the Chaldees. Only two generations had passed since Adam’s death, and by tradition Abram would learn of Adam’s wrongful course. He would learn about Abel, and also how God rewarded the faith of Enoch. He would learn, too, that it was the faith of Noah that caused God to save him from the flood and to use him to again begin to people the earth. The young </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">man </span><span class="font8">Abram chose the way of faith and trust in th® Lord God. (Genesis 12:1-3) In obedience to God’s command Abram left the land of his nativity and journeyed to the strange land then occupied by the Canaanites and hence known as the land of Canaan. (Genesis 12:6) Then Abram journeyed on to the south part of th® country. There was a famine in that land, and Abram went on down into Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To Abram Go’d had made the promise that h® should have a seed, and that through him and his seed the blessings of all the families of th® earth should come. The Devil hated that seed. (Genesis 3:15) Doubtless he knew of the promise made to Abram. He therefore began to devise a scheme to have the wife of Abram debauched by Pharaoh, one of Satan’s own servants, and thus compel God to either accept this unholy offspring as the seed or else repudiate His own word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan so arranged it that the princes of Pharaoh would see the beautiful wife of Abram, and then go to Pharaoh and commend her to the king who, to gratify his lust, would be an easy tool to carry out the Devil’s scheme. ( Genesis 12:15-17) Accordingly Pharaoh had Sarah, the beautiful wife of Abram, brought into his palace, intending to gratify himself. But th® Lord God protected Abram and Sarah by bringing great plagues upon the house of Pharaoh; and the king, becoming alarmed, sent Sarah away undefiled. Thus failed another wicked scheme of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Abram then returned to the land of Canaan, and God again made promise to him that he should have that land for himself and for hi» seed after him. (Genesis 13:15) When Abram was ninety-nine years old God appeared unto him and said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I am the Almighty God: walk before me, and be thou perfect. . . . Neither shall thy naw any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, and I will give unto the^ and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.” ►—Genesis 17:1, 5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ever on the alert to thwart the purposes of the Lord, again Satan made an attempt to have Sarah, the wife of Abraham, debauched that the promised seed might be defiled. Again God thwarted the wicked one’s purpose.—Genesis 20:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Sarah had passed the time according to women, and Abraham was one hundred years old, God overruled these seemingly unfavorable conditions and caused Sarah to conceive and bear a son; and he was named Isaac. The Lord made the promise then to Abraham: “In Isaac shall thy seed be called.” (Genesis 21:1, 12) That Isaac foreshadowed “the seed of promise” through whom the blessings must come to mankind is clearly stated by the divine record.— See Galatians 3:8,16; 4: 22-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A Living Picture</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A T THIS point God made a living picture which foreshadowed the unfolding of a part of His plan. In this picture Abraham was used to represent God, while Isaac was used to represent the only begotten and beloved Son of God, who was afterwards called by the name Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Abraham’s offering of Isaac upon the altar foreshadowed that the Son of God would be offered as a great sacrifice to provide a sin offering for the benefit of the world, to the end that in God’s due time the peoples of the earth might be delivered from the enemy, from his wicked influence and from his wrongful acts • which had brought death upon the human race. Abraham did not understand what the picture meant. With him it was purely a matter of faith. God commanded him what to do and that he did. It was a test of Abraham’s faith, but he bravely met the test and God rewarded his faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In making this picture the Lord God directed Abraham to take Isaac, his only son, whom he loved dearly and in whom he had all of his hopes centered, and to go to Mount Moriah and there offer up his son as a burnt offering. Because God had told Abraham that “in Isaac shall thy seed be called” and that the blessings shall some through him, this was a crucial test to offer up as a sacrifice this only son. In obedience to the Lord’s command Abraham provided wood for th® altar, fire, and a knife; and with this provision he and his son journeyed to Mount Moriah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Abraham built the altar, laid the wood in order, bound his son Isaac and laid him upon the altar upon the wood, and then stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son. In another instant the knife would fall and his son would be dead. God’s purpose here was to test and prove Abraham’s faith. Having met the test the Lord God arrested the hand that would have slain the son. The record reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me. And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him. up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord; for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son; that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed: because thou hast obeyed my voice.” (Genesis 22:11-18) The shadow made by this picture was afterwards carried out in every particular.—John 3:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Afterwards Rebecca became the wife of Isaac, and Rebecca was barren. Then Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife, and Rebecca conceived. Twin sons were bom and were named Esau and Jacob. God made it clear that Jacob should succeed to the promise, and that through him should the seed for the blessing of mankind come. Satan, alert to acts of wickedness and following his usual course, devised, % scheme to have Esau kill his brother (Genesis 27:42, 43) Jacob fled into ths land al</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">While Jacob slept the Lord appeared unto unto him in a dream and said to him: “I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places, whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of/’—Genesis 28:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was this same Jacob whose son Joseph was sold into Egypt and later became the ruler of that laud, and gave a witness in the name of the Lord God. It was this same Jacob who was the father of the great multitude of Israelites whom God miraculously delivered from Egypt. From that day to this God caused a eham of events to picture and foreshadow the gradual unfolding of His great plan, pointing to the Savior of the world who shall deliver from the enemy and from his wicked influence every one of the human race who will show faithfulness unto God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jacob had twelve sons, and they became the heads of the twelve tribes or divisions of the nation of Israel. Jacob grew old, and the time rame for him to die. He called before him his sons and, his mind being moved upon by the invisible power of God, he uttered this great prophecy: “The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.”—Genesis 49:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sceptre means the right to rule. The lawgiver means one who shall guide the people in the way that they shall go, who shall shield and protect them and teach them the way to life. Shiloh means the Messiah, or great Deliverer. “Unto Mm shall the gathering of the people be/’ Thus fee Lord God caused a prophecy to be uttered fey Jacob, foretelling the coming of Him who would undo the evil work of the Devil and who </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">irould du aho that </span><span class="font8">which Lucifer should have <a name="bookmark20"></a></span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>done when he was perfect, before iniquity was found in him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Law Covenant</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font8">E LEFT the children of Israel standing safe upon the eastern shores of the Red Sea, singing a song of deliverance from Egypt (Exodus 15:1-21) Three months later they </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font8">in the desert land of Sinai. Moses, whom </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font8">had used as their deliverer from Egypt, went up into the mountain; and there the Lord God said unto him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob', and tell the children of Israel: ¥e have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bar® you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself. Now therefore, if ye will obey my voicerin-deed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine. And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto th® children of Israel. And Moses came, and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him. And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord.’’—Exodus 19: 3-S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the third day thereafter God confirmed the Law Covenant which He had made with Israel in Egypt at the time of the passover; and now Jie gave to them specific laws vhich should be their guide, amongst which is the following?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“And God spake all these words, saying, I am the Lord thy God, which have brought the® out of the land of Egypt; out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon ths children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; and shewing mercy unte thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. Thou shalt not take the nam® of the Lord thy God in vain; for th.® Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh. his nam® ia vain.”—-Exodus 20sl-T.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Purpose</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“OMPHASIS is here laid upon the point that</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God provided by this covenant, and the law thereof, that the people should have no other gods beside Him; that they should make no graven images, and should not bow down to them nor serve them. What was the moving cause for this law? Was it because Jehovah feared that His adversary His disloyal son the Devil, would get the worship to which He, the Lord, was entitled? Was it selfishness on the part of God that moved Him thus to provide by the law that there should be no other gods? No! None of these reasons is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Devil has made many men believe that it was selfishness that induced Jehovah to act, but this is not true. God had already demonstrated His unlimited power and His ability to destroy the creatures of heaven and earth, including Satan the Devil, whensoever He might desire. It is impossible for God to fear. Then why did He make this provision, in the law?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord God knew that the insatiable desire of Satan was, and is, that he might have the worship of other creatures. He knew that if the people followed after Satan they would be led into wickedness and must die. Surely the great flood and the destruction of the Egyptians were sufficient to prove this to all reasonable creatures. “As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked.” — Ezekiel 33:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The delight of the Lord was not in the destruction of the evil ones. He would teach an all-important lesson to His intelligent creatures. He would have the people believe and understand that the one way that- leads to life and happiness is by doing good, and that none can do good ’who are out of harmony with the great Eternal Good One. The love of God for mankind provided the Law Covenant, and particularly the command that the Israelites should have no other gods beside Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God's dignity would preclude Him. from commanding any creature to worship Him merely for God’s own good. He owed the human race nothing. Strictly adhering to justice God would have wiped the human race completely out of existence, but His love for man led H</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">i</span><span class="font8">m to make a plan for man’s deliverance; and having made it He win carry it out</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The reason therefore for th© Law Covenant with Israel may be summed up as follow** (a)] It was made for the good of the people, and a* a schoolmaster to lead them in the right way until the coming of the Redeemer; (b) to prove to the people and to all mankind that no on* can get the blessings of life by his own efforts j and (c) to prove the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">necessity</span><span class="font8"> of a great Redeemer, Mediator and Deliverer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For forty years God led the children of Israel through the wilderness before they were permitted to enter into the land of Canaan. During that period they had. opportunities to learn many lessons. Their experiences in the wilderness, under the leadership of Moses, were typical.; foreshadowing the experiences of Christians who follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus during the wilderness period of the Christians on earth, during which time the Gentiles have been in power, ruling under the supervision of the god of this world, to wit, Satan the Devil. (2 Corinthians 4: 3, 4) At the end of that period of forty years the Israelites entered into Canaan, now Palestine, and there the Lord continued to deal with them and use them to make shadows of better things to come pertaining to His kingdom and His manner of bringing deliverance and blessings to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom of Israel</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">N DUE course God permitted the Israelites to have a king. Saul was anointed as the first king of that people. After a brief reign he was commanded by the Lord to go and destroy the Amalekites, one of the representative tribes of the Devil’s arrangement. The Amalekites had opposed God’s chosen people when they were marching to Canaan. The Devil had induced them so to do and used them for that purpose. Their wickedness had now come to the full.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Saul failed and refused to carry out the instructions of the Lord, although he pretended to do so. Because of his disobedience he was rejected from being king. Samuel, the prophet, speaking as the mouthpiece of the Lord, said unto Saul: “Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord<sub>g</sub> he hath also rejected thee from being king.” Samuel 15:22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font8"> Being rejected of the Lord Saul thereafter-wards sought solace and comfort at the hands of the Devil, by communing with the Devil’s colleagues, the evil spirits. (1 Samuel 28: 6-11) Saul’s experience represents and foreshadows that of the nominal, or so-called Christian, churches. As deebred by the Prophet Jeremiah, God planted the church a noble vine, and today we see it degenerated into a strange vine of the earth.—Jeremiah 2:21-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The so-called Christian churches, the systems, have forsaken the Lord and have joined hands with the Devil; and now they seek solace at his hand by communing with the evil spirits. These systems are confusing the people, as their name Babylon indicates. They have mixed with all the nations and rulers of the earth and have made them drunken with their false doctrines. Concerning them it is written: &quot;Babylon the great is fallen, . . . and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.” -—Revelation 18:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These wricked systems, like their prototype, parade before the people in the name of the Lord to mislead the people. But God has rejected them even as He rejected Saul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">David succeeded Saul as king. David means beloved, and foreshadows those who love the Lord and who are faithful to Him. The Devil sought in every way possible to kill David, be- &quot;&nbsp;cause he was faithful to God. David was not a perfect man, yet it is written that God called him “a man after mine own heart”. (Acts 13: 22) This was because of David’s faithfulness to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Whenever David, because of weakness, had committed a wrong he was quick to confess it to God and to ask forgiveness; and under all circumstances he faithfully represented the Lord. He foreshadowed the true Christians, fighting the good fight of faith and refusing to in any manner compromise with the Devil or any part of the Devil’s organization. After David came the peaceable and glorious reign of Solomon, which foreshadowed the peaceable and glorious reign of the great Prince of Peace, the Christ in glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God’s dealing with Israel over a long period of time was also to use that people as witnesses for Him. Many times Israel was unfaithful fo the Lord and turned away from Him, and times she cried unto Him and He heard the ery and delivered her out of the hands of her ea-emies. These experiences foreshadow how ft# Lord, in the exercise of His loving kindness will in due time deliver all the human race that call, upon His name and serve Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Zion</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ION is the name of God’s organization. Any part of that organization is properly callee!</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270810_files/g_E_19270810-8.png" alt="" style="width:13pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">Zion. When Israel was in harmony with Godg and when they were the people of God, that na» tion was a part of God’s organization, and therefore called Zion. Wh-n Israel was carried away captive to Babylon, and her people were asked to sing a song of Zion, they wept when they; remembered Zion and recalled how blessed wer® that people when they were a part of God’s c-r-ganization and obeyed Him.—Psalm 137:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people of Israel, organized into a nation and entered into a covenant with God, wer® typical of the true Zion which God has choses as His dwelling place and out of which H® . shines. (Psalm 132:13; 50:2) Of course th® enemy Satan has always opposed Zion. He corrupted the chosen people of God from time to time by inducing them to 'worship devils and to turn away from the true God. Being in a covenant with God and departing therefrom to worship idols was an illicit relationship with th® evil ones. This the Lord denounced as harlotry; with other gods, and for this He punished them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Similar conditions exist on earth today. Ther® are many organizations called churches that claim to be in relationship with God and to worship Him. At the same time these form a part of the Devil’s organization, because such cob-stitute the religious element of this world. Fog this reason God has cast them away from His favor. Within these organizations, however, are many good people who love the Lord. Thee® are in fact prisoners. If these prisoners wiU forsake the unrighteous organizations of ehurdi systems and turn themselves wholly to the Lord He will bless them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the ecclesiastical systems of the present' time the leaders are arrogant. They assum® great piety and speak with absolute authority<sub>g </sub>They misrepresent the Lord and His 'trutii.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They oppress the people who do not concur with them. God has promised that their arrogance shall be brought low, because the time is here for the Lord God to establish His righteous government and reward righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The organization of the people of Israel and God’s dealing with them foreshadowed the organization of His true people who faithfully ©bey Him. The casting away of Israel foreshadowed the casting away of Christendom, so-called, represented in the present denominational systems. A few of the Israelites were faithful and accepted Christ as King. A small number of Christians on earth faithfully adhere and give their allegiance to Christ the great King. He will establish God’s righteous government, and that He is now proceeding to do. But before He does so He will rebuke the arrogance of those who claim to represent Him and who do not represent Him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">[Radioeast from Station WBBR on a wave length of 256.3 meters by F. W. Franz.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font8">HAT boy or girl does not like to think of growing up? From the time children are gti.lt very young, and yet old enough to notice big people and what they do, little folks try to imitate grown ups. They hear or read stories aboy t grown-up people who made great names for themselves or who did wonderful things. It gets them to dreaming about the golden time coming when they, too, will be grown up and not be under the thumb of other grown ups, but when they can be independent (as they call it) and do wonderful things and be somebody great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now I do not know whether any of you boys and. girls want to be something great like a circus clown, er a liontamer, or a cowboy, or a policeman, or a street-car conduefor, or a schoolteacher, or an opera ringer, or a radio operator, when you get big; but I’m sure you want to grow up and be something. Not very many children are like little Peter Pan in the storybook, the boy who never wanted to grow up to be a man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">It is Good to Gnm Up</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270810_files/g_E_19270810-9.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">OW I must say, my dear little friends, that while it is pleasant to be a child and to have all the joys and pleasures and also the freedom that go with childhood, it is much better to be a grown up, especially if one is the kind of man or woman that God looks well upon. For if one knows the truth about God and does the things that God likes, he could not be better off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course, there are many wonderful things to which grown ups can take a liking; but, after all, the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">best</span><span class="font8"> thing you can go after is to learn about God and live and do and act so as to please Him. Being a liontamer, or a cowgirl, or a musician, is nothing to be compared to being good friends with God; and I hope to show you why tonight. Of course, very few grown-up people as yet know that this is so, and they still have this much to learn. If they did know it and lived by what they know, this earth would now be a happier place on which to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is perfectly all right for you to want to become big and of age. God never intended for little children always to remain small and for ever needing the care and attention of their parents. He wants them to grow up. “Oh,” you break in on me, “suppose I do not live long enough!” Don’t you worry; you will have the chance to grow up and enjoy all the privileges of a grown up anyhow. “Where? In heaven?” you ask. No' but in a new world on this earth. “Whew!” you whistle. “How can that ever be?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now tell me, Willie, or Mary, or whatever your name might be, you are not anxious to go to heaven, are you? You do not dream about going there, do you? Maybe when you used to go to Sunday school kindergarten the teacher taught you to sing:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I want to be an angel, and with the angel® stand; A crown upon my forehead, a harp within my hand.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You used to like to sing that, but do you really feel that way about it now? I believe you would enjoy riding a bicycle or playing with dolls more than parading around with a heavy crown on your head and picking at a harp. Do you know that God never intended children or even men and women to be angels? He wants them to be real men and women on this earth forever. Being a goody-goody does not make a person An angel, any more than meowing like your feousecat would make you a cat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">JPftaf </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">the Angel» Are and Are Not</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font8">T IS true that God’s angels are good and pur® and clean, but the word angel means messenger and the angels of heaven are God’s messen-rsrs.. Whether they have wings I do not know;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">have looked it up in the Bible and it nowhere ■ays that angels have wings. Because angels travel through the sky we think they have to have wings, and painters have painted pictures of them like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But heavenly angels are not people who once lived on this earth and who died and went to heaven and grew long hair like a woman and grew a pair of wings like a bird. Not at all 1 Heavenly angels are different kinds of beings altogether from us. We do not surely know v hat they look like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Angels used to show themselves to men and women long ago, but to make themselves seen they always had to clothe themselves with a human body just as you would put a dress or suit of clothes on you. When they had given their message, then these angels did away with such human bodies somehow or other, just as if the body had melted away into the air. They could not be seen after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible is the only book that can tell us the truth about angels. In the 8th Psalm, th® 4th and 5th verses, it tells us which is higher, the angels or men. It says: “What is man that thou [God] art mindful of him? . . . For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels.&quot; Now just as a man or a woman or even a child is a higher kind of creature, by that I mean a better kind of creature, than a horse, or an elephant, or a giraffe, or a camel, so is an angel higher than man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And you know there are no baby angels. “There aren’t!” you exclaim. No, because Jesus, and He came down from heaven, tells us that the angels neither marry nor do they give one another in marriage; and so they do not have a nursery for angel babies up in heaven; neither do they have papa and mamma angels up there raising and bringing up baby angels. Heaven is not noisy because of squalling, crying, fretting baby angels. We would have to believe some funny things if w<sup>r</sup>e believed there were babies in heaven, wouldn’t we ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">What Would You Like to Be?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">N</span><span class="font8">OW to talk about human beings again: Like what human being does God want </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">boys and </span><span class="font8">girls to grow up to be? The Bible </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">alone gives </span><span class="font8">the right answer; it says, Like Jesus. I know that many preachers tell the people more about the great men and women of the world than of Jesus or of God. They tell of teachers, generals, big government men, and men with lots of money. Very few of them will tell you to ba like Jesus; but I am not here </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">to say</span><span class="font8"> what mon want me to say, but what God tells us in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many teachers will tell you that kings and queens and generals and rich men were great; but for all that Goo. has made Jesus the greatest person in all heaven and earth next to Himself. If then yon copy Jesus you will he following the best Pattern that will bring you the best and biggest reward, and you will also be honoring God. Jesus always honored God, and nobody in heaven or on earth could do better than Jesus did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Aim at Perfection</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270810_files/g_E_19270810-10.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">NY person that thinks right will tell you. that if you want to copy anything, you should copy that which is perfect. When Jesus was on earth, He was a perfect man. He never did wrong in anything that He said or did or even thought* and He always pleased God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Do you know that there was only one other perfect man on earth besides Jesus ? That other perfect human being was Adam. Adam never had to grow up. God made him a man right away; and He made Eve, who was Adam’s wife, a woman right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That does not mean that Adam and Eve never had to learn anything. They had much to learn; and it was because they did not want to wait for God to teach them but wanted to get ahead of God and find out for themselves by eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, that they got into trouble and got all of us into trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So then, which perfect man do you believe that we should copy, Jesus or Adam? “Jesus,” you answer. That is right; for Adam is dead today because of his wrongdoing in disobeying God, who made him. As for Jesus: Yes, He died too, but it was wicked men. who did not love God who put Jesus to death because Jesus loved and obeyed God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some of these wicked men were priests and preachers and Sabbath-school teachers, some of them were soldiers and government men or politicians, and some of them were very rich; but that did not make them great, did it? No! but where are they today? Dead! And do you think they will be great when they come back from the grave? Surely not! The Bible says so. They will be ashamed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“But,” you ask, “isn’t it hard to copy Jesus now?” Yes, it is! None of us have a chance to grow up right, try as hard as we might. But do not think that Jesus did not have a hard time, too. He did, because He lived in the same world that we do and had the same things to put up with that we do. But Jesus was born perfect, and so when He vanted to do the right thing He could do it because He did not have sins in Him, as we have. In ilm new world on this earth, things will he much different from now for the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World on</span><span class="font8"> an </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Old One</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270810_files/g_E_19270810-11.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">NEW world on this earth! Did you ever hear of that before? ‘How tunny!’ you gay. “If it is going to be the same earth tliat w live on, will it not be the same- world’’’ No! hut God tells us there is really going to be a new world on this same old earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Have you ever heard that sajing, “The world to come&quot; ? Now that does not mean some other world that you have to leave this ear*h to go to; but it is a world that i« coming, and that is coming right here to this earth. Maj he you still 'do not understand, and so I’ll explain some mom</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How would you like this earth on which ue live to be burned up in a big fire, and even the sun and the moon and the stars to catch fire and bum up? Some people believe that this is going to happen, and that is what they call the end of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Hie world.</span><span class="font8"> They do not to think that the sun is on lire already and that the heat from its fire is what keeps us varm dovui here on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They think that the Bible word “world’’ means the ground, the earth: and that the end of the world means the end of the earth by a great fire in which all bad people will be burned up. That is a terrible teaching, isn’t it? I remember how afraid I was as a boy of the end of the world. When many grown ups were ascared that the the end of the world was very near, I was frightened, too; and I tried to live oh! so good, thinking I would go to heaven if the earth should be burned up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">ne World That fe Ending</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270810_files/g_E_19270810-12.png" alt="" style="width:16pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">EALLY though, you boys and girls and all of us can be glad that the world is coming to an end; for it means that all these bad, hard times and wicked things that we now have and everybody has had since Adam did wrong are going to pass away, and that the best times we have ever had on earth are going to come in and come to stay for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible tells us that the world that is coming will never pass away. In the Bible the word “world” means this: I am going to use a big word, but I’ll explain it to you. Here is the word: “Organization.” All the people on earth are in an oiganization, and this organization is under the most wicked person in heaven or earth, and that per-mn is the Devil. Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now you know what rulers are, don’t you? You know, in jour owi Lome your parents are, and lliey should be, the rulers. You have to mind them in the home. So also you live in a city, or a town, or a county, and in a state; and yon know that cities, towns, counties, and states have what wo might call rulers, and if you don’t look out the policeman will get you!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All these rulers are under still higher rulers vho live in the city of Washington, the capital of the United States. These rulers at Washington, I). C., are called the government of the United States. They are expected to look out for the good of the people and to see that ail things are done decently and orderly in this land. That is x\hy we say that all the people in the United States are organized; that is, they are lined up under a form of government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Chinese World</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270810_files/g_E_19270810-13.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">AVE you ever seen a Chinamen ? Some of you have not. In the large cities you generally see them in the Chinese laundry shops or in chop-suey houses. You can tell them at once! They look different from what we Americans do. Their skin is rather yellow, and I remember the time when Chinamen used to wear their hair in a long braid down their backs. We boys nicknamed these “pigtails”, and thought we had great sport in making fun of these pigtails. But really we were not polite. Nowadays the Chinamen who come to this country cut these hair “pigtails” off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now suppose we were taking a trip to China about thirty years ago. We would be surprised at how differently everything looked or was done. The houses would look odd. The men would be wearing their hair long in a queue and also be wearing dresses, while the women would be wearing their hair cut short and would be wearing pants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If we visited the schools we would find that the children studied their lessons out loud and the whole schoolroom would be full of jabbering and noise. If’ the teacher saw any child keeping quiet, he would think that the child was not studying the lesson and would punish him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If we visited the graveyards we would see Chinamen putting, no, not a bunch of beautiful flowers but a bowl of rice on top of the graves; and we would see the pigtails of dead Chinamen sticking up out of the ground, because many Chinamen are buried standing up. On the rivers we would see Chinamen rowing their boats, sitting face forward to the front of the boat instead of facing the rear end of the boat as we do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We would not see churches with tall steeples, but would see tall, lanky buildings, some as high as thirteen stories, called pagodas. We would see statues—we call them idols—here and there ©ver the land; and people bowing<sup>-</sup> down to these statues and praying to them and giving gifts to them. And the Chinese music, oh! we would think they played on such unusual instruments and would hardly think it was music at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There would be so many things different from our way of living ahd doing that we would say in great surprise: “Why, I’m in a different world altogether!” You would no! mean that you were no longer on the same earth of which the United States is a part, would you! No; you would simply mean that you were in a place where things weie different from what you were used to. And wh\ were they different! Because the land of China had a different organization over them than we do: that is, they had a different government, a different crowd of rulers whose minds thought differently than ours do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The God of this World</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HERE are many different countries on this earth, such as England, France, Germany, Spain, Mexico, Russia, Japan, India; and they all have different rulers. So you see the people ev&lt; rywhTc are organized under rulers or gov-&lt; i-n, .... m 3<sub>u</sub>t <sub>a</sub>]j <sub>o</sub>f these governments or rulers are under the rule and control of someone still higher up, and that one is invisible to us; that is, we cannot see him because he is a spirit being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus called him “the prince of this world”, and one of Jesus’ pupils by the name of Paul called him “the god of this world”. Who do you suppose he is? God? No! Jesus? No! Up in heaven, where God rules and His will is done, the beings are not sick and dying like here on this earth. They are not sometimes going hungry and without clothes to wear; neither are they doing such bad things that make others so much trouble and pain and crying and sadness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So you see the unseen ruler of this world must be a wicked one. “Oh. I know!” you cry out, “it’s the Devil, Satan.” That is right. Jesus and Paul were speaking about the Devil when they called him “the prince of this world” and “the god of this world”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The 4th chapter of Matthew’s gospel, and also of Luke’s gospel, tell how the Devil tried to tempt Jesus to do wrong; and how the Devil said that he owned and ruled over all the governments and kingdoms of this world. That is why this world, or way of running things and of ruling the people, is so bad and the people have to suffer. That is why the Apostle Paul called this wicked time “this present evil world”. He did not mean that the ground or the earth was evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now do you understand what the Bible means by using that word “world”? “I believe I do,” you say. “It means the way the people are organized or kept under our earthly rulers, and all of these rulers are under the higher rulership of an unseen powerful being, and the unseen ruler of this world is the Devil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The End of the Evil World</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">()\V</span><span class="font8"> you can understand what the pupils of Jesus wanted to know when they asked</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270810_files/g_E_19270810-14.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">Him about the end of the world. They were not afraid that some day the earth w’as to be burned up by a monstrous fire, and that maybe the fire would start when they were asleep in bed. If Jesus’ pupils studied the Bible hard, they must have known that the Bible says that “the earth abideth for ever”. In the book of Ecclesiastes,' chapter 1, verse 4, it says that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What they wanted to know was when the Devil and all the wicked and imperfect rulers of earth would be put out of business, and when the new and better world would be brought to the people. When the old world ends, the new world begins. Some of you may live, without dying, to see that new world fully come in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But why will it be a new world? Because there will be a new unseen, heavenly ruler. You know who He is—Jesus. The Bible calls him &quot;the Prince of Peace”. In the book of Revelation, chapter 20, Jesus tells us how He will eateh hold of the Devil and bind him and throw him into prison where he cannot do anyone any ham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus will also take away these present kinds of governments and their rulers, the best as well the worst of them. Of course, that means trouble; and do you know that is why we have been having so much trouble and upset on the earth lately, and all the rulers are having a hard time?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The prophets, and Jesus too, told us all about the troubles, wars, sicknesses, earthquakes, and other things that have come to us since 1914; and Jesus said that these things happening would be signs to tell us that the old, wicked world was ending and that Jesus was here unseen to bring the people a new and perfect world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible also gives us hope that very soon the Devil will be tied up fast and that all the rulers on earth will have so much and so great &amp;&nbsp;trouble that they will not be able to hold on to ruling the people any longer. Jesus will not let them rule anymore because either they do wrong to the people or else they are not able to give the people what they want and what they need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You know what the people want: They want to be altogether well, without aches and pains and sicknesses; they want to have the right things to eat and wear and enough of them; they want to have good homes and good rulers; they want no more wars; they want peace and to be happy for ever with those they love; they want to live on a beautiful earth; and best of all, deep down in their hearts, they want to know the real truth about God and about Jesus and to serve them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ftat iAeiVew </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">World Will Be Like</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">rpHESE! are just the things that the Bible **• tolls us that Jesus will bring to the people, and that is why He will bring a new world to this earth. Instead of the kind of rulers and kings that we now have, Jesus will raise up from the dead the good men and women who loved God and served Him, and who died before Jesus lived on earth. Some of these good people will be Enoch, Noah, .Abraham, David, Moses, and others that the Bible tells us about. Jesus will male® them the princes over the people. They will be good and perfect rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus will also make this earth like a beautiful garden, a Paradise. Then instead of funerals’ being held and digging graves and burying people, and the newspapers telling that Mister So-and-so and Mrs. So-and-so have died, they will tell how Jesus has called people back from the grave and given them back to their friends and relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then the little babies and boys and girls who did not have a chance to grow up will be waked up from their sleep in the graves. They will be brought back to their parents and then they will have the best chance they have ever had to be raised up right and to grow up to be good and perfect men and women under Jesus, the new King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then instead of people growing wrinkled and worn out the longer they live, losing their teeth, and their hair and their good eyesight and their good hearing, and at last dying and being buried, they will really grow young again, if they are good and obey Jesus; and in time they will become just like Jesus was when He was thirty years old. They will stay well and strong and fresh and good-looking. The Bible says their flesh will be fresher than the flesh of you boys and girls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The New World at the</span><span class="font7"> Door</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270810_files/g_E_19270810-15.png" alt="" style="width:12pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">INCE the things are happening today that Jesus told us about, we know that we ar® right at the very doorstep of the new world, the world to come. We are moving into the new world. If you try to learn about God in the Bible and try to please Him, you may never die, but move right on into the new world fully and then never have to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Think of keeping on living to see these good times come in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font8"> Think, too, of growing up in the new world on earth! Doesn’t it make you feel like throwing your hat up into the air and shouting out, &quot;Hurrah”? Doesn’t it make you want to love God more?</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">[A juvenile Bible story radioeast from Station WORD on a wave length of 275 meters by 0. D. Nicholson.J</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font8">HEN Moses went to the palace of Pharaoh to live he pursued his studies until he was about forty years old. Moses still loved his own Eople, the Israelites* and very much regretted e great injustice that was being done to them in keeping them slaves to the Egyptians. He went out on an inspection tour one day and saw ®ne of the Egyptian taskmasters treating a Hebrew in a shameful, unmerciful manner, and it to enraged Moses that he killed the Egyptian,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In order to escape the wrath of Pharaoh, Moses fled to the land of the Midianitcs. Moses soon fell in love with Jethro’s daughter, Zip-porah, and they were married.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One day when the sun was hot and the pastures were becoming short and dry, a small bush near him began to bum with flames of fire, which was not so peculiar; but the bush was not consumed into ashes, and this was peculiar. So Moses turned aside to see the strange sight; but before he got to the bush he heard a voice which said, &quot;Moses, Moses.” He replied, &quot;Here am I.” And the voice came to him out of the bush, telling him to remove the sandals from his feet: for he was Standing on holy ground. Then the voice said, “I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord told him that He had seen the affliction of His people in Egypt and had heard their cry because of their taskmasters, and that He knew their sorrows. Continuing He said, ‘T am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians and to bring them out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.” He agreed to send Aaron, Moses’ brother, as his special spokesman or mouthpiece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Moses and Aaron went first to the elders of the Israelites and. explained their mission. Then they appeared before Pharaoh. Pharaoh was angry and said, “Who is the Lord that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I do not know the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.” Miracles Were performed and plagues were sent upon th® Egyptians, and each time Pharaoh agreed that if th® plagues were removed he would lei tfas people go. However, after the Lord at th® request of Moses removed the plagues, Pharaoh’s heart was hardened and he refused to let them </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Finally after nine plagues had come and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">gone, </span><span class="font8">it was necessary to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">use an extreme measure </span><span class="font8">which was to destroy all the first-born boys in each, family as well as all the first-born male calves, sheep, goats, etc. This great incident happened, at midnight. When every </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">family </span><span class="font8">found that their eldest son had died, they ran to the palace of the king and demanded that th® Hebrews be set free. The Hebrew people had all their possessions in readiness: and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">when the </span><span class="font8">death angel passed through, Pharaoh gave the word to go, and the great procession began. They marched the remainder of the night and all the next day. In the evening they approached the Bed Sea and there spread camp for the night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By this time Pharaoh had repented letting the Israelites go. He got together six hundred of his best chariots and warriors and started in pursuit of the Hebrews. When the children of Israel saw them coming, they were frightened and asked Moses why he had not let them die in the land of Egypt, because they were confident that Pharaoh was going to kill them all. Moses went to the Lord and asked Him w’hat should be done. He was instructed to stretch his staff over the sea and to tell the people to “fear not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he would show’ to them that day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So Moses lifted his staff over the sea and the Lord caused a strong wind to divide the waters and make the sea dry land so that the Israelites could cross over. The children of Israel marched through the Red Sea, vflth the Egyptians following some distance behind. When the last of the Israelites were safely over, the Lord instructed Moses to again lift his hand over the sea, and the waters returned, swallowing up all the Egyptians who had followed them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The deliverance of the children of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font8"> srael from Egypt was a great picture in which all of us ar® deeply interested. They had been in Egyptian bondage for many years, picturing th® whois world of mankind which has been in bondage to sin and death for 6,000 years, and thia pietar® was placed in the Bible a® an illustration of what God is going to do for the whole world of mankind. They, too, are to be delivered from bondage to sin, sorrow, sickness, pain and death. This will come when God’s kingdom is established on earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">142. So God sent Jesus, as His name then was, as a little baby, a regular flesh-and-blood baby, to Mary, a very good woman of the Israelites. We may be sure that Jesus was the very nicest baby that every lived; never cried, but was always smiling and happy. How proud Mary was I 'God had told her that He would send her this special baby, and what she should call Him, and what He would do when He grew up.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">143. And here is where we see the wisdom of God in fulfilling His promise: Mary, the mother of Jesus, was related directly to a good man by the name of Nathan. Nathan was the son of King David of Israel. And David was the ever-fio-many-timcs great grandson of Abraham!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">144. So the mother of Jesus, our Redeemer, was directly related to Abraham, making good what God had said so long before her day, that through Abraham's descendants (children) all the nations of the earth would be blessed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">145. And Christ, the Son of God, who came to earth, as an innocent little baby, will soon bless everybody on earth, jn«t as God ea<sup>:</sup>d; and everybody will sing and shout and dance for joy because God is so good and kind.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Holy Spirit</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">146. The holy spirit is often mentioned in the Bible. It means the unseen </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">power</span><span class="font8"> of Jehovah God. It is His </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">inllueiice,</span><span class="font8"> His spirit; and He used it in olden days to guide and direct the words and deeds of Moses and Samuel and the other good men who acted as messengers of God. The holy spirit is not a person, or a being, or anything like it. It is the great power and strength of the heavenly Father.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">147. The writers of the New Testament wrote under rhe </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">inspiration,</span><span class="font8"> or direction, of the holy spirit. Holy means pure, whole, absolutely good, without any flaw or badness at all. The spirit or power of God is therefore holy, because God could not and would not do anything bad. So of course He would not use His power for anything bad. God does nothing but good and kind things—things that will always tarn out to be the best for us in the end.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">148. We know about the Foolish Teachers and their silly idea about the soul. (You know what a soul is, do you not!

<li>
<p><span class="font8">149. We also know about the Wicked Teachers, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font8"> silly and also very wrong idea about hell. (You know what hell is, do you not! Simply the hole in the ground where you are put when you die-—nothing else.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">150. Now we are going to learn about another kind of teacher, perhaps the funniest kind of all, because </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font8"> idea is entirely made up in their own head, and has nothing to do with the Bible at all. We are going to have a big laugh at these teachers when we see what they teach.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">151. What would you think of a teacher in school who could not figure even very simple sums in addition? She would be a very stupid teacher, and they would not let her stay in th® school to teach the. boys and girls at all.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">R</span><span class="font1">ADIO beacons have proven entirely practical in guiding an airplane from Detroit to Dayton and return. The pilot received a stream of signals constantly informing him as to whether or not he was on the right course, and if off his course the signals indicated whether he should turn to left or right. It is expected to so arrange the control board of the new Ford planes that these signals will be given by lights, and thus the pilot will be independent of the telegraph code as well as of landmarks below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Low Wages a Delusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A A MERICAN products, produced by the high-est paid labor in the world, are crowding to the wall the products of all the underpaid labor of the rest of the world. High wages have led to mass production, the best of machinery, huge buying power for the workers, and the ©reation of a wide home market. American workers today have all the comforts possessed by those who in Europe are considered moderately wealthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">#0 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a Minimum Wage in New York</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A</span><span class="font1">CCORDING to a careful study made by the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">National Industrial Conference Board, a New York employer who pays an office man less than $40 a week is paying him less than is actually required for the decent maintenance of himself and his family. Out of this sum $10 goes to the landlord, $15 to the grocer, butcher and milkman, $5 for the clothing of himself, his &gt;</span><span class="font8">■</span><span class="font1"> wife and his children under fourteen years of age, while the balance is needed for sundries, Bttch as medical care, insurance, recreation and. the like. Th® manual worker can get along on $36 per week, his expenses for rent and clothing being less. But as a matter of fact the office er, are generally paid less than the manual workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Necessity of Keeping Bush</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font1">HE necessity of keeping busy has been again brought to light by the revelation that eighty percent of all juvenile crime is committed after three o’clock in the afternoon; or, in other words, after school is out and the boys have nothing to do. The Children’s Aid Society null now give attention to the subject of giving school boys adequate means of entertainment after 3 p. m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life First, Property Second</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font1">HE national convention of the union of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">American Hebrew Congregations held at Cleveland passed resolutions that labor is life and is not a commodity to be bought and sold in the market, and that human rights take precedence over the rights of property. These axioms run contrary to general economic and legal practice, but they are parallel to the teachings of the Bible and must ultimately prevail. The best men and women are coming more and more to see that the Golden Rule is not only right but a necessity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New York’s Deaths by Automobiles</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">N</span><span class="font1">EW YORK STATES deaths by automobiles were 2,143 in 1926, which is a slight increase over 1925. Among the principal causes of death and accident were grade crossings, speed mania, reckless driving, intoxicated drivers, intoxicated pedestrians, pedestrians with umbrella-obstructed views, pedestrians with package-obstructed views, running from behind one machine into the path of another, sudden backing of cars and running into parked cars.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Buyer's Paradise</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">N</span><span class="font1">EW YORK is to have a new type of building which might be called a buyer’s paradise. It will have thirty stories and will be given over to buyers. The first three floors will house a permanent exposition, and the remainder will be operated as a hotel for the 3,000 buyers who can there bo accommodated. None but members of the International Mercantile Club or their invited guests will be accommodated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Terrible Housing Conditions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">W</span><span class="font1">ITNESSES before the State Housing Board show that there are still terrible housing conditions in New York City, due to the inability of many to pay the rents required. In numerous instances there are three families occupying apartments of only five or six rooms; and in some of the Negro sections of Harlem there are double shifts of boaiders, using the bedrooms day and night. On the other hand there are numerous high-class apartments that are standing unoccupied. An attempt is being made at Albany to persuade the leading New York life insurance companies to invest five percent of their funds in providing better housing facilities for the people of New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Widening and Lighting &amp;f Streets</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">M</span><span class="font1">ANY American cities are now determinedly widening their streets and none too soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The cost of street widening is offset by the increased value of the abutting property. Much the same may be said of improved street lighting. The crowds which the better lights bring to the improved areas soon pay for the lights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">moments Toward Ending Slavery</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font1">HERE are several encouraging movements toward the ending of slavery in the United States. In Louisiana the United States government is prosecuting two men for selling a fifty-year-old Negro, his wife and three children for $20; in Pennsylvania there is agitation against the binding out of dependent children in return for food, clothing and lodging; and in several of the states there is legislation pending forbidding the clergy of any denomination from requiring the marriage contract to bind parents to educate in any particular religious faith the children bom to the union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peonage in Texas and Arizona</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">TpIVE men, including the sheriff of Willacy <sup>A</sup> County, Texas, have just been found guilty of peonage by a federal jury. Young men 'were arrested on vagrancy charges, and instead of being placed on trial were forced, to work in the cotton fields. The charges of peonage in Arizona are less definite, but are based upon the supposed mistreatment of Porto Ricans brought from. Porto Rico to Arizona for cotton culture purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Why Immigrants Succeed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">npHE reason why Dora Martin of Costa Rica could enter the United States two years ago with no knowledge of English and then become the valedictorian of her class in that brief time, is that she was willing to work hard to accomplish her purpose. A native-born American could have accomplished the same result with an expenditure of much less energy. This happened in New York City. There is a similar case in Reading, Pa., where a boy from Jugoslavia achieved the same result under similar conditions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Achievements of a Blind Jewish Lad</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font1">AKEN blind on the way here from Russia, twenty-three years ago, a young Jewish lad, now only thirty-eight years of age, is the proprietor of a successful printing business in New York City and has just purchased a five-story building off Cooper Square, where he is opening an American Jewish Association for the Blind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This young man, Mr. Needleman, began life as a newsboy on Broadway and was successful from the start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mariani Is F&amp;nd of Grapes</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">N</span><span class="font1">EAR Nyack, New York, prohibition agents visited the farm of a Mr. Mariani, where they found ten acres devoted to the cultivation of white grapes; 5,000 gallons of fermented wine; 8.000 gallons in process of fermentation; a machine for charging wine to make it fizz; and forty-eight cases of bottles, each bearing champagne labels similar to that sold in New York night clubs at $20 per bottle. No arrests were made. Mr. Mariani claims he has a permit to hold the wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Broward County Coes Dry</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">B</span><span class="font1">ROWARD COUNTY, Florida, has gone dry ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">but in order to bring it about the prohibition authorities had to arrest the sheriff and all six of his deputies, the deputy police chief and eight of his patrolmen, and twenty-five other leading citizens. Up until that time the bootloggers of Broward county had enjoyed full police protection. Eight stills and a considerable quantity of liquor &quot;were seized in the raid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Increase in Kansas Mortgages</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font1">HE Kansas City </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font1"> tells us that there are now $20,000,000 more in mortgages resting on Kansas farms than v’as the case seven years ago. It is plain from this that the farmers are not getting a square deal, for in that time the general wealth of the country has increased by leaps and bounds. The original fertility of the Kansas farms has all been used up, and from now on the crops will be more expensive to produce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Net Profits Paid Out in Taxes</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">JL ”D </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ogee Babsox,</span><span class="font1"> the statistician, claims that ’ </span><span class="font8">■</span><span class="font1">*-»' taxes consume 83% of the net profits of agriculture; 60% of mining profits; 36% of transportation and public utility profits; 32% of construction profits; 31% of finance, banking and insurance profits; 27% of mercantile profits; and 24% of manufacturing profits. Justice requires that these matters be evened up. Instead of tlie farmers having to pay the most they really ought to pay the least, for there is no class of workers who work as hard for their money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Income of Park Avenue</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font1">HE income of the 4,000 families living on</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Park Avenue, between 34th and 96th Streets, New’ York City, is said to average $75,000 a year. Although the greatest concentrated collection of wealthy families in the world, they nevertheless live not in private homes but in apartments, like the cave dwellers of old, one apartment above the other.</span></p>

Of twenty-nine heads of important American railway systems, twenty-eight came from the bottom, although thirteen of them were college graduates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Big Discovery of Borax</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A N IMMENSE deposit of borax has been discovered in Kern County, California, about thirty-five miles from Barstow. The deposit, which is six hundred feet under ground, has been found to be about five miles long, three miles wide and ninety feet thick. The man who first drilled through the borax was in search of water, and abandoned his place in disgust when no water was found. The deposit is now under control of one company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peat As a Paper-Making Material '</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">TpXPERIMENTS in Wisconsin have demonstrated that wrapping paper and wall board can be made from peat, when a little waste paper is mixed with it as a binder. This is a valuable discovery, as there are unlimited quantities of peat in Wisconsin and other states, and a scarcity of paper-making materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Engine Number 5200</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A NEW engine has just been turned out by the American Locomotive shops at Schenectady, N. Y., that is expected to haul two complete sections of the heavy and fast trains operated over the New York Central lines, with only one train crew. This engine, No. 5200 could, if unleashed, attain a speed of 120 miles an hour. It will be used on the Twentieth Century Limited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Thirty Trillions of Stars</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">B</span><span class="font1">Y CAREFUL estimates based upon photographs of various sections of the heavens made with the world’s largest telescope the conclusion has been reached that there are not less than thirty trillions of stars. The Psalmist says of these stars that God knoweth them all by name. It is known that the light traveling at the rate of 186,300 miles a second would require at least a million years to merely pass across the face of the portion of the heavens that has already been mapped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Too Much Soft Coal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font1">HE likelihood of a prolonged strike in the soft coal regions calls attention anew to the fact that, under present industrial methods, America has too much soft coal. Ordinarily there are too many mines in operation and too many workers, so that the inevitable result is part time employment, with all its attendant evils. Along conies a spasm of prosperity, such as was caused by the British coal strike. For a time the mines are all busy. Then comes the inevitable slump, which is now upon us. The owners want to cut down wages, but the costs of living are high, the work is dangerous and taken from one year to another provides employment only about half the time. As a natural consequence the miners want more wages instead of less, and there you are. What the soft coal business needs is Christ’s kingdom. The problem seems beyond human ability to solve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Some Effects of Cigarette Smoking</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">C</span><span class="font1">IGARETTE smoke contains nicotine, creosote,* pyridine, prussic acid, and seven other poisons. One drop of the liquid will kill a sparrow in seventy seconds; one and one-half drops will kill a snake in twelve minutes; one-half drop will paralyze a mouse instantly. These poisons readily pass through the delicate linings and air tubes of the lungs and poison the blood. Tobacco affects the brain and spinal cord, the stomach and reproductive organs. Women working in tobacco factories are especially subject to miscarriage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tobacco used by growing boys produces intellectual apathy and melancholia, with occasional insanity. Athletic trainers refuse to permit men in training to smoke. Smoking reduces a man’s accuracy in the pitching of baseball. The excessive use of tobacco injures the eyesight. Thomas Edison will not employ any person who smokes cigarettes. Most of the cigarettes now sold are doped with glycerine, which adds charm to the cigarette and also adds to its deadliness as an agency for the destruction of manhood and womanhood. Cigarette smoking makes the complexion of women yellow and ashen, and makes the women themselves nervous and inclined to insomnia. In twenty-four years the consumption of cigarettes in the United States inereased from fliree billions to seventy-two Milons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Suicides Among College Students &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">D</span><span class="font1">URING the first month of 1927 there were</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">nine suicides among the students at </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">Atu</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">at. </span><span class="font1">ican universities. Several of these committed suicide because of a morbid desire to find out about the things of the next life, and some of them because they failed to pass the midwinter examinations. A Texas college professor believes that several of them have concluded to suicide because they believe the whole of life ** is what they have found it to be at the universities, and what the professor in question calls a rotten mess. As far as faith in and reverence for the Creator is concerned most universities are what the professor says they are; and when a young man or young woman has had love and reverence for God taken out of his or her life there is nothing left but disillusion and despair. Any college professor who by any means robs a believing young man or woman of faith in God is a foe to humanity and a well-developed child of the Devil, who is thus often proven to be a murderer in fact as well as in intent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Proper Place to Train Children &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">HDIIAT home is the proper place to train chil-J- dren has been proven again by a force of Columbia University psychologists who made careful studies of 2,400 children. All tests showed that the home influences toward honesty were preponderant, the influence of friends second and the influence of Sunday schools, schools and clubs of slight value. Girls cheated more often in classrooms and boys more often in games. Children of wealth were less honest than those of the poor. Honesty seemed to be in direct proportion to intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Massachusetts Insane Asylums</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I</span><span class="font1">T SEEMS that in Massachusetts any person who wants to get rid of a relative or ward and get possession of his property can hire two unscrupulous medical men to sign a commitment, get the formal approval of a judge, and then rush the victim off to an asylum. Commenting on these conditions the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fellowship Forum * </span><span class="font1">says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It has been discovered that for many years the^e has been an interlocking system composed of unprincipled and shyster attorneys, corrupt politicians and unscrupu* lous and ehaxacterless medical doctors. These men, cooperating, have looted and, stolen the property of well-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">to-d&lt;j citizens and have defrauded the rightful heirs of these estates, driving than, in many instances, into suffering and poverty.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Location of Our New Offices</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font1">HE boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn are connected by a series of bridges across the East Biver. Of these the Brooklyn Bridge is the oldest and the best known. It is the most southern of the series, and ranks among the great bridges of the world. About a mile above the Brooklyn Bridge is the Manhattan Bridge, opened in 1910. Over these two bridges an immense amount of traffic passes—automobiles, trucks, street-cars, elevated railways—in the orderly fashion predominant in New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Brooklyn district between these bridges is the oldest part of the borough of Brooklyn, as shown by the names of the streets therein. One can usually tell by the names of the streets just about when any district began its existence. The names of the streets in this locality are those of men prominent in the Revolutionary War— Washington, Adams, Jay—and of those subjects which then interested deeply the people of this section of the United States—Liberty, Concord, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the olden days this entire section was doubtless a desirable residential district, overlooking the East River, with the upper New York Bay not far south. Those houses still remaining are three or four stories in height, the usual height of the better class of residences in that day. But as the city grew, and business encroached upon the docks and streets nearby, the well-to-do citizens built new homes farther ©ut on Long Island; and in time what had once been a desirable residence district sank into slums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the past few decades, however, another change has begun. Many of the tenement houses have been demolished; in their stead factories of steel and concrete have been erected, and now the erstwhile slum district has become &amp;&nbsp;factory section. Meanwhile the traffic over the bridges has been many times multiplied, until now the stream of motor vehicles flows by incessantly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hundreds of employes pour forth from these factories at quitting time and scatter to various parts of the city. The roar of motor traffic increases. For a short while the hum of the departing workers fills the air. Then silence drops upon the factory district, broken only by the voices of children at play upon the streets or by passing citizens returning home. The great factories are also silent, except for the sounds indicative of the presence of the faithful watchmen wffio guard them against the possibility of fire or other damage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These modern structures of steel and concrete are much alike in their construction. Perhaps the most noticeable feature is the immense a-mount of windows which they contain. The buildings vary in height from eight to ten or twelve stories, with roofs carrying the huge tanks necessary for adequate protection from fire. As a rule the offices are in the top story of these buildings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The new home of </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Gowen Age.</span><span class="font1"> is one of these concrete and steel plants. It is located on the corner of Adams and Prospect Streets, and covers about one-fourth of the entire block. At present every one of the eight stories is occupied by the various departments of this plant; and doubts are already being expressed as to whether the building will long continue to be large enough for the needs of the rapidly growing business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The offices are on the eighth floor, where there is plenty of light and fresh air, and where a fine view is presented of the boroughs of Brooklyn and Manhattan. A few squares to the north is a bend of the East River; and a steady stream of rivercraft passes to and fro—ferries, barges, tugboats, and occasionally a naval vessel of some sort on its way to or from the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a half-mile or less up the river. At a short distance to the right and the left are the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges, those important thoroughfares between the boroughs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brooklyn Bridge, the first suspension bridge built between Manhattan and Brooklyn, was completed in 1883. It is over a mile long, and consists of one main suspension span and two shore spans. The roadway is eighty-six feet wide, and is divided into five sections; the two on the outer sides being used for vehicles and electric cars, the two on the inner side for the elevated railway, and the central division for foot passengers. It is estimated that about 250,-000 persons cross this bridge daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Manhattan Bridge was opened to the public on Dec. 31, 1909, but was not completed until May, 1911. This bridge is of double-deck design. The lower level has one thirty-five foot roadway in the middle, two subway trades on each side/-and one eleven-foot footwalk on each side; but at present the south side of this level is</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">dosed. The upper level has four trolley tracks and a roadway for motor vehicles. The number of persons crossing this bridge daily is estimated to be about 500,000. The subway trains become surface trains while crossing Manhattan Bridge. This bridge is also a suspension bridge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Street railways pass on both Adams and Prospect Streets, but these lines do not cross &lt;|ther bridge. A walk of two short blocks from our offices brings one to the entrance to Brooklyn Bridge, where you will find street-cars going to and from klanhattan, the chief of the five boroughs which go to make up Greater New York and comprising that part of the city commonly called New York City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The eastern windows of the office floor present an unbroken view of old-fashioned houses interspersed with factory buildings, the tall chimneys of which indicate their location. It is not generally known that Brooklyn is a manufacturing city of no mean proportions. The N. Y. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font1"> declares it to be the greatest single center in the country where shoes are manufactured, and states that during 1926 more than ffiky million dollars worth of footwear were produced here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As the spectator looks over the approach td the Manhattan Bridge, far off to the north-east* ern horizon the forest of tall chimneys corroborates the statement that this is a great manu* facturing center, as well as the city of homes and the beaten track to Coney Island, New York City’s famous pleasure resort</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the south side of the building one can see the district around Borough Hall, where th® Brooklyn skyscrapers are located. It is not generally known that one of these, the most recently built, is thirty-five stories in height. Beyond the skyscrapers the city stretches out as far as the eye can reach, and farther; for Brooklyn has an estimated population of more than two million persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The western windows of these offices look upon the billion-dollar mile of lower Manhattan, otherwise known as the Wall Street district. Far away to the left of the gazer can be seen the waters of the upper New York Bay, with Staten Island in the dim distance; while near at hand is the part of Brooklyn best known to the Bible Students—that which environs the home of the faithful men and women who have devoted their lives to the promulgation of the truth of God’s Word throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">America Named After Its Discoverer</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I</span><span class="font1">T IS a pleasure to note that historians are now agreed that America is properly named after its real discoverer, Leif the son of Eric.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■</span><span class="font1"> The prefix Amt in Scandinavian means Land of, and the combination </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amt-Eric,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Am-erica, </span><span class="font1">simply means the Land of Eric.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only did Leif, the son of Eric, or Leif</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">' Ericson, as he is usually called, unquestionably visit and make settlements in New England, but ithe name which he gave the land, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amt-Eric,</span><span class="font1"> has continued with the North American Indians to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">. this day. Among the Indians the ancient name is still given as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Am-arok-e,</span><span class="font1"> or America; and when Columbus and his friends crossed the southern part of the Atlantic, five hundred years after Leif and his friends had crossed the northern part of the same body of water, the name was in general use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The idea that the name America had anything io do with one of the explorers, Morego Ves-rd, who, by the way, was unable to write wn name, rests upon a single sentence in ths writings of a Boman monk, where it appears only in the form of a suggestion. If th® country had been named after this man surely it would have been called Vespuccia and not after his first name, Morego.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Among the historians and noted men. of letters who have expressed themselves as convinced that Leif Ericson was the real discoverer of America, are William Cullen Bryant, Sidney Howard Gay, H. H. Bancroft, F. H. Von Humboldt, Benjamin Franklin, Oliver Wendell Holmes, James Bussell Lowell, Bev. Charles Kingsley, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, T. Wentworth Higginson, and forty more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The evidence shows that Leif’s countrymen, the Icelanders, maintained colonies in America from the year 1000 to 1347 A. D. Inscriptions of other relics traceable to those colonies have been found at Kensington, Minnesota, Fall Biver and Dighton, Mass., Newport, R. I., Malba, L. I., and Fort Mountain, Ga. The find at Fall River was a skeleton in armor. A Roman Catholia monk, Adam of Bremen, made reference to these colonies in a manuscript written in the year •1073. The manuscript is still preserved at Copenhagen, Denmark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The h’Mory of Christopher Columbus shows that h«i made a voyage to Iceland in 1477; and the historian Henry Vignaud, a great admirer of Columbus, presents the evidence that before he sailed on his voyage of discovery Columbus knew of the existence of America and had an approximate idea of its distance from Spain in sailing days. This detailed information he obtained while in Iceland, the only place where it was procurable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A recent discovery, confirming the Icelandic claims to the settlement and naming of America, is the tribe of white Indians near Panama. It seems that these Indians are not albinos at all, but are golden-haired, blue-eyed and white-skinned, and look very much like the primitive Norse people. Without a doubt these are all that are left of the original Icelandic colonies. Wars with Indians, and pestilences in their home lands, caused the abandonment of the colonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The historians claim to have established the fact that Leif Ericson touched at Cape Cod, ascended the Charles River at flood tide, landed at Cambridge, built a house there at what is now known as Gerry’s landing, and that tho0-who followed him built the ancient city of Norumbega at what is now Watertown, Mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Norse peoples are quite plain in their statements that they believe they see why such a persistent effort has been made to take the glory away from the Protestant Norse discoverer and to give it all to the Roman Catholic explorers, Christopher Columbus and Morego Vespucci. It is indisputable, of course, that our history of that period is mainly from Catholic sources.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">In Re Hay Fever</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A</span><span class="font1"> MEDICAL authority defines hay fever as a “form of nasal catarrh, accompanied with fever and occasional dyspnoea (shortness of breath)”. He hasn’t said the half of it, as all sufferers from this malady can attest. It has been attributed to the effluvium from hay, and the pollen of certain plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The plants most stigmatized as causing hay fever during the pollen-spreading season, are the Oldfield Goldenrod </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Solidago nemoralis), </span><span class="font1">and the common Ragweed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Ambrosia trifida). </span><span class="font1">The ragweed merits most of the blame, however, for its pollen is intensely irritating to most human noses possessing an inherited or acquired catarrhal tendency. The family name of the ragweed, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ambrosiaciae,</span><span class="font1"> though suggestive of the Greek “food for the gods”, seems to be a misnomer, since we are certain that no one would mourn the loss of this obnoxious plant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Tn</span><span class="font1"> fact, the tears of hay fever victims would greatly decrease, in the event of the complete extermination of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ambrosia trifida.</span><span class="font1"> This does not seem likely, for the plant is established from New Brunswick to Florida, and to New Mexico nn the west. So it will no doubt continue to charge the autumn breezes with its golfa. '</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">■</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> By C. J. W., Jr. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I am sure that if “L Sneeze”, whose lamentation appeared in No. 192 of </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age, </span><span class="font1">had thought twice about the matter he would not have allowed even the tortures of hay fever to betray him into the hasty statement about “his Satanic Majesty getting ready to shake the ragweed and blow its pollen into the air to torture mankind once more”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fertilization of large areas of certain species of plants by the agency of wind-blown pollen is one of the most beautiful examples of the Great Creator’s provision for the welfare and perpetuation of His plant-creatures. We must not be led to think that the Lord created man, and then turned the job of creating plants, pollen, and air currents over to the Devil. The supposition that Satan has anything whatever to do with the economics of plant life is altogether erroneous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fertilization is also accomplished by other methods than that which makes the ragweed and its class so objectionable. As an illustration of the manifold and wonderful ways in which the Lord accomplishes the transmission of virile pollen between remote male and female flowers, I subjoin an extract from the pen of the eminent</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">biological authority, William Joseph Showalter, Sc. D., a member of the publication faculty of the National Geographic Society, Washington, D. C.:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The flower has been called a living machine for making seeds. The essential parts of this machine are pistils and stamens. To fertilize the ovules of the pistil with the pollen grains of the stamen, and thus to start the promise of the plant that is to be, is the flower's problem. / Less virile flowers, possessing both stamens and pis-til«, fertilize themselves. ... In others the sexes are so feoparah d that stamens and pistils occur in different fe.crs or even on different plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of these employ the wind and the water as mes-sei’gi rs for carrying pollen from mature stamens to receptive pistils. Such flowers are rigid economists exempt in the matter of pollen, of which they are profligate spenders. Insects might be attracted by pleasing odors, bi'isht colors, and sweet nectar, hut the wind and the nater pay no attention to such things. So color, scent, and sweetness are absent. But there is greater need for pollen, since wind and water are poor messengers and mu-t be loaded down if any of the pollen is to reach its proper destination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of the water-f°rtilized plants have had to adapt selves to fertilization under water, and hence are <sub>f</sub> provided with pollen of the same specific gravity as water. Others must be fertilized at the surface, and these launch their pollen grains on floating rafts. . . . When the water-living tasselgrass matures its pistils and stamens in separate flowers, their stalks suddenly shoot up to the surface of the water, no matter what the depth, and the staminate flowers there spread their pollen abroad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the most interesting of all the water-living plants in the matter of fertilization is the familiar wild celery, fl be female flower raises its head to the surface on a long stalk, but the male flowers remain entirely submerged until the time for fertilization comes. Then their buds detach themselves, float to the surface, and ’curve back their sepals, so as to make a raft for their two perfect staiiicns. These, float abort, until they meet the female flowers. Once the female flower is fertilized the stem contracts and the flower is drawn beneath the surface, where it matures its seeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The wind-pollinated plants include many of the forest trees and most of the grasses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the pollenization by insects, Mr. ShowaHer says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the birthworts, for instances, has hairs in the corolla which permit the ant or other creature to enter, but hjfld it prisoner until it has crawled all over the stamens and pistils, and is either loaded with pollen by the one, or has had its burden taken from it by the other. Sometimes the imprisonment lasts as long as sixty hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Dutchman’s-pfpe accomplishes the same object by making the tube leading to the nectar so smooth, that the small flies entering it cannot get a foothold on the way out until the flower withers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of the orchids secrete a copious supply of nectar, which is poured into a little chamber that has an overflow spout to discharge the surplus. The bees visit the flower to gnaw the sweet, fleshy ridge within. In doing so, they frequently push their fellows into the nectar chamber, where they get involuntary baths and from which they can escape only through the overflow spout. This forces them to rub their bodies against the receptive stigmas, and thus leave with the latter pollen from a previously visited flower. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mountain laurel fastens each of its stamens down in a corresponding pocket of the corolla. When a bee visits the flower and treads around over the corolla in its task of draining the nectar-cup, it steps on the stamens one by one. This releases them after the manner of a mouse springing a trigger trap, whereupon the stamen springs up and over the back of the bee, dusting it with the pollen in the anther.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some flowers, like the milkweed, grip the legs of insect visitors and hold them fast. In trying to “yank” the trapped leg free, the bee pulls loose a little saddlebag arrangement, containing two packs of pollen, which adheres to tho leg. Flying away to another flower that has a receptive stigma, the insect leaves the saddlebags with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The actual, underlying cause of hay fever is reasonably apparent. Were all membranous tissue in a perfectly normal state, sufficient fluid would be exuded thereby to enable the accumulation of large quantities of irritating matter without di seomfort. This of course would be removed, on occasion, in the usual manner, with, no subsequent ill effects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But as catarrhal tissue is pre-eminently </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dry </span><span class="font1">tissue, it follows that all external irritants 1’eadily attack it, stimulating abnormal secretion of the mucous fluid, with consequent inflamation of the mucous glands. Violent astringents are not natural, and do not promote a normal condition of the tissue. Healthy tissue is moist, and this moisture collects dry irritants to a surprising degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;When discomfort is felt after exposure to dust or similar irritating mediums, a normal nose will expel the collected material, leaving’ the surface of the membrane in a protected state. Such, of course, is not the case with our poor, imperfect, catarrhal noses, and when w® are subjected to the very fine, pungent pollen of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ambrosia trifida,</span><span class="font1"> we suffer. And then we suffer some more.</span></p>

And this represents only a fraction of the money cost and public suffering caused through lack of health information.

<p><span class="font7">Does Dr. Young, as a presumably devoted public servant, ask that the taxpayers go on putting up this money, year after year, and at the same time go on suffering ill-health when good health is available for a few dollars’ worth of common sense health knowledge?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Medical history is a history of intolerance, oppression and superstition. The first bath tub was introduced into the United States at Cincinnati, December 20, 1843. The Medical Association of that city, in order to display its superlative intelligence, warned the public against taking baths. They said it would bring on rheumatism, inflammation of the lungs and other dreadful diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One year later the city council, of Philadelphia, prompted by medical men, failed by only two votes to pass a city ordinance making it unlawful to wash the entire body between November 1 and March 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1844 the Medical Association had the City of Boston pass a law, and it remained a law for seven awful years, forbidding anyone to bathe in a tub without a doctor’s prescription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The bigoted doctors of seventy-five years ago who forbade the taking of baths are the same men who today, animated by the same spirit, attack and vilify and would prohibit the education of the public into the Bonunon sense mechanics of health.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Where the Moose Flourishes</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">TVTOOSE are thicker in British Columbia than^^f 1¥JL <sub>ever</sub> before, and they have increased to such an extent in some districts that the caribou herds are threatened, according to big game authorities at Vancouver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the beginning of the present century many 'districts that are now teeming with moose did not even know the species. They were, however, favored haunts of caribou, which were so plentiful that they formed the principal food supply of the nomad Indians, who used to follow the herds just as the prehistoric &quot;reindeer men” followed the reindeer in Northern Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The caribou and moose, however, do not get along well together, according to big game men. When the moose move into a region populated by caribou in large numbers, the caribou move out. This has been going on over a vast area in northern and central British Columbia during the past twenty-five years. One authority writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The caribou is too hardy a breed to vanish altogether. The moose and the caribou seem to gain dominance over each other according to cycles. We happen to be passing through a moose cycle now. In a few years an epidemic</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">or some other disturbance may weaken the moose and the caribou will have his day again. In any event, there is no possibility of serious depletion of either species for many generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The waphti or elk, another antlered family, was in danger of being annihilated as a result of ruthless hunting some years ago; but since restrictive measures have been adopted the remaining herds, two on Vancouver Island, one in the Kootenay district and another in northern British Columbia, have grown to large proportions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Shingle Industry </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">By E. C. O'Neall</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font1">HE Shingle Industry is a comparatively small one, and one that only a few people know much about. Shingles have been used from earliest times to protect buildings from the weather, both as roofing and as siding. Up to comparatively recent times they were made by the slow process of hand work. The logs were cut into bolts, hand-rived with a frow or broadaxe, and the shingles were shaved with a drawing knife. A &quot;shaving horse&quot; was used in early colonial times. A man who could rive 500 shingles in a day was considered an expert worker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Until a few decades ago white pine, chestnut and southern white cedar were relied upon for 'the major portion of shingles used in this country. The rustic shingle-maker was often able to fell from general appearance of the tree whether it would rive properly or not. Frequently, however, a large block was cut out of the side of the virgin white pine trees to test their splitting qualities. If the wood did not split well the tree was left a prey to the next forest fire, which quickly ignited the resin which oozed from the exposed portion. This pioneer custom was very wasteful, since only the butt log was used for shingles; and very frequently a tree that would now’ produce throe thousand shingles was then able to produce only about five hundred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hand-made shingles were generally of two kinds, known as &quot;joint” and &quot;lap”. The latter were longer, with one edge thicker than the other, and nailed on the roof so that the edge of one lapped over the edge of the other, like weather boards. The &quot;joints” were nailed edge to edge, '’like sawed shingles. Hand-made shingles, called &quot;shakes”, are still made from) sugar pine and redwood in California. The introduction of shingle’machinery proved to be a great economy in saving the available raw material. With the shingle saws, shingles which included knots, cross-grain, etc., could be made not only from butt levs of ihe best trees but from the tops and partially decayed butts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Gradually the center of the shingle industry moved to the Pacific Northwest, where the western red cedar, which </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">grows</span><span class="font1"> so abundantly in that region, was found to be an ideal shingle wood. In the East shingle mills are usually located in connection with saw-mills, the shingles often being made of defective or misshapen portions of the butt logs of white pine, yellow pine, spruce, cypress, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Advent of Machinery</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270601_files/g_E_19270601-2.png" alt="" style="width:12pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">SINGLE machines wore introduced on a commercial basis about 1880. Several years before that time hand-made western red cedar shingles w<sup>T</sup>ere being shipped around South America to the Atlantic seaboard. The shaved shingle industry had already assumed proportions in the Puget Sound and Columbia Biver sections. With the advent of machinery and the opening of the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1883 came </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a great</span><span class="font1"> impetus in the manufacture of sawed shingles and their distribution, not only in the Northwest but throughout the central prairie states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">About the year 1892 came a rapid increase in production and several hundred million shingles were shipped to the far eastern market. About 200 shingle mills were then in operation in western Washington. At the present time western red cedar shingles are sent to every state in the Union, and compete successfully with shingles made from all other species. There are approximately two hundred shingle mills in Washington at the present time, most of them being operated as separate industries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to a circular that was printed by the United States Cedar Industry Tariff Committee last year, there have been about one hundred mills lost by fire in the States of Washington and Oregon; and some went bankrupt and were never rebuilt because of the small marginal profits, due to foreign trade. I will insert here what this committee stated in their circular under the heading of Investment:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The shingle industry is the fifth largest industry in the Pacific Northwest; and in Washington and Oregon there are about two hundred shingle mills, representing an investment of more than $30,000,000. This industry is capable of producing a product having an. annual value of approximately $30,000,000, and will produce that amount if the mills are given full time operation. In 1922 and 1923 alone a total of fifty-nine mills in Washington and Oregon, with 197 shingle machines, vent into the hands of a receiver, or burned and were not replaced. Many are now on the verge of bankruptcy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are probably fewer shingle mills today in the Pacific Northwest than there were a few years ago; but there is a much larger annual output, due to the larger capacity of from 100,-000 to 550.000 shingles per day of eight hours. A few of the places with mills of the largest capacity are: Everett, Wash., Vancouver, B. C., Ballard, Wash., Hoquiam, Wash., and Edmonds, Wash. Of course there are more than one mill in each one of these places. The President of the shingle weavers union, Mr. J. G. Brown, made the statement some time ago that Everett, Wash., was the largest shingle manufacturing center in the world; Grace Harbor coming next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Annual Production</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A</span><span class="font1">BOUT 8<sub>5</sub>OOO,OOO,OOO to 12,000,000,000 shingles are produced annually in the United States. The latter amount lias been produced during the several years past; but for the last few yeais the production has decreased, due to numerous cities’ inaugurating fire laws which prohibit the use of shingles in new buildings within city limits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the total shingle production, between seventy and eighty percent are made up of western red cedar. These shingles are largely manufactured in the state of Washington, which a-lone produced seventy-three percent of all the shingles made in this country up to 1917. Oregon and northern Idaho also now turn out large quantities of shingles, and a few western red cedar shingles are also made in western Montana. Many northern white cedar shingles are now being made, mainly in northern Michigan, Maine and Minnesota. Southern white cedar shingles are produced chiefly in eastern Virginia and North Carolina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Next to cedar, cypress is the leading shingle wood; but only slightly over 600,000,000 cypress shingles are annually manufactured in this country. Next, in order, come yellow pine, red- ! wood, spruce and chestnut. A few shingles are &lt;&nbsp;made .from, hemlock, western yellow pine, white • pine and a few others; but their total amount j is of little comparative consequence in. the shirfc ! gle industry of this country. Western red cedar &lt;&nbsp;is practically the only kind that has a national </span><span class="font8">■</span><span class="font1"> market. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The northern white cedar is consumed largely ’ in the Central West and Northwest, and south- ' ern white cedar in the Southwest and East. Cy- , press shingles are used throughout the East, and southern pine shingles find their principal market in the South. AU other shingles are used very largely in restricted local regions, except redwood, which has developed a wide market outside California as well, as within that state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Next to Washington, which is preeminently the leading shingle manufacturing state, accordr ing to government statistics the following areX the leading stales in order of production: Oregon, cutting western red cedar; Louisiana, with its cypress and yellow pine shingles; California, cutting redwood; Maine, turning out large quantities of northern white cedar; and Michigan, with its great cedar shingle output.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Shingle Qualifications</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">rpiIESE are some of the qualifications in wood that are used for shingles: Shingles must withstand varying conditions of moisture, the effects of wealhering and the rapid changes of temperature. Non-durable woods are practically unused for shingle purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Lightness in weight is very important in shingle transportation. In order to compete successfully the wood must be very light in weight, in order to minimize the heavy transportation charges incident to the shipping of shingles to great distances. Shingles therefore are al-'&quot;*&quot;' ways thoroughly seasoned before shipment by rail. This is done usually by dry steam after they are placed in kilns; hut if they are overheated it greatly shortens the life of the shingles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shingles must retain nails without loosening. Zinc nails are commonly used in connection with many of our shingles, as they do not rust. These nails are commonly called galvanized nails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shingles must not check, warp or twist out of shape when once placed flat on the roof. Prevention of leakage is of great importance. Shingles should preferably be straight and evengrained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To meet the above qualifications, the western , red cedar has been found to be an ideal shingle wood, in addition to the fact that it is abundantly available. Other trees, such as northern white cedar and the southern white cedar, make pi optically the same quality of shingles as the western variety of red cedar; but they are more inclined to be knotty, and are narrower in rvidth inasmuch as they are made from much smaller trees. Other species yielding shingles of very high quality are cypress and redwood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Haw Material</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">rpHE material used for the manufacture of J- shingles comes to the mills in. the form of bolts or logs. This raw material is usually logged in large lumber operations, and sold directly to the shingle mills. This constitutes a sepa-/&quot;Srate industry in the Northwest. Very often the poorer quality of logs are separated and sold to the shingle mills, since very excellent shingles can be made from hollow-butted, rotten or wormy logs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">.Ranchers and those clearing land commonly cut cedar stumps and trees into 52-inch bolt lengths and sell them directly to the mills. Logging of shingle timber is done largely by donkey engines and railroads, or by chutes and by the use of drivable streams. The production of the raw material for the manufacture of shingles is usually carded on by separate companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Costs</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">S</span><span class="font1">HINGLE logs bring between $15 and $25 or more per thousand hoard-feet, delivered at the mill. Bolts in 52-inch lengths bring from $4 to $8 or piore per cord at the mill. The price depends upon the quality of the timber and the local demand at the time of delivery. The market on shingles fluctuates continually, hence the value of the raw material fluctuates accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In logging southern white cedar for shingle production, the trees are cut into 62-inch and 84-ineh lengths. Three holts, for 20-ineh shingles, can be made out of 62-inch logs; and four bolts, for 18-inch shingles, from 84-inch logs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A shingle cord in eastern Virginia and North Carolina in 1907 was considered to be a stack of bolls four feet high by five feet wide by seven feet long, and containing 140 cubic feet, or 600 log feet. At the present time a shingle cord in this region is considered to be a stack of bolts four feet high by four feet wide by eight feet long, and containing 128 cubic feet. This is considered equivalent to 500 feet, board measure, by the Doyle rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the manufacture of cypress, southern pine and whiie pine shingles, defective or misshapen logs are commonly butted by means of a cut-off saw, at the top of the jack ladder in the sawmill; and the short lengths are sent down a chute to the shingle mill on the lower floor. Mills known as combination mills often make cants out of their poor logs. Cants are logs ripped into heavy timbers of all sizes, which are then sent to the shingle mill to be cut into blocks for shingles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In a typical case the cost of logging shingle bolts of v. astern red cedar was $3.75 per cord. The prices paid for bolts on this operation varied from $4.75 to $5.50 per cord. Eight thousand “Star A” 62-inch shingles were derived from each 1000 feet of logs. Each cord of shingle bolts contains on an average, about 850 board feet. Each cord was made up of twenty-five to forty bolts, each fifty-two inch esin length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Shingle Bolt Qualifications</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">G</span><span class="font1">ENERALLY, the shingle manufacturers prefer their shingle bolts in such sizes that from twenty to thirty make up a cord, and it is commonly accepted that a cord of these bolts is equivalent to about 700 board-feet. No trees less than fifteen inches at the butt are ordinarily accepted for making shingle bolls; but this is not a standaid rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The western red cedar usually grows with a large flared butt, especially in the oldest and biggest specimens. In these cases the swollen butt is cut up into shingle bolts; and the upper part of the trunk, which is less tapered, is utilized for saw-logs or for poles and piling, unless too large. The best timber for shingle purposes are I he trees with a straight, slightly tapering and limbless bore, straight grain, and as free as possible from such defects as rot, shake, cheek, limbs, worms, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A few years ago, when all stumps in logging camps were cut from five to twenty feet high with the aid of spring-boards, shingle mills frequently moved from place to place and obtained I heir raw material at a low figure; and it generally was of such high quality that profits were excellent. These small mills were easily portable, with only one upright shingle machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The cost of logging shingle bolts, southern vhite cedar, is approximately $8.50 per cord. Each, cord contains about 500 board-feet, by the Beyle ruE. Thc^c data are supplied by Mr. Ector F. Claik, for the southern white cedar industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are vaiiou® forms of shingle machines now placed upon the market. Formerly they were entirely of the horizontal variety, with a provision to make the standard shingle with a thick, butt and a thin tip. Machines used in the varh days of the industry were devised to cut fiom one to ten blocks at the same time. In recent years the horizontal machines have been largely supplanted by the upright shingle machines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Modern </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font1">HE equipment in a modern shingle mill usually consists of the following machinery: A Drag or swinging circular cut-off saw—usually run by steam or electricity, and used to cut logs or bolts to the desired length. Drag saws are generally preferred with large timber, as they are adaptable to all-sized logs. But they are also objectionable, because they do not make a smooth cut and therefore result in rough-butted shingles. Bolts arc usually cut into shingle block lengths by means of small stationary circular saws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font1"> Bolter or “Knee Bolter” is a circular saw revolving in a horizontal plane and fed by a small carriage controlled by the knee of the operator. This saw is used to remove the bark and any exterior defects and to cut the bolt into proper sizes for the shingle machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Shingle Machines. These were formerly of the horizontal type, as stated above; but they have been largely replaced by the upright machines, which were introduced within recent years from the Lake states. All </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">horizontal</span><span class="font1"> types are regulated to make the standard-size shingles having the thick butt and thin tip, and with provision for taking from one to ten blocks at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The vertical or upright type Shingle Machine consists of a stationary circular saw, revolving in a vertical plane. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font1"> vertical sash frame holds the block and operates with a longitudinal reciprocating motion. Attached to the frame are spur rolls, one above the other, v’hich automatically alternate the butt cut, from the top to the bottom of the block, with each backward stroke of the frame. This, of course, means a minimum of waste, which runs as low as ten percent of A the rav/ material in the most modern mills using the upright machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Jointer or Clipper Saw is a vertical type stationary saw. There are some types called the Wheel Jointer, carrying several revolving steel knives, set in a radial fashion. The Jointer “edges'-’ or “joints’’ the shingle, making the two sides parallel and trimming off wane or uneven edges, knots and norm holes, rotten wood, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Shingle Packer consists of a bench frame and two slotted, overhanging steel rods. After the operator places the shingles into the frame the rods are pressed down, packing the shingles tightly together, the thin tips overlapping ; while the metal strips are nailed. Foot </span><span class="font8">■</span><span class="font1"> levers are used to draw the wooden cleats to-^ gether and hold the shingles tight until the strips are fastened. The daily capacity of the five types of Packers is about as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Ten-block Packer</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Double-block Packer</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Single-block Packer</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Hand Packer</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The removal of the tariff on shingles by th© Federal Government has seriously affected the manufacturers in Washington and Oregon. British Columbia manufacturers have the advantage of cheap Oriental labor; better grades of raw material, since the timber runs better in »r that section; and greater concentration of capital and industrial conditions. There were about 115 shingle establishments in British Columbia ten years ago, which number has steadily increased. They export from one to four billion shingles to the United States annually.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font1">HE season generally known amongst the people as Lent has recently come to a close. That is a period of time beginning with Ash Wednesday and continuing for forty days, ending approximately at the season when Jesus Christ was crucified. Of course Lent is not a Scriptural term. It is an appendage of the church systems and a man-made arrangement, jit deceives the people, by suggesting to them Ihat they can be holy for forty days and do as they please the rest of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The famous American clergymen who have recently been making known through the public pre^s their great wisdom observe, of course, all the ceremonies in connection with Lent, and inci dently they connect the same vith the name of Jesus Christ; but not one of them will explain to tlm people the real meaning of the death and resurrection of our Lord. Probably there are tvo reasons for their failure to do so; (1) because they do not believe the Bible record, and (2) not understanding the Bible they do not see nor appreciate the meaning of the death of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">।</span><span class="font1"> The death of Jesus upon the cross and His ^resurrection are of such primary importance to the people that it becomes the duty and privilege of every Christian to keep these truths before the mind and to tell others about them. 'As the anniversary of the death of Jesus, with which Lent and Easter have been erroneously connected, is still fresh in our minds, I shall attempt this morning to briefly review this matter from the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To properly understand and to observe the Memorial of Jesus’ death means to honor the name of Jehovah God. He is the Author of the great plan for the salvation of man. Jehovah loves and rewards loyalty. To observe what He has pointed out for us to do and to do it joyfully means loyalty to Him. Eleven of the disciples of Jesus stood loyally by Him and thereby proved their loyalty to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus was about to take His departure, hence He left with His disciples a message of commen-'»4Ution and promise. His words apply to all others who have been inducted into His body by the anointing of the Father. In substance He said to them: “You have been with Me during My trying experiences. You have been loyal and faithful to Me. My Father has made a covenant with Me to give Me the kingdom. This He does because of His loving kindness, and I delight to do His will. I now invite you to be broken with Me and pour out your life blood w’ith Me and then be with Me in My kingdom?—Luke 22: 28, 29.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">eas</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">The disciples did not understand at that time the full import of Jesus’ words. At Pentecost they began to understand, and then they more clearly saw thereafter the purpose of the fie-moriah Tim privilege of partaking with the Lord in H'S death appears more vmndcrfnl fo Christians as they journey near the end of the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memorial Prefigured</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1!!K Memorial of our Lord’s death was pT-o--®- figured by the Memorial of the slariim of the original Passover lamb in Egypt. That the significance of the occasion might be legularlv brought to mind, Jehovah provided for the children to ask this question during the progress of the Passover supper: “What mean ye by this service?” The one presiding at the feast was instructed to be true to God and to the true historical facts, and to answer in substance: “It is the sacrifice of the Lord’s passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses.”—Exodus 12: 26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It seems appropriate, therefore, in view of the recent celebration of this event, to review briefly the things which led up to and which grow out of our Lord’s Memorial. Each consecrated child of the Lord may fittingly ask: “What mean ye by this service?&quot; Not that the question implies ignorance; but a review of the Lord’s benefits to us, and of all our honorable privileges, is healthful to all in covenant relationship with Jehovah. The health and safeguarding of His people was undoubtedly the thought of the Lord in ordaiirng a memorial of the death both of the Passover lamb and of its reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah has long been accused of being a boastful and self-centered God, but He is not such. By the Passover He was not inviting attention to Himself for self-gratification or vainglory, or for any other selfish reason. Jehovah is the personification of perfect unselfishness. Pure love and selfishness could not inhere in Him at the same time. He has been and will for ever be above all selfishness and self-eenteredness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For over sixty centuries now God’s love has expressed itself in mercy and daily goodness toward an ingrate race, without their knowing it and without their seeking as yet to know and thank the T' spenser of all the good things they enjoy. Instead of turning in contempt away from those who ignore Himanddismissingthem for ever from His attention, Jehovah “humbleth himself to behold the tilings that are in heaven, and in die earth” (Psalm 113:6), and condescends to bring His own name to the fore that the teachable and righteously disposed ones wav be blessed thereby. lie lots it be known that He is God, in order that His creatures may be delivered from tho trap and toils of the deceptive sham god, Satan. Witness an instance oi this as recorded in Sacred Writ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Wm had many false gods and worshiped idols. Joseph had taught the ruling factors of Egypt concerning the true and living God. Disclaiming am eindit lor interpreting Pharaoh’s dream, Joseph had said: “It is not in me: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">God</span><span class="font1"> shall give Pharaoh an answer in peace. . . . </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">God </span><span class="font1">he th shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In course of time God fulfilled Pharaoh’s di cam and the interpretation thereof. Thus He gave testimony to the fact that the Egyptians did not worship Him but served Satan, the in-vwiMe god of Egypt, yet that Jehovah is supreme and can control the affairs of Egypt re-gai'dle&quot;? of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pudoubtedly the Pharaoh who was contemporary to Joseph respected Joseph’s God. After Joseph’s death Satan quickly caused the Egyptians to forget how Joseph’s God had once saved the nation from ruin. A Pharaoh rose up who did not acknowledge the God of the Hebrews. Mimicking Satan, who was the real power behind Egypt’s throne, Pharaoh outrageously ground down the Hebrews with hard labor and bondage and unjust legislation, intending thereby to destroy them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Had Pharaoh gratefully remembered Jehovah’s good turn to Egypt during Joseph’s administration things bright have gone better for the Egyptians. The reputation of Jehovah as a God of superior ability to Egypt’s gods was at stake. His name was in question both among the heathen as well as among His favored people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Conditions at that time pictured the conditions of mankind during the Christian era, and particularly at the present time. Pharaoh, servant to the Devil, together rvith his hard-hearted taskmasters, pictured Satan, the invisible super-lord of this world, and his angelic cohorts. Th^ Egyptians represented the people of this time organized under the forms of government or kingdoms of this wmrld. They give God’s people scant sympathy. The oppressed Hebrews represent the people of God, present or prospective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">few</span><span class="font1"> are now faithful to Jehovah God, but hundreds of thousands of them are attached to the denominational idols of this world; they are woefully ignorant of God’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">name; they are in a.</span><span class="font1"> slave-like condition and languishing in the ecclesiastical prisons. Their Jives are made bitter by the heavy burdens which clerical prison-keepers load upon tnem to build up and sustain the great building operations of the religious systems. Since 1918 their sighingu and groaj^ ings tmve come up to the Lord God. He is not untouched by their oppressed eoiidi.ti.on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Egypt Jehovah miraculously preserved and raised up Moses. Moses, willing to serve as the foreiunner of The Christ, was willing to suffer with the people of God, which sufferings foreshadowed the sufferings of The Christ. God rewarded his fe‘&gt;tnfillness by using him. in th© deliverance of Israel. Logically the deliverance must be identified with the true Deliverer, in oid w that all vAo shared in the deliverance, or who witnessed it, might know’ who is truly re-spoi'wble for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">S’ace the Deliverer was bound to show Uis idc-ioity. His name, the Lord, with all propriety revealed H i 5 name to Uis chosen w itness. Moses. He was iiistraoted to publish God’s nemo first to God’s own people. Conditions warranted His making a name for Himself among His chosen people. “Thus saith the Lord God, In the day^ when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and mads myself known unto </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ihem</span><span class="font1"> in the land of Egypt, ivben I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the Lord [Jehovah] your God.”—Ezekiel 20:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Through Moses God showed three preliminary signs to the Hebrews to convince them that He is God. Then He sent Moses to publish the name of God in the courts of the rulers of Egypt. When His servant demanded Israel’s release in the name of God, Pharaoh brazenly retorted: “Who is Jehovah, that I should obey his voice?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Who is God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I</span><span class="font1">T AT once became evident that the name of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah rather than the liberation of the Hebrews was at issue. Nobody was being benefited by this general disregard of God’s worthy name. To vindicate His name and to frame it with its proper glory called for a demonstration. That demonstration should he painful to the Egyptians and simultaneously be a blessing and joy to the ones who were not ashamed to be associated with God’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The series of nine plagues followed. By staying each successive plague at the entreaty of Pharaoh, God was making a name for His goodness as ’well as for His power. Pharaoh did not ^profit by these lessons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">God announced to Moses, and in turn through Moses to the Hebrew’s and to the Egyptian court, that the tenth and last plague would sweep into death all the first-born of man and beast. The Israelites could escape solely by conforming to Jehovah’s commandments. God decreed that the month of the deliverance should be the beginning of the Jewish year. On the tenth day thereof each Jewish household was instructed to take a male lamb or a kid, unblemished and of the first year, into the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the evening which marked the beginning of the fourteenth day this Jamb was to be slain. A testimony was to be given both to the Lord and to the Egyptians by sprinkling the doorposts and lintels with the lamb’s blood. Then the Israelites were to retire into their houses and remain in all night. The Iamb must be roasted with fire, not a bone of it being broken. X In anticipation of the coming deliverance the Israelites were to come to the meal all equipped for their march into freedom at a moment’s notice. They must come girded, shod, and furnished with staff. The roast lamb was to be served with bitter herbs, indicative of their galling servitude. All partakers of the repast who were males muat bear in them the sign of God’s covenant with Abraham, which was circumcision. None of the lamb was to be left until the morning. All of it must be disposed of, either by eating the whole of it or by disposing of the leavings by fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the eventful night the angel of the Lord passed through Egypt. Upon every door where the blood of the lamb appeared he passed it over. In every household where the blood did not appear the first-born was put to death, as it is written: “For there was not a house among the Egyptians where there was not one dead.” Instead of this turning the Egyptians to Jehovah it angered the governing factors and the Israelites were thrust out of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">What Was Foreshadowed</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270601_files/g_E_19270601-4.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">LL these happenings foreshadowed similar events of greater magnitude to transpire in the future. Moses, acting as the deliverer of the Hebrews, foreshadowed Christ the Messiah, as it is stated in Deuteronomy 18:15. God used Moses because he was faithful to Him. Moses </span><span class="font8">■</span><span class="font1">withstood Pharaoh and acted for the liberation of the people. Christ Jesus, whom he foreshadowed, will destroy Satan and his organization, foreshadowed by Pharaoh and his government, and will liberate the peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first-born ones of Egypt were the chief of all the strength of the Egyptians. They were the ones who would fall heir to the estate and responsibilities of government. Their counterpart is found today in the ruling elements of this world, to wit, the unfaithful shepherds of the flock who claim to represent God, and their allies, the professional politicians and big financiers. The overthrow of the Egyptians and their complete destruction foreshadowed the destruction of Satan’s organization, which the Lord declares shall take place in the great battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The lamb slain also foreshadowed the Lord Jesus Christ, who as a perfect man should be slain to provide the redemptive price for the human race. Slain in Egypt it foreshadowed how Jesus would die on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus, by reason of human birth, was &quot;made of a woman”; and since that woman was a Jewess He was “made under the law”. Now the keeping of a yearly memorial on the anniversary of the slaying of the Passover lamb was commanded upon the Israelites as a part o£ their covenant with the Lord. Recognizing His obligation to observe this feature of the Law, Jesus drew the inner circle of His disciples about Him in an upper room in Jerusalem, for in that city Jehovah had commanded that the Passover Memorial must be held.—Deuteronomy 16:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was the evening and hence the beginning of the fourteenth day of Nisan, the first month of the Jewish calendar. As they were gathered about the board, Jesus said unto His disciples: “With desire have I desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.” He had special desire to eat because He was soon to suffer even unto death. Before another Passover season could roll around He would no longer be in the flesh as a Jew but would have ascended to His heavenly Father. So He said: “For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memorial Instituted</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font1">HROUGHOUT the three and one-half years of His ministry Jesus had been proclaiming, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” And now He knew that within not many hours He who was the King, and who at that time was the sole representative of God’s kingdom on earth, would be slain in fulfilment, of the paschal lamb’s 'death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hence, after the requirements of the Law had been complied with by eating of the roast lamb, &quot;Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disdples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And lie took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all [that is to say, ’All ye drink’] of it: for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hitherto the Passover lamb had represented the Lord’s flesh. His body; but now from henceforth Jesus ordained that the loaf of unleavened bread was to stand for His body. Hence His words, “This [loaf] is [represents] my body.” The bread being unleavened pictured the same thing as the lamb being “without blemish”, namely, the sinlessness and inherent justification of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Correspondingly, the blood of the paschal lamb had foreshadowed the blood of Jesus, but following Jesus’ death the cupful of wine was to represent the shed blood of our dear Redeemer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hence His words of explanation, “This [wine] is [represents] my blood of the new testament” By this statement Jesus also linked up His blood with the New Covenant, even as the blood of the paschal lamb was linked with the Law Covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Long years ago Jehovah had testified that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">H&amp; </span><span class="font1">would make a New Covenant with the house oi Israel, by which covenant lie would take away j their sins and remember them no more. (Jere- * miah 31:31-34) The fact that there was to be a New Covenant indicated that the Mosaic Law Covenant would grow old or out of date and vould be succeeded with a new and improved covenant.- -Hebrews 8: 7-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now the days were come for the New Testament or Covenant to be made. Jesus’ co</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font1">ent, on the wine-cup show’s that the New Covenant was made at the time that His blood flowed on Calvary. The institution of the Memorial of His death was really the first feature of that New Covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Three Covenants</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19270601_files/g_E_19270601-5.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">HE Scriptures disclose three great cove-J^ nan is relating to th e recovery of mankind, to v’it: (1) God’s unconditional promise to Abraham, w’hich is a one-sided covenant, because God bound only Himself to do anything, and it is therefore called a unilateral covenant; (2) the first Law Covenant, made by Jehovah, on one side and Moses on the other side as mediator for the nation of Israel; and (3) the New Law<sup>r</sup> Covenant, with God on one side and Jesus Christ on the other side as the legal representative on behalf of Israel and through Israel for the whole world of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is a close relationship between these covenants, and the Memorial links them together more completely than any other incident recorded in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The seed of the first or unconditional promise to Abraham was pictured in Isaac and fulfilled in Christ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus.</span><span class="font1"> The old or first Law </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Covenant </span><span class="font1">gave life to no one, because no one was abl® to keep the terms of the law. That Law Covenant, however, served as a schoolmaster to lead Israel to Christ.—Galatians 3:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A schoolmaster is one who instructs. Th© law, therefore, served as an instructor of Israel, dS God’s purposes to grant life to the people through the New Covenant; and that the bk©3 that would ratify that covenant must be the blood of the One who would be the Redeemer and afterward become the Mediator and Lifegiver. The law demonstrated to Israel the absolute necessity of a Savior and a Mediator able to save to the uttermost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The blood shed at the commencement of the Law Covenant was the blood of the paschal lamb. That lamb represented Moses, and was ^ain instead of Moses. Moses foreshadowed Christ. “The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.&quot; &quot;I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him”—-Dueteronomy 18:15,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Better Things to Crnne</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font1">HE law being a shadow of &quot;better things to come” (Heb. 10:1), the paschal lamb slain at the Passover foreshadowed the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world. (John 1:29) The people of Israel were without the right to life, because of sin; and the Law Covenant promised the taking away of their sin and the giving to them of life on the condition named.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But the conditions could not be met by them. The New Covenant likewise promises life to all who accept and obey its terms: but its Mediator is able to make all keep that covenant who want to keep it. It therefore follows that through the terms of the New Covenant the people must get life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When Jesus had been raised from the dead, and bad ascended on high, Jehovah did not see good to inaugurate the New Testament at that time. Not that Jesus was not then sufficient for the service, nor that the blood of His human sacrifice was not of sufficient worth to be the basis of that covenant; but because Jehovah had other gracious purposes in view. These purposes provided for other “able ministers of the new testament”, for at Mount Sinai Moses as mediator of the Law Covenant had foreshadowed not only Jesus but also the members of the body of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the time of Jesus’ appearing in God’s presence these body members of Christ were still to be drawn out of the world, justified through faith in Christ’s blood, called, begotten of the Father’s will, anointed with His spirit, coa« formed unto the image of His dear Son, prove® faithful unto death, and raised up in glory from the dead to be united with their glorified Head, _ Furthermore, as the Law Covenant was made in Egypt but was inaugurated at Mount Sinai<sub>? </sub>even so the New Testament, made by the sacrifice of the Lamb of God on earth, must be inaugurated in the mount, the kingdom of God, in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After distributing the memorial emblems Jesus said to His disciples: “This do in remembrance of me.” (1 Corinthians 11:24) By this injunction He did not mean that the disciples were to have Him in mind to the exclusion of, or in preference to, the heavenly Father. All He could have meant was that His followers should thus celebrate, not in remembrance of the Passover lamb originally slain in Egypt, but in remembrance of the true Lamb of God that takes away the world’s sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In other words, they should regard the reality, the fulfilment, rather than the ancient shadow. Instead of showing forth the Passover lamb’s death, “ye do show forth the Lord’s death till he come.” Surely the Savior did not wish to draw the chief attention to Himself and to ’detract from the praise of His heavenly Father. He knew that the Passover of old was the Lord &quot;Jehovah’s Passover”, and that the celebrants were not to have the paschal lamb so much in mind as they were to have Jehovah in mind as the great Deliverer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Likewise, at the Memorial Christians should not think chiefly of Jesus, the Lamb of God, but of Jehovah, the adorable Author of the plan of deliverance and the generous Giver of that “unspeakable gift” through which the deliverance is wrought. Highest praise should go to “the Eternal One”, “of whom are all things and we in him.” It was therefore most befitting that before distributing the emblem of His body and blood Jesus gave thanks to the heavenly Father; also that at the conclusion of the service he and His disciples sang a hymn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Significance</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font1">HE significance which Jesus attached to the Memorial is of primary importance. Had He detailed the full significance thereof He would have had many things to tell His disciples. But they could not understand them thenj be« cause they had not received the illumination and appreciation of the holy spirit. He left it for the Apostle Paul to call to our attention the deeper meaning, by his pointed words in 1 Corinthians 10:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was specially in the light of this that th® Apostle Paul warned the members of the church that some might eat the bread, and drink the cup of tlie Lord unworthily and be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. Hence he solemnly counsels us, saying, “Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.’’—1 Corinthians 11: 23-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Lord has a cup and a table, and the Devil has likewise. (1 Corinthians 10:21) A Christian cannot consistently partake of both. He should keep Iris spiritual perception quickened so as to “discern the Lord’s body”. The Memorial calls his attention to that body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The loaf of unleavened bread represents not only the fleshly body of Jesus but also his mystic body, in which the 144,000 called and chosen and faithful ones are privileged to be lumbers. Through eating’ Christ’s flesh m a figurative sense, they received justification by faith, which led io their acceptance and sacrifice and membership in Christ’s body. As partakers of the body of Christ they are privileged to be biokon with Him as the one loaf was broken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Memorial wine symbolizes Jesus’ bloodstream, which had the value of a perfect human Me. But it also symbolized that blood poured Ln th from Uis earthly body; in other words, 1Jis sacrificial death, entailing considerable sufferings. Blood-drinking was punishable by death among the Hebrews, according to God’s plain law. (Leviticus 17 :10) Drinking the Memorial cup pictured the drinkc-rs’ being joined with Christ in death by a covenant by saciifi.ce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Only those who “endure [breaking] with him shall reign vith him”. Only those who are and ho i emnin “dead uith him shall live with him”. To Jive with Him means the attainment of life on the same plane of existence with Him, namely, immortality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Under the New Covenant arrangement mankind shall be privileged to eat the flesh of Christ Jesus and thereby gain justification at the conclusion of the Millennial Age. But Jesus discriminated between His few disciples and the vast race of mankind, by saying, “Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you,” that is, no immortality. Such is God’s way of giving immortality instead of the way stated by the famous </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font1">er* lean clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Who May Partake?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">rpiIOSE who discern the Lord’s body and dis-®- cern themselves to be faithfully abiding in that body may properly partake of the Lord’s Memorial. Just as no uncircumcised male, be h^-natural Jew or Gentile, might partake of th® Passover, so no unconsecrated person may partake of ihe emblems of our Lord’s body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah confined the holding of the Passover memorial to the city of Jerusalem. In close harmony with this picture he limits the celebrating of the Lord’s death to those dwelling in His organization, of which Jerusalem was the symbol. Only those who dwell as members in His body may do as He so indicated -when He said</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">: “He</span><span class="font1"> that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him.”—John 6: 56.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is a rare privilege then to d* ink the Lord’s cup, a privilege confined solely to the Christian era. Very soon “all” the faithful disciples will have drunk their share of it. The Apostle correctly calls it “the cup of blessing which we bless”. Can we not give thanks for it as did Jesus? We can. As the wine spelled death to the trampled grapes but joyful exhilaration to the drinker thereof (Judges 9:13), likewise the Memorial cup symbolizes a death potion joined together with a draught of fulness of joy eternally. There is joy even amid the death potion because God’s loving kindness is better than life. —Psalm 63:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The cup does not represent experiences, although drinking the cup will lead to experiences. It sjmbolizes the will of God toward the members of The Christ. Obedience to that will, as pictured by imbibing from the cup, results in human death but also in endless supernal joys. It was in this latter sense that Jesus referred to the cup, saying, “I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And now the kingdom of God has come! Th&gt;-Lord Jesus has come in His kingdom. In 1914 Jehovah God gave it to Him as His du® right and sent the rod of His strength out of Zion,, saying, “Rule thou in the midst ofl thine enemies.” As the Chief Executive and Priest of th® Most High God He went forth to vindicate Hi®</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Father's name, which He so loves and honors, highly joyful in His privilege of thus doing. Thus the Lord drank the wine of joy in the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Joy</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A</span><span class="font1">T THE same time it is the privilege of the faithful saints still on earth to sip a foretaste of that wine of the Lord’s kingdom joys. The Lord, having come to His temple in 1918, paused a thorough purging of the priests, “the sons of Levi,” polished brightly with “the present truth” and gloriously reflecting the light of the truth to the utmost ends of the earth. These He has covered with the “robe of righteousness” from Jehovah. At the realization of this fact the anointed ones do greatly rejoice in Jehovah, and their souls are joyful in their God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To these the King, enthroned on Zion, gives “the testimony of Jesus Christ”, saying, “Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler ever many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.” Fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore await their entrance actually into the Father’s presence. Then they shall in the com-^te sense enter into the kingdom which Jesus has covenanted for them.-Luke 22:29, </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dtaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">W</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">hil</span><span class="font1">e not unmindful of the keen sufferings of our beloved Head and Redeemer Jesus, neither unsympathetic therewith, yet the disciples of Jesus may partake of the Memorial with kingdom joy in their hearts. It is a feast of deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Though the Memorial points backward to our Lord’s death nineteen hundred years ago, and reminds ns of our covenant to suffer and be dead with Him, it also points forward to the future deliverance which the wide-awake disciples &amp;ee drairing near, deliverance during this dark night through the Lamb’s death, and deliverance out of their own death state by the triumphal first resurrection. As long as Christians are in the flesh, dying with the Lord Jesus, can they forget or overlook His sufferings? It is our privilege to “show forth the Lord’s death *till He come”, which means until His kingdom is in full operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When at Pentecost the holy spirit had come and illuminated the minds of the faithful disciples, and they had learned the real meaning ©f the Memorial which the Lord had instituted and requested them to keep, it must have thrilled their hearts with joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Previously they had hoped to be a part of His earthly kingdom. Now they saw that they were to be members of the house of God, eternal in the heavens, not made with hands; that they would see Jesus in all His glory and beauty, and be by Him presented to the great eternal Father ; that they would dwell for ever in the house of the Lord and behold His beauty and inquire in His temple (Psalm 27:4); that then they would experience fulness of joy and pleasures for evermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As they thus contemplated the blessings to come they would remember the Avoids of the Master vhen He said: “But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit, of the vine, until that day when I drink it new .with you in my Father’s kingdom.”-—Matthew 26: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">When to Celebrate</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">W</span><span class="font1">HAT is the proper time to observe the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Memorial? Some erroneously celebrate the Lord’s Supper every Sabbath morning, while others observe it at stated intervals during the year, and some only when convenient. There could be but one proper time. By way of illustration I ask, Why do the people of America celebrate the Fourth of July once a year? Th© answer is, Because that day is the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence and deliverance of the American people from the bondage of an oppressive monarch. No one would think of celebrating it more than once a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus died once, and His death will result in the complete deliverance of the people from the bondage of Satan’s organization and from death. It is proper to celebrate the Memorial of His death therefore once each year, and not oftener. The anniversary of His death is the fourteenth of Nisan, according to the Jewish calendar. The day begins at six o’clock in the evening. On Friday evening, the fifteenth of April, after six p. m. and during that night, was the proper time this year to celebrate the Memorial of our Lord’s death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All who are qualified to partake, whether they be Catholic or Protestant, should do so. Th© qualifications required are: Full faith in th® blood of Christ Jesus, a full consecration to do God’s will, justification by faith and being begotten by the holy spirit It is manifest the® that the dergy who repudiate the Wood of Christ could, never partake ef the Memorial with propriety. It is only for tree Christian^. The clergy have misrepresented and misused the Memorial of our Lord’s death, as they hava almost all other parts of God’s plan. It tea ever been the purpose of Satan to make- it a laughing stock or a delusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The practice of Lent, of Ash Wednesday, and Easter, and like things, vludi are incidentally connected with the Lord’s death, have been used to blind ths people t@ ths true meaning thereof. Let the people lean? th® truth and observe what is taught in God’s Word. They must choose to follow either that or the famous American clergy. I opine that th® people now desire to follow God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The sacrifice of the paschal lamb by the Jews once each year foreshadowed the sacrifice of the Lamb of God, Christ Jesus, which takes away the sm of the world; to wit, the sin which Adam committed and which brought condemnation upon all men. Eighteen hundred and ninety-four years ago Jesus, the Lamb of God, was sacrificed as the Passover of Uis true followers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His life blood poured out was the basis fpx the New Covenant which will he ratified in tire kingdom, and through that New Covenant the way for complete deliverance of mankind will be opened and all the families of the earth will have an opportunity to receive the blessings of life, liberty and happiness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">[Radiocast team Station WBBR on a wav®</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A</span><span class="font1">S THEY moved from Egypt toward the promised land Israel represented all mankind, all who win ever have any hope of everlasting life. And, indeed, outside the camp proper there was a mixed multitude who followed along with Israel, who represented those who will eventually be out off from. God, destroyed in the second death. The eamp itself, in a general way, represented all who ever claim to be God’s people, Greek and Roman and other Catholics, 163 kinds of Protestants, all kinds of Jews, Moslems, ete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Near the eenter the ©amp, grouped around the Tabernacle, </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ob</span><span class="font1"> its four sides, were the Levites, who in a very special sense represented Huos® whc i® aS ages are really God’s people and who really will gai®. everlasting life on some jriaus of being. These Levites were of four families. the Amramites, Merarites, Kohathites and Gershonites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Amramites were the guard of honor on the east side o&quot; the Tabernacle, where was the oniy gate into it? rjaered precincts. The Merarites were oncamped on the north side, the Kohathites on the ijouth side and the Gershonites on the west side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Our heavenly Father so overruled the naming of the immediate descendants of Levi that we see in their names a key to something of interest to ns in Uh wnneetion. Amram means high </span><span class="font6">length of 416.4 meters by C. J. Woodworth.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">or exalted people; Merari means bitterness; Kohath means ally or comrade; while Gershon means refugees or rescued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The meanings of these names, and the arrangement of these sections of the tribe of Ldvr* about the Tabernacle, show the relation of the four classes of saved humanity toward the great plan of God. On the east, in the direct path of salvation, the first to be reached by the rising rays of the “Sun of righteousness”, are the high or exalted people, the Christ, Head and body. The Amramites represented the complete Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the west, the last to be reached by the rays of truth and life, are the rescued ones from amongst mankind, who will attain to an earthly salvation during the Millennial reign. The Gershonites, refugees or rescued ones, represented those who will attain this earthly salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Between those to the east and those to the west were the Merarites on the north and the Kohathites on the south. The north represents heavenly things, a heavenly nature. The Bible shows that millions, an immense company, will gain a heavenly salvation which, however, will be inferior to that of The Christ; and that they*&quot; will come to it through great tribulations. The Merarites represent the great company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the south were the Kohathites. As the north represents heavenly things and a heavenly state, so the south represents earthly things and an earthly state. During the Millennial Age there will be a grand company of men, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Samuel, David, Daniel, Isaiah and all the holy prophets, who will be the allies or comrades of all the others. They will be in touch with The Christ, with the world of mankind and with the great company. The Kohathites represented the ancient worthies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">F’uW </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Manhood at Thirty</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I</span><span class="font1">T IS an item worth noting that none were invited to do any voik about the Tabernacle such as was allotted to the Kohathites unless they had attained to thirty years of age. This was the ago of manhood under the Jewish law. The thought seems to be that physical development takes place up to perhaps twenty-five years of age. but the full mental powers are not available until thirty. A man that is powerful mentally at twenty-five will be more powerful at thirty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now the Scriptures say of Christ Jesus that ju«t as he began to be thirty years of age, and this was probably the very day that He attained His legal majority, He went down into Jordan aJffkvas baptized. There He offered Himself to God to do everything that was written in the Book. He was a diligent student of the Scriptures, and applied to Himself this provision of the law which made a man acceptable to God, able to do a man’s perfect work, at the age of thirty. Thirty is the ideal age, the age of youth, vigor, experience and maximum vitality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One of the interesting things of the Jewish law was that every sin of a man against his neighbor was considered a sin against Almighty God, and was so stated to be, in Numbers 5:6, 7, and elsewhere. When a man or a woman committed such a sin the law required that when his or her guilt was made known, the guilty party v as to refund to the wronged one the amount of the trespass, with twenty percent added thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Then the law also provided that if the person trespassed against were dead, and had left no relatives, the required recompense must nevertheless be made, and in that instance should be made to the priest, who must, in any event, intercede for the erring one to obtain his reinstatement in divine favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We see the application of this in the antitype. The world’s great High Priest is The Christ, Jesus the Head and the church His body. In the Millennial Age there will be a complete righting of every wrong. Not a thing will be overlooked. The militarists and other murderers will be faced by their victims, the oppressors by those they have oppressed, the faithless by those they have wronged, the clergy by those to whom they have lied, the financiers by those whose faces they have ground in the dust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Restitution</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;DESTITUTION must be made; and more will be required, by twenty percent, than was dishonestly taken, ft will at once be seen that where millions of money have been involved there will be no chance of literal refunding of dishonestly gained vealih, for during the Lord’s reign there v ill be no chance to accumulate millions while others are living from hand to mouth. The Lord’s reign is for the very purpose of establishing equity in the earth, and it is not equity to let the powerful few grab the whole earth and invite the needy many to periodically kill one another off so that the earth will not be overcrowded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The restitution that will be required will be, in most instances, a public, open-handed, honest admission of previous wrong doing, accompanied by pledges to The Christ, who will then be in control, that nothing of the kind will be undertaken again. And this will be hard for many. Nothing can be held back. There must be a clean revealment of everything; and when it comes we can well believe the statement of the Prophet Daniel that “many shall awake to' shame and age-lasting contempt”, a contempt that will last until they have proven by their changed conduct that they are thoroughly in accord with the principles of justice and honesty, and thoroughly out of accord with tho principles of injustice and dishonesty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We have before pointed out that the Jewish Passover took place on the fourteenth day of the first month. This was at the full of the moon, symbol of the Law Covenant and the people under that Covenant. This illustrated Christ’s crucifixion at the full of the moon. The fact that it immediately began to wane foreshadowed Israel’s national decline which followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the Book of Numbers we have an interesting addition to this thought. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font1"> contained a provision that if any Jew was on a journey, or for other reasons could not participate in the Passover at the proper time, he was to keep the memorial four weeks later, on the fourteenth of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">second</span><span class="font1"> month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There was a grand reason for this provision. It represented that those who by ignorance were prevented from accepting Messiah as their Redeemer when first offered to ’them, will have an opportunity of doing so in the Mimes of restitution”—when the Jewish nation, Israel, represented by the moon, shall again be full of blessings in the Matter harvest”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mo^es Pictured Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I</span><span class="font1">NSTEAD of being a schemer after power and authority, the Scriptures show that Moses was really the overworked servant of the people. At length the burden became too great for him to bear and he cried to the Lord for relief. Then the Lord put a measure of His spirit upon seventy of the elders, fecundating their minds mechanically, without affecting them in any moral sense, so that they might hear the less complicated causes of friction, while the remainder were reserved for Moses himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The seventy were duly designated, and sixtyeight of the seventy repaired to the Tabernacle for the endowment promised and supplied; but two of the seventy remained in the camp, and </span><span class="font8">■</span><span class="font1">when the spirit was poured out upon the seventy they w<sup>r</sup>ere of those who were blessed and immediately began to prophesy, as did the others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some came to Moses and complained that there were some in the camp who were prophesying, and wanted Moses to forbid them to do so; but he answered, “Would God that all the Lord’s people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them.” Thus pointedly was Christ’s willingness to share the honors of the divine nature with His church exemplified. The world’s Messiah will be not the one individual, Christ Jesus, but the entire Christ—Jesus the H ead, and the church His body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The rock which Moses smote represented the Rock Christ Jesus. This is fully set forth by the Apostle Paul and needs no further comment. See 1 Corinthians 10:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As the children of Israel neared the end of their wanderings in the wilderness they came to a district still famous for the size and number of its reptiles. Many Israelites died frompthe bites of these reptiles. At the command of the Lord Moses erected a hrazen serpent and put it on a cross, and whoever looked upon the serpent was healed. Our Lord Jesus Himself tells us the meaning of this, saying that “as Moses lifted up the serpent in the </span><span class="font8">■</span><span class="font1">wilderness even so must the Son of man be lifted up”. The serpent we thus see primarily represented sin, Satan's agent in alluring our first parents into condemnation, and hence our Lord Jesus, wflio took tiro sinner’s place. The Scriptures add that “He made him who knew no sin to be a sin-offering for us”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bible students have long recognized that Israel's “cities of refuge” to which those guilty of manslaughter might flee for protection fromthe avenger very fitly represented Christ Jesus, God’s arrangement, God’s city of refuge, to whom we may flee from the avenger of blood, Satan. There is another item of interest in this connection. The one guilty of manslaughter was in danger of his life until the death of the high priest, but as soon as that occurred he was at liberty to return to his own home without molestation and without fear. Thus is illustrated the fact that in the new dispensation the church will be presented faultless before the Father’s presence, after the last member of the world's great High Priest, the Christ, the Messiah, has passed beyond the confines of this life.</span></p>

Well, the coming of two angels all the way from heaven to this earth was no small event either, and I. am sure you are anxious to find out when this event happened, and what the reasons were for their coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">rtome years before the experiences of our present lesson a boy was bom among the children of Shem, whom his parents named Abram. Abram was taught to honor and respect Jehovah and His promises, and he took a very keen interest in them. Because of his honesty, uprightness, sincerity and faith in God, he was given many blessings by our heavenly Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Lord made to Abram a very special promise. This promise was repeated several times, and it made such an impression upon his mind.that he gave everything else m life only secondary consideration. Be sure to remember this promise, for we shall refer to it in succeeding lessons. God promised Abram that He would make of him a great nation—give him MJghy children and grandchildren—and that through his seed or offspring all the families of the earth should be blest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, in. order to receive the fulfilment of this promise from our heavenly Father, it was necessary for Abram to move to the land of Canaan. After doing this the Lord told him that He would give to him and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to his seed or</span><span class="font1"> offspring, for an everlasting possession, all ths land of Palestine, which at that time was inhabited by the Canaanites. It is because of this promise made to Abram that the Hebrew people are now rebuilding Palestine as a permanent Jewish homeland. Abram believed the Lord, had faith, in His promise, and as soon as possible gathered together all his possessions of cattle, sheep and camels and, along with his wife, servants and his nephew Lot, moved over into the land of promise. God changed Abram’s name to Abraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">^Abraham and Lot prospered greatly in the land of Canaan and their herds multiplied and became so great in number that it was difficult to find sufficient pasture for them. As a result a rivalry sprang up between the herdsmen and shepherds of Lot and those of Abraham. This rivalry was so bitter that it became necessary for Abraham and Lot to separate. Abraham asked Lot to select the portion of country he wanted for his future home, saying that lie would take his possessions and go in the opposite direction. Acting somewhat selfishly, Lot chose the rich valley along the Jordan River, in which was located the wicked city of Sodom. Abraham moved back into the hills, away from the river; and this ended the strife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Lot was a righteous man, and the wickedness of the people of Sodom sorely vexed him. God sometimes finds it necessary to destroy people in order to prevent them from becoming so wicked that they will not believe or accept his plans or arrangements when His due time comes, which will be in the golden age. The Sodomites as well as those living in the neighboring city, Gomorrah, were the first people after the flood to reach this depraved condition. Therefore the Lord decided that all the inhabitants of Sodom, with the exception of the one righteous man and his family, should be destroyed. The Lord never destroys good people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In order to fulfil His promise the Lord actually sent two angels all the way from heaven to deliver Lot and his family from the unholy, wicked city of Sodom before He destroyed it. The two angels were entertained by Lot and his family overnight, and early the next morning took Lot and his wife and two daughters and hurried them out of the plain or valley in which Sodom and Gomorrah were located. Lot’s wife was so much in love with the conditions that she hesitated to leave them. After going some distance she longingly looked back at the city, and was turned to a pillar of salt. As soon as Lot and “his daughters had reached a place of safety, fire and lightning came down from heaven and destroyed the plain in which Sodom and Gomorrah were loeaied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this lesson we seo the bounds or limitations which God has set upon wickedness; Uis care for the righteous; and that this temporary destruction of the wicked is simply a manifestation of Uis great love for them; that they are to be brought hack to life again when God’s kingdom is established here on the earth, when the great promise God made to Abraham will he fulfilled: ‘Tn thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.”</span></p>

Jehovah is a kind and loving God; and although the wicked people had displeased Him, still He would not hurt them by burning them up or by sending wild beasts to eat them. Instead, God caused a big rain, the biggest rain that has ever come upon the earth, which gradually washed away all these wicked people; and not one escaped. They were all drowned.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">99. Noah and his family were kept safe from the waters in a big boat which the Lord had corn-manded Noah to build, and which sailed on top of the rainwater for forty days and nights, and kept the good man and his wife and children warm and dry.</span></p></li></ul>

After the waters had dried up, Noah and his family came out of the Ark, which was the name of the big boat that the Lord had commanded him to build; and they had the whole earth to themselves.

<li>
<p><span class="font1">101. In a few hundred years Noah’s descendants, his boys and girls, we might call them, peopled the earth again.

God has promised there will never be another deluge.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">102. Among the good people there was a man named Abraham, “the father of the faithful.” He loved God very much, and tried to do His will in everything. We have often noticed that God uses people to make pictures of things, and </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font1"> was the case with Abraham.

<li>
<p><span class="font1">104. Isaac grew up to be a fine strong young man; and his father was very proud of him indeed. One day God said to Abraham, “Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou Invest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon ©n® of the mountains which I will tell thee of.”</span></p></li>

This entrancing music is caught up by the multitude of earth and wafted back to heaven (for communication has been established between the perfect men and the perfect heavenly creatures), until every creature which is in heaven and on earth and the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, are praising God, saying^ “Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.” (Revelation 5:13), Every knee is bowing and every tongue is confessing that Jesus is the Christ, to the glory of God the Father. Every creature that has breath is now joining in the song. It is the Hallelujah chorus, and this is what they sing:</span></p>

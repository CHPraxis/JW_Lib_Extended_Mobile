Literacy Campaign Among Mexicans Appreciated
 Most of the 3,000 illiterate Mexicans who enrolled in the reading and writing classes of Jehovah’s witnesses in February, 1956, successfully finished the course by December of that year, and since February, 1957, 1,500 more enrolled. The 1958 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses in reporting on this activity quoted the following excerpt of a letter received from a Mexican school official in Veracruz, which is indicative of the way his government feels about this activity of the witnesses: “I am grateful for your co-operation, and in behalf of the state government I convey to you their most sincere congratulations for your noble progressive work for the benefit of the people in bringing the light of knowledge to the illiterate. . . . I wish you success in your educational work.” Incidentally, if the comparative handful of Jehovah’s witnesses can accomplish so much in such a short time, what could the world’s largest religious organization, which practically ran the country for four centuries, have accomplished had she really had the interests of the Mexican at heart?

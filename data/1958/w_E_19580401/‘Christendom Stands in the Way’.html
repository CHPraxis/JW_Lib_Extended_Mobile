<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> A former editor of <em>The Christian Century, </em>Charles Clayton Morrison, has gone on record, saying: “We have allowed Christendom to belie its own Christianity. It is Christendom that stands in the way of the world triumph of Christianity. In the Orient and in all non-Christian lands Christ is loved and the missionaries who teach his way of life are held in high esteem, but when statesmen and students come from afar to our shores and behold Christendom after nineteen centuries of Christian influence they turn back to their own faiths and traditions unconvinced and unpersuaded.”</p>

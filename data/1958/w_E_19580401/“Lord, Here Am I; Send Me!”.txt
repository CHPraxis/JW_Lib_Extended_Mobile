“Lord, Here Am I; Send Me!”
 At a home in Sumatra, Indonesia, where she was conducting a Bible study, a Watch Tower missionary was asked if the witnesses sang songs. She replied that they did and then taught the family the song entitled “Lord, Here Am I; Send Me!” They thought the song truly beautiful, but one member of the family observed that the missionary was the only one who had a right to sing that song, as Jehovah had not sent them. The missionary then showed them how they too could share in serving Jehovah and be sent by him. Imagine her surprise when at the next call she found that, acting upon her suggestions, they had obtained seven subscriptions for the Watchtower magazine among their friends and expressed their desire to attend the coming congregational Watchtower study. They came the following Sunday and no one sang the song “Lord, Here Am I; Send Me!” more earnestly than did this family.—1958 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

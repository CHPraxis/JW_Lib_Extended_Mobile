Indonesian Official Evaluates “The Watchtower”
 When the Society’s branch at Djakarta, Indonesia, applied for a paper license to begin printing Awake! magazine there in the Indonesian language, an official of the Ministry of Information said: “I consider the Menara Pengawal [The Watchtower] one of the best magazines in Indonesia and I am only too glad to help with the paper license for your new magazine.”—1958 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

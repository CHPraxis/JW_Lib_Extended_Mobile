FIELD MINISTRY
A Bible-study book, on the contribution of 50 cents, will be offered to persons contacted by Jehovah’s witnesses in their ministry during December. Thereafter, to aid interested ones to gain further knowledge of Jehovah God’s purposes, return calls will be made and home Bible studies started. For information on how you can share in this joyful work go to the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses or write this office.
NEW VOICES PRAISING JEHOVAH
In every part of the world the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is moving ahead. Every year new thousands join their voices in the swelling song of praise to Jehovah’s name. Last year 716,901 persons were engaged in preaching, while this year 787,967 participated. These are not just statistical figures. They represent human lives devoted to the service of the Most High. For the thrilling and inspiring details read the 1959 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Send only 50c, and for a beautiful calendar for 1959 add 25c to your order.

Scientific Investigation
 Professor R. D. Wilson writes in A Scientific Investigation of the Old Testament, p. 213: “Whenever there is sufficient documentary evidence to make an investigation, the statements of the Bible in the original text have stood the test. . . . The chronological and geographical statements are more accurate and reliable than those afforded by any other ancient documents; and the biographical and other historical narratives harmonize marvellously with the evidence afforded by extra-Biblical documents.”

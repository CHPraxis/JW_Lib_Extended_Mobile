FIELD MINISTRY
A Bible-study book, on the contribution of 50 cents, will be offered to persons contacted by Jehovah’s witnesses in their ministry during December. Thereafter, to aid interested ones to gain further knowledge of Jehovah God’s purposes, return calls will be made and home Bible studies started. For information on how you can share in this joyful work go to the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses or write this office.
1959 YEARBOOK AND CALENDAR READY
Interest in Jehovah’s witnesses and their world-wide preaching work has been stimulated tremendously, due to the Divine Will International Assembly this summer. Therefore the 1959 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses takes on a new significance as it brings you an informative and heart-warming report of this modern-day example of preaching as Jesus did it. Get your copy for only 50c. A beautifully illustrated calendar for 1959 will also bring you pleasure in considering ways of doing the divine will. Add 25c to your order for each calendar.

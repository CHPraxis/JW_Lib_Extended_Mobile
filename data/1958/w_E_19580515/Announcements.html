<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>BEING CONGREGATED FOR WORKS WORTHWHILE</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Christ Jesus is the greatest congregator of all time, serving in this capacity as the anointed and chosen instrument of his heavenly Father, Jehovah God. He congregates willing people to the worship and service of his Father and ‘being wise he teaches people knowledge continually.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:9-21:12:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:9</a>) Under his leadership and invisible direction his faithful footstep followers serve as witnesses of the true God, Jehovah, and spread abroad the good news of his established kingdom. In response to this worthwhile work, more and more people of good will toward God and Christ are being congregated to join in these same works. During June they are offering the people Bible instruction in the form of two bound Bible-study aid books and two booklets on the small contribution of $1. To share in this worthwhile work go to the nearby Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> The following item appeared in the San Bernardino (California) <em>Sun </em>of January 20, 1958: “A couple of $100 bills that took off down E St. on the wings of the wind are back in the pocketbook of Mrs. D. W. Glennie of Hemet. She had hung on to another as she left the bank at Court and E Sts. Wednesday and a fourth that engaged in free flight was found and returned shortly afterward by Mrs. Laura Hodge, 1942 Washington Ave. The two bank notes were returned Saturday by Dorothy Butler, 775 Base Line, who snatched them after they came in for a landing at 3rd and E Sts. Coincidentally, both finders are Jehovah’s Witnesses.”</p>

FIELD MINISTRY
A Bible-study book, on the contribution of 50 cents, will be offered to persons contacted by Jehovah’s witnesses in their ministry during December. Thereafter, to aid interested ones to gain further knowledge of Jehovah God’s purposes, return calls will be made and home Bible studies started. For information on how you can share in this joyful work go to the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses or write this office.
“YOUR WILL BE DONE ON EARTH”
One of the most striking features of the Bible that elevates this Book above all other literature is the element of prophecy. This makes the Bible of even greater value to us today because of the amazing fulfillment of prophecy in our time. The new book “Your Will Be Done on Earth” is unequaled for its revelation of these vital happenings. To be informed on God’s will for our generation obtain your copy of this thrilling 384-page book for only 50c.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> “I have often been amazed at the rapid movement of the writings of the New Testament,” once said American clergyman Elmer G. Homrighausen. “The writers were evidently not interested in writing best sellers. They were not paid by an editor according to the line. They were not interested in literary style. There are few adjectives in the whole Bible. It is filled with nouns and verbs, and as such it is fast-moving, and breath-taking. These men did not write for wealth or fame or popularity. They were flaming witnesses.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The right use of related Bible texts invariably helps to throw light on a Scriptural subject. Illustrating this point is the incident that took place in the eighth-grade classroom of a certain school in Kentucky (U.S.). In this classroom, consisting of thirty-four students, each morning there is a reading from the Bible or telling of a Bible story by one of the students. Assignments for this are given the previous day. One day it appeared that the teacher had forgotten to make an assignment on the day before and so he asked James, who is one of Jehovah’s witnesses, to give an impromptu talk.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">James tactfully gave a sermon on God’s name, Jehovah. “You should be a preacher!” exclaimed one of his fellow students. “Why have I never heard God’s name in my church?” asked another. And, “Just why does God have a name?” asked still another. The teacher’s comment was: “I am glad that we have a student that can tie his scriptures together. I have known those scriptures all my life but could not tie them together.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Before long James had given seven sermons, one sermon each week for seven weeks in a row, and was due to give more. Among his subjects were: “Who Is Causing Woes on Earth?” “New Heavens and a New Earth,” “Some Will Live on Earth Forever,” and “144,000 Will Go to Heaven.” More than just one student, after checking the Scriptural references James gave, had to admit: “That is exactly what it says!”</p>

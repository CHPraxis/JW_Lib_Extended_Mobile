<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHEN a composer has produced a musical masterpiece, should someone else be given credit for it? When a scientist makes a great discovery, should another scientist be honored? It would be rank injustice to give credit where it has not been earned while ignoring the one to whom it is due.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Generally the world realizes this and so gives credit to great composers and scientists for the things they have done. But to whom does it give credit for the 8,600 species of birds, the 4,500 species of living mammals, the 150,000 kinds of flowers, besides the countless numbers of fish and insects? Does it give credit to the One who designed them and gave them the ability to reproduce their kind in great variety? Does it honor the One who could think up and produce these living creatures with such a vast variety of functional body designs, bodies that make use of many fundamental physical laws? Does it praise the One who could produce a multitudinous variety of trees and plants as well as design flowers in so many colors, shapes and sizes that man’s imagination is staggered?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The answer is a most shameful No!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">While the world is very conscious about giving credit to men for great works in art, literature and science, it refuses to give credit to Jehovah God for his works of creation. It marvels at his works, studies them, and learns from them, but adamantly refuses to give him credit for them. It prefers to argue that nothing designed these wonders, nothing made them.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Its willful blindness does not alter the fact that all living things are the product of God’s hands. “How many your works are, O Jehovah! All of them in wisdom you have made. The earth is full of your productions.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:24-19:104:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 104:24</a>) Do not be like this senseless world. Show good sense by giving credit where credit is due.</p>

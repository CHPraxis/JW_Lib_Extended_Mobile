<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>FULFILLING THE COMMISSION TO GO PREACH—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:6:8-23:6:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Isa. 6:8, 9</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Keep watching the ministry . . . that you fulfill it,” said the apostle Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:17-51:4:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Col. 4:17</a>) These words are important advice and admonition to all who are witnesses of Jehovah, for their commission to preach the good news of Jehovah’s established kingdom to all nations is clearly stated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>. Just as Isaiah, after experiencing divinely provided cleansing from his uncleanness, accepted the commission, saying: “Here am I; send me,” so today the cleansed and enlightened witnesses of Jehovah willingly offer themselves and are desirous of fulfilling the commission to go preach. This month of July will be no exception. From house to house, and also on the way to the great international assembly, they will preach to all who will listen. As an aid to persons hungering for Bible knowledge two Bible-study aid books and two booklets will be offered on a $1 contribution. Be sure to share in fulfilling the commission to go preach.</p>

No Time
 “I was speaking to a man the other day who has travelled extensively,” writes Ronald K. Ross. “When he arrived at New York the customs officer, observing his Bible in his bag, said to him, ‘Say, brother, you’ll have no time to read this in the States. We are all too busy making dollars. Guess the almighty dollar is our god.’”—Treasury of the Christian World.

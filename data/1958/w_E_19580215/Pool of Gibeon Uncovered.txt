Pool of Gibeon Uncovered
The ancient city of Gibeon is noted for one of history’s most spectacular rescues. Here Joshua and the Israelites rescued the Gibeonites from the allied Amorite forces. Here the God of heaven rained great hailstones on the enemy and caused the sun and moon to stand still to enable Joshua to complete the victory. It was also at Gibeon that a battle took place between the servants of Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, and the servants of David. The Bible discloses that the encounter started by “the pool of Gibeon.”—2 Sam. 2:12-17.
This pool was recently uncovered; and, after some twenty-five centuries, it is flowing again. The discovery, made by archaeologist James B. Pritchard, was announced by the University of Pennsylvania Museum. In searching for ancient Gibeon the archaeologist surveyed thirty-nine sites and finally picked as the right location the Arab village of El-Jib in the Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan, about eight miles north of Jerusalem. He dug four feet below the surface at El-Jib and found the walls of houses. Later he came to the rim of a pool thirty-seven feet across.
Workers removed debris and they came to the first stage of the well. This was a thirty-three-foot-deep pit faced with a spiral staircase. Then diggers excavated a narrower tunnel, with steps cut in its side, to reach a broad water-drawing room eighty-two feet below the surface. After more debris was removed, water started flowing again. Restoration of the pool has revealed one of the ancient world’s remarkable engineering achievements, the authorities of the museum said. And finding the great well, they added, confirms the Bible account that the Gibeonites were drawers of water.

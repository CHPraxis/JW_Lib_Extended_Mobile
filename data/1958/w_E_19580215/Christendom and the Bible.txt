Christendom and the Bible
 During his New York crusade evangelist Billy Graham, speaking for Christendom, said concerning the Bible: “The Bible is the world’s best-seller. Almost everybody has a Bible in their home. But very few of us know anything about the message of the Bible. We don’t read it. We don’t study it. We talk about it. We have it in our homes. We have it on our pulpits in the churches. But we don’t know what the Bible has to say.” Punctuating Graham’s remarks was a news item from Arcadia, Kansas, that appeared in the Fresno (California) Bee of September 26, 1957: “An Arcadia woman opened her family Bible and found the deed to her family home for which she had been searching fruitlessly since 1937. It was just where she left it.”

Preaching in Prisons Fruitful
 Making use of every opportunity to preach the good news, Jehovah’s witnesses also conduct Bible studies in prisons with those who are of honest heart. One couple, a man and a wife who are doing this in the state of New Jersey, writes: “We have a Bible study with some prisoners in the B———— prison and have studied with them over a year now. One of them recently was discharged and upon leaving the prison he wrote us a very fine letter giving us his new address and expressing his appreciation to Jehovah and to us for having studied the Bible with him. He said that his prison stay was not in vain, for in it he found both himself and his Maker, Jehovah God. He looks forward to the time when he will also be going from house to house and be able to call himself one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Every time we study with one of the inmates we must have a guard with us and they must sit in on our study. Since it is a different guard each time, the guards in this prison are also getting spiritual food, including sample copies of the Watchtower and Awake! magazines. One of the men we study with has become editor of the prison magazine and now writes articles in it about Jehovah’s kingdom. About 650 prisoners read this magazine, and many copies are also sent out of the prison to the homes of the men; so quite a witness is also being given in this manner due to our prison studies.”

To Give a Church Some Life
 A church in Manchester, England, needed some life. Disclosing what the pastor did, the Kamloops (British Columbia) Sentinel of September 30, 1957, said: “Feet tapped and members of the congregation rocked Sunday to the hot rhythm of church music set to jazz tempos. ‘The music tonight is a little unusual,’ said Rev. A. Gower-Jones of the Church of England. Beside the choir was a trap drummer, two guitarists, a hot fiddle player and the church’s regular organist, swinging a hymn. ‘It is difficult to change the music in church,’ said the minister, ‘but if the church is to be alive—then changes must be made.’”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>EMULATING THE EXCLUSIVE DEVOTION OF THE SHULAMMITE</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The love of the Shulammite girl of Solomon’s superlative song is illustrative of the devotion of the congregation to Christ Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:8:6-22:8:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Cant. 8:6</a>) He is their Lord and Head and heavenly “bridegroom.” The exclusive devotion of the Shulammite for her shepherd lover and that of those whom she pictured as a group for Christ Jesus should be followed as an example by all who as “other sheep” of the Right Shepherd join in his service. During the month of September they will do so by telling the good news of his kingdom. Two valuable Bible-study aid books and two booklets will be left on a contribution of only $1.</p>

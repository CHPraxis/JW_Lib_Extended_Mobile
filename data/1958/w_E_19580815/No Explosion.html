<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> In the book <em>Like a Mighty Army </em>Halford E. Luccock writes of Christendom’s churches: “Did you happen to notice in the public prints not long ago that there was a violent explosion in a church in New York state—unfortunately not in the pulpit but in the boiler room? . . . The New Testament explodes all over the place. Here are a few . . . words which the Apostle Paul used to people who were blocking the path of the gospel: ‘You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, you whitewashed wall.’ Definitely not the language recommended by Robert’s <em>Rules of Order. </em>Perhaps that is what is the matter with us. Could it be that we are taking our cue from the wrong textbook? It would be a shock in many places to displace Robert’s <em>Rules of Order </em>by the New Testament, but it might be exciting . . . Think of explosion in pew and pulpit over muddled thinking, over mouselike trepidation before Caesar and Mammon, over festoons of ecclesiastical red tape.”</p>

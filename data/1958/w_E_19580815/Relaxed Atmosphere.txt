Relaxed Atmosphere
 At Richardson, Texas, pastor Mark B. Herberner of the Messiah Lutheran Church has announced that the adult Sunday-school class has increased its attendance 100 percent. He explained that coffee and cigarettes are now being served. “We find nothing in the Bible,” said the pastor, “that forbids a homey, relaxed atmosphere.”

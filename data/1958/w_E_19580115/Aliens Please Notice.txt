Aliens Please Notice
 The Department of Justice has once again announced that January is Alien Address Report month. We would like to remind our many readers who are not citizens that the law requires them to report their addresses during the month of January. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has provided a very simple method for all aliens to comply with the law. All an alien has to do is go to any post office or immigration office where he will obtain an address report card. The form number is I-53. You fill this card out, sign your name and the date and leave it with the clerk. Thatâ€™s really all there is to it and by so doing you will have complied with the law. Our readers who are citizens can help their government by reminding their friends and relatives who are aliens to report their addresses. Remember, January is the time, your local immigration or post office the place.

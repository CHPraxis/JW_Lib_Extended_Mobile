Materialistic Dream
 A few years ago Time magazine reported the following from “Give Me Liberty And———,” an unpublished play by Eugene O’Neill: “We talk about the American Dream, and want to tell the world about the American Dream, but what is that dream, in most cases, but the dream of material things? I sometimes think that the United States, for this reason, is the greatest failure the world has ever seen.”

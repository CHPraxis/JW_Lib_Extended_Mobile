<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>KEEPING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:18-49:5:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Eph. 5:18</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">To have God’s spirit is a matter of greatest importance. Jesus showed this by saying that the heavenly Father would be more pleased to give the holy spirit to those who ask him than earthly parents are to give good things to their children. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:13-42:11:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 11:13</a>) <em>Asking </em>for the filling of God’s spirit precedes acquiring it by “seeking” and “knocking.” We seek and knock by diligent study of the Bible and by applying its instructions to our way of life. Through these means one keeps filled with the spirit of God. The Bible must be studied, as it is inspired and inspiring. The Watch Tower publications are provided to aid such seekers. During May Jehovah’s witnesses will offer people the opportunity of obtaining two bound Bible-study aid books of prepared spiritual food and two Bible booklets on a contribution of $1. Be sure to join in this pleasurable service.</p>

The Power of the Truth
 At a recent assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in Japan an elderly witness related how he had retired from his employment so that he and his wife could devote their full time to preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. And his wife smilingly related how her husband now does something that is unheard of for Japanese husbands—he helps with the housework, making it possible for both to meet the hour requirements of the full-time ministry! What the truth won’t do!—1958 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

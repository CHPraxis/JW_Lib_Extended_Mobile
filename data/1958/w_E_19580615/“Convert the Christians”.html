<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> George Lansbury, one-time British Labor party leader and politician, told this experience: “I once discussed my faith as a Christian with Lenin and Trotsky. Both repudiated my reliance on Christian ethics, and Lenin said, ‘Go back home and convert the Christians; get a world of justice by Christian teaching. No one wants bloodshed, but Christians slaughter each other as readily as others for material gain.’”</p>

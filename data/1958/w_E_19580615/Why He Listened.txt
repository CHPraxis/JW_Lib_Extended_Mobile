Why He Listened
 When asked by the bishop of Melanesia why he, a former member of the Anglican Melanesian Mission, Solomon Islands, had listened to a representative of the Watch Tower Society, the former member replied: “I like to hear both sides of a story.” “Well, then,” asked the bishop, “now you have heard it, what is your opinion?” “It is all true, because everything said he proved from the Bible,” was the reply. This man followed up his conviction by leaving the Church of England and offering his home for group Bible study meetings.—1958 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

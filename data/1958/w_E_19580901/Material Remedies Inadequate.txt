Material Remedies Inadequate
 In The Humanities After the War W. MacNeile Dixon writes: “Pursued though it be through weary days and sleepless nights, the search for material remedies to soothe or cure our spiritual distresses can have only one end—failure. Much more will be needed than to feed the hungry, house the poor, clothe the destitute, however generously contrived and devotedly administered these undertakings may be. The day of acceptance of the great truth approaches, than which a greater was never yet proclaimed, that ‘man does not live by bread alone.’ With its acceptance and not till then will be laid the foundation stone of a civilization worthy the name.”

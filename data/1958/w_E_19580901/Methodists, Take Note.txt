Methodists, Take Note
 In 1754 John Wesley completed his “alterations” of the Authorized Version of 1611 together with his “Explanatory Notes.” As an honest student of the Scriptures Wesley rejected the trinitarian spurious text of 1 John 5:7 as found in the King James translation.—See Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament, by John Wesley, reprinted edition of 1948, p. 917.

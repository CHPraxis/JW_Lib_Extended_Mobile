Spiritual Condition in Question
 A Roman Catholic bishop recently questioned the reality of his church’s membership claim in the United States. The Roman Catholic Church now claims 34,563,851 members. But Bishop Stephen S. Woznicki of Saginaw, Michigan, thought that no more than twenty-five million are practicing Catholics. “There has been great progress in the physical condition of dioceses,” he said, “but the spiritual condition is an entirely different question.”—Time, September 23, 1957.

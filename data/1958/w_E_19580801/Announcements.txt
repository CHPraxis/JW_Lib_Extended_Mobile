PREACHING THE KINGDOM IN UNITY—Rev. 11:15.
“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king for ever and ever.” While this inspired utterance was written about 1,900 years ago, it is in our time, since 1914, that Jehovah God has taken his “great power and begun ruling as king” by the one he has appointed, Christ Jesus. This means the long-prayed-for kingdom is established! (Matt. 6:9, 10) And within this generation the King Christ Jesus will destroy all wickedness, visible and invisible, and thereafter “for ever and ever” surviving mankind will enjoy unending life and happiness on a paradise earth under the blessings of the Kingdom. It is this good news Jehovah’s witnesses unitedly preach, by word of mouth and by printed page. This month, after an informative three- to eight-minute verbal sermon at all homes where they call, two Bible-study aid books and two booklets will be offered to householders on a contribution of $1. Have you heard the good news and are you passing it on to others? Ask any of Jehovah’s witnesses how you may share in the work.

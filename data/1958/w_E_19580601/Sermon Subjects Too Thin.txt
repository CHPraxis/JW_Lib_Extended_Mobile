Sermon Subjects Too Thin
 Charles Clayton Morrison. one-time editor of The Christian Century, once discussed sermons, saying: “During the many years since I was pastor of a church I have listened to a great many sermons. . . . One impression made upon me is that the sermons generally deal with subjects that are too thin. Most preachers seem to select for their subject some fragment of Christian truth; they break off a tiny twig from the tree of life—it may be a scripture text or an ethical idea—and make their sermon out of that.”—Treasury of the Christian Faith.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>GETTING FILLED WITH GOD’S SPIRIT</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Keep getting filled with spirit” is the Bible’s counsel at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:18-49:5:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:18</a>. By what means do we keep filled with holy spirit? By continually going to the source, Jehovah God, in prayer and in study of the Word of God, the Bible. Association with others who also seek the filling of the spirit is coessential, for <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:19-49:5:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:19, 20</a> says: “Speaking to yourselves with psalms and praises to God and spiritual songs, singing and accompanying yourselves with music in your hearts to Jehovah, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ giving thanks always for all things to our God and Father.” Being continually replenished with the spirit by these means, we are able to go to others with the truths of God’s Word and bring them the spiritual help that is so much needed in these times of world crisis. During May this will be done by Jehovah’s witnesses in offering people two bound books containing Bible-study assistance of great importance, together with two booklets, on a contribution of $1.</p>

African Chief Shows Wisdom
 Two full-time ministers of Jehovah were sent to a certain village in Nyasaland to preach. This caused the representative of the Universal Missions to Central Africa to petition the chief to expel the witnesses on the premise that both organizations could not operate in the same village. After consulting with his superiors the chief ruled: “If the U.M.C.A. does not want to stay together with Jehovah’s witnesses, then they may leave. I am very pleased to have the name of Jehovah preached in my area and I agree that they stay and continue with their good work.” So now still only one religious group is active in the village, but it is Jehovah’s witnesses!—1958 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

Sheep Recognize the Shepherd’s Voice
 An Adventist lady in Oriente, Cuba, told one of the witnesses that she belonged to the Adventists because their books so enlightened her. To prove her point she produced the book “The Truth Shall Make You Free”! Needless to say, it was a real joy for the witness to assure her that this book was a witness publication. A home Bible study was then started with her and several other Adventists, with the result that six are now actively witnessing for Jehovah, including a former Adventist missionary.—1958 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

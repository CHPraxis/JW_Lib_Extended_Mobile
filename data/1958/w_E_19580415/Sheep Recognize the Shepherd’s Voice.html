<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> An Adventist lady in Oriente, Cuba, told one of the witnesses that she belonged to the Adventists because their books so enlightened her. To prove her point she produced the book <em>“The Truth Shall Make You Free”! </em>Needless to say, it was a real joy for the witness to assure her that this book was a witness publication. A home Bible study was then started with her and several other Adventists, with the result that six are now actively witnessing for Jehovah, including a former Adventist missionary.—1958 <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</em></p>

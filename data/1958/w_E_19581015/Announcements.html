<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When considering the experience of Job the emphasis is often placed on the dark side of the picture. Yet the outcome Jehovah gave is the thing to stress. Job did not maintain his integrity in vain. He did not trust Jehovah only to come off disappointed. In his case, as well as in the case of Jehovah’s witnesses always, the words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:11-59:5:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">James 5:11</a> will be found true: “We pronounce happy those who have endured.” With this thought in mind, witnesses of Jehovah will continue to exert themselves, carrying the good news of the Kingdom to all persons they can contact. During November they will offer householders valuable truths in book form, on a contribution of 50 cents each. Share in the happy service of Jehovah.</p>

Exploring Part of the Exodus Route
 After six years of exploration a noted archaeologist claims to have discovered a 150-mile stretch of the Exodus route, the route taken by the Israelites from Egypt to the Promised Land. The archaeologist is Dr. Nelson Glueck, president of the Hebrew Union College and the Jewish Institute of Religion. Reporting on Dr. Glueck’s discovery, the New York Mirror Magazine of April 6, 1958, said: “The area reaches from Kadesh-barnea to Hormath, just east of Beersheba. ‘The Israelites had to come this way,’ says Dr. Glueck. ‘West of this section, the region is mountainous, spotted with deep depressions, and waterless. To the east, it is all sand dune and desert and also devoid of water. The only route which would have provided sufficient water and grazing land is this one.’ . . . Does the discovery prove the Bible version? ‘If you accept the Bible,’ Dr. Glueck answered, ‘you don’t need archeology to prove it. But archeology has demonstrated that the Bible can be believed.’”

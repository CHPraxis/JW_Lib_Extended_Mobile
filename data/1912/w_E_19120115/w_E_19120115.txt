THIS SPECIAL ISSUE OT INTEREST, WE TRUST 

The newspaper syndicate handling Pastor Kus- 
sell's sermons, believing that the World Tour of th& 
Foreign Missions Investigations Committee, of which 
Brother Russell is chairman, would furnish interest- 
ing "copy" for their list of patrons and news 
editors m general (which we realize to mean a still 
more extensive promulgation of Present Truth), have 
gotten out a very attractive pamphlet, descriptive 
of some of his sucees&ful meetings at home and 
abroad, and containing illustrations which have ap- 
peared in the press of the world, together with 
various items in Brother Russell's hibtoij, t>aid to 
be desirable matter in Newspaperdom 

Since first the "round-the-world trip" wa& men- 
tioned in the columns of The Watch Tower, con- 
siderable interest has been manifested in the move- 
ment by the dear friends in various parts, believing 
with us that it is no unimportant step in the Harvest 
vrork, furnishing, as it dues, a still greater oppor- 
tunity to proclaim the Gobpel "in all the world for 
a witness " 

It has occurred to us that we could not present 
to our readers anything of greater interest than 
this Souvenir Announcement, hence we have adopted 
it for this issue, and have encased the whole in a 
special "Watch Tower cover. \Ve trust that our efforts 
m this respect to please mav be successful

Upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity; the sea and the waves (the restless, discontented) roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear 
and for looking forward to the things coming upon the earth (society); for the powers of the heavens (ecclesiasticitm) shall be shaken. . . . When 
ye sec these things come to pass, then know that the Kingdom of God is nigh at hand. Look up, lift up your heads, rejoice, for your redemption 
draweth nigh.— Lute 21 -eyiS-ji. [4943] 



FOREWORD 




HIS announcement is dedicated to newspaper Editors and Publishers, 
and we hope it may encourage some of even greater zeal in their 
efforts in serving their constituency. The first article, "The Press and 
the Public," while not bearing directly on Pastor Russell's proposed 
tour, is inserted because it, in unique style, excellently describes certain 
prevailing conditions, which, when properly appreciated by Editors, 
make easy the solution of certain vexatious questions of the past. 

Approximately fifteen hundred Editors are at present publishing 
weekly Pastor Russell "copy," furnished in various countries through 
Press Associations, News Syndicates or Lecture Bureaus. In a 
special endeavor to serve the interests of the Editors receiving their 
services, the American Lecture Bureau and Press Association invited Pastor Russell to make 
a Round-the- World Tour, hoping thus to enable him to give his many millions of readers the 
benefit of his keen observation and wonderful power of description when applied to the 
present status and prospects of Christianity in heathen lands. 

Pastor Russell is at present on his regular Autumn lecture tour in Great Britain. 
He is due in New York November 24th. After spending a few days at home, he 
will begin the Round-the- World Tour by leaving for the Pacific coast, sailing from San 
Francisco for Honolulu December 13th. Small interior points, as well as many leading 
cities, are to be visited in Oriental and African Countries ; and the Pastor Russell party is 
due in London next March, in time for Pastor Russell to fill his regular British engagements. 

The International Bible Students Association assembled in general annual convention 
at Mountain Lake Park, Maryland, Sept. 1-11, 1911, appointed General Wm. P. Hall, 
U. S. A.; Robert B. Maxwell, Mansfield, Ohio; E. W. V. Kuehn, Toledo; Prof. F. H. 
Robison, Ontario; J. T. D. Pyles, Washington, D. C; Dr. Leslie W. Jones, Chicago, and 
Pastor Russell, as a committee to investigate the subject of Foreign Mission Work — as to 
the present conditions, methods employed, doctrines taught, disbursement of funds, etc. 
The first six gentlemen named go as contributors and laymen. At the first meeting of the 
committee, held at the Waldorf-Astoria, New York City, Sept. 25th, for organization and 
adoption of plans of procedure, Pastor Russell was made chairman, and Prof. Robison 
secretary. The International Bible Students Association expects this committee, upon their 
return, to report without fear or favor all important facts that would properly have a bear- 
ing upon their policy respecting future support in person or by purse. 

The special sermons by Pastor Russell while on this tour will be stirring "copy," con- 
taining much valuable information interestingly commented on from his, an independent, 
standpoint. We beg leave to venture the one assertion that this "Round-the- World Tour" 
will be instrumental in bringing from Pastor Russell's Pen the most remarkable and valu- 
able writings of the age on past and present "Christian Endeavor" in the Foreign Mission- 
ary Field. On page fifteen detailed information is given showing how Pastor Russell's 
writings reach the Press and the people.

PASTOR RUSSELL'S ROUND-THE-WORLD TOUR 



THE PRESS AND THE PUBLIC 




EW indeed are those that realize the opportunities and the power of the Press 
in this the twentieth century. So great is this power that the generally ac- 
cepted opinion of a nation upon a subject may be completely reversed within 
a month. This was not so fifty or one hundred years ago. Under former 
conditions it would have taken a century to crystalize public opinion on such 
a matter as the recent Dr. Cook and Com- 
modore Perry North Pole controversy. 

through the Press, placed 

the "Tribunal of Public 

consequently was readily 
settled, furnishing an excellent example of 
how the people of the whole world take 
knowledge and settle matters in this our day. 




7Tu's case was, 
on trial before 
Opinion," and 



A case of a thousand times greater im- 
portance is now up for trial before this 
same "Tribunal of Public Opinion." Sectarianism has, within 
the very recent past, been placed in the balance. Shall she be 
found wanting? 

We see denominational prestige and influence being shattered 
on the right and on the left Seemingly, thinking people have 
suddenly awakened to an individual responsibility and are examin- 
ing the teachings of the past, and are inquiring, "Why so many divisions among professed Christians?" 
So general is this awakening that a reasonable answer to this question must be forthcoming. 

Many clergymen, realizing the personal advantages of sect preservation, and of keeping the 
masses under some sort of religious influence, are now willing, even under protest, to exclusively advo- 
cate simply a brotherhood among men, insisting only upon the retention of a few fundamentals, such 

as the Fatherhood of God, the Saviourhood of Jesus, 
and the Brotherhood of Man. 

Momentous indeed are the consequences, and de- 
cisive will be the verdict in this issue. In the face of the 
radical sectarian teachings of the past centuries, we may 
well ask, "What will the verdict be?" Will the people 
allow venerated doctrines of their fathers to be covered 
up or abandoned without explanation? We think not. 
The "first impressions" received in childhood are perhaps 
still with us, no matter how unsatisfactory they may be. 
They cannot be forgotten nor wiped out of the mind, 
unless something more reasonable is offered and accepted 
in their stead. 

To the minds of many, religion and politics suggest 
a similar picture. As political party doctrines are seldom 
praised by adherents of an opposing party, or vice versa, so 
it is with clergymen of every community. Sectarian preach- 
ers, in order to retain their pulpits, must do a denominational 
work, and therefore cannot extol, or even admit, the good 
pouits of competing denominations.

Not satisfied with this condition, the general public, by 
the aid of the Press, have figuratively raised themselves up 
above the heads of both stump speaker and sectarian 
preacher. The masses refuse longer to be bound by party 
or creed bonds or ties, and consequently are "freethinkers" 
and "independents." This fact is fully attested by the 
admitted great falling away from the churches and the 
enormous independent vote cast in the recent State and National Elections of the various countries. 

Independents now constitute the big congregation and can be influenced by, and will pay sincere 
respect to, only an independent. It matters not how able, as a writer or speaker, one of your local 
sectarian ministers may be, he can hold as a following only those of his own congregation, which is, 
at most, only a small portion of what should be the constituency of any representative newspaper.

Thus is manifested an unprecedented opportunity for the Press. Will it be grasped? Yes! 
The Newspapers at present constitute the only channel through which the solution of this mighty 

problem can be speedily disseminated among the people. 
The clergymen have waited too long; they once had the 
public ear and confidence; they now have neither. As to 
doctrines they now stand repudiated. The Daily and the 
Weekly Press of the present day are the sole source of 
information for millions of families, and these families as- 
suredly will, through the Press, learn a harmonious, com- 
plete and satisfactory explanation of heretofore incompre- 
hensible doctrinal questions. 

Hundreds of Editors, realizing their responsibilities and 
possible opportunity, sought a solution and found it. They, 
after many experiments, were forced to acknowledge that 
their sermon or religious department, even though edited by 
a high class local minister, would not secure for their paper 
the personal influence of Christians belonging to congrega- 
tions served by other ministers, nor could they interest the 
large non-church going element of their community. In- 
variably, to publish the "copy" of a local man was to invite 
criticism from either the clergy or laity of other denomina- 
tions.

Are reached 



Finally the solution was found, 
dreds of editors have since demonstrated that the best way 
to completely fulfil their responsibility to the public and to 
successfully cater to the active Christians of all denomina- 
tions is to publish "copy" prepared by an "independent ' 
who is not endeavoring to build up any particular denomina- 
tion at the expense of another; "copy" emanating from some 
outside city; "copy" that will appeal to the heart of not 
only every Christian, but also to skeptic, Jew or Gentile; 
"copy" prepared without malice, but with an abundance of 
charity for all; "copy" written by a man who ably shows 
forth from the Scriptures a logical basis for true Christian 
unity amongst Christians of all denominations, in addition 
to the desired general brotherhood of man. This sort of 
"copy" was found in the weekly articles prepared by an 
"independent," Pastor Russell of London and Brooklyn 
Tabernacles. 

That you may know something of this man, who can ^ ^ 

satisfactorily serve you in the capacity of Editor of your weekly "sermon" or of your Sunday 
School Department," we are sending you this little booklet, which is dedicated to our friends, the 
editors of the more than fourteen hundred newspapers at present publishing Pastor Russell "copy" 
weekly. So notable testimony was never before accorded by editors to any religious writer, past or 
present.

PASTOR RUSSELL'S ROUND-THE-WORLD TOUR 



A PASTOR IN THE MAKING 



Charles Taze, second son of Joseph L. and Ann Eliza (Bimey) Russell, was born in Pitts- 
burgh. Pa., in 1852, and is shown in the accompanying portrait at the age of three years. 
At about this time the Russell children began to receive their "first impressions" on religion, some of 
which have since been shattered, notably those relating to the supposed literal lake of fire as a 
place of eternal torment for the unsaved. 

The strong resemblance between the portraits of Pastor 
Russell at sixty, and Charles Taze at three, is unusual, and 
the character lines indicating determination rather suggest 
the explanation for his subsequent independent evangelistic 
wort 

Up to the age of fifteen he believed, as gospel truth, 
all and only such doctrines as his sectarian ministers had 
taught him. To learn to understand doctrines at that period 
was very difficult, as the clergy usually discouraged in- 
dividual Bible research, and the asking of questions on 
doctrines was then considered equivalent to doubting, and 
"to doubt was to be damned." 

The dissipation of this superstitious reverence and fear 
only awaited such time as he should attempt to defend by 
the Scriptures his particular sectarian views, and subsequent 
events justify the thought that Providence had decreed that 
just at this juncture young Russell should attempt to re- 
claim an infidel acquaintance to Christianity. 

By skillful questions, which were unanswerable by 
either minister or laymen from their sectarian standpoints, 
and by the maneuvering of many seemingly paradoxical 
Scriptures, the infidel completely routed young Russell, who 
within a few months became an admitted skeptic. Here, 
as in nearly every similar case, the Bible was discarded 
together with the doctrines of the creed. Few, indeed, under 
such circumstances, study the Scriptures to see whether they 
had been properly interpreted, and Charles Taze Russell 
was no exception. 

As he desired to learn the truth regarding the hereafter, the next few years were devoted to the 
investigation of the claims of the leading Oriental religions, all of which he found to be unworthy of 
credence, hence we see him arriving at manhood's estate with a mind unsatisfied, a mind which, de- 
spite all efforts to the contrary, was still subject to its occasional bad hours on account of its "first 
imoression" on the eternal torment theory. 

WHY HE BECAME A BIBLE TEACHER 

At twenty-one Mr. Russell was possessed of much knowledge and voluminous data on "re- 
ligion" as believed in and practised in all parts of the world. Apparently these were to become of no 
value to himself or others because of large business responsibilities that were placed on him at this time. 
Days grew into weeks and weeks into months and he found less and less time to devote to theological 
research, and the solace for heart and head so diligently sought for seemed as remote to him as ever. 

The question that here confronted him was, "Shall I try longer to find the truth on religion? 
Or shall I smother the hope of finding it and strive for fame and fortune among the financial and 
commercial captains of the time?" The latter he was about to do, but fortunately he decided first to 
search the Scriptures from a skeptic's standpoint, for its own answer on hell-fire and brimstone. 

Amazed at the harmonious testimony, proving an unexpected but satisfactory answer, he under- 
took systematic Bible research, and was brought to a complete confidence in the Bible as being in- 
spired by an all-wise, powerful, just and loving Creator, worthy of adoration and worship. Thus 
a sure anchor for a fainting hope was found, and an honest, truth-seeking heart was made glad.

PASTOR RUSSELL'S ROUND-THE-WORLD TOUR 



VISITS THE HOLY LAND 

INTERPRETS GREAT PYRAMID 




HE unfulfilled promises to the Jews, spoken of hundreds of times by the prophets of old, 
and reaffirmed in the writings of the New Testament, attracted Pastor Russell's early at- 
tention, and consequendy the time of the restoration of the Jews in Palestine, as a Nation, 
became a question of almost paramount importance to his mind. In order to verify or 
disprove certain claims or supposed facts. Pastor Russell visited the Holy Land in 1 892, 
verifying much valuable information contained in his third volume of "Scripture Studies," 
wherein he interestingly treats the complex Jewish racial problem, past, present and future. 
This trip was the real beginning of a campaign to attract the attention of the world 
to the future inheritance of the natural "seed of Abraham." 
During the past twenty years, Pastor Russell has written much on Jewish topics and has ad- 
dressed many Jewish audiences on Biblical Zionism, pointing out the significance of the many unful- 
filled promises to them by Jehovah, 

fiu stUe 3 bSlfe THE GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZEH 

at the border. The Bible Stone-Witnes. 

yet in the center, 
of Egypt stands 
strangely related 
to the hope of the 
Jew, and Pastor 
Russell has most 
in t e r estingly 
treated the meas- 
urements, angles, 
shape, size, weight, 
passag e - w a y s , 
King's Chamber, 
Queen's Chamber, 
etc., as positive 
corroborative evi- 
dence of the time 
prophecies of the 
prophets of old. 
His findings, as 
explained in the 
symbolic language 
of "Holy Writ," 
read like a re- 
markable piece of 
fiction, when in 
reality it is a 

plain, yet entrancing narrative of Jehovah's Plan as respects the various ages and His dispensational 
dealings with the human race, terminating with the full restoration of the Jewish people in the land 
of their fathers, during the "times of restitution of all things." 

Prof. C. Piazzi Smith, F.R.S.E., F.R.A.S., Ex-Astronomer Royal for Scotland, in a letter 
written from Clova, Ripon, England, Dec. 21,1 890, commenting on Pastor Russell's interpretation 
of the Pyramid, said in part : "At first I could find only slips of the type-writer, but as I progressed 
through the pages, the powers, the specialties and the originalities of the Author came out magnifi- 
cently; and there were not a few passages I should have been glad to take a copy of for quotation, 
with name, in the next possible edition of my own Pyramid book. But of course I did nothing of 
that sort, and shall wait with perfect patience and in most thankful mood of mind for when the 
Author shall choose his own time for publishing. So I merely remark here that he is both good and 
new in much that he says on the chronology of the various parts of the Pyramid, especially the 
First Ascending Passage and its granite plug; on the Grand Gallery, as illustrating the Lord's life; on 
the parallelisms between the King's Chamber and its granite, against the (Jewish) Tabernacle and 
its gold ; and generally on the confirmations or close agreements between Scripture and the Great 
Pyramid." 

The late Dr. John Edgar, M.A., B.So., M.B., CM., F.F.P.S.G., of Glasgow, Scotland, 
with his brother Morton, in 1909, visited Gizeh to critically test Pastor Russell's deductions. Their 
verdict, after a most elaborate investigation, was a thorough endorsement of Pastor Russell's inter- 
pretation of the Great Pyramid, the greatest of the world's wonders. 



[4953] 




THE CHEAT PYRAMID 

Built 2 1 70 B, C. probably by Melchizedek . In it« own symbolic language it so 
states. Seemingly every stone in this, the most remarkable building in the world, has 
been made to testify by Pastor Russell in his remarkable interpretation.

THE VOW BOOKMARK 

We have prepared a very neat bookmark of thin white 
celluloid. On one side of it The Vow is printed in clear type 
in dark blue ink. On the other side is a picture of the white 
dove which hangs in the center of Brother Russell's study 
in Brooklyn. Under the picture is a beautiful poem entitled 
"The Bridegroom's Dove," which is a real inspiration to 
Christlikeness. It was our intention to send one of these 
with each WATCH TOWER receipt, but we find that some were 
missed. 

We now have reports from about ten thousand who have 
taken The Vow, and we would like each of these to have one 
of the bookmarks. Any such who have not received one 
will please send us a post-card so stating, and they will receive 
one by return mail. 



THE NEWSPAPER SYNDICATE'S IDEA 

For the benefit of our readers we remark that Brother 
Russell is very anxious to co-operate with the Newspaper 
Syndicate which handles his weekly sermons. While he retains 
fullest liberty in respect to the subject matter of his 
discourses, he yields other points considerably to the Syndicate's 
wishes. This will account for his greater care in his 
clothing, his more frequent use of cabs and parlor cars. The 
Syndicate insists that Brother Russell's personality has much 
to do in placing his sermons far and near. And Brother Russell 
is glad to yield to the Syndicate's business judgment, because 
he desires that his Gospel message shall be heard the 
world around. 



PROLIFIC BEANS FOR SEED 

Sister Smith of Nebraska recently discovered one stalk of 
beans which she declares yielded so prolifically that she calls it 
the Millennial Bean. She desires to get the beans into the 



hands of others, and at the same time to make a donation to 
our Tract Fund for the sending forth of free spiritual food 
to the hungry. Accordingly the beans have been sent to our 
office. 

We believe the project quite a proper one, and if the beans 
be as prolific elsewhere as in Nebraska, we would be glad to 
purchase them at the rate of five beans for one dollar. (We 
have heard of seed wheat selling at one dollar per grain.) 

However, in view of unfriendly criticism of enemies, we 
think it best not to sell these beans, but to give them free to 
our subscribers who have gardens, and who will request them 
—five beans each. 

Sister Smith writes that they should be planted one bean 
to the hill, and the hills six feet apart. They should be planted 
in April. They keep bearing right along for weeks, and five 
should supply a small family. They will be ready to ship in 
February. 



R4963 : page 26 

CURE FOR APPENDICITIS 

It is known that only about three out of every one hundred 
operated upon for appendicitis really have a diseased appendix 
needing removal. We give below a simple cure for appendicitis 
symptoms. The pain in the appendix region is caused by 
the biting of worms near the junction of the transverse colon 
with the small intestines, low down on the right side of the 
abdomen. 

This remedy is recommended also for typhoid fever, which 
is also a worm disease. The medicine is Santonine: dose, 3 
grains, an hour before breakfast; repeated for four mornings, 
or until all the symptoms disappear. Then one dose per month 
for three months to eradicate all germs. 

This recipe is of incalculable value. Not only will it save 
the surgeon's and hospital fees of perhaps $200, but it saves 
weeks of ill health, inconvenience, convalescence and loss of 
salary. 



R4955 : page 27 

VIEWS FROM THE WATCH TOWER 

PULPIT HAS LOST POWER 

THE Rev. Lyman Abbott, of New York, spoke 
sadly of the decadence of the power of the 
pulpit, addressing 3,000 University of Wisconsin 
men and women at a convention at 
Madison, Wis. 'It is said the cloth has lost 
its power— it has,' said Dr. Abbott. 'It is 
said the pulpit has lost its power— it has. 



But a man, altruistic in the highest sense 
and spiritual, will never lose his power.'" 
* * *— Press Report. 

It was certainly appropriate that Dr. Abbott should 
make the above statement to college people. Admitting 
the facts, let us find also their cause. It is because 
of the inconsistency of its teaching that the pulpit has 
lost its power with the masses. The pulpit backs up and 
endorses the teachings of all the colleges of our day 
along the lines of Higher Criticism and Evolution. The 
people are coming to understand that this means that the 
pulpit is in antagonism to the Bible. If Evolution be 
true, man never fell and hence needed no Redeemer and 
no saving from a fallen state, but needed merely to be 
let alone in his evolutionary progress. According to 
Higher Criticism the Bible in general is unreliable. 
Moses never wrote the books accredited to him, and 
Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel and others never wrote the 
books accredited to them— never were inspired of God to 
write these books. And if this be true, then Jesus and 
the Apostles were deceived and could not have been 
inspired by God when they quoted from these sacred 
writings of the past and declared them to be the Word 
of God and vouched for their authorship. 

NO WONDER CHURCH ATTENDANCE IS SLIM 

On the other hand the public notice that the very 
ministers who thus preach Evolution, Higher Criticism, 
unbelief in the Divine Revelation, keep right along 
preaching some of the absurdities which our forefathers 
claimed were in harmony with the Bible. Is it any 
wonder that the people are coming to see the inconsistency 
of such a position? How long might they expect 
to be blind to it? What must be the influence? 

The result is that the masses have less and less confidence 
in the clergy. The people do not know what the 
clergy believe even when they hear them speak, for their 
address may be from the standpoint of the creeds or 
from the standpoint of Higher Criticism, according to 
their moods. The result of this uncertain sounding of the 
trumpet is that the masses are coming to the conclusion 
that the whole matter of religion is a big guess and 
that some of the guesses are influenced by temporal considerations. 
No wonder Church attendance is slim! No 
wonder doubt and skepticism are prevalent! No wonder 
that faith in the Bible is undermined and religion made 
to look ridiculous and contradictory! 

The unbelief of the people grows and threatens to 
become agnosticism, or worse, atheism! Those who have 
brought about this condition of things during the past 
thirty years are the college professors and the best educated 
pulpiteers of Christendom. And now they stand 
astonished at the results, which they should have foreseen. 
Verily they are fulfilling the Divine prophecies of 
Isaiah, which, referring to our day, declare, "The wisdom 



of their wise men shall perish; the understanding of their 
prudent men shall not be manifest." (Isa. 29:14.) No 
wonder the civilized world is in trepidation as it sees the 
onward march of Socialism! And however honest and 
well-intentioned many Socialists may be, the result of 
their effort will spell anarchy and a time of trouble such 
as the world has never yet seen— a time of trouble, however, 
predicted by Daniel the Prophet, whose prediction 
was endorsed by Jesus Himself.— Dan. 12:1; Matt. 24:21. 



What is the remedy? No remedy can possibly reach 
the disease! The Bible rightly understood is the balm 
of Gilead which alone could have helped. But matters 
have gone so far that comparatively few have sufficient 
confidence in the Bible to be willing to make a re-examination 
of it in the light of the Divine Plan of the Ages, 
which alone shows the harmony of the Word of God, 
from Genesis to Revelation. 

But while we cannot hope to stem the tide of "higher 
critical," evolutionary infidelity— while we cannot hope to 
counteract the influences of more than half of Christendom 
and of three-fourths of all the pulpits of Christendom, 
we do hope, by the Lord's grace, to find some of the 
Truth-hungry sheep and to assist them to an appreciation 
of the Heavenly Father's Message, given by Jesus, the 
Apostles and Prophets, but lost during the Dark Ages. 
We can help them to find the lost key of knowledge, 
whereby God's Word opens up, revealing to the eyes of 
faith and obedience a Creator infinite in Wisdom, Justice, 
Love and Power, a Savior and a great one, able 
to save to the uttermost all who come unto the Father 
through Him, and a Divine arrangement and Plan consistent 
with the Divine character. By these means the 
Lord's faithful ones will be sustained from falling in 
this evil day mentioned by the Apostles and Prophets. ~ 
Eph. 6:11-13; Psa. 91:7. 



R4956 : page 28 

THE TEST OF ENDURANCE 

"Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast 
himself as he that putteth it off."— 1 Kings 20:11. 

THE TEST OF ENDURANCE is certainly 
one of the severest tests of faithfulness to 
which the elect Church, the Body of Christ, 
is subjected. It is the test which gages and 
registers the strength of every other virtue 
and grace, and no soldier of the cross will 
be crowned with the laurels of victory who 
has not stood this test. The Christian life 



is a warfare, and the above words of one of 

the kings of Israel to a boastful enemy of 

the Lord's people, are applicable, not only to every new 

recruit in the Lord's army, but, similarly, to all who have 

not yet finished the good fight of faith. 

The first gush of enthusiasm in the Lord's service, 
much as we may and do appreciate it, may be but the 
hasty production of the shallow soil of a heart which immediately 
receives the truth with gladness but, having no 
root in itself, endures but for a time, and afterward, when 
affliction and persecution arise, immediately is offended. 
(Mark 4:16,17.) Such characters cannot stand the fiery 
tests of this "evil day," whereof it is written— "The fire 
[of that day] shall try every man's work, of what sort it 
is."— 1 Cor. 3:13. 

NECESSITY FOR THE WHOLE ARMOR 

Therefore, says the Apostle Peter, "Beloved, think it 
not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, 
as though some strange thing happened unto you." (1 Pet. 4:12.) 
All of the elect Church must be so tried; and 
blessed is he that shall endure unto the end. The sure 
Word of prophecy points to severe conflicts and great 
trials in the closing scenes of the Church's history. Elijah, 
a type of the Body of Christ, finished his earthly career 
and went up by a whirlwind in a chariot of fire— strong 
symbols of storms and great afflictions. John, another 
type of the Church, was cast into prison and then beheaded. 
And we are forewarned of the great necessity of 
the whole armor of God, if we would stand in this "evil 
day."-STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES, Series 2, Chap. 8. 

It therefore behooves every one who aspires to the 
prize of our high calling to brace himself for the severer 
conflicts and trials of faith and patience that may suddenly 
and without a moment's warning be sprung upon him. 
In the battle of this day, as in all other battles, the effort 
of the Enemy is to surprise and suddenly attack and overwhelm 
the Lord's people; and the only preparation, therefore, 
that can be made for such emergencies is constant 
vigilance and prayer and the putting on of the whole armor 
of God— the Truth and the spirit of the Truth. 

WHICH WAY WILL YOU TURN? 

"In your patience possess ye your souls." No other 
grace will be more needed than this in the fiery ordeals 
of this "evil day;" for without great patience no man can 
endure to the end. All along the Christian's pathway, 
ever and anon, he comes to a new crisis; perhaps these 
are often seemingly of trivial importance, yet he realizes 
that they may be turning points in his Christian course. 
Who has not realized them? There comes a temptation 
to weariness in well-doing, together with the suggestion 
of an easier way; or there springs up a little root of pride 
or ambition, with suggestions of ways and means for feeding 



and gratifying it. Then there comes, by and by, the 
decisive moment when you must choose this course or that; 
and lo, you have reached a crisis! 

Which way will you turn? Most likely you will turn 
in the direction to which the sentiments you have cultivated 
have been tending, whether that be the right way or 
the wrong way. If it be the wrong way, most likely you 
will be unable to discern it clearly; for your long cultivated 
sentiments will sway your judgment. "There is a 
way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof is 
the way of death." (Prov. 14:12.) How necessary, 
therefore, is prayer, that in every crisis we may pass the 
test successfully! Nor can we safely delay to watch and 
pray until the crisis is upon us; but such should be our 
constant attitude. 

THOSE WHO OUTRIDE THE TRIALS WILL BE THE OVERCOMERS 

The life of a soldier, ever on the alert and on duty, 
is by no means an easy life; nor do the Scriptures warrant 
any such expectation. On the contrary, they say, 
"Endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ;" 
"Fight the good fight of faith," etc. And yet many Christian 
people seem to have the very opposite idea. Their 
ideal Christian life is one without a breeze or a storm; it 
must be one continuous calm. Such a life was indeed 
more possible in former days than now, though the 
world, the flesh and the Devil always have opposed them, 
and always have had to be resisted by every loyal 
soldier of the cross. But now the opposition is daily 
becoming more and more intense; for Satan realizes 
that his time is short, and he is determined by any and 
every means to exert his power against the consummation 
of the Lord's plan for the exaltation of the Church. 

Consequently, we have had within this Harvest period 
many and severe storms of opposition; and still there are 
doubtless more severe trials to follow. But those who, 
with overcoming faith, outride them all— who patiently 
endure, who cultivate the spirit of Christ with its fruits 
and graces, and who valiantly fight the good fight of faith, 
rather than withdraw from the field— such will be the 
"overcomers" to whom the laurels of victory will be given 
when the crowning day has come. 



R4955 : page 28 

WE BELIEVE THE BIBLE 

THOSE WHO OPPOSE our teaching are 
given to misrepresenting it. They do not 
wish to speak untruthfully, but desire to 
hinder our work, which they fail to recognize 
as the Lord's work. 
It is difficult to answer the arguments of 



our opponents in a few words, when they 

misunderstand our presentations of more 

than three thousand pages. If they cannot 

understand a detailed account, we have no 

hope of making a brief one satisfactory to them. However, 

we give here a synopsis:— 

I. We affirm the humanity of Jesus and the deity of 
Christ. 

II. We acknowledge that the personality of the Holy 
Spirit is the Father and the Son; that the Holy Spirit 
proceeds from both, and in turn from all who are begotten 
by it. 

III. We affirm the resurrection of Christ— that He 

was put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the Spirit. 
We deny that He was raised in the flesh, and challenge 
any statement to that effect as being unscriptural. 

IV. We affirm, with the Scriptures, that God alone 
possessed immortality, "dwelling in the light which no 
man can approach unto." We affirm that this Divine 
quality has already been granted to the Lord Jesus and is 
to be the portion of the elect Bride, the "Body of Christ." 
As for mankind, we affirm the Divine provision for these 

R4956 : page 29 

and for angels to be everlasting life for the obedient. 
This, by many, is mistermed immortality. We follow the 
Scriptures strictly. 

V. We hold that the entire race lost life with Father 
Adam, as a result of his failure in Eden; and that Christ 
died to secure a second chance for Adam and an individual 
chance for all of his race, who lost their first chance in 
Adam when he sinned. "As all in Adam die, even so all 

in Christ shall be made alive." (I Cor. 15:21,22.) A 
few of us, comparatively, having eyes of faith and ears 
of understanding, have had this second chance in the 
present life. Adam and the great mass of his posterity 
must get their second chance after being awakened from 
the tomb. But NOBODY IS TO GET A THIRD CHANCE! 

VI. We believe that the soul was condemned to death. 
"The soul that sinneth it shall die." We believe that this 
death would have been eternal, everlasting destruction, 
had it not been for God's mercy in and through our 
Lord's redemptive work. By reason of His death our 
souls do not die in this full sense of the word, but are 
Scripturally said to "fall asleep," "asleep in Jesus." The 
awakening will be in the resurrection morning; and the 
interim will be a period of unconsciousness, beautifully 
symbolized by a restful sleep. 

VII. We believe in the "hell" of the Bible, sheol. 
This, the only word used for hell for four thousand years, 
is translated more than one-half the time grave in our 
Common Version, and should always be thus translated. 
"Hades," in the New Testament, is its equivalent. "Gehenna 
fire," of the New Testament, is a symbolical picture 
declared to signify the Second Death. 



VIII. We believe that God is able to destroy "both 

soul and body" in Gehenna— the Second Death. We consider 
it much more sane to believe thus, as it is more 
Scriptural, than to believe that in creating man God did 
a work which He could not undo; much more reasonable 
also than to believe He prefers to have the incorrigible 
suffer eternally, when their sufferings could do neither 
themselves nor others any good. 

IX. We believe that, like the Father and the holy 
angels, our Lord is a spirit being. We are convinced 

that "flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God." 
We do not believe that our Lord has a flesh and blood 
body, a "little lower than the angels," and has thus been 
out of harmony with His heavenly environment for 
nearly two thousand years. We believe the Apostle's 
statement, "Now the Lord is that Spirit." This is the 
Jesus who will "so come, in like manner," quietly and 
unknown to the world, as He went away. We do not 
affirm, dogmatically, that He came in 1874, but we say 
that to us it is the evident teaching of the Scriptures. 
Our Lord warned us not to expect Him in the flesh; that 
men might say "Lo, here" or "Lo, there." The Harvest 
work in the universal Church Nominal, the Laodicean 
period of the Church, well corroborates our expectations 
of what His work will be, as outlined in His parables, etc.

"BORN KING OF THE JEWS" 

-MATTHEW 2:1-12.-FEBRUARY 4.- 

"Look unto Me and be ye saved, all ye ends of the earth; 
for I am God and there is none else."— Isaiah 45:22. 

TODAY'S STUDY relates to the Wise Men 

of the East and their seeing of a wonderful 

star which, as astrologers, they recognized 

to import a great event— the birth of a great 

King. At the time Palestine was a province 

of the Roman Empire, and its King, 

Herod, was not a Jew of the House of 

Jacob, but a representative of the house of 

Esau. Herod sought to perpetuate his dynasty, 

and hence the announcement of the 

shepherds that a great King of the Jews had just been 

born suggested the overthrow of the Herodian dynasty 

and the establishment on Israel's throne of a king in the 

line of David and Solomon. 

Herod's disquietude is easily understood, but the fact 
that the people of Jerusalem in general should be disturbed 
by the annunciation of a king of their own awakens 
thought. Evidently they were in a very self-satisfied condition; 
under the Romans they were experiencing great 



prosperity. Herod, the Edomite, had built them a temple 
the grandeur of which outshone that of Solomon. The 
people were feeling so satisfied with their attainments 
that they had ceased to specially long for and pray for 
the coming of the Messiah, the long-promised King of the 
line of David. They were disturbed lest any change 
should be for the worse— lest it should mean internal 
strife as between Herod and another and lest it should 
mean strife with the Roman Empire, which at the time 
was treating the Jews quite generously. 

A very similar condition of things may be expected in 
conjunction with the second advent of Christ. The powers 
that be today are styled Christ's Kingdom, "Christendom," 
but they are really "kingdoms of this world." Any 
announcement today that Messiah's Kingdom is nigh— 
that He will soon take unto Himself His great power and 
reign (Rev. 11:17)— meets with resentment. If in surprise 
we ask why this indifference respecting the fulfilment of 
our prayer, "Thy Kingdom come," the answer is, "Let 
well enough alone; do not agitate that subject; it may 
bring in strife and contention, because many are prospering 
so well under the reign of the 'Prince of this world' 
that they could not look upon a change as likely to bring 
any improvement in their condition— indeed some of them 
have reason to fear that Messiah's Kingdom would seriously 
disturb their entrenched privileges and monopolistic 
control of the wonderful blessings of our day." 

PRIESTLY INDIFFERENCE ON THE SUBJECT 

Although King Herod called the priests and teachers 
of his day to inquire particularly respecting the prophecies 
of Messiah's birth, and although they answered him correctly, 
nevertheless, the records show no joy, no enthusiasm, 
on the part of the religious teachers in respect to the 
prophetic fulfilment which they had professed to trust in 
and to long for. They were indifferent; none of them 
followed to Bethlehem to find the new born King of the 
Jews. They had become Higher Critics and no longer 
believed the prophecies; they had less faith in them than 
had Herod. 

And do we not find an antitype in this day? Are not 
the chief priests and religious leaders generally so out of 
harmony with the Divine promises and so faithless as 
respects the glorious Messianic Kingdom of which the 
Bible tells, that they are ashamed to identify themselves in 
any degree with those who seek the Lord and wait for His 
Kingdom? Alas! even the Mohammedans and Brahmins 
of the East are waiting for Messiah and the Golden Age 
and disposed to seek the evidences— but amongst the most 
prominent ministers of "Christendom" there is apparent 
unbelief, Higher Criticism, Evolution and general opposition 
to Messiah and His Kingdom. Let the civil government 
fight down if it chooses everything associated with 

R4956 : page 30 



the New Dispensation. These are quite indifferent; they 
have plans and schemes of their own by which they are 
hoping to accomplish the work predicted for Messiah; 
they are anxious to raise money and to convert the world 
without disturbing the present order of things. Alas for 
them! how clearly they are mistaken! how terrible will be 
their disappointment when their cherished plans will all 
fail in a time of trouble which, while it will greatly disappoint 
them, will prove to be the forerunner of the reign of 
righteousness for the blessing of all the families of the 
earth— for the ushering in of "the times of restitution." 

WAS THERE A MISTAKE? 

Nearly nineteen centuries have passed since the events 
of this lesson. Israel, instead of being exalted as Messiah's 
Kingdom, has been wrecked. Was it by mistake 
that Jesus was announced King of the Jews at His birth, 
or did God change His plan because the Jews refused 
Jesus and crucified Him? 

Neither suggestion is correct. Jesus is yet to be the 
King of the Jews and the King of the world. The "mystery" 
is cleared when we understand that there are two 
classes of Jews, two classes of Israelites— a heavenly and 
also an earthly class. Thus there are the two "Seeds of 
Abraham," one of which is to be as the stars of heaven 
and the other as the sands of the seashore. The heavenly, 
the spiritual, must be developed first and be associated 
with Messiah in glory, honor and immortality, far above 
angels. 

It has required all of this Gospel Age for the selecting 
of this Spiritual Seed. With its completion a New Age 
will be inaugurated. Then the earthly blessings promised 
will be fulfilled to the natural seed of Abraham. "They 
shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards 
and eat the fruit thereof"; "the knowledge of the 
glory of the Lord shall fill the whole earth"; to Him 
"every knee will bow and every tongue confess," for all 
who refuse shall be destroyed in the Second Death. (Isa. 65:21; 
Hab. 2:14; Rom. 14:11.) Messiah is already recognized 
as Lord by all Spiritual Israelites. During the 
next Age He will be crowned Lord of all by natural Israel, 
and all other nationalities will enjoy the privilege of 
becoming proselyte children of Abraham in the flesh. 
Messiah will reign in His Mediatorial Kingdom for the 
very purpose of bringing these blessings to natural Israel 
and through her to all nations. 

The relationship of Messiah to Spiritual Israel, the elect 
Church, is quite different from what it will be toward the 
world. He is our Lord and prospective Bridegroom; we 
are His betrothed and prospective Bride, and joint-heirs 
of His glory, and are to be associated in His glorious Messianic 
work. "If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's 
seed, and heirs according to the promise."— Gal. 3:29. 

It will require the entire thousand years of the reign 



of Christ and His Bride to accomplish that promise— the 

R4957 : page 30 

blessing of all the families of the earth with full light 

and knowledge and opportunity for complete return to 

harmony with God and for the recovery of all that was 

lost in Adam and redeemed at Calvary. We by faith hail 

Him as King, even before the establishment of His Kingdom, 

and loyally and gladly submit ourselves to Him, 

pledging our lives in the service of His Cause of righteousness 

and truth. We, when praying, "Thy Kingdom 

come," are expressing our sympathy with the righteousness 

which Messiah's Kingdom shall establish and our 

faith in His promise that we shall sit with Him in His 

Throne. And when we pray that God's will shall be done 

on earth as in heaven we are expressing our confidence 

that the Messianic reign will be glorious and successful 

to the last degree— overthrowing all evil and adverse conditions 

and establishing righteousness amongst men on the 

same permanent foundation that prevails in heaven.

"ABOUT MY FATHER'S BUSINESS" 

-LUKE 2:40-52.-FEBRUARY 11.- 

"How is it that ye sought Me? Wist ye not that 
I must be about My Father's business?"— V. 49. 

THE WONDERFUL BABE of Bethlehem 

"grew and waxed strong, filled with wisdom, 

and the grace of God was upon Him." 

The perfect child, the perfect boy, was of 

course far in advance of imperfect children. 

The schooling privileges of today were unknown. 

The education gleaned by the 

masses came to them chiefly through contact 

with their elders; history itself being 

handed down from generation to generation, 

except for the scholarly. Jewish boys, however, had 

an advantage over those of other nations because of the 

Divine regulation of the temple services and the services 

in the synagogues every Sabbath day. Those services consisted 

particularly of readings from the Law and the 

Prophets by course. Thus all Jewish children had excellent 

facilities for hearing the Word of the Lord. "They 

have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them." Few 

had more opportunities than this— few were able to read; 

but Jesus was amongst those few— not because of schooling 

privileges in His youth, but because of His brilliant mind, 

which retained everything that came to it and to which, 

therefore, the Bible was continually an open book. 



The surpassing abilities of Jesus are attested by 
the fact that when He entered the synagogue of His 
home city, Nazareth, His superiority as a reader and an 
exponent was so generally recognized that the service was 
usually turned over to Him. (Luke 4:16.) And yet the 
people marveled, saying, How comes it that Jesus is a 
man of letters, having never gone to school? And they 
all bore Him witness and wondered at the grace of His 
speech. (Luke 4:22.) The explanation of the matter is 
that Jesus was perfect while all about Him were 
imperfect. 

Our lesson relates particularly to an incident which 
occurred when Jesus was twelve years old. His "parents" 
were strict religionists and obeyed the Mosaic Law by attending 
regularly the Feast of Passover at Jerusalem 
every year, and on this occasion Jesus was with them. 
The expression "parents" does not imply that Saint Luke 
supposed Joseph to be the father of Jesus any more than 
that Mary so considered the matter when (verse 48) she 
spoke of Joseph as being His "father." He was the foster 
father of Jesus— His foster parent, and Jesus was his 
foster child; the language is in exact harmony with what 
we would use under such circumstances today and is not 
a basis for any just criticism. 

As might be surmised, the gathering of Jews from all 
parts of Palestine, yea, from the entire world, meant great 
crowds of people; on some occasions more than a million. 
Different families from different localities usually traveled 
together as one caravan. It was a Jewish custom that a 
Jewish boy should be considered "a son of the Law" when 
he had attained his twelfth year. He then became responsible 
under the Law and thenceforth was required to keep 
its festivals, etc. 

R4957 : page 31 

JESUS A GREAT STUDENT 

At the time in question Jesus had attained His twelfth 
birthday. He well knew of His peculiar birth and of the 
great prophecies which centered in Him, related by Gabriel 
to His mother, and was on the alert to fulfil His mission- 
to do the will of the Heavenly Father. He surmised 
that since at twelve years of age Jewish boys came under 
the requirements of the Law Covenant, this arrangement 
might possibly have been made as an indication of His 
proper course and duty— that that was the time at which 
He should begin His ministry. 

Therefore He resolved to consult the very highest 
authorities respecting the teachings of the Law upon this 
subject. From time to time He sought intercourse with 
the learned Scribes and Pharisees and Doctors. He 
wished to make no mistake; He was therefore not satisfied 
with simply their opinion, but desired references to the 
Law and to the Prophets that He Himself might judge 
and not rely too implicitly upon the conclusions of others. 



During a considerable part of the time of the Passover 
Feast the great men of His nation were engaged in public 
functions, and hence His best opportunity for conference 
with them was at the close of the feast, and then as He 
could gain their attention— coming time and again with 
new questions, with fresh inquiries about other types and 
symbols and their proper meaning. 

When the time came for the return journey He had 
not finished His investigations of the Scripture teachings 
on this point. His parents, thinking that He was in the 
company with some of their relatives, went a day's journey 
homeward before they ascertained that He was not in 
the company. Then they returned, journeying another 
day, and the third day they found Him in the temple 
with the learned men discussing the question which to 
Him was the all-important one of the hour— the time at 
which public ministry might be begun, according to the 
Law. Evidently He had just finished His quest and found 
as His satisfactory answer that, although a boy at twelve 
became amenable to the Law, none could enter upon a 
teaching or preaching service until thirty years of age. 
This matter had evidently been settled just prior to the 
arrival of His parents. 

Joseph, the foster father of Jesus, said nothing, allowing 
his wife, Mary, to chide Jesus with having been negligent 
of His duty toward them— causing them trouble, 
grief, annoyance by not coming promptly with them on 
the return journey. The words of Jesus may be paraphrased 
thus: Did you not know that I was twelve years 
of age; was it not your understanding that I had reached 
the time when I must become a son of the Law? Did you 
not know that this might mean to me some great responsibility 
in connection with my service of the Heavenly 

R4958 : page 31 

Father? Did you not forewarn me that such responsibilities 
were to be looked for by myself and that I must be 
diligent to accomplish my mission? Why, then, may I 
ask, should you be surprised and disappointed in finding 
that I had tarried behind you? Did it not occur to you 
that as a son of the Law I might have responsibilities at 
this time and that I must use every opportunity to be 
about my Father's business— to do whatever work I should 
find He has appointed for me? But now I will give you 
no further trouble. I have ascertained through study and 
conference with the Doctors of the Law that there is 
nothing that I can do as a minor in the way of beginning 
the Father's service. I am therefore ready to return with 
you to our home, and I assure you that I shall be as loyal 
and obedient to you as heretofore and that my apparent 
neglect of your wishes in the present instance was merely 
because I supposed that you knew that I would be looking 
out for my Heavenly Father's business and my privileges 
in connection with it, and that you would therefore not 
be necessarily expecting me to return home at this time. 



JESUS INCREASED IN WISDOM 

In the last verse of our study we read: "Jesus increased 
in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men."

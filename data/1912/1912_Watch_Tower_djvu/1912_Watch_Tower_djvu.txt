THIS SPECIAL ISSUE OT INTEREST, WE TRUST 

The newspaper syndicate handling Pastor Kus- 
sell's sermons, believing that the World Tour of th& 
Foreign Missions Investigations Committee, of which 
Brother Russell is chairman, would furnish interest- 
ing "copy" for their list of patrons and news 
editors m general (which we realize to mean a still 
more extensive promulgation of Present Truth), have 
gotten out a very attractive pamphlet, descriptive 
of some of his sucees&ful meetings at home and 
abroad, and containing illustrations which have ap- 
peared in the press of the world, together with 
various items in Brother Russell's hibtoij, t>aid to 
be desirable matter in Newspaperdom 

Since first the "round-the-world trip" wa& men- 
tioned in the columns of The Watch Tower, con- 
siderable interest has been manifested in the move- 
ment by the dear friends in various parts, believing 
with us that it is no unimportant step in the Harvest 
vrork, furnishing, as it dues, a still greater oppor- 
tunity to proclaim the Gobpel "in all the world for 
a witness " 

It has occurred to us that we could not present 
to our readers anything of greater interest than 
this Souvenir Announcement, hence we have adopted 
it for this issue, and have encased the whole in a 
special "Watch Tower cover. \Ve trust that our efforts 
m this respect to please mav be successful

Upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity; the sea and the waves (the restless, discontented) roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear 
and for looking forward to the things coming upon the earth (society); for the powers of the heavens (ecclesiasticitm) shall be shaken. . . . When 
ye sec these things come to pass, then know that the Kingdom of God is nigh at hand. Look up, lift up your heads, rejoice, for your redemption 
draweth nigh.— Lute 21 -eyiS-ji. [4943] 



FOREWORD 




HIS announcement is dedicated to newspaper Editors and Publishers, 
and we hope it may encourage some of even greater zeal in their 
efforts in serving their constituency. The first article, "The Press and 
the Public," while not bearing directly on Pastor Russell's proposed 
tour, is inserted because it, in unique style, excellently describes certain 
prevailing conditions, which, when properly appreciated by Editors, 
make easy the solution of certain vexatious questions of the past. 

Approximately fifteen hundred Editors are at present publishing 
weekly Pastor Russell "copy," furnished in various countries through 
Press Associations, News Syndicates or Lecture Bureaus. In a 
special endeavor to serve the interests of the Editors receiving their 
services, the American Lecture Bureau and Press Association invited Pastor Russell to make 
a Round-the- World Tour, hoping thus to enable him to give his many millions of readers the 
benefit of his keen observation and wonderful power of description when applied to the 
present status and prospects of Christianity in heathen lands. 

Pastor Russell is at present on his regular Autumn lecture tour in Great Britain. 
He is due in New York November 24th. After spending a few days at home, he 
will begin the Round-the- World Tour by leaving for the Pacific coast, sailing from San 
Francisco for Honolulu December 13th. Small interior points, as well as many leading 
cities, are to be visited in Oriental and African Countries ; and the Pastor Russell party is 
due in London next March, in time for Pastor Russell to fill his regular British engagements. 

The International Bible Students Association assembled in general annual convention 
at Mountain Lake Park, Maryland, Sept. 1-11, 1911, appointed General Wm. P. Hall, 
U. S. A.; Robert B. Maxwell, Mansfield, Ohio; E. W. V. Kuehn, Toledo; Prof. F. H. 
Robison, Ontario; J. T. D. Pyles, Washington, D. C; Dr. Leslie W. Jones, Chicago, and 
Pastor Russell, as a committee to investigate the subject of Foreign Mission Work — as to 
the present conditions, methods employed, doctrines taught, disbursement of funds, etc. 
The first six gentlemen named go as contributors and laymen. At the first meeting of the 
committee, held at the Waldorf-Astoria, New York City, Sept. 25th, for organization and 
adoption of plans of procedure, Pastor Russell was made chairman, and Prof. Robison 
secretary. The International Bible Students Association expects this committee, upon their 
return, to report without fear or favor all important facts that would properly have a bear- 
ing upon their policy respecting future support in person or by purse. 

The special sermons by Pastor Russell while on this tour will be stirring "copy," con- 
taining much valuable information interestingly commented on from his, an independent, 
standpoint. We beg leave to venture the one assertion that this "Round-the- World Tour" 
will be instrumental in bringing from Pastor Russell's Pen the most remarkable and valu- 
able writings of the age on past and present "Christian Endeavor" in the Foreign Mission- 
ary Field. On page fifteen detailed information is given showing how Pastor Russell's 
writings reach the Press and the people.

PASTOR RUSSELL'S ROUND-THE-WORLD TOUR 



THE PRESS AND THE PUBLIC 




EW indeed are those that realize the opportunities and the power of the Press 
in this the twentieth century. So great is this power that the generally ac- 
cepted opinion of a nation upon a subject may be completely reversed within 
a month. This was not so fifty or one hundred years ago. Under former 
conditions it would have taken a century to crystalize public opinion on such 
a matter as the recent Dr. Cook and Com- 
modore Perry North Pole controversy. 

through the Press, placed 

the "Tribunal of Public 

consequently was readily 
settled, furnishing an excellent example of 
how the people of the whole world take 
knowledge and settle matters in this our day. 




7Tu's case was, 
on trial before 
Opinion," and 



A case of a thousand times greater im- 
portance is now up for trial before this 
same "Tribunal of Public Opinion." Sectarianism has, within 
the very recent past, been placed in the balance. Shall she be 
found wanting? 

We see denominational prestige and influence being shattered 
on the right and on the left Seemingly, thinking people have 
suddenly awakened to an individual responsibility and are examin- 
ing the teachings of the past, and are inquiring, "Why so many divisions among professed Christians?" 
So general is this awakening that a reasonable answer to this question must be forthcoming. 

Many clergymen, realizing the personal advantages of sect preservation, and of keeping the 
masses under some sort of religious influence, are now willing, even under protest, to exclusively advo- 
cate simply a brotherhood among men, insisting only upon the retention of a few fundamentals, such 

as the Fatherhood of God, the Saviourhood of Jesus, 
and the Brotherhood of Man. 

Momentous indeed are the consequences, and de- 
cisive will be the verdict in this issue. In the face of the 
radical sectarian teachings of the past centuries, we may 
well ask, "What will the verdict be?" Will the people 
allow venerated doctrines of their fathers to be covered 
up or abandoned without explanation? We think not. 
The "first impressions" received in childhood are perhaps 
still with us, no matter how unsatisfactory they may be. 
They cannot be forgotten nor wiped out of the mind, 
unless something more reasonable is offered and accepted 
in their stead. 

To the minds of many, religion and politics suggest 
a similar picture. As political party doctrines are seldom 
praised by adherents of an opposing party, or vice versa, so 
it is with clergymen of every community. Sectarian preach- 
ers, in order to retain their pulpits, must do a denominational 
work, and therefore cannot extol, or even admit, the good 
pouits of competing denominations.

Not satisfied with this condition, the general public, by 
the aid of the Press, have figuratively raised themselves up 
above the heads of both stump speaker and sectarian 
preacher. The masses refuse longer to be bound by party 
or creed bonds or ties, and consequently are "freethinkers" 
and "independents." This fact is fully attested by the 
admitted great falling away from the churches and the 
enormous independent vote cast in the recent State and National Elections of the various countries. 

Independents now constitute the big congregation and can be influenced by, and will pay sincere 
respect to, only an independent. It matters not how able, as a writer or speaker, one of your local 
sectarian ministers may be, he can hold as a following only those of his own congregation, which is, 
at most, only a small portion of what should be the constituency of any representative newspaper.

Thus is manifested an unprecedented opportunity for the Press. Will it be grasped? Yes! 
The Newspapers at present constitute the only channel through which the solution of this mighty 

problem can be speedily disseminated among the people. 
The clergymen have waited too long; they once had the 
public ear and confidence; they now have neither. As to 
doctrines they now stand repudiated. The Daily and the 
Weekly Press of the present day are the sole source of 
information for millions of families, and these families as- 
suredly will, through the Press, learn a harmonious, com- 
plete and satisfactory explanation of heretofore incompre- 
hensible doctrinal questions. 

Hundreds of Editors, realizing their responsibilities and 
possible opportunity, sought a solution and found it. They, 
after many experiments, were forced to acknowledge that 
their sermon or religious department, even though edited by 
a high class local minister, would not secure for their paper 
the personal influence of Christians belonging to congrega- 
tions served by other ministers, nor could they interest the 
large non-church going element of their community. In- 
variably, to publish the "copy" of a local man was to invite 
criticism from either the clergy or laity of other denomina- 
tions.

Are reached 



Finally the solution was found, 
dreds of editors have since demonstrated that the best way 
to completely fulfil their responsibility to the public and to 
successfully cater to the active Christians of all denomina- 
tions is to publish "copy" prepared by an "independent ' 
who is not endeavoring to build up any particular denomina- 
tion at the expense of another; "copy" emanating from some 
outside city; "copy" that will appeal to the heart of not 
only every Christian, but also to skeptic, Jew or Gentile; 
"copy" prepared without malice, but with an abundance of 
charity for all; "copy" written by a man who ably shows 
forth from the Scriptures a logical basis for true Christian 
unity amongst Christians of all denominations, in addition 
to the desired general brotherhood of man. This sort of 
"copy" was found in the weekly articles prepared by an 
"independent," Pastor Russell of London and Brooklyn 
Tabernacles. 

That you may know something of this man, who can ^ ^ 

satisfactorily serve you in the capacity of Editor of your weekly "sermon" or of your Sunday 
School Department," we are sending you this little booklet, which is dedicated to our friends, the 
editors of the more than fourteen hundred newspapers at present publishing Pastor Russell "copy" 
weekly. So notable testimony was never before accorded by editors to any religious writer, past or 
present.

PASTOR RUSSELL'S ROUND-THE-WORLD TOUR 



A PASTOR IN THE MAKING 



Charles Taze, second son of Joseph L. and Ann Eliza (Bimey) Russell, was born in Pitts- 
burgh. Pa., in 1852, and is shown in the accompanying portrait at the age of three years. 
At about this time the Russell children began to receive their "first impressions" on religion, some of 
which have since been shattered, notably those relating to the supposed literal lake of fire as a 
place of eternal torment for the unsaved. 

The strong resemblance between the portraits of Pastor 
Russell at sixty, and Charles Taze at three, is unusual, and 
the character lines indicating determination rather suggest 
the explanation for his subsequent independent evangelistic 
wort 

Up to the age of fifteen he believed, as gospel truth, 
all and only such doctrines as his sectarian ministers had 
taught him. To learn to understand doctrines at that period 
was very difficult, as the clergy usually discouraged in- 
dividual Bible research, and the asking of questions on 
doctrines was then considered equivalent to doubting, and 
"to doubt was to be damned." 

The dissipation of this superstitious reverence and fear 
only awaited such time as he should attempt to defend by 
the Scriptures his particular sectarian views, and subsequent 
events justify the thought that Providence had decreed that 
just at this juncture young Russell should attempt to re- 
claim an infidel acquaintance to Christianity. 

By skillful questions, which were unanswerable by 
either minister or laymen from their sectarian standpoints, 
and by the maneuvering of many seemingly paradoxical 
Scriptures, the infidel completely routed young Russell, who 
within a few months became an admitted skeptic. Here, 
as in nearly every similar case, the Bible was discarded 
together with the doctrines of the creed. Few, indeed, under 
such circumstances, study the Scriptures to see whether they 
had been properly interpreted, and Charles Taze Russell 
was no exception. 

As he desired to learn the truth regarding the hereafter, the next few years were devoted to the 
investigation of the claims of the leading Oriental religions, all of which he found to be unworthy of 
credence, hence we see him arriving at manhood's estate with a mind unsatisfied, a mind which, de- 
spite all efforts to the contrary, was still subject to its occasional bad hours on account of its "first 
imoression" on the eternal torment theory. 

WHY HE BECAME A BIBLE TEACHER 

At twenty-one Mr. Russell was possessed of much knowledge and voluminous data on "re- 
ligion" as believed in and practised in all parts of the world. Apparently these were to become of no 
value to himself or others because of large business responsibilities that were placed on him at this time. 
Days grew into weeks and weeks into months and he found less and less time to devote to theological 
research, and the solace for heart and head so diligently sought for seemed as remote to him as ever. 

The question that here confronted him was, "Shall I try longer to find the truth on religion? 
Or shall I smother the hope of finding it and strive for fame and fortune among the financial and 
commercial captains of the time?" The latter he was about to do, but fortunately he decided first to 
search the Scriptures from a skeptic's standpoint, for its own answer on hell-fire and brimstone. 

Amazed at the harmonious testimony, proving an unexpected but satisfactory answer, he under- 
took systematic Bible research, and was brought to a complete confidence in the Bible as being in- 
spired by an all-wise, powerful, just and loving Creator, worthy of adoration and worship. Thus 
a sure anchor for a fainting hope was found, and an honest, truth-seeking heart was made glad.

PASTOR RUSSELL'S ROUND-THE-WORLD TOUR 



VISITS THE HOLY LAND 

INTERPRETS GREAT PYRAMID 




HE unfulfilled promises to the Jews, spoken of hundreds of times by the prophets of old, 
and reaffirmed in the writings of the New Testament, attracted Pastor Russell's early at- 
tention, and consequendy the time of the restoration of the Jews in Palestine, as a Nation, 
became a question of almost paramount importance to his mind. In order to verify or 
disprove certain claims or supposed facts. Pastor Russell visited the Holy Land in 1 892, 
verifying much valuable information contained in his third volume of "Scripture Studies," 
wherein he interestingly treats the complex Jewish racial problem, past, present and future. 
This trip was the real beginning of a campaign to attract the attention of the world 
to the future inheritance of the natural "seed of Abraham." 
During the past twenty years, Pastor Russell has written much on Jewish topics and has ad- 
dressed many Jewish audiences on Biblical Zionism, pointing out the significance of the many unful- 
filled promises to them by Jehovah, 

fiu stUe 3 bSlfe THE GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZEH 

at the border. The Bible Stone-Witnes. 

yet in the center, 
of Egypt stands 
strangely related 
to the hope of the 
Jew, and Pastor 
Russell has most 
in t e r estingly 
treated the meas- 
urements, angles, 
shape, size, weight, 
passag e - w a y s , 
King's Chamber, 
Queen's Chamber, 
etc., as positive 
corroborative evi- 
dence of the time 
prophecies of the 
prophets of old. 
His findings, as 
explained in the 
symbolic language 
of "Holy Writ," 
read like a re- 
markable piece of 
fiction, when in 
reality it is a 

plain, yet entrancing narrative of Jehovah's Plan as respects the various ages and His dispensational 
dealings with the human race, terminating with the full restoration of the Jewish people in the land 
of their fathers, during the "times of restitution of all things." 

Prof. C. Piazzi Smith, F.R.S.E., F.R.A.S., Ex-Astronomer Royal for Scotland, in a letter 
written from Clova, Ripon, England, Dec. 21,1 890, commenting on Pastor Russell's interpretation 
of the Pyramid, said in part : "At first I could find only slips of the type-writer, but as I progressed 
through the pages, the powers, the specialties and the originalities of the Author came out magnifi- 
cently; and there were not a few passages I should have been glad to take a copy of for quotation, 
with name, in the next possible edition of my own Pyramid book. But of course I did nothing of 
that sort, and shall wait with perfect patience and in most thankful mood of mind for when the 
Author shall choose his own time for publishing. So I merely remark here that he is both good and 
new in much that he says on the chronology of the various parts of the Pyramid, especially the 
First Ascending Passage and its granite plug; on the Grand Gallery, as illustrating the Lord's life; on 
the parallelisms between the King's Chamber and its granite, against the (Jewish) Tabernacle and 
its gold ; and generally on the confirmations or close agreements between Scripture and the Great 
Pyramid." 

The late Dr. John Edgar, M.A., B.So., M.B., CM., F.F.P.S.G., of Glasgow, Scotland, 
with his brother Morton, in 1909, visited Gizeh to critically test Pastor Russell's deductions. Their 
verdict, after a most elaborate investigation, was a thorough endorsement of Pastor Russell's inter- 
pretation of the Great Pyramid, the greatest of the world's wonders. 



[4953] 




THE CHEAT PYRAMID 

Built 2 1 70 B, C. probably by Melchizedek . In it« own symbolic language it so 
states. Seemingly every stone in this, the most remarkable building in the world, has 
been made to testify by Pastor Russell in his remarkable interpretation.

THE VOW BOOKMARK 

We have prepared a very neat bookmark of thin white 
celluloid. On one side of it The Vow is printed in clear type 
in dark blue ink. On the other side is a picture of the white 
dove which hangs in the center of Brother Russell's study 
in Brooklyn. Under the picture is a beautiful poem entitled 
"The Bridegroom's Dove," which is a real inspiration to 
Christlikeness. It was our intention to send one of these 
with each WATCH TOWER receipt, but we find that some were 
missed. 

We now have reports from about ten thousand who have 
taken The Vow, and we would like each of these to have one 
of the bookmarks. Any such who have not received one 
will please send us a post-card so stating, and they will receive 
one by return mail. 



THE NEWSPAPER SYNDICATE'S IDEA 

For the benefit of our readers we remark that Brother 
Russell is very anxious to co-operate with the Newspaper 
Syndicate which handles his weekly sermons. While he retains 
fullest liberty in respect to the subject matter of his 
discourses, he yields other points considerably to the Syndicate's 
wishes. This will account for his greater care in his 
clothing, his more frequent use of cabs and parlor cars. The 
Syndicate insists that Brother Russell's personality has much 
to do in placing his sermons far and near. And Brother Russell 
is glad to yield to the Syndicate's business judgment, because 
he desires that his Gospel message shall be heard the 
world around. 



PROLIFIC BEANS FOR SEED 

Sister Smith of Nebraska recently discovered one stalk of 
beans which she declares yielded so prolifically that she calls it 
the Millennial Bean. She desires to get the beans into the 



hands of others, and at the same time to make a donation to 
our Tract Fund for the sending forth of free spiritual food 
to the hungry. Accordingly the beans have been sent to our 
office. 

We believe the project quite a proper one, and if the beans 
be as prolific elsewhere as in Nebraska, we would be glad to 
purchase them at the rate of five beans for one dollar. (We 
have heard of seed wheat selling at one dollar per grain.) 

However, in view of unfriendly criticism of enemies, we 
think it best not to sell these beans, but to give them free to 
our subscribers who have gardens, and who will request them 
—five beans each. 

Sister Smith writes that they should be planted one bean 
to the hill, and the hills six feet apart. They should be planted 
in April. They keep bearing right along for weeks, and five 
should supply a small family. They will be ready to ship in 
February. 



R4963 : page 26 

CURE FOR APPENDICITIS 

It is known that only about three out of every one hundred 
operated upon for appendicitis really have a diseased appendix 
needing removal. We give below a simple cure for appendicitis 
symptoms. The pain in the appendix region is caused by 
the biting of worms near the junction of the transverse colon 
with the small intestines, low down on the right side of the 
abdomen. 

This remedy is recommended also for typhoid fever, which 
is also a worm disease. The medicine is Santonine: dose, 3 
grains, an hour before breakfast; repeated for four mornings, 
or until all the symptoms disappear. Then one dose per month 
for three months to eradicate all germs. 

This recipe is of incalculable value. Not only will it save 
the surgeon's and hospital fees of perhaps $200, but it saves 
weeks of ill health, inconvenience, convalescence and loss of 
salary. 



R4955 : page 27 

VIEWS FROM THE WATCH TOWER 

PULPIT HAS LOST POWER 

THE Rev. Lyman Abbott, of New York, spoke 
sadly of the decadence of the power of the 
pulpit, addressing 3,000 University of Wisconsin 
men and women at a convention at 
Madison, Wis. 'It is said the cloth has lost 
its power— it has,' said Dr. Abbott. 'It is 
said the pulpit has lost its power— it has. 



But a man, altruistic in the highest sense 
and spiritual, will never lose his power.'" 
* * *— Press Report. 

It was certainly appropriate that Dr. Abbott should 
make the above statement to college people. Admitting 
the facts, let us find also their cause. It is because 
of the inconsistency of its teaching that the pulpit has 
lost its power with the masses. The pulpit backs up and 
endorses the teachings of all the colleges of our day 
along the lines of Higher Criticism and Evolution. The 
people are coming to understand that this means that the 
pulpit is in antagonism to the Bible. If Evolution be 
true, man never fell and hence needed no Redeemer and 
no saving from a fallen state, but needed merely to be 
let alone in his evolutionary progress. According to 
Higher Criticism the Bible in general is unreliable. 
Moses never wrote the books accredited to him, and 
Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel and others never wrote the 
books accredited to them— never were inspired of God to 
write these books. And if this be true, then Jesus and 
the Apostles were deceived and could not have been 
inspired by God when they quoted from these sacred 
writings of the past and declared them to be the Word 
of God and vouched for their authorship. 

NO WONDER CHURCH ATTENDANCE IS SLIM 

On the other hand the public notice that the very 
ministers who thus preach Evolution, Higher Criticism, 
unbelief in the Divine Revelation, keep right along 
preaching some of the absurdities which our forefathers 
claimed were in harmony with the Bible. Is it any 
wonder that the people are coming to see the inconsistency 
of such a position? How long might they expect 
to be blind to it? What must be the influence? 

The result is that the masses have less and less confidence 
in the clergy. The people do not know what the 
clergy believe even when they hear them speak, for their 
address may be from the standpoint of the creeds or 
from the standpoint of Higher Criticism, according to 
their moods. The result of this uncertain sounding of the 
trumpet is that the masses are coming to the conclusion 
that the whole matter of religion is a big guess and 
that some of the guesses are influenced by temporal considerations. 
No wonder Church attendance is slim! No 
wonder doubt and skepticism are prevalent! No wonder 
that faith in the Bible is undermined and religion made 
to look ridiculous and contradictory! 

The unbelief of the people grows and threatens to 
become agnosticism, or worse, atheism! Those who have 
brought about this condition of things during the past 
thirty years are the college professors and the best educated 
pulpiteers of Christendom. And now they stand 
astonished at the results, which they should have foreseen. 
Verily they are fulfilling the Divine prophecies of 
Isaiah, which, referring to our day, declare, "The wisdom 



of their wise men shall perish; the understanding of their 
prudent men shall not be manifest." (Isa. 29:14.) No 
wonder the civilized world is in trepidation as it sees the 
onward march of Socialism! And however honest and 
well-intentioned many Socialists may be, the result of 
their effort will spell anarchy and a time of trouble such 
as the world has never yet seen— a time of trouble, however, 
predicted by Daniel the Prophet, whose prediction 
was endorsed by Jesus Himself.— Dan. 12:1; Matt. 24:21. 



What is the remedy? No remedy can possibly reach 
the disease! The Bible rightly understood is the balm 
of Gilead which alone could have helped. But matters 
have gone so far that comparatively few have sufficient 
confidence in the Bible to be willing to make a re-examination 
of it in the light of the Divine Plan of the Ages, 
which alone shows the harmony of the Word of God, 
from Genesis to Revelation. 

But while we cannot hope to stem the tide of "higher 
critical," evolutionary infidelity— while we cannot hope to 
counteract the influences of more than half of Christendom 
and of three-fourths of all the pulpits of Christendom, 
we do hope, by the Lord's grace, to find some of the 
Truth-hungry sheep and to assist them to an appreciation 
of the Heavenly Father's Message, given by Jesus, the 
Apostles and Prophets, but lost during the Dark Ages. 
We can help them to find the lost key of knowledge, 
whereby God's Word opens up, revealing to the eyes of 
faith and obedience a Creator infinite in Wisdom, Justice, 
Love and Power, a Savior and a great one, able 
to save to the uttermost all who come unto the Father 
through Him, and a Divine arrangement and Plan consistent 
with the Divine character. By these means the 
Lord's faithful ones will be sustained from falling in 
this evil day mentioned by the Apostles and Prophets. ~ 
Eph. 6:11-13; Psa. 91:7. 



R4956 : page 28 

THE TEST OF ENDURANCE 

"Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast 
himself as he that putteth it off."— 1 Kings 20:11. 

THE TEST OF ENDURANCE is certainly 
one of the severest tests of faithfulness to 
which the elect Church, the Body of Christ, 
is subjected. It is the test which gages and 
registers the strength of every other virtue 
and grace, and no soldier of the cross will 
be crowned with the laurels of victory who 
has not stood this test. The Christian life 



is a warfare, and the above words of one of 

the kings of Israel to a boastful enemy of 

the Lord's people, are applicable, not only to every new 

recruit in the Lord's army, but, similarly, to all who have 

not yet finished the good fight of faith. 

The first gush of enthusiasm in the Lord's service, 
much as we may and do appreciate it, may be but the 
hasty production of the shallow soil of a heart which immediately 
receives the truth with gladness but, having no 
root in itself, endures but for a time, and afterward, when 
affliction and persecution arise, immediately is offended. 
(Mark 4:16,17.) Such characters cannot stand the fiery 
tests of this "evil day," whereof it is written— "The fire 
[of that day] shall try every man's work, of what sort it 
is."— 1 Cor. 3:13. 

NECESSITY FOR THE WHOLE ARMOR 

Therefore, says the Apostle Peter, "Beloved, think it 
not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, 
as though some strange thing happened unto you." (1 Pet. 4:12.) 
All of the elect Church must be so tried; and 
blessed is he that shall endure unto the end. The sure 
Word of prophecy points to severe conflicts and great 
trials in the closing scenes of the Church's history. Elijah, 
a type of the Body of Christ, finished his earthly career 
and went up by a whirlwind in a chariot of fire— strong 
symbols of storms and great afflictions. John, another 
type of the Church, was cast into prison and then beheaded. 
And we are forewarned of the great necessity of 
the whole armor of God, if we would stand in this "evil 
day."-STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES, Series 2, Chap. 8. 

It therefore behooves every one who aspires to the 
prize of our high calling to brace himself for the severer 
conflicts and trials of faith and patience that may suddenly 
and without a moment's warning be sprung upon him. 
In the battle of this day, as in all other battles, the effort 
of the Enemy is to surprise and suddenly attack and overwhelm 
the Lord's people; and the only preparation, therefore, 
that can be made for such emergencies is constant 
vigilance and prayer and the putting on of the whole armor 
of God— the Truth and the spirit of the Truth. 

WHICH WAY WILL YOU TURN? 

"In your patience possess ye your souls." No other 
grace will be more needed than this in the fiery ordeals 
of this "evil day;" for without great patience no man can 
endure to the end. All along the Christian's pathway, 
ever and anon, he comes to a new crisis; perhaps these 
are often seemingly of trivial importance, yet he realizes 
that they may be turning points in his Christian course. 
Who has not realized them? There comes a temptation 
to weariness in well-doing, together with the suggestion 
of an easier way; or there springs up a little root of pride 
or ambition, with suggestions of ways and means for feeding 



and gratifying it. Then there comes, by and by, the 
decisive moment when you must choose this course or that; 
and lo, you have reached a crisis! 

Which way will you turn? Most likely you will turn 
in the direction to which the sentiments you have cultivated 
have been tending, whether that be the right way or 
the wrong way. If it be the wrong way, most likely you 
will be unable to discern it clearly; for your long cultivated 
sentiments will sway your judgment. "There is a 
way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof is 
the way of death." (Prov. 14:12.) How necessary, 
therefore, is prayer, that in every crisis we may pass the 
test successfully! Nor can we safely delay to watch and 
pray until the crisis is upon us; but such should be our 
constant attitude. 

THOSE WHO OUTRIDE THE TRIALS WILL BE THE OVERCOMERS 

The life of a soldier, ever on the alert and on duty, 
is by no means an easy life; nor do the Scriptures warrant 
any such expectation. On the contrary, they say, 
"Endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ;" 
"Fight the good fight of faith," etc. And yet many Christian 
people seem to have the very opposite idea. Their 
ideal Christian life is one without a breeze or a storm; it 
must be one continuous calm. Such a life was indeed 
more possible in former days than now, though the 
world, the flesh and the Devil always have opposed them, 
and always have had to be resisted by every loyal 
soldier of the cross. But now the opposition is daily 
becoming more and more intense; for Satan realizes 
that his time is short, and he is determined by any and 
every means to exert his power against the consummation 
of the Lord's plan for the exaltation of the Church. 

Consequently, we have had within this Harvest period 
many and severe storms of opposition; and still there are 
doubtless more severe trials to follow. But those who, 
with overcoming faith, outride them all— who patiently 
endure, who cultivate the spirit of Christ with its fruits 
and graces, and who valiantly fight the good fight of faith, 
rather than withdraw from the field— such will be the 
"overcomers" to whom the laurels of victory will be given 
when the crowning day has come. 



R4955 : page 28 

WE BELIEVE THE BIBLE 

THOSE WHO OPPOSE our teaching are 
given to misrepresenting it. They do not 
wish to speak untruthfully, but desire to 
hinder our work, which they fail to recognize 
as the Lord's work. 
It is difficult to answer the arguments of 



our opponents in a few words, when they 

misunderstand our presentations of more 

than three thousand pages. If they cannot 

understand a detailed account, we have no 

hope of making a brief one satisfactory to them. However, 

we give here a synopsis:— 

I. We affirm the humanity of Jesus and the deity of 
Christ. 

II. We acknowledge that the personality of the Holy 
Spirit is the Father and the Son; that the Holy Spirit 
proceeds from both, and in turn from all who are begotten 
by it. 

III. We affirm the resurrection of Christ— that He 

was put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the Spirit. 
We deny that He was raised in the flesh, and challenge 
any statement to that effect as being unscriptural. 

IV. We affirm, with the Scriptures, that God alone 
possessed immortality, "dwelling in the light which no 
man can approach unto." We affirm that this Divine 
quality has already been granted to the Lord Jesus and is 
to be the portion of the elect Bride, the "Body of Christ." 
As for mankind, we affirm the Divine provision for these 

R4956 : page 29 

and for angels to be everlasting life for the obedient. 
This, by many, is mistermed immortality. We follow the 
Scriptures strictly. 

V. We hold that the entire race lost life with Father 
Adam, as a result of his failure in Eden; and that Christ 
died to secure a second chance for Adam and an individual 
chance for all of his race, who lost their first chance in 
Adam when he sinned. "As all in Adam die, even so all 

in Christ shall be made alive." (I Cor. 15:21,22.) A 
few of us, comparatively, having eyes of faith and ears 
of understanding, have had this second chance in the 
present life. Adam and the great mass of his posterity 
must get their second chance after being awakened from 
the tomb. But NOBODY IS TO GET A THIRD CHANCE! 

VI. We believe that the soul was condemned to death. 
"The soul that sinneth it shall die." We believe that this 
death would have been eternal, everlasting destruction, 
had it not been for God's mercy in and through our 
Lord's redemptive work. By reason of His death our 
souls do not die in this full sense of the word, but are 
Scripturally said to "fall asleep," "asleep in Jesus." The 
awakening will be in the resurrection morning; and the 
interim will be a period of unconsciousness, beautifully 
symbolized by a restful sleep. 

VII. We believe in the "hell" of the Bible, sheol. 
This, the only word used for hell for four thousand years, 
is translated more than one-half the time grave in our 
Common Version, and should always be thus translated. 
"Hades," in the New Testament, is its equivalent. "Gehenna 
fire," of the New Testament, is a symbolical picture 
declared to signify the Second Death. 



VIII. We believe that God is able to destroy "both 

soul and body" in Gehenna— the Second Death. We consider 
it much more sane to believe thus, as it is more 
Scriptural, than to believe that in creating man God did 
a work which He could not undo; much more reasonable 
also than to believe He prefers to have the incorrigible 
suffer eternally, when their sufferings could do neither 
themselves nor others any good. 

IX. We believe that, like the Father and the holy 
angels, our Lord is a spirit being. We are convinced 

that "flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God." 
We do not believe that our Lord has a flesh and blood 
body, a "little lower than the angels," and has thus been 
out of harmony with His heavenly environment for 
nearly two thousand years. We believe the Apostle's 
statement, "Now the Lord is that Spirit." This is the 
Jesus who will "so come, in like manner," quietly and 
unknown to the world, as He went away. We do not 
affirm, dogmatically, that He came in 1874, but we say 
that to us it is the evident teaching of the Scriptures. 
Our Lord warned us not to expect Him in the flesh; that 
men might say "Lo, here" or "Lo, there." The Harvest 
work in the universal Church Nominal, the Laodicean 
period of the Church, well corroborates our expectations 
of what His work will be, as outlined in His parables, etc.

"BORN KING OF THE JEWS" 

-MATTHEW 2:1-12.-FEBRUARY 4.- 

"Look unto Me and be ye saved, all ye ends of the earth; 
for I am God and there is none else."— Isaiah 45:22. 

TODAY'S STUDY relates to the Wise Men 

of the East and their seeing of a wonderful 

star which, as astrologers, they recognized 

to import a great event— the birth of a great 

King. At the time Palestine was a province 

of the Roman Empire, and its King, 

Herod, was not a Jew of the House of 

Jacob, but a representative of the house of 

Esau. Herod sought to perpetuate his dynasty, 

and hence the announcement of the 

shepherds that a great King of the Jews had just been 

born suggested the overthrow of the Herodian dynasty 

and the establishment on Israel's throne of a king in the 

line of David and Solomon. 

Herod's disquietude is easily understood, but the fact 
that the people of Jerusalem in general should be disturbed 
by the annunciation of a king of their own awakens 
thought. Evidently they were in a very self-satisfied condition; 
under the Romans they were experiencing great 



prosperity. Herod, the Edomite, had built them a temple 
the grandeur of which outshone that of Solomon. The 
people were feeling so satisfied with their attainments 
that they had ceased to specially long for and pray for 
the coming of the Messiah, the long-promised King of the 
line of David. They were disturbed lest any change 
should be for the worse— lest it should mean internal 
strife as between Herod and another and lest it should 
mean strife with the Roman Empire, which at the time 
was treating the Jews quite generously. 

A very similar condition of things may be expected in 
conjunction with the second advent of Christ. The powers 
that be today are styled Christ's Kingdom, "Christendom," 
but they are really "kingdoms of this world." Any 
announcement today that Messiah's Kingdom is nigh— 
that He will soon take unto Himself His great power and 
reign (Rev. 11:17)— meets with resentment. If in surprise 
we ask why this indifference respecting the fulfilment of 
our prayer, "Thy Kingdom come," the answer is, "Let 
well enough alone; do not agitate that subject; it may 
bring in strife and contention, because many are prospering 
so well under the reign of the 'Prince of this world' 
that they could not look upon a change as likely to bring 
any improvement in their condition— indeed some of them 
have reason to fear that Messiah's Kingdom would seriously 
disturb their entrenched privileges and monopolistic 
control of the wonderful blessings of our day." 

PRIESTLY INDIFFERENCE ON THE SUBJECT 

Although King Herod called the priests and teachers 
of his day to inquire particularly respecting the prophecies 
of Messiah's birth, and although they answered him correctly, 
nevertheless, the records show no joy, no enthusiasm, 
on the part of the religious teachers in respect to the 
prophetic fulfilment which they had professed to trust in 
and to long for. They were indifferent; none of them 
followed to Bethlehem to find the new born King of the 
Jews. They had become Higher Critics and no longer 
believed the prophecies; they had less faith in them than 
had Herod. 

And do we not find an antitype in this day? Are not 
the chief priests and religious leaders generally so out of 
harmony with the Divine promises and so faithless as 
respects the glorious Messianic Kingdom of which the 
Bible tells, that they are ashamed to identify themselves in 
any degree with those who seek the Lord and wait for His 
Kingdom? Alas! even the Mohammedans and Brahmins 
of the East are waiting for Messiah and the Golden Age 
and disposed to seek the evidences— but amongst the most 
prominent ministers of "Christendom" there is apparent 
unbelief, Higher Criticism, Evolution and general opposition 
to Messiah and His Kingdom. Let the civil government 
fight down if it chooses everything associated with 

R4956 : page 30 



the New Dispensation. These are quite indifferent; they 
have plans and schemes of their own by which they are 
hoping to accomplish the work predicted for Messiah; 
they are anxious to raise money and to convert the world 
without disturbing the present order of things. Alas for 
them! how clearly they are mistaken! how terrible will be 
their disappointment when their cherished plans will all 
fail in a time of trouble which, while it will greatly disappoint 
them, will prove to be the forerunner of the reign of 
righteousness for the blessing of all the families of the 
earth— for the ushering in of "the times of restitution." 

WAS THERE A MISTAKE? 

Nearly nineteen centuries have passed since the events 
of this lesson. Israel, instead of being exalted as Messiah's 
Kingdom, has been wrecked. Was it by mistake 
that Jesus was announced King of the Jews at His birth, 
or did God change His plan because the Jews refused 
Jesus and crucified Him? 

Neither suggestion is correct. Jesus is yet to be the 
King of the Jews and the King of the world. The "mystery" 
is cleared when we understand that there are two 
classes of Jews, two classes of Israelites— a heavenly and 
also an earthly class. Thus there are the two "Seeds of 
Abraham," one of which is to be as the stars of heaven 
and the other as the sands of the seashore. The heavenly, 
the spiritual, must be developed first and be associated 
with Messiah in glory, honor and immortality, far above 
angels. 

It has required all of this Gospel Age for the selecting 
of this Spiritual Seed. With its completion a New Age 
will be inaugurated. Then the earthly blessings promised 
will be fulfilled to the natural seed of Abraham. "They 
shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards 
and eat the fruit thereof"; "the knowledge of the 
glory of the Lord shall fill the whole earth"; to Him 
"every knee will bow and every tongue confess," for all 
who refuse shall be destroyed in the Second Death. (Isa. 65:21; 
Hab. 2:14; Rom. 14:11.) Messiah is already recognized 
as Lord by all Spiritual Israelites. During the 
next Age He will be crowned Lord of all by natural Israel, 
and all other nationalities will enjoy the privilege of 
becoming proselyte children of Abraham in the flesh. 
Messiah will reign in His Mediatorial Kingdom for the 
very purpose of bringing these blessings to natural Israel 
and through her to all nations. 

The relationship of Messiah to Spiritual Israel, the elect 
Church, is quite different from what it will be toward the 
world. He is our Lord and prospective Bridegroom; we 
are His betrothed and prospective Bride, and joint-heirs 
of His glory, and are to be associated in His glorious Messianic 
work. "If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's 
seed, and heirs according to the promise."— Gal. 3:29. 

It will require the entire thousand years of the reign 



of Christ and His Bride to accomplish that promise— the 

R4957 : page 30 

blessing of all the families of the earth with full light 

and knowledge and opportunity for complete return to 

harmony with God and for the recovery of all that was 

lost in Adam and redeemed at Calvary. We by faith hail 

Him as King, even before the establishment of His Kingdom, 

and loyally and gladly submit ourselves to Him, 

pledging our lives in the service of His Cause of righteousness 

and truth. We, when praying, "Thy Kingdom 

come," are expressing our sympathy with the righteousness 

which Messiah's Kingdom shall establish and our 

faith in His promise that we shall sit with Him in His 

Throne. And when we pray that God's will shall be done 

on earth as in heaven we are expressing our confidence 

that the Messianic reign will be glorious and successful 

to the last degree— overthrowing all evil and adverse conditions 

and establishing righteousness amongst men on the 

same permanent foundation that prevails in heaven.

"ABOUT MY FATHER'S BUSINESS" 

-LUKE 2:40-52.-FEBRUARY 11.- 

"How is it that ye sought Me? Wist ye not that 
I must be about My Father's business?"— V. 49. 

THE WONDERFUL BABE of Bethlehem 

"grew and waxed strong, filled with wisdom, 

and the grace of God was upon Him." 

The perfect child, the perfect boy, was of 

course far in advance of imperfect children. 

The schooling privileges of today were unknown. 

The education gleaned by the 

masses came to them chiefly through contact 

with their elders; history itself being 

handed down from generation to generation, 

except for the scholarly. Jewish boys, however, had 

an advantage over those of other nations because of the 

Divine regulation of the temple services and the services 

in the synagogues every Sabbath day. Those services consisted 

particularly of readings from the Law and the 

Prophets by course. Thus all Jewish children had excellent 

facilities for hearing the Word of the Lord. "They 

have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them." Few 

had more opportunities than this— few were able to read; 

but Jesus was amongst those few— not because of schooling 

privileges in His youth, but because of His brilliant mind, 

which retained everything that came to it and to which, 

therefore, the Bible was continually an open book. 



The surpassing abilities of Jesus are attested by 
the fact that when He entered the synagogue of His 
home city, Nazareth, His superiority as a reader and an 
exponent was so generally recognized that the service was 
usually turned over to Him. (Luke 4:16.) And yet the 
people marveled, saying, How comes it that Jesus is a 
man of letters, having never gone to school? And they 
all bore Him witness and wondered at the grace of His 
speech. (Luke 4:22.) The explanation of the matter is 
that Jesus was perfect while all about Him were 
imperfect. 

Our lesson relates particularly to an incident which 
occurred when Jesus was twelve years old. His "parents" 
were strict religionists and obeyed the Mosaic Law by attending 
regularly the Feast of Passover at Jerusalem 
every year, and on this occasion Jesus was with them. 
The expression "parents" does not imply that Saint Luke 
supposed Joseph to be the father of Jesus any more than 
that Mary so considered the matter when (verse 48) she 
spoke of Joseph as being His "father." He was the foster 
father of Jesus— His foster parent, and Jesus was his 
foster child; the language is in exact harmony with what 
we would use under such circumstances today and is not 
a basis for any just criticism. 

As might be surmised, the gathering of Jews from all 
parts of Palestine, yea, from the entire world, meant great 
crowds of people; on some occasions more than a million. 
Different families from different localities usually traveled 
together as one caravan. It was a Jewish custom that a 
Jewish boy should be considered "a son of the Law" when 
he had attained his twelfth year. He then became responsible 
under the Law and thenceforth was required to keep 
its festivals, etc. 

R4957 : page 31 

JESUS A GREAT STUDENT 

At the time in question Jesus had attained His twelfth 
birthday. He well knew of His peculiar birth and of the 
great prophecies which centered in Him, related by Gabriel 
to His mother, and was on the alert to fulfil His mission- 
to do the will of the Heavenly Father. He surmised 
that since at twelve years of age Jewish boys came under 
the requirements of the Law Covenant, this arrangement 
might possibly have been made as an indication of His 
proper course and duty— that that was the time at which 
He should begin His ministry. 

Therefore He resolved to consult the very highest 
authorities respecting the teachings of the Law upon this 
subject. From time to time He sought intercourse with 
the learned Scribes and Pharisees and Doctors. He 
wished to make no mistake; He was therefore not satisfied 
with simply their opinion, but desired references to the 
Law and to the Prophets that He Himself might judge 
and not rely too implicitly upon the conclusions of others. 



During a considerable part of the time of the Passover 
Feast the great men of His nation were engaged in public 
functions, and hence His best opportunity for conference 
with them was at the close of the feast, and then as He 
could gain their attention— coming time and again with 
new questions, with fresh inquiries about other types and 
symbols and their proper meaning. 

When the time came for the return journey He had 
not finished His investigations of the Scripture teachings 
on this point. His parents, thinking that He was in the 
company with some of their relatives, went a day's journey 
homeward before they ascertained that He was not in 
the company. Then they returned, journeying another 
day, and the third day they found Him in the temple 
with the learned men discussing the question which to 
Him was the all-important one of the hour— the time at 
which public ministry might be begun, according to the 
Law. Evidently He had just finished His quest and found 
as His satisfactory answer that, although a boy at twelve 
became amenable to the Law, none could enter upon a 
teaching or preaching service until thirty years of age. 
This matter had evidently been settled just prior to the 
arrival of His parents. 

Joseph, the foster father of Jesus, said nothing, allowing 
his wife, Mary, to chide Jesus with having been negligent 
of His duty toward them— causing them trouble, 
grief, annoyance by not coming promptly with them on 
the return journey. The words of Jesus may be paraphrased 
thus: Did you not know that I was twelve years 
of age; was it not your understanding that I had reached 
the time when I must become a son of the Law? Did you 
not know that this might mean to me some great responsibility 
in connection with my service of the Heavenly 

R4958 : page 31 

Father? Did you not forewarn me that such responsibilities 
were to be looked for by myself and that I must be 
diligent to accomplish my mission? Why, then, may I 
ask, should you be surprised and disappointed in finding 
that I had tarried behind you? Did it not occur to you 
that as a son of the Law I might have responsibilities at 
this time and that I must use every opportunity to be 
about my Father's business— to do whatever work I should 
find He has appointed for me? But now I will give you 
no further trouble. I have ascertained through study and 
conference with the Doctors of the Law that there is 
nothing that I can do as a minor in the way of beginning 
the Father's service. I am therefore ready to return with 
you to our home, and I assure you that I shall be as loyal 
and obedient to you as heretofore and that my apparent 
neglect of your wishes in the present instance was merely 
because I supposed that you knew that I would be looking 
out for my Heavenly Father's business and my privileges 
in connection with it, and that you would therefore not 
be necessarily expecting me to return home at this time. 



JESUS INCREASED IN WISDOM 

In the last verse of our study we read: "Jesus increased 
in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men." 
It was not a boy who was to be the Redeemer, even as it 
was not a boy who had sinned. Jesus, therefore, to be a 
corresponding price for Father Adam and the race which 
lost life in Him, needed first to be developed into 
manhood. 

The verse under consideration covers the period from 
His twelfth year to His thirtieth. For eighteen years He 
kept growing in wisdom and in grace of character. He 
did not grow in the Father's favor in the sense of becoming 
less sinful and more righteous, but in the sense of becoming 
more developed— reaching human perfection. Just 
so a piece of fruit in growing may be as perfect of its kind 
at the beginning as at the end, but it grows in size and in 
richness of flavor, and therefore in the appreciation of the 
owner. 

So it was with Jesus. The perfect babe became the 
perfect boy; the perfect boy became the perfect youth; the 
perfect youth became the perfect man, and at thirty years 
of age was ripe and ready to be offered as an acceptable 
sacrifice of sweet savor to God, on behalf of mankind— 
"the Just for the unjust."

BROTHER RUSSELL'S LETTER FROM HONOLULU 
TO THE "BETHEL" FAMILY:- 

Beloved in the Lord: I drop this note at Honolulu, 
Hawaiian Islands. I wish you to know of my continued 
love for you all. We daily remember you and all the 
dear Israel of God at the Throne of Heavenly Grace, and 
feel sure you are remembering us. I will report the 
journey thus far. 

We had a delightful day at Pittsburgh, Dec. 4th; 
about 40 children were consecrated, a church election was 
held and a discourse was delivered to about 350; the 
house overflowed. 

At St. Louis, Dec. 5th, I had much pleasure in meeting 
the dear friends, and addressed them for about an 
hour. 

Dallas, Tex., was our next stop— on Dec. 6th. We 
had quite a nice little convention. Nearly 30 children 
were consecrated. 

San Antonio gave us a hearty greeting on the 7th. 
We had meetings all day. The interest and spirit were 
splendid. That class of Bible students seems to be growing 
steadily, both in numbers and in grace, yet not without 
trials. 



Los Angeles, Cal., was reached in due time for Sunday 
services, Dec. 10th. A more hearty welcome could 
not be asked. "Love Divine, all love excelling," seems 
to be the secret of this class's progress. About 400 were 
present in the forenoon, and about 2,100 at the afternoon 
meeting for the public. 

Fresno, Cal., we reached for services on the 1 1th. 
About 60 of the friends from surrounding country attended 
during the day, and at the public meeting at night 
the attendance was about 500. Matters went exceedingly 
well, considering that there is no Class of I.B.S.A. there. 

San Francisco, Cal., was reached on Dec. 12th (or 
rather Oakland). Good testimonies in the forenoon 
showed that the classes here are in splendid condition— 

R4957 : page 32 

apparently faithful and humble. The afternoon meeting 
was on consecration and the evening meeting on Baptism. 
At our request no advertising was done, so the attendance 
of about 300 must have been chiefly interested people. 
About 26 symbolized their consecration. The session 
closed with an enjoyable Love Feast. The next day 
nearly 100 bade us goodby and sang us away on our journey 
as the steamship Shinyo Maru left dock. 

With much love to you— one and all— your brother 
and servant, C . T . RUS S ELL .

PREPARE YE FOR THE KINGDOM 

-LUKE 3: 1-17. -FEBRUARY 18.- 

"Repent ye, for the Kingdom of 
Heaven is at hand."— Matthew 3:2. 

JOHN THE BAPTIST was the last of the 

Prophets and Jesus declared that none of 

them was his superior— "There hath not 

arisen a greater Prophet than John the Baptist 

—and yet I say unto you that the least 

in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than 

he." (Matt. 11:11.) Every member of the 

Kingdom of Heaven class must be higher 

than John because begotten of the Holy 

Spirit. They are reckoned as members of 

the House of Sons, while the Prophets belong to the preceding 

House of Servants: "Moses verily was faithful in 

all his House as a servant, but Christ as a Son over His 

own House, whose House are we."— Heb. 3:5,6; 

John 1:13. 

God proposed from before the foundation of the world 
that He would redeem man and that He would establish 



His Kingdom for their restoration from sin and death 
conditions. The Redeemer of the world was to be the 
King by whose reign of a thousand years the work of 
Satan would be undone; the head of the Serpent would 
be crushed and humanity would be uplifted out of sin 
and death and be brought back to the condition in which 
Adam was at first— "very good." The obedient would 
learn through experience a great lesson, valuable to all 
eternity; the wilful rejectors would be destroyed without 
hope or remedy. But previously, from amongst the redeemed 
would be selected a little company to be associated 
with the Redeemer in His great work. These would be 
called the Kingdom— the Kingdom class— the Royal 
Family— Sons of God. 

God promised Abraham, "the friend of God," that this 
great blessing would come to humanity through his posterity, 
and indeed all of the saved ones should be known 
as his posterity in that they would become proselyte members 
of Israel. Messiah was promised to be of Abraham's 
seed also, and it was to be through this Messiah 
that Abraham's natural posterity would be blessed, and 
would be made a channel of blessing to all nations. One 
thing not explained to Abraham was that Messiah would 
have a company of joint-heirs selected from amongst 
men and counted the "Body of Christ," or "The Bride, 
the Lamb's Wife." 

NECESSARILY TO THE JEW FIRST 

Although God had not mentioned this elect class which 
He purposed should be members of the Messiah, or His 
Bride, nevertheless God determined that the opportunity 
to become members of this elect, special class should first 
of all go to Abraham's natural seed. For the three and 
a half years of Jesus' ministry and for a further three 
and a half years after His death the privilege of becoming 
His Bride and joint-heir was limited to Israel after 
the flesh. 

Later it was sent on equal terms also to the Gentiles. 
Saint Paul tells us that it was necessary that the Gospel 
Message should go first to the Jews because this was the 
Divine arrangement. But he adds, "Israel hath not 
obtained that which he seeketh for [the best of God's 
gifts, the privilege of becoming members of the spiritual 
Israel], but the election hath obtained it and the rest were 
blinded." (Rom. 1 1:7.) The blindness is not to be forever, 
but merely until the completion of the elect, spiritual 
class— then the blindness is to pass away and Israel 
is to be saved or recovered to the Divine favor lost 
eighteen centuries ago. (See Romans 11:25-33.) 

Meantime the dealing with natural Israel proceeded 
just as though Jesus in the flesh were about to take the 
Throne; and just as though His disciples in the flesh 
were to be His Bride; and just as though the Jewish 
nation would then be exalted and used as the Divine 
channel; and just as though the promise would there 



have fulfilment: "In thy Seed shall all the families of 
the earth be blessed." 

"MY KINGDOM IS NOT OF THIS WORLD" 

It was in harmony with this offer which God knew 
would not be accepted by a sufficient number that He 
sent John the Baptist to announce Jesus as though He 
would be King of the Jews in the flesh and to announce 
His Kingdom as though it would be immediately established. 
However, all along God knew and had provided 
for the crucifixion of His Son, and that merely a beginning 
would be then made in the selecting of the elect 
Church, and that it would require more than eighteen 
centuries to complete it— and therefore require a tarrying 
of the Kingdom for more than eighteen centuries, until 
the Kingdom class should be ready in God's name and 
power to take the dominion of the earth— under the whole 
heavens. 

As Jesus declared, "My Kingdom is not of this world 
(Age)," and as He did not establish His Kingdom at 
His first advent, but merely began the work of calling 
the "elect," so the work of John the Baptist was merely 
to the Jew and proportionately only was he the antitype 
of Elijah. A larger antitype of Jesus, and of Elijah 
and John as forerunners, we may now see. Jesus 
in the flesh and all His faithful members in the flesh 
for eighteen centuries have constituted the antitype of 
John the Baptist. Their message all the way down these 
centuries has been to all who hear it, "Repent, for the 
Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." The antitype of the 
King whose Kingdom they announce is composed of the 
glorified Jesus and His glorified Bride, beyond the veil. 
These soon shall take the Kingdom and reign gloriously 
as Abraham's Seed for the blessing of all the families of 
the earth. 

The Church has cried in "the wilderness" in the sense 
that she has been alienated and separated from the world. 
She has called upon all who would hear to prepare for 
Messiah's Kingdom. She has told more fully than did 
John the Baptist of the effect of Messiah's Kingdom— 
the leveling up of the valleys (the lifting up of the poor), 
the straightening out of the crooked things and the 
smoothing of the rough things, that thus all flesh might 
see, appreciate, understand, experience the salvation of 
God. Both John and the Church declare that this salvation 
is to be brought through Jesus and His glorified 

R4958 : page 33 

Bride in Kingdom power. The point we are making is 

that while John the Baptist was an antitype of Elijah, 

and was forerunner or herald of Jesus, so, only more 

particularly, the Church in the flesh is a higher antitype 

of Elijah, and still more particularly a herald of the Messianic 

Kingdom. 



"GENERATION OF VIPERS" 

In John's day multitudes desired to be of the Kingdom 
class, but while still holding on to their gross sins. And so 
it has been throughout this Age. The only ones who can 
truly claim to belong to Abraham's spiritual Seed are 
such as show their repentance from sin and their loyalty 
to God by a full consecration to oppose sin and to walk 
in the footsteps of the Master, even unto death— even an 
ignominious death, if need be. 

John declared that the "ax" was about to be applied 
to that nation. Pruning would no longer do. Each individual 
must either bring forth good fruit or be cut down 
and be cast into the "fire"— the great time of trouble with 
which the Age ended. The people asked John what they 

R4959 : page 33 

should do following their repentance. His answer was 
that those who had a surplus of coats should be ready to 
give or lend to those who had none, and those who had 
a sufficiency of food should likewise give to the needy. 
Thus would they show their repentance from the selfishness 
and hard-heartedness which evidenced them as sinful 
—thus would they show a condition of heart necessary 
to an acceptance of Jesus. 

"ART THOU THE MESSIAH?" 

When the tax-gatherers came to John repenting they 
asked, "How shall we conduct our lives?" He answered, 
"Exhort no more than that to which you are entitled by 
the Law." Soldiers also repented and asked John 
respecting their course: "What shall we do?" He 
answered, "Do violence to no man; neither exact anything 
wrongfully; and be content with your wages"— 
thus will you show that you have repented and that you 
are seeking to do the Divine will, for such a course will 
be very different from the one to which you have been 
accustomed. But notwithstanding John's preaching of 
contentment he was apprehended as a disturber of the 
peace and beheaded. 

The spirit of expectation was in the air and some of 
the people, wondering at John's teaching, asked if he 
were the Messiah. He promptly replied, "No; my baptism 
is merely that of water." Messiah's baptism will be that 
of "the Holy Spirit and of fire"; "His fan is in His hand 
and He will thoroughly purge His threshing floor; He 
will gather the wheat into His garner, and will burn up 
the chaff with fire unquenchable."— Matt. 3:11-12. 

"WRATH IS COME UPON THIS PEOPLE" 

These things which John prophesied of Jesus were 
partially fulfilled more than eighteen centuries ago, but 



in another sense they are yet to be fulfilled. They were 
fulfilled so far as the Jewish nation was concerned. Jesus 
did baptize some of them with the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, 
and subsequently— all the faithful "Israelites indeed"; 
and He did, later on, baptize the unfaithful with 
fire— a time of trouble. Writing of that trouble St. Paul 
says, "Wrath is come upon this people to the uttermost; 
that all things written in the Law and in the Prophets 
concerning them might be fulfilled." Jesus did a harvesting 
work there for the Jewish nation only. He gathered 
their wheat into the garner of the Gospel Age by begetting 
them of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost and onward, 
and "burned up" the nation in a time of trouble with 
which their Age ended, in A. D. 70. 

But now for the larger fulfilment— world-wide. In 
the end of this Age all the "wheat" class are to be gathered 
into the heavenly garner by the change of the First 
Resurrection, and in the time of trouble coming all others 
than the true Church will be cut off from association 
with the Church and from all opportunity of membership 
in it— as "tares" they will be burned— reduced to 
the level of the rest of humanity. But, thank God! at 
that time will begin the work of blessing the masses of 
mankind; all the families of the earth are to be blest by 
the glorious, Messianic Kingdom! 



R4959 : page 33 

TO MARRY OR NOT TO MARRY 

WE ARE ASKED to publish the below letter 
respecting marriage, in the hope that it 
may be helpful to some considering this 
subject:— 

"DEAR SISTER: As your conduct towards me 
is not as formerly, but you pass me and seem 
to intentionally avoid giving me recognition, 
it has made me think that perhaps you may 
have some unfriendly feeling towards me on 
account of the stand I have taken, or on account 
of something that I may have said. If 
I have done you any wrong I ask your forgiveness. 

"I can sympathize with you, as I also have a fight with the 
fallen flesh, and I will tell you how I feel and look at the 
matter of matrimony at this late moment of the harvest time, 
and how, by the Lord's grace, I obtain strength. 

"This matter should be viewed by us only from the standpoint 
of the new mind, and by thus doing I find it the greatest 
help to keep the flesh from dictating to me along fleshly lines. 

"We should also constantly have the spiritual welfare of 
ourselves as well as of others uppermost in our mind; and 
I thus ask myself: How can I help a sister spiritually through 
the union of the flesh? How will it help the sister or myself 
in setting our affections on things above? Is it the sister's 



fellowship I desire? If so, can I not have that without marriage? 
If not always personally, can I not have it through 
the course of letter writing, and thus help and encourage the 
sister spiritually, and develop character thereby? 

"We are to crucify the tendencies of the fallen flesh, which 
are selfish desires, and put the body under and not give in to 
it, for now we are walking in newness of life, and know the 
brethren, not after the flesh, but after the spirit— 'Ye are 
neither male nor female, but all one in Christ Jesus.' Let 
our love be a pure, holy, brotherly love. 

"The 'Vow' I find a great help, especially the portion 
which reads, 'Thy will be done in my mortal body.' What is 
the Lord's will? What was this sexual distinction given for? 
I find it was for the filling of the earth, to populate it, and 
that after that has been accomplished the sexual distinction 
will cease. 

"Realizing that there is no distinction of sex among the 
angels, and that such will also be the future condition of 
humanity, I ask myself, should I, at this closing moment of 
our pilgrimage, yield, or will I be more pleasing to the Lord 
if I now develop character in myself in the direction of our 
future condition, not only by setting my affections on things 
above and developing the new mind, but also by putting the 
desires of my fleshly body under? 

"Although these fleshly bodies are to serve us while yet 
on this side the veil, they should not be used to serve us in 
sin and fallen tendencies. 

"The Apostle said that we commit no sin if we marry, 
but this also includes our duty to perform the Father's will 
and make proper use of our functions, or abstain, and this 
cannot be done on account of the fallen and degraded flesh, 
as testified by those who have gone through this experience. 

"The best way is to ask for strength and grace, and to 
be faithful to the admonition given us by St. Paul, which is, 
Let every man abide in the calling wherein he was called'; 
and by so doing we certainly will receive a blessing, perhaps 
a greater blessing than we think; it may win for us the crown, 
and the ignoring of it may prevent us from obtaining it and 
thus we may become members of the Great Company. 

"A single person, when consecrating, agrees to give up 
more time to the Lord than can a married one. Realizing 

R4959 : page 34 

this, would it be right for me to take back some of the time 
which I have given to the Lord and give it to some one else? 
Would I be pleasing to the Lord by so doing? 

"Do I know of an instance where a brother or sister has 
profited spiritually by the union? Perhaps a few, but as St. 
Paul said, 'He that is unmarried careth for the things that 
belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord, but he that 
is married careth for the things that are of the world, how 
he may please his wife.' 

"The thought might suggest itself to me: Perhaps I might 
need just such experiences, just such troubles in the flesh to 
perfect me. To this I answer, If so, I will leave it in the 



hands of the Lord to give them to me, without trying to help 
Him by giving myself persecutions, for He knows best what 
I need, but will strive to please Him, remembering that 
'Obedience is better than sacrifice.' 

"We are told to make straight the path for our feet, and 
as the natural man can run better with the least burden, so 
also the spiritual man. Why should I cast extra stones and 
obstacles in my own way to hinder myself from running as 
I should? 

"Viewing it from my personal standpoint, I ask myself, 
Would this union put two in the work? Or would it take out 
two, in the sense of preventing a sister or myself or both 
from entering now or in the future? 

"Being tied down by obligations to those depending upon 
me, and not permitted to enter the colporteur work at present, 
I ask myself, Should I make my obligations heavier and also 
tie a sister down, preventing her from active service, now or 
in the future, and have her use her consecrated time in ministering 
to my fleshly body? 'Ye are bought with a price; be 
not ye the servants of men.' 

"Should the Lord see fit to make me foot-loose, then, viewing 
it from that standpoint, I should have to ask myself, Have 
I enough working capital for two, or can I earn enough in 
the work without the sister's assistance, should she become 
unable to help support herself? Or, should I become disabled, 
would she still remain in the work? Can we together 
make both ends meet, or might it take both of us out of the 
work and make it necessary for me to labor at something else, 
as has been the experience of others, so that I would thus 
miss the blessings and privileges, not only myself, but also 
be responsible for the sister? 

"How do I know that we both will stand in this last moment 
of testing? I know of only one instance, where error 
has overtaken one of those thus united, where the other remained 
faithful unto the Lord, while the life companion fell; 
I find that in all other instances, to my knowledge, they both 
fell. Consequently, I do not think it advisable to take chances 
and endanger my Christian welfare or that of a sister. If 
there is a shadow of possibility that it might prevent me from 

R4960 : page 34 

making my 'calling and election sure,' I say to myself, through 
the grace and strength of the Lord, 'Don't do it.' 

"We know that Satan is always ready to hand us plenty 
of excuses along these lines, and if we are looking for them 
he will be able to present one (even through a brother or 
sister) which we can accept. 

"One brother expresses himself to the effect that we might 
seek advice upon certain matters and obtain the same from 
some who are not able to give advice to the Little Flock, as 
they may be or will be members of the Great Company. 

"By scrutinizing every thought, and word, and action, I 
find that selfish thoughts should have no place in us, and if 
we do not give place to wrong thoughts they cannot result in 
wrong actions. 



"The time is so short! It is not so much the years now, 
but we count the time by weeks and days; as we mentioned 
at the Mountain Lake Park Convention, it is only about one 
hundred and fifty weeks until the last member of the Little 
Flock shall have passed beyond the second veil, and some of 
this time has since passed. 

"I pray the Lord to overrule these words, should they not 
be fully in accord with the new mind or His will. 

"Pray for me, dear sister, that I may be a conqueror, yea, 
more than an overcomer. 

"With much Christian love from your brother and fellow-runner 
in the narrow way, ." 

Notwithstanding the good arguments of this letter 
we are not to forget the other side of the question, which 
the Apostle sets forth. With each one rests the responsibility 
of his decision to marry or not to marry. To 
some the relationship must surely appear as above, but 
to others equally conscientious it may seem different. 
Let each one be fully persuaded in his own mind. 

We certainly believe that those who cannot quite fully 
settle the matter and take a decided stand, determined 
not to marry, should very properly take the other decided 
stand and get married. Nothing is much more injurious 
to spirituality than indecision, wavering, lukewarmness. 
Do not trifle with your own earthly affections 
nor with the affections of others. Settle matters at once 
and firmly as you think would be most to the Lord's 
glory— most in harmony with the Divine will. Act upon 
this decision and put far from you everything to the 
contrary, so that you can give the best that you have 
to the Lord. A decision, a positiveness, will help in the 
development of character. Trifling undermines true 
character. 



"Up, up, my soul, the long-spent time redeeming; 

Sow thou the seeds of better deed and thought; 
Light other lamps, while yet the light is beaming; 

The time, the time is short." 



THE PRAISE BELONGS TO HIM 

I know if I am chosen to joint-heirship with my Lord, 
To reign with Him in glory, to receive that great reward; 
If after all my weaknesses a crown for me He'll claim, 
I know that choice will surely bring great glory to God's 
name. 

If I had been more worthy, and my stumblings had been few, 
When men gave God the glory, they'd have praised my virtue, 
too; 
If I'd ne'er lost a battle, or had never missed the mark, 



As they talked about His goodness, mine, also, they'd remark. 

But my being so deficient, in thought and word and deed, 
Means He'll get all the glory— He deserves it all, indeed. 
When they see this weak mortal raised to such immortal 
heights, 

What praise will rise to Him who in such nothingness 
delights! 

I know that when my Savior did return to Heaven above, 
And was crowned with wondrous glory, it did prove His 
Father's love; 

But thinking of Christ's merit, and His sinless life of grace, 
'Twas no wonder that Jehovah chose Him for such a place. 

With me it is so different; I have not one thing to plead, 
That I should be more honored than another bruised reed; 
And truly there's no reason to give me a mite of praise; 
To Him belongs all glory for the joys which crown my days. 

If you knew all my failings, and my blemishes so vile, 
And saw the loving patience my Father shows the while, 
Twould amaze you beyond measure to think He could or 
would 
Make me an able servant who should do His people good. 

But if to Him such praise is due because of what I am— 
Because of such a weakling He has made a stronger man, 
Then what will be His glory when He's raised me higher still, 
And crowned me with His choicest on the top of Zion's Hill? 

That all these years of striving find me so imperfect still, 
Does not speak much to my credit nor give a happy thrill; 
Where I appear as worthy 'tis because His grace is there, 
And in the praise and glory I deserve no part, no share. 

I hate my faults and failings, and I fight them day by day, 
But from self with all its weaknesses I cannot get away; 
Despite this fact, He uses me— beyond is still more grace— 
And hosts will tell His glory— His who found poor me a place. 
BENJAMIN H. BARTON.

YOUR "GOOD HOPES" FOR 1912 



[The plan here proposed we designate "GOOD HOPES," 
because nothing is actually promised— only your generous 
hopes expressed, based upon your future prospects as they 
now appear to you. The plan proved not only so beneficial 
to the cause of Truth, but also so blessed to the hopers, for 
some years past, that we again commend it to all as Scriptural 



and good. Those who desire to make use of this plan 
can fill out both these memoranda. One should be kept 
for the refreshment of your memory; the other mail to us.] 

-TO THE- 

"WATCH TOWER BIBLE & TRACT SOCIETY." 

Dear Friends:— I have read with interest of the openings 
for the STUDIES and Tract work in foreign lands and here 
at home. I need not tell you that I am deeply interested in 
the spread of the Glad Tidings of the lengths and breadths, 
the heights and depths of redeeming love expressed for us 
in God's great Plan of the Ages. 

I am anxious to use myself— every power, every talent, 
voice, time, money, influence, all— to give to others this 
knowledge, which has so greatly blessed, cheered and comforted 
my own heart and placed my feet firmly upon the 
Rock of Ages. 

I have been considering carefully, and praying to be instructed, 
how to use my various talents more to my Redeemer's 
glory and for the service of His people— those 
blinded by human tradition who are, nevertheless, hungering 
for "the good Word of God," and those also who are 
naked, not having on the wedding garment of Christ's imputed 
righteousness, the unjustified, who stand at best in 
the filthy rags of their own righteousness. I have decided 
that so far as my "money talent" goes, I will follow the rule 
so clearly laid down for us by the great Apostle Paul (1 Cor. 16:2), 
and will lay aside on the first day of each week, according 
to my thankful appreciation of the Lord's blessings 
during the preceding week. Out of this fund I wish to contribute 
to the several parts of the Lord's work carried on by 
our Tract Society. Of course, I cannot in advance judge 
or state particularly what the Lord's bounty may enable 
me to set apart weekly, and hence you will understand the 
sum indicated to be merely my conjecture or hope, based 
upon present prospects. I will endeavor to contribute more 
than I here specify; and should I not succeed in doing as 
well, the Lord will know my heart, and you, also, will know 
of my endeavors. 

My only object in specifying in advance what I hope to 
be able to do in this cause is to enable those in charge of 
the work of publishing and circulating the Tracts, etc., to 
form estimates, lay plans, make contracts, etc., with some 
idea of what I will at least try to do in the exercise of this 
my highly appreciated privilege. 

My present judgment is that during the coming year, by 
self-denial and cross-bearing, I shall be able to lay aside on 
the first day of each week for Home and Foreign Mission 
Work (to assist in circulating SCRIPTURE STUDIES in foreign 
languages, and in publishing the PEOPLES PULPIT in various 
languages, and in supplying these gratuitously to brethren 
who have the heart and opportunity to circulate them widely, 
and in meeting the expenses of brethren sent out as Lecturers 
to preach the Divine Plan of Salvation, and in general to 



be expended as the officers of the Society may deem best), 
the amount of per week. 

To comply with United States Postal Laws, all or any 
portion of my donation may be applied as subscription price 
for WATCH TOWER or PEOPLES PULPIT sent to the Lord's poor 
or others, as the Society's officers may deem advisable. 

That the work be not hindered, I will endeavor to send 
you what I shall have laid aside for this cause at the close 
of each quarter. I will secure a Bank Draft, Express Order 
or Postal Money Order as I may find most convenient, and 
will address the letter to

WATCH TOWER SUBSCRIPTIONS 

ON "GOOD HOPES" ACCOUNT 

The friends who contribute to the "Good Hopes" (described

and loss. Price, postpaid, 50c. 

CHRISTIAN HOME EMBELLISHMENTS 



For several years we have been supplying our readers with 
handsome Texts and Motto Cards for the walls of their 
homes. Their influence is excellent, for they continually and 
cheerfully catch the eye and remind the heart of our great 
favors present and to come, based upon the "exceeding great 
and precious promises" of our Father's Word. We commend 
these as helps in the "narrow way"— helps in character 
building. 

Many of the mottoes also make splendid gifts for friends 
on all occasions. 

For your convenience and ours we put these up in packets 
of choice assortments, as below, $1 each, postpaid. So doing, 
we are enabled to give you twice as many mottoes for your 
money as you could purchase elsewhere. Besides, we select 
the styles and mottoes with great care. The following packets 
represent our assortment. Order by number:— 

No. Ma— Contains small mottoes of 22 assorted texts and 
styles; all beautiful. 

No. Mb— Contains medium and small mottoes, 11 assorted;

British friends. 

DAILY HEAVENLY MANNA 



Those who use this book as we recommend are surely being 
blessed. It should be on your breakfast table regularly. 
Its daily text should be read and commented on freely by all. 
Then the MANNA comment should be read. Introduce it to 
your friends as a help toward godly living. See prices in our 
August 15 issue, page 334.

A PRIVILEGE AND A SERVICE 



We are convinced that THE WATCH TOWER lists do not 
contain the names of one-half of those deeply interested in its 
teachings. The total is small enough surely, and we are not 
content that the name of any should be missing. We believe 
that all such will be stimulated and encouraged on the "narrow 
way" by its semi-monthly appearance on their table, reminding 
them afresh of spiritual matters which the world, the 
flesh and the Devil continually tend to crowd out of mind and 
heart. 

Hitherto we have at times required that all desiring THE 
WATCH TOWER on credit, or free, as "the Lord's Poor," should 
make personal application; but now we request every subscriber 
to inquire among those whom he knows to be interested 
in Present Truth, and to obtain the consent of all such 
to send in their subscriptions either on credit or free, as their 
circumstances may necessitate. Any getting it on credit may 
at any future time request that the debt be canceled, and we 
will cheerfully comply. We desire that as nearly as possible 
THE WATCH TOWER lists shall represent all those deeply interested 
in its message. 

Our object is not the gain of "filthy lucre," but "the perfecting 
of the saints for the work of ministry"— present and to 
come. (Eph. 4:12.) We offer no premiums, desiring the cooperation 
of such only as appreciate the privilege of being 
co-workers with us in this ministry. Our list is now about 
28,000; but it should be at least 30,000, and we confidently 
expect the above program to bring it to that figure. Let as 
many as appreciate it as a privilege join in this service. 

HYMNS OF DAWN WITH MUSIC 



Our readers have for years inquired for this book. We 
now have it for you in handsome cloth binding and at cost 
price. It is the best and the cheapest hymn book in the world, 
at 35 cents per copy, postpaid, and contains 333 of the choicest 
hymns of all ages. By express, collect, 25c each, in any 
quantity.

INTERESTING QUESTIONS 
THE SEED AND THE COVENANTS 

Question.— Kindly explain briefly the Apostle's meaning 
in Romans 7:7-25. 

Answer.— The Apostle's thought is this: At the time 
of Abraham, God said: "Abraham, I intend to bless the 
world, and I will tell you about it in advance. Through 
your posterity I will do it, for I have found you faithful 
as a servant." St. Paul was one of those who was included 
in that promise. (See Heb. 7:9,10.) Abraham 
was not under the sentence of the Law; but he had the 
promise that a blessing would come to him and to all 
others. 

Several hundred years after this God entered into a 
special Covenant with the nation of Israel. They bound 
themselves by the Law Covenant that they would do certain 
things; and God promised that the reward would be 
eternal life. But they could not fulfil the conditions, and 
consequently they came under the sentence of death. 
Therefore, they were worse off in that respect than if 
they had never come under the Law Covenant, for they 
had already received, prospectively, the forgiveness of 
sin; but now, being unable to keep the Law Covenant, 
they came again under condemnation to death. 

The remainder of the world of mankind was condemned 
once. God had said that He would bless all those 
who kept the Law; and the Jews had their opportunity 
but failed because of inherent weakness. So the Law, 
St. Paul states, brought them death instead of blessing. 
How did this awaken in them what he says here? "I had 
not known sin but by the Law." Suppose that before the 
Law was given, a man did not know that it was wrong 
to steal or to kill. Not knowing it, and not having come 
under any law telling about it, he had not sinned against 
the law. But before that Law Covenant came, says the 
Apostle, not having the Law specified to me, I was not 
under it. But now I know; and sin came upon me because 
I could not keep what I saw and what I had agreed 
to do. 

Sin lives. What sin? Original sin, Adamic sin, 
which passed from Adam through heredity upon all his 
children. God said to Abraham, I intend to bless all the 



families of the earth. I intend to remove the curse. 
Those who had failed to keep the Law had come under 
the curse of the Law as well as under Adam's curse, so 
that in addition to the curse which came upon all of 
Adam's children the Jew came under the curse of the 
Law. That which the Jew thought to be unto life, he 
found to be unto death. The Law Covenant promised 
that if the Jew would do these things he would live. But 
he found that he could not do them, and the Covenant 
brought condemnation and death upon him. The Apostle 
does not say that the Law Covenant was just and good, 
but that the Law was good, the Law was just— not the 
Covenant. God's Law is always the same, and always 
will be the same; but He will make a better Covenant; for 
finding fault with the Law Covenant, He said, "I will 
make a New Covenant." If God was not finding fault 
with the Old Covenant, why make a new one?— 
Heb. 8:8-13. 

The unsatisfactory feature of the Covenant was that 
it could not give life to Israel. God knew this beforehand, 
but they did not. God wished them to learn this 
great lesson that because of their own deficiency they 
needed the merit of the sacrifice of the Redeemer. The 
whole world must learn this lesson. Whoever will not 
learn it will not make progress; but God's promise is that 
in due time all the blind eyes shall be opened and all the 
deaf ears shall be unstopped, and that all shall understand 
clearly the conditions of God's arrangements and the 
provision He has made. 

IS THE NEW MIND THE NEW CREATURE? 

Question.— Is it correct, in the strict sense, to speak or 
think of ourselves as New Creatures while in the begotten 
condition? Or is it only when born from the dead 
that this condition is attained? In other words, Is the 
new mind the New Creature? 

Answer.— Yes; the new mind is the New Creature. 
The Scriptural thought is that this New Creature is now 
an embryo. This embryo is to develop more and more, 
and take on the character-likeness of the Lord Jesus. 
Then will come the birth of the New Creature. The 
Lord uses the thought of begetting and birth as a picture. 
First, there is the begetting, and then the gradual development 
of the embryo; finally there comes the time for 
birth. But if anything checks the development of the 
embryo the birth will never take place; there will be a 
miscarriage. 

So the New Creature, begotten of the Holy Spirit, is 
in an embryotic condition, and must develop, or it will 
never be ready for the birth. The birth is the resurrection. 
As the Scriptures say, Jesus was the first-born from 
the dead and we are His brethren. He is the first-born 
amongst these many brethren; and we also must be born 
from the dead to share His glory. 



THE PROPHETS AND THE RESURRECTION 

Question.— Did David understand the doctrine of the 
resurrection? 

Answer.— Even from what David has written in the 
Psalms we cannot really tell whether he clearly understood 
the doctrine of the Resurrection; for the Scriptures 
inform us that David spoke and wrote very much by 
inspiration. The Apostle Peter tells that many of the 
Prophets themselves did not know the import of the 
things they were saying; but that the Spirit of God 
moved them. God reserved much of the understanding for 
the Church. So when the Prophet David makes certain 
allusions to the resurrection, we do not know whether he 
fully understood or not. We believe that all those in 
God's confidence knew that, though they were dying, yet 
the time would come when God would recover them from 
the grave. The resurrection hope was the hope of all the 
Jewish nation, not only in the days of Jesus, but prior 
to that time. 

In the days of Jesus the orthodox Jews, the holiness 
people, or Pharisees, were firm believers in the Resurrection. 
The Sadducees were the Higher Critics and infidels 
of that time; for they did not believe in angels 
or spirits, or in the resurrection of the dead; but the 
Pharisees believed in both. On one occasion, particularly, 
when St. Paul was in great danger, he perceived 
that part of the audience were Pharisees and part 
Sadducees; and thinking he could get the good will of 
the one part, he cried out, "I believe in the resurrection. 
That is the reason I am on trial here." Immediately 
the Pharisees went to his side and said, "Yes, this 
man believes in the resurrection. We all do. It is you 
Sadducees who do not believe in the resurrection; and 
you are trying to injure us."— See Acts 23:6-9. 

And so we feel sure that David believed in the resurrection. 
We are to remember, however, that while apparently 
he spoke of his own resurrection— "Thou wilt not 
leave my soul in sheol, nor suffer Thine Holy One to see 
corruption"— St. Peter, speaking, we believe, under inspiration, 
said that David spoke these words not concerning 
himself, but being a Prophet he spoke beforehand of 
Christ, that Christ's soul would not be left in sheol. (Acts 2:29-32.) 
So the principal text in the Psalms that tells 
of David's faith in the resurrection, we are told, is 

R4961 : page 38 

applicable prophetically; but we think there is no question 
in the matter that David and all the Prophets in the past 
knew that they were not getting their reward then, but 
must get it in the future. 

St. Paul brings this fact to our attention in Hebrews 1 1:38-40. 
He had been telling about Abraham and his 



faith, and states that some of the Prophets were stoned 
to death, sawn asunder, etc. Then he sums it all up, saying, 
"All these died in faith, without having received the 
promise." They knew they had not received eternal life 
or any of the things which God had promised, but they 
died in faith that they would get it in the resurrection; 
faith that God was able and willing to fulfill every promise 
He had made. So St. Peter gives us the assurance that 
they knew, though they did not understand all that they 
wrote themselves.— I Pet. 1:10-12.

SOME INTERESTING LETTERS 
IN DEFENSE OF THE TRUTH 

TO THE WATCH TOWER. 

DEAR BRETHREN:— At a recent question meeting the following 
question was asked: "Should one who is in the Truth 
bring an action in damages for defamation of character? 
Does not the Bible teach that we should endure persecution 
without resorting to the law?" On several other occasions 
questions of the same import have been asked. My reply 
thereto has been to this effect:— 

Under ordinary circumstances the Christian should not 
sue for defamation of character. There are circumstances, 
however, under which it would not only be right to sue, but 
it would be a neglect of duty to fail to do so. The principle 
is illustrated in the suit recently filed by Brother Russell 
against the Brooklyn Eagle. Brother Russell occupies a position 
peculiarly different from any other person in the world. 
The Lord has permitted him to proclaim the Gospel through 
the public press, and today hundreds of newspapers are publishing 
each week his sermons. This is a talent possessed by 
Brother Russell which is not possessed by any other Christian, 
for the reason that no other Christian is doing the same work. 
In order to continue to use this talent it is necessary for 
him to maintain his good reputation. An attack upon his 
character by an influential paper would tend to destroy his 
reputation, and therefore to destroy his opportunity for 
service through the public press. Should he refuse to defend 
his character and let the assailants go unchallenged, he would 
permit this talent to be rendered useless. As the servant of 
the Lord he could not afford to do this, but must defend himself 
in whatever way is provided. Under the Constitution of 
the United States and the laws of New York, the only means 

R4962 : page 38 

provided for defense against a libelous attack by a newspaper 
is by suit at law for damages; the purpose not being merely to 
get money, but by means of the courts to compel the wrong-doer 
to desist, and at the same time let the world know that 



the charges made are false. Under such circumstances there is 
no alternative to one who is consecrated to use every talent 
in the Lord's service. 

The Apostle Paul occupied a peculiar position toward the 
Church, being endowed by the Lord to do a certain work. 
He was arrested and brought into court for trial, and defended 
himself, taking advantage of legal technicalities. When 
he was taken before Felix for trial, Felix asked Paul if he 
would consent to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried. The 
Apostle could have well said, I am in the Lord's hands; I will 
not resist, therefore do with me as you see fit. Had he done 
so, he well knew that his life would be taken from him by the 
Jews and his opportunity to preach the Gospel would end, 
hence he declined to go up to Jerusalem, there to be tried, but 
appealed unto Caesar. It may be insisted that the Apostle here 
was merely defending his life and liberty, and did not himself 
prosecute a case in court. Such a position is untenable. He 
had said, "Neither count I my life dear unto me, so that I 
might finish my course with joy and the ministry which I 
have received to testify the Gospel," etc. (Acts 20:24.) The 
Apostle's chief purpose was that he might fully use up his 
opportunities of service for the Lord. When, therefore, he 
appealed to Caesar, he put himself exactly in the position of 
one who institutes a suit in court, for the reason that the 
appellant on appeal becomes the plaintiff, or prosecutor of the 
case, whereas the appellee occupies the position of defendant. 

When Brother Russell's character is attacked, he could say, 
I will not defend myself, but will permit the enemies to do 
unto me whatsoever they see fit since I am in the Lord's 
hands. Like the Apostle, his chief object is to finish his 
ministry of the Gospel. Personally, his reputation in the 
world is not dear unto him; not even his earthly life does 
he count dear, but these are necessary in order for him to 
finish his ministry. Therefore, it becomes his duty under a 
covenant of sacrifice with the Lord to maintain within legal 
bounds his good name and reputation, to the end that he 
might continue to preach the Gospel through the public press, 
and his failure or refusal to appeal to the courts for this 
protection would appear to be a clear neglect of duty. Keeping 
in mind always that his chief object is to further the best 
interests of the Gospel, then we can readily see that Brother 
Russell in every sense is fully justified in the position taken. 

In the service of the Truth, Yours faithfully, 

J. F. RUTHERFORD. 



EXPERIMENTAL EXTENSION WORK 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

I selected R , 22 miles from here, as the scene of an 

experiment in the Extension Work. It is perhaps needless 

for me to tell you that I do not know anybody in R . The 

morning came off rainy, but having decided to go anyway, I 

put on my raincoat and started. When I arrived at the 

station I found the train was an hour late, and then remembered 



that I had forgotten any pins with which to pin up my 
chart, that my voice was a bit husky and I had forgotten to 
bring any troches, and, incidentally, had also forgotten any 
breakfast with which to line up the inner man. This gave 
plenty of time to attend to these details. 

Arrived at R at 9 o'clock. The weather had turned 

colder, so that there was no danger of rain. Approached 

the first pleasant-looking man I met, told him I was a representative 

of the International Bible Students Association, 

was a traveling man in C for a time, was greatly interested 

in Bible study, and had run out to R to see if I could find 

a few Christians who might like to listen to a talk on methods 
of Bible study. Asked about auditoriums and he gave me the 
name of the man who owns the school, which is private. 
Went to see him and he turned me down cold; said it would 
be necessary for me to get some letters of commendation 
from local preachers who know something about my work; 
that there had been so many fakes come along that he never 
gave the use of the school building any more to people he 
did not know all about. Thought to myself he was wise, 
from his viewpoint, and if he really suspected what I represented 
he would be sure I was the worst fake of all. 

Inquired about churches; found there were three, a 
Methodist, Baptist and Presbyterian. These three churches 
divide services between them, it being understood that on 
Methodist day all the churches have their own Sunday 
Schools at 10 o'clock, but at 1 1 o'clock all go to the Methodist 
church. Happened to be Methodist day today, so I concluded 
to stay away from the Methodist church. Inquired names 
of trustees of Baptist church; was given two names, Brother 

M , living some distance away on the mountain side, and 

Brother S , living within a quarter mile. 

Called on Brother S ; most hospitably received. Invited 

me to go to Sunday School with him; stated he would 
have Sunday School dismissed early, so I could have half 
an hour or so for a lecture. There were over thirty present, 
more than half of them adults. Was requested to lead in 
prayer, which I did; then the teacher of the adult Bible class 
told me he had broken his spectacles and asked me to lead 
the class, which I did. The subject of the study was the rebuilding 
of the Temple, which gave a splendid chance for 
bringing in some truths regarding the true Temple. I then 
gave a chart talk on the three worlds, and was invited to 
return next Sunday and continue it (in the afternoon) when 
they have promised to have the whole town out to hear me. 
"This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes." 

Before I left for R I had told the Lord that if He desired 

me to go to R and just sit down on the depot steps and read 

the Bible until my train came to carry me back to C I would 

be just as glad to do that as anything else, but, of course, 
if He wanted me to go into this Extension Work I would 
be thankful for any evidences of His favor that He might 
be pleased to show me. 

After the session (I spoke for about three-quarters of an 
hour, leaving plenty of time for the audience to get to the 
Methodist Church at 1 1:20) Brother S invited me to his 



R4962 : page 39 

home, where I spent a most enjoyable hour, listening to his 
questions, partially answering them, and asking him some 
to think about during the coming week. Then he invited 
me to dinner, and I went to my train, arriving home at 1:15, 
thankful of heart to the Lord for His gracious overruling of 
the whole affair. It is now 2 o'clock, the sun is shining 
brightly out doors and in my heart, and I am just going to 
the afternoon meeting. Maybe the Brethren won't be surprised 
when they see how easy it is for the Lord to start up 
this Extension Work! All He needs is a tiny, broken, earthen 
vessel, lying conveniently near His pathway. 
Your brother and servant in the Lord, 

C. J. WOODWORTH.-Tenn.

PASTOR C. T. RUSSELL, DEAR BROTHER:- 

I trust you will pardon me for intruding upon your time. 
I am filled with gratitude to the Heavenly Father for permitting 
me to recognize the channel through which the "meat 
in due season" is being dispensed, and I desire to thank you, 
as His servant, for the service you have rendered me. I am 
glad to acknowledge that every bit of heavenly Truth that 
has reached my ears has come through you. From present 
indications it appears to me quite probable that one of the 
tests of the Lord's people will be along the lines of loyalty 
to the source of Present Truth, and I want to keep my 
heart right, filled with love at all times, so that I will be able 
to stand with the faithful. Pray for me. 

While grieved to learn of your trials, we are endeavoring 
to look at the matter as the dear Lord and Master would 
have us do, and to remember that "all things shall work together 
for good." How comforting the assurances that He 
"will not leave nor forsake thee," and that "the angel of the 
Lord encampeth round about them that reverence Him"— 
"My grace is sufficient for thee!" 

The friends here join in sending greetings and expressions 
of love and sympathy, and wish to assure you of their 
prayers in your behalf. We all earnestly desire to be "faithful 
unto death" and have part in the "First Resurrection." 

Yours in the service of the King of kings, 
M. E. C.-Tenn. 



R4962 : page 39 

DEAREST BROTHER IN THE LORD:- 

With great pleasure I remember the joyful days, when I 
had the opportunity to meet you in Scandinavia. I should 
be very glad to see you again. 



We have here with the Lord's aid continued the harvest 
work and as a result I send herewith the new edition of "The 
Divine Plan of the Ages" (Jumalallinen Aikakausien Suunnitelma); 
the second volume of the "Studies in the Scriptures," 
"The Time Is at Hand" (Aika on Lahestynyt); "What 
Say the Scriptures about Hell?" (Mita Sanoo Raamattu 
Helvetista?); "Hymns of Morning" (Aamulauluja) and the 
tract PEOPLES PULPIT (Puheita Kansalle), of which we already 
have distributed about 125,000 copies. We have also 
translated TABERNACLE SHADOWS OF BETTER SACRIFICES, THE 
PAROUSIA OF OUR LORD, and also, from THE NEW CREATION, 
STUDY X, THE BAPTISM OF THE NEW CREATION. Vols. Ill 
and V are also preparing. In various places we have held 
about 100 lectures and meetings before great and interested 
crowds. The total number of people in attendance has been 
about 25,000. 

We have heard that you will make a trip around the 
whole world and it would be a very great joy to us if you 
could visit our country. 

I know you are very busy and I have given you only a 
little record of our efforts in Finland. We remember you, 
beloved brother, with thankfulness in our prayers. 

Yours in the Blessed Hope, K. H.— Finland. 



page 39 

MY DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

As I have come into the Truth, and rejoice in the new 
light and have newly consecrated my life to God, I write to 
say how thankful I am to have been directed through my 
dear son to your STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES. 

I cannot tell you on paper what remarkable experiences 
have been mine the last six months, nor how I have been 
changed, surely by the grace and power of God, nor how I 
pray daily to keep strong in the faith and to learn, more and 
more, true humbleness of mind and obedience to the will of 
God. 

I have had a number of sacrifices (hard to lay on the altar, 
except in His strength) to make, but I have made them joyfully, 
"counting all things but loss for the excellency of the 
knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord." 

One of these— the hardest— has been coming out of sectarianism 
—pulling up lifelong roots; and I now feel rather 
lost and bewildered, although sometimes attending the Boston 
ecclesia with profit. 

As I told you in conversation last summer, my life has 
been a cruel one and I had often thought of trying to enter 
an Episcopal Sisterhood. But since visiting "Bethel Home" 
I have abandoned that thought. 

I desire to take the symbolic immersion— "that I may 
know him and the fellowship of His sufferings, being made 
conformable to His death." 

I would be very grateful for any words of advice from 
you. 



Yours in Him, W. B. B.--MASS. 



R4962 : page 39 

DEAR PASTOR:- 

Loving greetings on your return home. It has not been 
my privilege to meet you in England this time, but I have 
followed you with loving interest and prayers day by day. 

My object in writing at this time is to relate an incident 
to you which is interesting. Some months ago my eldest boy, 
who has always manifested an interest in the Truth, reached 
the age of 15 years, when it was decided for him to leave 
school, but what we were to put him at was the question 
which perplexed us. 

I suggested that he try the colporteur work. He protested 
that he was too young; but I told him of some as young as 
he who had succeeded in other places. He followed my advice, 
and from the first day had more success than I ever 
dreamed. What was my joy in getting home last time to 
find that in one day he had taken orders for twenty-four 
volumes! 

Further than this, the effect seems manifest in a wave of 
enthusiasm over the friends, and several of the sisters are 
giving some time with good effect. Even Sister Smith has 

R4963 : page 39 

been giving the work a trial with marked success. Such is 
the wonderful effect of zeal and shows how the Lord can 
use weak means to great ends.— 1 Cor. 1:27,28. 

You can imagine the joy that this brings to our hearts. 
I know it will bring joy to yours also. 

Yours in faith and love, R. G. SMITH.— England. 



DEARLY BELOVED BROTHER AND PASTOR:- 

Christian love and greetings! It has been the privilege of 
Sister Louise Jolly and myself to spend the past few days 
colporteuring some of the offices of Plainfield. The dear 
Lord strengthened us so wonderfully for this service and 
granted us such fine experiences that I felt constrained to 
write you. 

Having naturally too much caution, I have very few times 
colporteured the business section of towns for fear of intruding. 
However, here few gave the excuse of being too 
busy, and when they did they invited us to call again. Those 
who purchased STUDIES thanked us many times for calling, 
as did also several who did not purchase. It is such a satisfaction 
to present the Message to those who are in the forefront 
of this great battle for existence and who seem to appreciate 
any literature treating the subject of present-day 
conditions. 

A dear Sister said to me at the Put-in-Bay Convention, 



"Don't neglect the business section of your towns. The Lord 
has some precious grains of wheat among the busy business 
men." She gave her experience as having been so timid that 
before she could undertake that branch of service, she would 
have to have special prayer of each member of the class in 
her behalf. "Now," she says, "I would not take anything 
for my experiences in the business sections." 

Again I desire to express my gratitude to the great Chief 
Shepherd, and incidentally to you, an appointed Pastor, for 
these soul-refreshing, life-giving waters of Truth, and His 
great condescension, in using to any extent an earthen vessel 
which seemed of no use at all. Pray for me, dear Brother, 
that I may continue to be "a broken and emptied vessel for 
the Master's use made meet," now and in the glorious future. 

Yours in our glorious hope, M. M. SPRINGER.

THE BABE OF BETHLEHEM 

"For unto you is born this day in the City of David a Savior, 
which is Christ, the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you: 
Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling 
clothes and lying in a manger."— Luke 2:11,12. 

WHY WAS THIS BABE EXPECTED? 



WHY WERE all men in expectation of Him at 

the time of His birth? What was to be 

peculiar about Him to lead Israel to expect 

His birth? The answer to this question is 

that God had made a certain promise centuries 

before and the promise had not been 

fulfilled. This promise contained the 

thought that a holy child would be born, and 

that in some way, not explained in the 

promise, this child would bring the blessing 

the world needed. Therefore every mother amongst the 

Israelites was very solicitous that she might be the mother 

of a son rather than a daughter, that perchance she might 

be the mother of this promised child. Thus the matter 

went on for years until, finally, the child was born. 

The promise back of the expectation was that which 
God made to Abraham, saying, "In thee and in thy Seed 
shall all the families of the earth be blessed." From that 
time forward Abraham began to look for the promised 
Seed— the promised child. He looked first of all to his 
own children, and was finally informed that it would not 
be one of his children direct, but that through their 
children, at some remote date, this child should be born— 
the Seed of Abraham. From that time onward, all the 
Israelites were waiting for the birth of the child that 
should bring the blessing. 

But why was a Messiah necessary? Why wait at all 
for the birth of the child? The answer to this question 
is that sin had come into the world; that God had placed 
our first parents— holy, pure and free from sin— in the 
glorious conditions of the Garden of Eden with every 
favorable prospect and everlasting life at their command 
if they continued in harmony with God. But by reason 
of their disobedience they came under Divine displeasure 
and sentence of death. This sentence of death has brought 
in its wake aches, pains, sorrows, tears, sighing, crying 
and death— all of these experiences as the result of sin. 

Our heavenly Father said to our first parents— and 
this was the first intimation that He gave them of a deliverance 
—that "The Seed of the woman shall bruise the 
Serpent's head." The serpent in this expression means 
Satan— all the powers of evil, everything adverse to humanity, 
everything adverse to the blessings which God had 
given them, and which they had lost by disobedience. 
But the promise was vague and they understood little 
about the "Seed of the woman" and "bruising the Serpent's 
head." It merely meant in an allegorical way a 
great victory over Sin and Satan, without explaining how 
it should come. 

So mankind continued to die; they continued to have 
aches and pains and sorrows; they continued going down 
to the tomb. They realized that what they needed was 
some Savior to come and deliver them from the power 
of sin, to deliver them from the death penalty of sin— a 
Savior who would be, in other words, a Life-giver. They 



were dying and needed new life. This is the meaning of 
the word Savior in the language used by our Lord and 
the Apostles. They were hoping and expecting that God 
would send a Life-giver. 

It was on this account that they were so greatly concerned 
regarding the promise made to Abraham— "In thee 
and in thy Seed shall all the families of the earth be 
blessed"— they shall be granted a release from sin and 
death. In no other way could mankind be blessed. It 
would be impossible to bless mankind except by releasing 
them from sin and death. Hence, the Scriptures tell us 
of God's sympathy; that God looked down from His holy 
habitation, and beheld our sorrow, and heard, figuratively, 
"the groaning of the prisoners"— humanity— all groaning 
and travailing under this penalty of death— some with few 
aches and pains, and some with more aches and pains; 
some with few sorrows, and some with greater sorrows, 
but all groaning and travailing in pain. 

But God's sympathy was manifested; and we read that, 
"He looked down and beheld that there was no eye to 
pity and no arm to save" and with "His own Arm He 
brought salvation." This is what was promised to 
Abraham— that one should come from his posterity who 
would be the Savior of the world; and because this promise 
was made to Abraham and to his Seed, they were 
marked out as separate from all other nations and peoples. 
To the Jewish nation alone belonged this great honor- 
that through them should come this salvation. Hence, 
from that time onward the Jews spoke of themselves as 
God's people, the people whom God had promised to bless, 
and through whom He would bring a blessing to all 
others. Therefore, all other people were called heathen 
(or nations, which the word means). Israel was thus separated 
because God's Covenant was with them, and not 
with the others. But God's Covenant with Israel was for 
the blessing of all the others: "In thy Seed shall all the 
families of the earth be blessed." Now, we have the 
"Why" of this wonderful babe's being born. 

R4964 : page 44 

HOW WAS THIS BABE PECULIAR-HOLY, HARMLESS, 
UNDEFILED? 

How could He be a Savior? In what way could He 
be different from any other babe? Why not use some 
other babe as the one through whom salvation should 
come? The answer of the Bible is that salvation could 
not come to mankind unless there should be a satisfaction 
of Justice on account of Original Sin. That must be the 
first consideration. The penalty, "Dying, thou shalt die," 
pronounced against the first man, must be met before the 
world could be blessed. 

Why not let any man die? Because all were under the 
sentence of the original condemnation, and none could be 
a Ransom-price or a substitute. Hence the necessity for 



a specially born babe, different from any other babe. In 
what way was this One differently born? The Bible 
explains to us very distinctly that He was not begotten 
of an earthly father. Although Joseph was espoused to 
Mary, yet this child was not the child of Joseph. The 
Bible explains that this child was specially begotten by 
Divine power, in the mother, though she was still a "virgin" 
when she brought forth the child. 

This is the Scriptural proposition; and while it may not 
seem clear to some, yet the Word of God standeth sure. 
If the Redeemer was not perfect then He could not be the 
Savior of the world. The promised redemption implied 
that Jesus would be perfect; it implied that He would be 
as the first man was before he sinned. "For since by man 
came death, by man shall come also the resurrection of the 
dead"; "As all in Adam die, even so shall all in Christ be 
made alive." 

So this one must be, as the Apostle declares, "holy, 
harmless, undefiled and separate from sinners." (Heb. 7:26.) 
He must be entirely distinct and separate from humanity 
so far as sinful features were concerned. If we 
had time it would be interesting to go into the scientific 
features— of how a perfect child could be born from an 
imperfect mother. If we can have a perfect life germ we 
can have a perfect child from an imperfect mother. If 
a breeder of stock wishes to raise the standard of his 
stock, he selects a fine bull, a male goat, or a male ram, 
and thus he improves the entire herd. And so, if we had 
perfect fathers, we would soon have a perfect race. But 
there is no father who can produce a perfect child. Hence 
it was necessary in this case (and the Scriptures declare it 
was accomplished) that God should beget this Son by 
power from on high. Therefore, that which was born of 
the "virgin" was separate and distinct from all humanity. 
His life came not from an earthly father, but from His 
Heavenly Father. 

WHO WAS HE THUS BORN? 

It is written that before He became flesh Jesus had an 
existence; as He declared, "Before Abraham was, I am." 
Again, in one of His prayers He said, "Father, glorify 
Thou Me with the glory that I had with Thee before the 
world was." The Revelator tells us that "He was 
the beginning of the creation of God," and Paul says that 
"by Him all things were made." And so our Lord Jesus 
was not only the beginning, but also the active agent of 
the Father in all the creative work in the angelic world 
and in the creation of humanity, and in all things that 
were created. 

The whole matter is summed up by the Apostle John. 
We will give a more literal translation of "In the beginning 
was the Word." [This expression, Word, in the 
Greek is Logos. The thought behind the word Logos is 
that in olden times a king, instead of speaking his commands 
directly to his people, sat behind a lattice work, and 



his Logos, or messenger, or word, or representative, stood 
before the lattice work, and gave the message of the king 
to the people in a loud tone of voice. The king himself 
was not seen by the people— the Logos was the one seen. 
So this is the picture the Scriptures give us of how Jesus 
was the express representative of the Heavenly Father, 
the One through whom the Heavenly Father made Himself 
known— the Word, or the Logos. So we read in the 
first chapter of John], "In the beginning was the Logos, 
and the Logos was with the God, and the Logos was a 
god. The same was in the beginning with the God. By 
Him were all things made, and without Him was not anything 
made." 

In other words, Jesus was the direct Creator of all 
things. He was the Divine Power, Agent, Word, Messenger, 
the Logos of Jehovah. He did all the great work of 
creation; but He Himself was the first of God's direct 
creation, the First-born of all creatures, that in all things 
He might have the pre-eminence— the first place. 

When the time came that our Heavenly Father made 
known His great purpose that He would bless the world, 
He gave opportunity to this First-begotten One— this One 
begotten of the Father— to be the servant in this great 
work He intended to accomplish for mankind. Consequently, 
the Scriptures state that "for the joy set before 
Him He endured the cross, despising the shame." And 
now He has sat down at the right hand of the Majesty 
on high. He has this great reward because of His obedience 
even unto death, the death of the cross. 

The Apostle speaks of Him as having been rich, but 
for our sakes becoming poor, that through His poverty 
we might be made rich. He tells us how He left the 
glory which He had with the Father and humbled Himself 
to the human nature. Why? Because, as already stated, 
it was necessary that some one should become man's Redeemer; 
an angel could not redeem man, neither 
could an animal redeem man. The Divine law is 
"an eye for an eye; a tooth for a tooth; a man's life for 
a man's life." This was to teach us a great lesson: that 
perfect human life having been condemned to death, it 
would require a perfect human life to redeem it. It was 
therefore necessary that Jesus should become the "Man 
Christ Jesus," in order "that He, by the grace of God, 
might taste death for every man." 

WHAT RESULTS HAVE FOLLOWED? 

The results that have followed have been that He Himself 
proved His own faithfulness. "Being found in fashion 
as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient 
unto death, even the death of the cross"— the most ignominious 
form of death. It pleased the Father thus to 
prove Him, not only by Death, but by the most ignominious 
form of death— dying as a culprit, being crucified 
between two thieves. What a terrible ignominy to die 
thus! 



It would be ignominy enough for us in our imperfection, 
but for Him, perfect, "holy, harmless, undefiled and 
separate from sinners," it must have been a cause for 
deep and poignant sorrow. Having completed the laying 
down of His life, at the end of the three and a half years, 
He cried, "It is finished!" What? Not His work, for 
much of that lay before Him! He merely finished this 
part of the work, finished laying down His life a 
ransom-price. 

What next? After His death came His resurrection; 
and we read that "God raised Him from the dead on the 
third day." According to the Scriptures He was raised 
up from death a glorious being— "sown in corruption, 
raised in incorruption; sown in dishonor, raised in glory; 
sown in weakness, raised in power; sown a natural body, 
raised a spirit body"; "Wherefore God hath highly exalted 

R4964 : page 45 

Him and given Him a name that is above every 
name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, 
those in heaven, and those on earth, and those under the 
earth; that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ 
is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."— Phil. 2:10. 

But we see not yet all knees bowed to Him. Why not? 
The Scriptures tell us that before He begins His great 
work for the world of mankind, He first does a work for 
the elect, the Church, those who desire to walk in His 
footsteps, to gather out of the world a Bride, to be co-workers 
with Him in all the great work of the Father. 
This is the only work yet in process of accomplishment, 
and this has been going on now for over eighteen centuries. 
We see how He gathered out the saintly ones from 
amongst the Jews, "Israelites, indeed, in whom there was 
no guile." Not finding enough to make the desired number, 
He proceeded to gather them from all nations, kindreds, 
tongues and peoples. 

The Apostle tells us that when this Bride class is 
united with Him they shall be parts of the Seed of 
Abraham; as we read, "And if ye be Christ's then are 
ye Abraham's Seed, and heirs of the promise." (Gal. 3:29.) 
This statement relates to the promise made to 
Abraham, that through him and his Seed all the families of 
the earth shall be blessed. Thus we see the work that 
Christ is accomplishing now. 

The invitation to become the Bride of Christ is a very 
special invitation and those who would be His must walk 
in the "narrow way." If they will sit in His Throne, 
they must suffer with Him. If they suffer with Him they 
shall also share His glory. So "the sufferings of Christ, 
and the glory that shall follow," were not only to be 
accomplished in our Lord Jesus, personally, but He was 
an example for all the Church who are justified through 
faith in His blood. They have a share with Him in His 
sufferings, and will share in His glory; they have also a 
share in the First Resurrection; as the Revelator declares, 



"Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection, 
on such the Second Death hath no power; but 
they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall 
reign with Him a thousand years."— Rev. 20:6. 

Saint Paul says, "I count all things but loss for the excellency 
of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord," 
"that I might know Him and the power of His resurrection" 
(the special resurrection) to the divine nature. 
How? By being made conformable to His death; for, "If 
we suffer with Him we shall also reign with Him." 

WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE? 

All the families of the earth are to be blessed, as originally 
promised in Eden: "The Seed of the woman shall 
bruise the Serpent's head." Also, as St. Paul states in 
the 16th chapter of Romans, "The very God of peace 
shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly." So, then, the 
next thing in order in the outworking of God's Plan will 
be to bruise Satan and destroy sin. 

R4965 : page 45 

When and how will this be done? Just as soon 
as this Age shall end; because this Age is merely for the 
development of the Bride class; then will come the promised 
Free Grace to all the families of the earth. Messiah's 
Kingdom shall come. He has promised that when 
He shall reign, all His faithful shall reign with Him: "To 
him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My 
Throne, even as I overcame and am set down with My 
Father in His Throne." All the Church will be associated 
with Him in His great Messianic Kingdom; and "He 
shall reign from sea to sea, and from the river to the 
ends of the earth"; and "Unto Him every knee shall bow 
and every tongue confess, to the glory of God the Father"; 
"The knowledge of the glory of God shall fill the whole 
earth." The whole earth will become as the Garden of 
Eden. Paradise Lost will be Paradise Restored. The Divine 
Image lost in Adam will be restored to man. Human 
nature will be brought to perfection. But the glorious 
reward to the Church will be the divine nature, 
to be like her Lord, to sit at His right hand, and to bless 
the world of mankind. Man will become not only perfect, 
having all that Adam had, but will have additional 
knowledge and character; and there is every evidence that 
this shall be an eternal blessing. 

SHALL NONE BE LOST? 

Yes, the Scriptures tell us that some will be lost, and 
that the loss they shall sustain will be loss of life, and 
therefore all the pleasures of life. "They shall be as 
though they had not been"; "They shall be destroyed 
from amongst the people." St. Peter says, "They shall 
be destroyed as brute beasts."— Acts 3:23; 2 Pet. 2:12. 



When? When the eyes of their understanding shall 
have been opened to see the Lord and to understand His 
glorious character, and they shall have had opportunity to 
appreciate and enjoy His blessing. When such intentionally 
reject the grace of God, they shall die the Second 
Death, from which there is no resurrection, no hope of recovery. 
But, thank God, there shall be no knowledge of 
suffering for them; they shall be destroyed as brute beasts. 

In proportion as we believe in this Babe of Bethlehem 
shall we rejoice today. In proportion as we believe He 
was manifested on our behalf; in proportion as we believe 
He died for our sins; in proportion as we recognize 
Him as the glorified Savior; in proportion as we have 
surrendered our hearts to Him and seek to do the things 
well pleasing to him shall we have the peace of God. 

Our hope on behalf of mankind in general is that in 
God's due time His blessing shall reach all— not the same 
as that for the Church, but as St. Peter tells us in Acts 3:19-21, 
"Times of refreshing shall come from the presence 
of the Lord, and He shall send Jesus Christ, who 
before was preached unto you, whom the heavens must 
retain until the Times of Restitution of all things spoken 
by the mouth of all the holy Prophets." 



R4965 : page 45 

THE BODY OF CHRIST 

QUESTION.-Is the "body" mentioned in 
Hebrews 10:5 and Hebrews 7:27 the same? 

Answer.— The body which God prepared 
for sacrifice may properly be viewed 
from two standpoints: First, the Father 
prepared the body of Jesus, in that He was 
born holy, harmless, undefiled and separate 
from sinners, and of the human family 
through His mother. This is the foundation 
of the whole matter. But the Apostle 

Peter and also the Apostle Paul inform us that God foreknew 
the Church, "the Body of Christ," and, therefore, 
foreknew the sufferings of the Body as well as the sufferings 
of the Head— foreknew our share in the sufferings 
and also in His glory. 

In speaking therefore of the body which God prepared 
we should properly enough think how the Father prepared 
a body for Jesus which was actually, physically 
perfect and corresponding to the body of Adam, who was 
afterward condemned, and also prepared the way by which 
the "Body of Christ" should be justified from the sinfulness 
of the flesh, that thus He might offer not only Himself, 

R4965 : page 46 

the Head, but also "the Church, His Body," a "living 



sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God." 

TYPICAL AND ANTITYPICAL ATONEMENT DAY SACRIFICES 
FOR SIN CONTRASTED 

In Hebrews 10:10 the Apostle is contrasting the atonement 
day sacrifice of the typical high priest with the 
antitypical atonement day sacrifice of the antitypical 
High Priest, Jesus. The typical high priest needed once 
every year, repeatedly (not daily), to offer up sacrifices. 
The first part of the sacrifice was for his own sin, and the 
second part of the sacrifice was for the sins of the people. 
The first part was the bullock, and the second part 
the offering of the goat. These two offerings constituted 
the one sacrifice for sin on the day of atonement! And 
so, in the antitype, the offering of our Lord Jesus, when 
He offered up Himself, was for "himself," that is, for His 
Body, those who are to be His Church, the household of 
faith. And then, a further part of His sacrifice has been 
the offering up of these members of His Body, in harmony 
with their wills and in harmony with the Divine 
provision. 

Thus the antitypical atonement day sacrifices for sin 
have been in progress for eighteen hundred years. The 
special merit of the sacrifice was that which our Lord 
Himself offered, through which our offerings are made 
acceptable. It is one sacrifice in the sense that it is all 
one Body of one Priest that is offered, for the Apostle 
said, "We are partakers of the sufferings of the Anointed," 
and, "if we suffer with Him we shall reign with Him"; 
"if one member suffer all members suffer." 

ALL OFFERING MUST BE DONE BY THE PRIEST 

In Hebrews 7:27 the Apostle said, "This He did 
once when he offered up Himself." The question arises, 
To whom does this refer? Does it mean Jesus, and the 
members of His Body offering up Himself? We answer, 
No. The members of the Body do not offer up themselves; 
they present themselves; but the offering, so far 
as God is concerned, must be done by the Priest, Jesus, 
the "High Priest of our profession." The Apostle says 
that this He did once, and we answer, Here the thought 
is one fulfilment of the one type. In the type there were 
two sacrifices offered, and it is here called His sacrifice. 

Our Lord offered up Himself at Jordan, and He offered 
up all the members of His Body, the Church, at 
Pentecost. The offering of Himself personally at Jordan 
was accepted of the Father, and the remainder of Christ's 
sacrifice was merely the fulfilling of the terms of the sacrifice. 
So the presentation of the Church before the 
Father was accomplished at Pentecost, though it has required 
the entire Gospel Age to complete the sacrifice. 

This, too, was shown in the atonement day type: The 
high priest, after offering up the bullock, took the blood 
into the Holy and later into the Most Holy and sprinkled 



it on behalf of himself and his household— the members 
of his body and the household of faith— the underpriests 
and the Levites. 

Next the high priest came to the door of the Tabernacle 
and slew the goat, representing the acceptance of 
justified believers as His Body and their consecration to 
death. In the type this did not represent the second coming 
of Christ, but merely His manifestation in connection 
with the sacrifice of the Body, which is the Church. In 
the antitype our Lord as the High Priest manifested His 
power in the Church at Pentecost by sending the Holy 
Spirit upon them and thus giving the intimation that their 
sacrifice was made and acceptable in the Father's sight. 
All of the Church who have since come in were counted 
in there— just as in our Lord's prayer He said, "Neither 
pray I for these alone, but for those also who shall believe 
on Me through their word." Similarly the acceptance 
of the Church at Pentecost as joint-sacrificers, as 
part of Christ's sacrifice, has continued ever since and 
we are members of His Body, each in his turn being sacrificed 
until the entire sacrifice of the Great High priest 
once for all shall have been accomplished, and that accomplishment, 
we believe, is near. 

The expression, "If one member of the Body of 
Christ suffer, all the members suffer with it" (1 Cor. 12:26), 
does not, of course, signify that the dead members 
of the Church would suffer with the living members, 
nor that those not yet begotten of the Spirit would 
suffer with the Apostles, nor that members in different 
parts of the world would suffer with the other members 
of whom they were ignorant. It merely means that there 
is such a sympathy and union and fellowship in the Body 
of Christ that each is intimately and deeply interested in 
each other member, so that the interests of one are the interests 
of all. As, for instance, where there are two or 
three of the Lord's people in fellowship, as a little ecclesia 
or class, they are, in this sense of the word, a Body of 
Christ and are interested in each other, and suffer with 
each other in the tribulations, persecutions and difficulties 
of life. And, in a larger sense of the word, any of the 
members of the Body of Christ, in any part of the world, 
learning of the sufferings of other members of the Body 
would correspondingly feel an interest, a sympathy and 
fellowship in their sufferings, or in their joys. 

NOT A PART OF THE RANSOM 

In the statement, "A body hast thou prepared me," 
we must be careful not to read in what is not stated. It 
is not stated, "A body hast thou prepared me as a ransom-price," 

R4966 : page 46 

but, "A body hast thou prepared me" (Heb. 10:5), 

"for the suffering of death." (Heb. 2:9.) The 

suffering of death on the part of our Lord Jesus constituted 



the ransom-price for the sins of the whole world. 
But the Body, which is the Church, the Father prepares 
through justification for association with Jesus in the "suffering 
of death," but this does not constitute the Church 
partakers in the ransom-price. Only one ransom-price 
was necessary, and that was one perfect man's death, and 
that had already been arranged for before the Church was 
invited to become joint-sufferers and joint-heirs with the 
Redeemer as His members. 

The word "sacrifice" seems to be confusing to some. 
We are exhorted to present our bodies living sacrifices, 
but our presentation of our bodies to the Lord should not 
be confounded with the Lord's presentation of us. Going 
back to the type we find that two goats were presented 
to the Lord at the door of the Tabernacle. They were 
presented to be sacrificed, and so, when speaking of them, 
one might properly say, Those are the sacrificial goats; 
and whoever presented the goats might in one sense of the 
word be said to be the sacrificer. 

But the word sacrifice, when used in the sense of 
devotion, or setting apart for sacrifice, should not be confounded 
with the sacrificing work by the high priest. The 
goats were not sacrificed merely because they were presented 
or devoted. God dealt not with the people, but 
with the priest, and only when the priest had slain the animal 
was it sacrificed, from the Divine standpoint. Then, 
and only then, was it really acceptable to God as a sacrifice. 

Applying this, then, we may desire to come to God 
and learn that now is the acceptable day, now is the time 
when the Body of Christ may be devoted, or presented to 
the Lord. But something more is necessary than our 
presentation, and that further thing is the work which is 

R4966 : page 47 

accomplished for us by the High Priest, Jesus; namely, 
His acceptance, or His endorsement of our consecration, 
and the presentation of our offering as a part of His sacrifice. 
When the High Priest presents us with His merit 
imputed, then, and not until then, does our offer become 
a "sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God." 



R4966 : page 47 

"SOME BETTER THING"-"OUR HEAVENLY CALLING" 

LIKE MANY of our Christian friends, for a 
long time we did not understand how to 
"rightly divide the Word of Truth." (2 Tim. 2:15.) 
We did not comprehend that God's 
Plan provides, first, a heavenly salvation 
for the Church, and then an earthly salvation 
for mankind in general. The study 
of the Bible along Dispensational lines 



clears away all of our difficulties. It shows 

us that the promise that the redeemed 

"shall sit every man under his own vine and fig tree," 

and "long enjoy the work of his hands" (Mic. 4:4; Isa. 65:22), 

is God's provision for Israel restored to Divine 

favor, and for all the families of the earth, but not for the 

Church. Of the true Church, the Bride of Christ, it is 

declared that her members shall, in the resurrection, be 

like unto the angels— heavenly or spirit beings. 

St. Paul distinctly says of these, "Flesh and blood cannot 
inherit the Kingdom of God." (I Cor. 15:50.) Jesus 
tells these that He has gone to prepare them a place in 
the Father's house on high. (John 14:2,3.) But the 
place for man, the earth, already provided from the foundation 
of the world (Matt. 25:34), is a very different one 
from ours, of which we read, "Eye hath not seen, nor ear 
heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the 
things which God hath prepared for them that love Him." 
-I Cor. 2:9; Isa. 64:4. 

THE CALL TO THE SPIRIT NATURE 

Now we understand why it is that from Genesis to 
Malachi there is not one suggestion of a heavenly or 
spiritual hope for any natural man. Every promise is 
earthly. In Abraham's case, for instance, we read, "The 
Lord said unto Abram, Lift up now thine eyes, and 
look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, 
and eastward, and westward, for all this land which 
thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever. 
And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, so that 
if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy 
seed also be numbered. Arise, walk through the land in 
the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it 
unto thee. "-Gen. 13:14-17. 

St. Paul refers to this difference between the hopes 
of the spirit-begotten Church, founded at Pentecost, and 
those of all others. Pointing to the faithful of the past, 
he declares that although they had God's testimony to 
their faithfulness, nevertheless, they "received not the 
promise, God having provided some better thing for us, 
that they, without us, should not be made perfect."— 
Heb. 11:38-40. 

As soon as we get our "better thing," our higher reward 
of "glory, honor, and immortality," in joint-heirship 
with our Lord as figuratively His Bride— then the worthy 
ones of ancient times will get their reward of resurrection 
to human perfection. Under Messiah's Kingdom, those 
perfect men will be "princes in all the earth." (Psa. 45:16.) 
Then from the spiritual to the perfected earthly 
ones the blessings and instruction will descend for the 
poor, ignorant, selfish and superstitious world to help 
them, to uplift the obedient to the perfections illustrated 
in the perfected Worthies. 

We have heard of the Sunday School teacher who told 
her class about heaven, about its pianos, harps, organs, 



horses and carriages, fruits and flowers, etc. We see 
that she was merely thinking of the blessings God has 
provided for the faithful and obedient of the world— "in 
due time." She had no conception of the "heaven of 
heavens" promised to the faithful followers of Jesus in 
the "narrow way." The Great Teacher explains that it is 
impossible to describe heaven with its beauties and 
charms. He said to Nicodemus, "If I have told you of 
earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe 
if I tell you of heavenly things?"— John 3:12. 

In line with this, the Bible makes no attempt to describe 
heaven itself, nor its inhabitants. We are merely 
told that "God is a Spirit," "dwelling in the light which 
no man can approach unto, whom no man hath seen, nor 
can see"— personally. (John 4:24; I Tim. 6:16.) Men 
must discern God in His works— the noblest of which is 
the perfect man-made in His moral likeness, on the 
earthly plane, "a little lower than the angels" on the 
spirit plane. The most that His Word declares of our 
heavenly inheritance is that "Eye hath not seen, nor ear 
heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the 
things which God hath prepared for them that love Him." 
-I Cor. 2:9. 

But while refusing to inform us of the heavenly condition, 
God gives us a soul-satisfying portion. Through 
the Apostle He declares (I John 3:2), "It doth not yet 
appear what we shall be; but we know that when He 
[the glorified Jesus] shall appear [at His second advent, 
in power and great glory] we shall be like Him; for we 
shall see Him as He is." Others, not thus changed from 
human to spirit nature by the First Resurrection power, 
will not "see Him as He is," but only as He shall be revealed 
in His providences and judgments, which every eye 
shall recognize. 

How satisfactory! Beyond all that we could have 
asked or thought! "Like Him!"— what more could we 
ask? "Like Him" whom God hath highly exalted "Far 
above all principality and power and might and dominion, 
and every name that is named!" (Eph. 1:21.) We stand 
amazed at such grace! Moreover, we can realize that 
He who called us to become "partakers of the divine nature" 
and joint-heirs with the Redeemer in His Mediatorial 
Kingdom has provided for our every comfort and 
joy in that heavenly state, the details of which we may 
not now grasp. Prophetically of these it is written, "I 
shall be satisfied, when I awake with Thy likeness."— 
Psa. 17:15. 

It is the hope, the desire, the aim of every one of us 
to make our calling and election sure— to so run that we 
may obtain that great "prize" of participation in the First 
Resurrection. Of that resurrection we read, "Blessed and 
holy is he that hath part in the First [chief] Resurrection; 
on such the Second Death hath no power, but they 
shall be Priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign 
with Him a thousand years." (Rev. 20:6.) Let us have 
this in mind, dear friends, that our participation with our 



Lord in the glories of the Kingdom is dependent upon our 

faithfulness here in following Him through evil report 

and through good report; through honor and through dishonor; 

in the bearing of the cross along the way of 

self-denial. 

THE FIRST-BORNS PASSED OVER 

When God would bring typical Israel out of Egypt, the 
first-borns had a peculiar salvation, or preservation, first. 
The night before the deliverance all the first-borns were 

R4967 : page 48 

in danger of death, and were saved only when under the 
blood of the passover lamb. We see the significance of 
this beautiful type. St. Paul tells us that Christ is our 
Passover Lamb, slain for us. We each have appropriated 
His flesh, His human nature, which He sacrificed on our 
behalf. We recognize His sacrifice, the blood of 
Atonement. We see that this entire Gospel Age is the 
antitype of that night. We are hoping to belong to the 
First-borns (begotten of the Holy Spirit) who, during 
this night-time of sin and death, will be passed over and, 
on account of the blood without and the lamb within, be 
accounted worthy of being passed over— accounted worthy 
of eternal life on the spirit plane as members of the 
Church of the First-born— participants in the First Resurrection, 
to glory, honor and immortality, with our Lord 
and like Him. 

All of the first-borns of Israel passed over typified all 
of the Lord's people, in all denominations and outside of 
all denominations, who are now passing from death unto 
life. In the type, however, the first-borns of every tribe 
were exchanged for the one tribe of Levi— the priestly 
tribe— which thereafter typified the Church of the First-borns 
—the "Household of Faith." Further, the Lord 
divided that tribe into two classes. A little handful were 
made priests and occupied a special position of favor and 
relationship and nearness to God. The remainder of that 
tribe were honored in being used as the assistants or servants 
of the priests. This is an allegory, or type. 

The Church of the First-borns will consist of two 
classes, a "little flock" of priests, and a "great company" 
of the "household of faith," antitypical Levites, who will 
serve. The "little flock" of priests do their sacrificing 
now and, if faithful, will shortly be made a Royal 
Priesthood, a reigning Priesthood, joint-heirs with the 
great King of Glory and High Priest of our profession- 
Jesus. The "great company," however, typed in the ordinary 
Levites, will not be in the Throne, but serve before 
the Throne. They will not be "living stones" of the Temple, 
but will serve God in the Temple. They will not wear 
crowns of glory, though they will be granted palms of 
victory. 

Which place will you or I occupy in the resurrection, 



in the General Assembly of the Church of the First-borns? 
Shall we be of the Royal Priesthood, or of the 
less honorable, but still blessed servants? Shall we be 
of the Bride class, or of the less honored "virgins, her 
companions, that follow her"? 

It is for us to make our calling and election sure by 
our zeal, our earnestness, our devotion to the great King 
and His cause. He has called us to the highest plane of 
existence. It rests with us, under His wonderful and gracious 
arrangements, to determine whether we shall be 
passed over or not passed over; and if passed over, to determine 
whether we shall accept the place to which we 
are called, or the inferior place, which will be granted to 
those who do not keep their garments unspotted from the 
world and who, therefore, must come through "great 
tribulation" in order to enter into the Kingdom at all. 

We exhort, therefore, that we strive, not only to be 
present at the Great Convention, the "General Assembly 
of the Church of the First-borns," but to make our "calling 
and election sure," that we may be of the Bride class, 
the Royal Priesthood class, the members of the Body of 
the Great Prophet, Priest and King of Glory! Let us 
encourage each other and be encouraged to maintain the 
good fight of faith, and to gain the victory, so far as our 
hearts are concerned, over the world, the flesh and the 
Adversary. Let us be so filled with the spirit of the 
Truth, the spirit of meekness, gentleness, patience, long-suffering 
brotherly-kindness and love, that we shall be a 
blessing to those in our homes, that they may take knowledge 
of us that we have been with Jesus and have learned 
of Him; and that this blessing may thus overflow and 
abound to many hearts. 

BURNING AND SHINING LIGHTS 

One of old was declared to be "a burning and a shining 
light." There is force in this expression. Some 
lights are cold, austere, unsympathetic; but the kind approved 
of the Master was the burning kind— warm, glowing, 
sympathetic, helpful, intensive! The Master Himself 
furnishes the best of all illustrations of the principle 
enunciated. He was the Light which came down from 
heaven— undimmed, resplendent, shining forth to the 
utmost the light of Divine Truth! Not a cold, forbidding 
recluse was He, holding Himself aloof from the people 
with a haughty and disdainful spirit, telling coldly "Wonderful 
words of life." On the contrary, His entire life 
was sympathetic, whole-souled. One of the charges 
brought against Him by the cold Pharisees was, "He receiveth 
sinners and eateth with them." Even His disciples 
were shocked that He should converse with a woman of 
Samaria. But the common people heard Him gladly. 
While recognizing that He was far above their plane- 
while beholding in Him the glories of the "Only-begotten 
of the Father," they nevertheless were drawn to Him because 
He was the burning as well as the shining light. 



And they declared, "Never man spake like this man."— 
John 7:46. 

Bible students are all Christians; though, alas! all 
"Christians" are not Bible students. True, God's Book 
may even be read through by some who are unbelievers; 
and it may be scanned critically by opponents who seek to 
find fault with it and to entrap it, as they sought to find 
fault with the Master. These, however, are not Bible 
students in the proper sense of the word. Only those who 
have made a consecration of their lives to the Lord and 
are anxious to know the Divine will that they may conform 
their lives to it, and who, to attain this end, have 
entered the School of Christ to be taught of Him— only 
these are Bible students from our standpoint, searchers 
after the secrets of the Lord, because they love Him, and 
are appreciative of His glorious Plans and desirous of 
understanding them fully. 

Such Bible students should be burning and shining 
lights in the world and amongst our fellow-Christians of 
all denominations, many of whom, alas! have much of the 
spirit of the world and are lacking in the spirit of the 
Truth itself— because they are not sufficiently Bible 
students. 

"Let your light so shine before men that they may see 
your good works and glorify your Father which is in 
heaven." We are not enjoined to make a show of carrying 
our Bibles everywhere in an ostentatious manner. We 
are exhorted to show forth in our daily lives the lessons 
we learn from its precious pages. As the Bible is the 
Lamp provided by the Lord to all those who walk in His 
footsteps, so each of these in turn is a lamp which should 
shine forth upon others the light, the knowledge, the 
Spirit of the Truth, for their satisfaction. In other 
words, the Holy Spirit is not poured out upon the world of 
mankind, but merely upon the Lord's servants and handmaidens. 
It is an anointing for these, and upon these, 
evidencing to them that they have been begotten again, to 
the new nature, and making of them light-bearers for the 
benefit of others— burning and shining lights, sympathetic 
and helpful lights, "that they might show forth the 
praises of Him who hath called them out of darkness into 
His marvelous light." 

R4967 : page 49 

"THE LIGHT SHINETH IN DARKNESS" 

While keeping the lamp trimmed and burning— while 
seeking to glorify God as burning and shining lights in 
the world, we must not forget that the Bible assures us 
that we shall be no more successful in converting the 
world than was our Master. His great light shone in 
darkness, "and the darkness comprehended it not." And 
the religionists of His day instigated His crucifixion. 

The Master's prophecy concerning His followers will 
prove true to the end of the Age. The darkness hateth 



the light. "Marvel not, My brethren, if the world hate 
you"; "If the world hate you, ye know that it hated Me 
before it hated you." (I John 3:13; John 15:18.) It is altogether 
a mistake, therefore, to suppose that the Lord's 
consecrated people, letting their light shine faithfully before 
men, could convert the world. Such was not God's 
intention. It is the Church, not the world, that is being 
tested at the present time. The opposition of the world 
and all the powers of darkness serve to test us as New 
Creatures— to test our loyalty to God and to His Truth. 

Whosoever receives the light of Truth intelligently 
must rejoice in it; and, rejoicing in it, he must let it shine 
out upon others, or, by covering his light with a bushel, 
he will demonstrate his lack of courage, lack of appreciation, 
lack of earnestness— qualities which the Lord is now 
specially seeking amongst those whom He has invited to 
be sharers with Jesus in the glories of the Mediatorial 
Kingdom about to be established amongst men. It is important, 
therefore, that we let our light shine before men; 
that we be willing, nay, glad, if need be, to suffer 
for our loyalty to the Lord and to His message. And 
we have His Word for it that whoever is ashamed of Him 
or of His Word now, of such He will be ashamed by and 
by. He will not own them as members of His Bride class, 
will not accept them as assistants with Him in His 
glorious Throne. 

"The Light of the world is Jesus"; "That was the true 
Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the 
world." (John 1:9.) Thus far Jesus has not been dealing 
with the world, but merely with the blessed ones who have 
the eye of faith and the ear of faith. "Blessed are your 
eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear." (Matt. 13:16.) 
The time for the enlightenment of the world 
will be after the special call of the elect. Then the 
Church, as the Bride, will be with the heavenly Bridegroom 
in His Throne. Then all now found faithful in 
the matter of letting their light shine will be associated 
with the great Light, Jesus, as members of His Body. 
Altogether they will constitute the great Sun of Righteousness, 
which will then arise with healing in its beams 
for the blessing of all the families of the earth; "Then 
shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom 
of their Father; who hath ears to hear, let him hear." 
(Matt. 13:43.) He that hath a desire of heart, let him be 
obedient and thus make his "calling and election sure" to 
this glorious, chief salvation.

WHAT CONSTITUTES SPIRITUAL-MINDEDNESS? 
"To be spiritually-minded is life and peace."— Rom. 8:6. 
ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND the Scriptures, 



to talk fluently upon them and to expound 

them clearly is a qualification which we 

think should follow in the wake of spiritual-mindedness; 

but some might be able to 

expound Scripture very well, and to express 

truths in very good form who are not 

necessarily very spiritually-minded. A 

parrot can repeat certain words and 

phrases; but no one would accuse a parrot 

of being spiritually-minded. So there are some people 

who can repeat certain spiritual truths, apparently with 

a good deal of zest. 

To be spiritually-minded is to have a mind in harmony 
with the Spirit of God, and fully surrendered to the Divine 
will— fully consecrated to the Lord. It would not be 
enough merely to have a preference for good, saying, "I 
prefer not to do any gross sin; I prefer to live a life that 
will be honest and decent." This attitude would not be 
spiritual-mindedness. Adam was not spiritually-minded, 
but in his perfection he had a mind to do right. He had 
the mind of God in the sense that he had a balanced mind, 
not one having a preference for sin, or one that was 
weak. He was sound-minded and could appreciate things 
from the standpoint of righteousness and justice. But 
even in his perfection Adam had not a spiritual mind, in 
the highest, or Scriptural sense of the word. 

In Romans 8:6 the Apostle Paul uses the expression 
"spiritually-minded" in describing a certain class who 
have become followers of Christ, who have made a full 
consecration of their lives to the Lord and who, in 
harmony with this consecration, have been begotten of 
the Holy Spirit. These are spiritually-minded. These are 
granted a spiritual insight into Divine things. 

OUR LORD BECAME SPIRITUALLY -MINDED AT JORDAN 

This was true of our Lord Jesus. Having left the 
glory which He had with the Father, and having humbled 
Himself to take the human nature, He was found in 
fashion as a man. We read that He was not an imperfect 
man, but "holy, harmless, undefiled and separate from 
sinners." (Heb. 7:26.) Yet with all these special qualities 
He did not have the spiritual mind to which the 
Apostle has reference. Our Lord had a mind such as 
Adam had before the fall— a mind in perfect harmony, 
perfectly balanced. Our Lord received the spiritual mind, 
however, at the moment when He was begotten of the 
Spirit, when He made full consecration at baptism, and 
as a consequence the Holy Spirit descended and lighted 
upon Him in bodily form like a dove. 

Following that begetting, the Lord had an enlargement 
of understanding and was granted to see certain deep 
things of God which He had not seen before His consecration; 
so we read in that very connection that "the 
heavens were opened" to Him— the higher things became 
clear to Him— the more spiritual things. These things 



St. Paul calls "the deep things of God." "The natural 
man," St. Paul says [the natural man would be a perfect 
man; fallen man is imperfect, unnatural], "receiveth not 
the things of the Spirit of God,. ..neither can he know 
them, because they are spiritually discerned." (I Cor. 2:14.) 
Then he proceeds to say that we have received 
the Spirit of God through the begetting of the Holy 
Spirit; and that having the new mind, this spirit begetting, 
we are enabled to understand the deep things of God. 
"The things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of 
God; and we have received... the Spirit which is of 
God, that we might know the things that are freely given 
to us of God." Thus to us is it given to know the deep 
things of God.-I Cor. 2:11,12. 

NO NATURAL MAN IS SPIRITUALLY -MINDED 

So, then, the one who has been begotten of the Holy 
Spirit is spiritually-minded. He sees things from the new 
standpoint which God specially brings to the attention 
of the spirit begotten. As the Apostle John says, "Ye 

R4968 : page 50 

have an unction from the Holy One, and ye all know it." 
(I John 2:20.) Whoever receives this begetting of the 
Holy Spirit, this anointing, has an understanding of 
heart and of mind which is different from that which any 
natural man would have, a quality that will progress with 
him. He has the privilege of growing in grace and in 
knowledge and in the appreciation of the deep things of 
God; and he should grow. 

The Apostles Peter and Paul go on to explain (I Peter 2:2,3; 
Heb. 5:13,14; 6:1,2) that one thus begotten of 
the Spirit of God is at first only a babe, and, as a babe, 
should desire the sincere milk of the Word— the first 
principles of the doctrine of Christ; but as he goes on, 
he should feed upon the strong meat of God's Word. 
Some of those who have the begetting of the Spirit may 
be blessed with the special gift of language, so that they 
can make the matter very clear to others; some others 
who have also received the begetting of the Spirit may 
not be blessed with this gift. But all certainly would 
have the desire to tell forth the blessings which they have 
received from the Lord, that others might know and 
might glorify God in their bodies and spirits, which are 
His. 

As these spiritually-minded ones would thus endeavor 
to tell the good tidings, we have no doubt whatever that 
the Lord's blessing upon them would more and more 
qualify them as ambassadors and representatives, that 
they might tell the Message to others— if not in one form, 
then in another. We have noted, however, that some who 
speak with stammering lips have sometimes accomplished 
very wonderful things, while some with a great deal of 
eloquence have failed to obtain the same results. The 



victory is not always to the strong nor to the swift; for 
the Lord may grant His blessing with the feebly spoken 
word, particularly if the whole life be in harmony with 
the message given out. 

We have been surprised at times to find that some who 
have apparently considerable understanding of spiritual 
things, in the sense of being able to tell about them, do 
not always give the best evidence in their lives that they 
really have the Spirit of the Lord. Sometimes in their 
private lives there is that which is quite contradictory. 
This condition surprises us; causes us to wonder how it is 
that those who apparently understand the Truth should 
be without the power, or manifestation of the power of 
the Truth in their daily lives. We should bear in mind 
that whoever speaks the words of the Lord with his 
mouth, should uphold it in his every act, word, thought, in 
private life as well as in public. 

THE LIFE, NOT THE WORDS, A TRUE INDEX 

The Truth should be the standard. Everything else 
is certainly quite contrary to the Divine will; and that 
person who fails to uphold the Truth in his daily life 
gives evidence that he has not the Spirit of the Lord in 
the proper degree. If, therefore, any of us should find 
that in our daily lives we have not been living in conformity 
with the message of our lips, it would be a matter 
of serious concern, for we cannot doubt that whoever is 
out of harmony with the Lord in his heart, will sooner 
or later get out of harmony in his utterances. 

We think, therefore, that if in a congregation of the 
Lord's people any one were proposed as an Elder or a 
Deacon who outwardly had ever so great ability as a 
teacher, but who did not in his daily life give good 
evidence of being fully consecrated to the Lord, and of 
seeking to walk, not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, 
he should be regarded as a very dangerous person to put 
into the high position of Elder or Deacon. The sooner 
he is left quite by himself the better. For the more such 
people are put forward in public, the worse it will be for 
them and for the congregation whom they are supposed 
to serve.

DRIVEN INTO THE WILDERNESS 

-FEBRUARY 25. -MARK 1:9-11; MATT. 4:1-11.— 

'For in that He Himself hath suffered being tempted, He 
is able to succor them that are tempted."— Heb. 2:18. 

OUR STUDY for today is a most interesting 
one. It points to the time when Jesus 



reached the age of thirty and consequently 

was permitted to offer Himself without spot 

to God as the world's Sin-offering. Saint 

Paul quotes as applicable to Him the words 

of the Prophet, "Lo, I come to do Thy will, 

oh God," as it is written in the volume of 

the book concerning Me. I now present 

myself to be the Antitype, the fulfiller, of 

every prophecy that Divine wisdom has caused to be recorded, 

and the Antitype of every feature of the Law 

applicable to Me. 

There the Redeemer became the antitypical Passover 
Lamb, the antitypical bullock of the Atonement Day Sin-offering 
There He gave up His life to the doing of the 
Father's will; there He as the Man Jesus died; there He 
as the antitypical bullock was slain; there He was begotten 
of the Holy Spirit and became the antitypical 
Priest— the Sacrificer. Through the following three and 
a half years of His ministry He carried out this consecration 
and completed it at Calvary, crying, "It is finished!" 

R4970 : page 50 

LED OF THE SPIRIT-INTO TEMPTATION 

When Jesus received the begetting of the Holy Spirit 
at His baptism it was the begetting to the divine nature, 
and with it came great enlightenment to His mind, as 
represented in the words, "And the heavens were opened 
unto Him," literally, rent asunder. Forthwith He could 
see clearly into the Divine arrangements and purposes 
respecting Himself in a manner not possible to Him prior 
to His consecration. And so it is with all those who 
follow in His steps. The deep things of God are revealed 
to them gradually, as they are able to receive them, but 
never until after they have made their consecration vows 
to the Lord. With His followers as with Himself, the 
trial or temptation or testing as to loyalty comes more 
particularly after consecration than before. Hence the 
importance of Jesus' injunction: "Sit down first and count 
the cost."-Luke 14:28-33. 

But with us as with Jesus the Father provides not only 
a clearer appreciation of our trials and responsibilities, but 
also a clearer perception of the glories which will follow 
to the faithful. In Jesus' case the opening of the heavens 
—the enlightenment of His mind respecting the Divine 
Plan— was a much more wonderful matter than it is with 
us, because with His perfection of brain and of heart 
He was able to realize instantly the lengths and breadths 
and heights and depths of His undertaking, in a manner 
only partially attained by us after years of progress and 
study. At once the Master realized the full import of the 
Day of Atonement sacrifices, of the Passover Lamb slain, 
of the prophecies that spoke of Himself as being led as a 
lamb to the slaughter, and of the type which pictured 



R4970 : page 51 

Him as the Antitype of the brazen serpent, lifted on high 
for the healing of Adam's sin-bitten race. 

As these thoughts began to rush into the Savior's mind, 
He was first of all pressed of the spirit (His own spirit 
or mind) to go apart for awhile and to study out afresh 
the full import of the Law and the Prophets and His 
own obligations according to the covenant He had just 
made. For forty days and nights His intense earnestness 
made Him oblivious to almost everything else. Apparently 
He neither ate nor slept until the forty days were ended; 
and He "afterward hungered." Then it was that the 
Adversary appeared as a tempter— at the moment of His 
physical weakness as the result of fasting— at the moment 
when His soul was overwhelmed with the realization of the 
importance of the great contract He had made and of 
what it would cost Him to fulfil its terms. It was the 
severest test imaginable. Would the Redeemer prove Himself 
loyal to God— to the Divine Program— to His 
covenant of consecration, unto death? Or would He 
feel that the Father had poured too bitter a cup for Him 
—that God had made the tests of loyalty and obedience 
too severe— that it was neither just nor loving to allow 
Him to enter into such a contract? 

How glad we are to note the loyalty which triumphed 
over every temptation! With the angels we acclaim, 
"Worthy is the Lamb who was slain!" Not merely in 
the sense of consecrating His will, but in maintaining 
His full submission and deadness, according to the flesh, 
faithfully even to Calvary and the death of the cross. To 
Him be glory, honor, dominion and might everlasting ! 

TEMPTED AS WE ARE 

The Savior was not tempted with the habits of a 
drunkard nor with the weaknesses of a debauchee or a 
libertine, neither are those the temptations which come to 
us— His footstep followers. We are to remember that the 
Scriptures clearly differentiate between us and the world: 
"Ye are not of the world even as I am not of the world." 
"Tempted like as we are" therefore signifies that the 
temptations or trials which Jehovah permits to come upon 
His consecrated people are of the same kind that He 
permitted to come upon our Redeemer. 

It is important, therefore, that we notice the character 
of our tests. God is not testing us to see whether or not 
our flesh is perfect, for He knew all along that amongst 
men there is none righteous, no, not one. The Father's 
tests for those whom He receives as sons are tests of 
loyalty to Him, loyalty to the principles of righteousness, 
loyalty to the Truth, loyalty to the Divine methods— a 
refusal to take our own way or to seek our own glory or 
our own ease at the expense of Truth or of the Divine 
method. 



JESUS' THREE TEMPTATIONS 

When the Master was weakened through fasting, at 
the end of the forty days of Bible study, the Adversary 
appeared— not as an enemy and a fiend of darkness, but 
as a friend, "as an angel of light." (2 Cor. 11:13-15.) 
Professing interest in the Savior's welfare and an interest 
also in His work, he said, You are hungry, man, and 
unnecessarily so. Do you not know that the holy power 
which came upon you forty days ago is more than 
sufficient for your every need? Do you not know that 
now you may command even these stones to be made 
bread, and therefore have no need to be hungry? Do 
so, at once, please, before we have a conversation, for I 
have a great interest in you. I remember you well from 
the long ago when we were in fellowship, before my 
deflection. 

But Jesus replied, The power received was not to be 
used for ministering to My own flesh. It was received, 
rather, because I had made a consecration of My flesh 
to death. The Divine power which I possess I may use in 
any manner for the Father's glory, but not for self-gratification, 
however apparently legitimate. Besides, 
My eternal life is not dependent upon bread, nor upon 
the maintenance of this physical body. Rather, My hope 
is in God and in His promise that, if faithful in the use 
of this holy power which He has committed to Me— if 
faithful in My consecration unto death— He will give Me 
a crown of life— glory, honor, immortality. 

That temptation failing, Satan tried another. We 
assume that He took our Lord in mind to Jerusalem and 
the temple, saying, If you will go to the pinnacle of the 
temple and cast yourself down therefrom, it will be a 
means of proving to the people that you are the Son of 
God, and it will be the quickest method by which you can 
convince them of your mission and gain their adherence 
and loyalty and make them your disciples and thus accomplish 
your mission. I will quote you the prophecy in 
proof that this was God's intention for you: "He shall 
give His angels a charge concerning Thee and in their 
hands they shall bear Thee up, lest Thou dash Thy foot 
against a stone." (Psalm 91:12.) But Jesus declined this 
proposition also. 

If He had been thrust off the Temple pinnacle by the 
hands of an angry mob before His time was come, surely 
the Father's power would have interfered that He should 
not be injured; but to deliberately defy the laws of nature 
and to expect Divine protection from the natural consequences 
of His own course would have been to tempt 
God; this Jesus refused to do. 

The third temptation also was a mental presentation. 
A high mountain, in symbol, is a high kingdom. From no 
mountain on earth could all the kingdoms of the world be 
seen, since the world is round; but Satan's own kingdom 
was called to the attention of Jesus. Satan said, "You 
realize, of course, that I am the Prince of this world, 



that I am the God of this world and that I now have 
practical control, through ignorance and superstition, of 
the masses. I have a proposition to make to you. I confess 
to you that I am weary of the reign of sin and death 
which has progressed in the world because of my domination. 
I would rather share the Kingdom and have it 
uplifted and blessed. In other words, I propose to you a 
federation— that together we shall unite in the bringing 
of humanity out of sin and death conditions. What do 
you say? I on the spirit plane and you on the human 
plane will be quite masters of the situation, for you see 
I have the power in my hand and can easily turn the thing 
to our favor, and quickly the world will be blessed. Thus 
you will attain the glorious consummation of your hopes, 
and that without the awful trials, sufferings, experiences, 
etc., which you are now anticipating through following 
God's arrangement outlined in the prophecies. Come, let 
us federate and co-operate. Speedily I will turn things 
your way; victory will begin to come from the very hour 
of our federation ! 

Our Lord was indignant that it should be thought for 
a moment that, having left the heavenly glory to do the 
Father's will, He would now prove traitor to His covenant, 
and for fear of the cross and the shame and the death 
He would enter into a confederacy with the great Arch-enemy 
of righteousness— Satan. He answered, "Get thee 
hence, Satan, for it is written: Thou shalt worship the 
Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve." I will 
not serve you nor co-operate with you in any sense of the 
word. "Then the Devil leaveth Him." So far as we 
know, Satan never thought it worth while to return to 

R4970 : page 52 

the attack on the Savior. Then by Divine arrangement 
angels came to the famished Overcomer and ministered 
unto Him— strengthened Him, revived Him. 

The Lord's followers are to note how these same 
temptations are the very ones by which the Adversary 
assails them: (1) He would be their friend and helper 
and would thereby induce them to violate their covenant 
of sacrifice by requests for physical healing, physical 
blessings, which they have agreed to sacrifice. (2) He 
would suggest to them some wild, foolish way of capturing 
the world for God by some great exploits or prayer 
tests. (3) He would have them compromise with the 
world and its spirit and its methods by Church Federation 
and otherwise. We are to resist the Adversary courageously 
that he may leave us permanently, seeing no hope 
of winning us.

LABORERS IN THE HARVEST 



--MARCH 3. --MARK 1:14-28.- 

Text.— "The Harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few. 
Pray ye, therefore, the Lord of the Harvest, that He will send 
forth laborers into His Harvest."— Matthew 9:37,38. 

EVERYWHERE the New Testament teaches 
that the work done by Jesus and His 
Apostles amongst the Jews eighteen centuries 
ago was a harvesting work. Thus 
Jesus said, "I send you forth to reap that 
upon which you have bestowed no labor. 
Other men labored and ye have entered into 
their labors"— ye are reapers of the fruits 
of their labors— gatherers of the "harvest" 
of the fruitage of the Jewish Age. 

The ripe characters of that Dispensation were ready 
to receive Messiah and His Message upon terms of full 
devotion of their time, talents, influence and lives as 
servants of the New Institution— the New Covenant— 
which God purposes to inaugurate with Israel in due time, 
and under which all the families of the earth will be 
blessed. The service of the present time is sacrificial— 
the preparation of the Royal Priesthood, after the order 
of Melchizedec, to stand as Mediator between God and 
men— the world. 

The labors of Jesus and the Apostles found about five 
hundred brethren worthy of the garnering during His 
ministry. Subsequently, at Pentecost and after, several 
thousand more Jews were harvested— brought into the 
Spirit Dispensation— begotten of the Holy Spirit as New 
Creatures, Members of the Body of the Anointed, members 
of the Royal Priesthood. But of these there were not a 

R4969 : page 52 

sufficient number to complete the Divine foreordination; 
hence, after all the "Israelites indeed" had been harvested, 
the Jewish people were thrust aside from Divine favor 
for a time, and God's Message of Grace was sent to the 
Gentiles, "to take out of them a people for His name"— 
to be associated with the Jews as members of the great 
Mediator of the New Covenant, under the Headship of 
the glorified Christ. 

GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM 

Today's lesson relates to our Lord's inauguration of 
the "harvest" work amongst the Jews. John the Baptist 
and his disciples had preached and baptized many under 
the announcement that the Kingdom of God was at hand, 
and that all desirous of participating in its great blessings 
should come into full harmony with the Mosaic Law, and 
thus be prepared to be transferred from typical Israel to 
antitypical Israel— from membership in Moses, the type, 



to membership in Christ, the Antitype. In due time the 
preaching of John the Baptist was brought to a close- 
when Herod cast him into prison. From that time onward 
Jesus and His disciples became more prominent, but 
their Message was the same as John's; as we read, "Jesus 
came to Galilee preaching the Kingdom of God and saying, 
The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at 
hand; repent ye, and believe the Gospel." Whoever believed 
this Message recognized Jesus as the "Sent of 
God," the Messiah, who, in God's due time, will be the 
King of Israel, and the Monarch of the earth. "The time 
is fulfilled" meant that the foreordained time when the 
offer of the Kingdom would be made unto the Jewish 
nation had arrived. 

But God foreknew that Israel would not be ready- 
that only a few would be prepared to become the Bride 
of the Messiah, His associate in the Kingdom work, and 
that it would require eighteen centuries to select the remainder 
from amongst the Gentiles. 

Hence St. Paul points out in Romans 9, 10 and 1 1 
that the Prophets foretold the stumbling of Israel, their 
temporary rejection as a nation, the fact that a remnant 
of them would be the nucleus of the Bride class, and that 
the remainder would be made up of Gentiles. St. Paul 
declares, "Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh, 
but the election obtained it and the rest were blinded"— 
"until the fulness of the Gentiles has come in" and the 
"elect" class is completed. 

However, God proceeded with His portion of the 
proposition just as though He had not known in advance 
the course the Israelites would take. The Gospel was 
preached to them first and all the saintly ones were 
found in advance of any move being made to open the 
door of this special favor to the Gentiles. 

"TO BECOME FISHERS OF MEN" 

The Wisdom of God is foolishness with men, and the 
wisdom of men is foolishness with God— say the Scriptures. 
This is exemplified in our Lord's choice of the 
twelve Apostles, the calling of four of whom is noted in 
this study: Simon, Andrew, James and John. However 
able they were as men, they lacked the polish or education 
which people were accustomed to expect in religious 
teachers. The Bible record of them is, "People perceived 
that they were ignorant and unlearned men." 

This reminds us that the Apostle declared that this 
"high calling" of God to joint-heirship with Jesus reached 
and influenced merely the poor of this world, rich in faith; 
that amongst the "elect" will be found "not many great, 
not many rich, not many wise, not many learned, not 
many noble." (I Cor. 1:26,27.) Success in life leads to 
more or less of self-confidence, self-esteem, self-will, 
whereas the Gospel Message appeals to those who feel 
their own weakness and imperfection and unworthiness, 
and who correspondingly with great earnestness lay hold 



upon the Divine promise— the Divine aid, giving God the 
glory. 

The words of Jesus, "Woe unto you rich" (in 
wisdom, property, fame, in learning, in nobility of character) 
must not be understood to mean that the great, 
noble, wise and rich are all or nearly all condemned to 
eternal torment, or to any punishment, on account of their 
riches of education, character, etc. 

Rather, we must remember the standpoint of the Great 
Teacher's Message— "Woe unto you" as respects the Kingdom 

R4969 : page 53 

—you are less likely to gain this wonderful "high 
calling" of God than if you were in humbler circumstances. 
You have your consolation now, and correspondingly 
have less interest in the glorious things of God's 
Message. You are so well satisfied with the things of 
this present life that it will be the more difficult for you 
to sacrifice all these for the prospect of a share in 
Messiah's Kingdom. But, said the Master, "Blessed are 
you who are poor in spirit," humble-minded, and therefore 
the more teachable, for the more you will look out 
for the great Gift of God— the "pearl of great price," 
a share in the Kingdom of God's dear Son. 

TAUGHT AS ONE HAVING AUTHORITY 

The first five verses of our study tell how the fishermen 
forsook their earthly all for the prospect of sharing 
with Messiah in His Kingdom. Verse 21 shows that the 
Redeemer was recognized in Capernaum as a great 
Teacher and a man of learning, to whom others gave 
place in the synagogue; and the people marveled, saying, 
"How knoweth this man letters, having never learned at 
school?" 

Moreover, they were astonished at His teaching, "for 
He taught them as one having authority and not as the 
scribes." The Jewish scribes and rabbis then, as today, 
were evidently quite perfunctory and quite unable to give 
the people any understanding of the teachings of the Law 
and the prophecies. Jesus had a thorough grasp of the 
Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God, and His applications 
and interpretations therefore were convincing to His 
hearers. 

Had the Scribes and Pharisees and Priests accepted 
Him, the whole nation would have done so. But this would 
not have outworked the Divine Program. Hence the 
Master's works and teachings were largely parabolical 
and in dark sayings, because it was the Divine intention 
that only the saintly Jews should fully appreciate the 
Teacher and become His followers. The same principle, 
under God's providence, has applied to the Message and 
the messengers of the Kingdom throughout the entire 
Gospel Age. Hence at no time has the real Message been 
attractive to any except the saintly— others were content 



with forms of godliness devoid of power and out of accord 
with the Word. 

EVEN DEMONS OBEY HIM 

While Jesus was teaching in the Capernaum synagogue 
a young man, obsessed by a demon, "an unclean 
spirit," cried out. The demon recognized Jesus and His 
teaching and used the young man as his mouthpiece, his 
medium, saying, "Art Thou come to destroy us? I know 
Thee who Thou art, the Holy One of God." 

The demons cast out of human beings by our Lord 
and the Apostles, the Bible tells us, were once holy angels. 
They fell from Divine favor through their sinful relationship 
to humanity in the days of Noah. (Gen. 6:1-5.) 
These fallen spirit beings still desire human relationship, 
and are styled "unclean spirits," because, however they 
may begin by presenting themselves as angels of light, 
they later reveal their true characters by unchaste, impure 
suggestions. 

As St. Paul refused to allow a young woman medium 
to proclaim him and Silas servants of God (Acts 16:16-18), 
so Jesus refused to allow this demon to give testimony 
respecting Himself— even though it was complimentary. 
He commanded the demon to come out of the man. In 
leaving the man the demon caused him great pain so that 
he cried aloud. The effect upon the congregation at the 
synagogue was amazement. Not only the teachings of 
Jesus captivated them, but also His power to deal with 
the evil spirits, corroborating His authority as a Teacher 
sent from God. His fame began to spread throughout all 
the region of Galilee. 



R4967 : page 53 

"A SAVIOR AND A GREAT ONE" 

"A ghastly sight shows in the shivering air 

On Calvary's brow; 
The Savior of mankind, in love, hangs there, 

While followers bow 
The head low on the breast and sadly sigh, 
'How can He be Messiah— if He die?' 

"A jeering mob surrounds the cursed knoll 

And mocks the Lord; 
Yet to His lips and from His stricken soul 

Cometh no word 
Of vengeance or reproach— ah, no; and when 
In anguish came the final moment, then 

"Tis finished!' rings in triumph through the sky; 

He bows His head; 
And, while the querying soldiers mark the cry, 



The Lord is dead. 
All anguish past, His triumph doth begin, 
The world is saved, a death blow dealt to sin. 

"Jerusalem, amazed, hears fishers tell, 

With courage bold, 
How Christ has vanquished Satan, death and hell, 

As He foretold. 
Humble disciples forcefully proclaim, 
'There is Salvation in no other name.' 

"A Sabbath's journey from the city gate, 

With sorrow shod, 
Two sad disciples bear their sorry weight 

To their abode. 
The Christ appears, while holden are their eyes, 
And doth expound wherefore Messiah dies. 

"Emmaus reached, the Lord would further go; 

They gently chide— 
'Thou hast beguiled our grief and tears, and so 

With us abide.' 
He brake their bread— then vanished from their sight— 
Their hearts did burn with holy joy that night. 

"Still thus He comes; and though the faulty sight 

Of clouded eyes 
Perceives Him not, He makes the burden light, 

And stills our cries; 
For, like weaned babes, we mourn, the while He would 
Our hearts sustain with stronger, richer food. 

"The tale is old, but ever sweetly new, 

Why Jesus died. 
The nail prints, doubting one, He shows to you, 

And in His side 
A spear thrust gapes— a passage rent apart, 
For easy access to your Savior's heart. 

"It was for you, my brother, that He shed 

His life so free; 
For you, for me, He bowed His godlike head 

On Calvary's tree, 
That, trusting in the merit of His name, 
We might be saved from sorrow, sin and shame. 

"The past sufficeth, surely, to have spent 

In sinful deeds. 
Come, join our band; and be our footsteps bent 

Where Jesus leads. 
So, in His righteousness serenely dressed, 
We'll meet Him face to face among the blest."

INTERESTING QUESTIONS 
USE DISCRETION AND WISDOM 

Question.— We are told that from him who would borrow 
of us we should not turn away. (Matt. 5:42.) How 
shall we understand this? 

Answer.— There is nothing in this Scripture that says 
that we should lend to everybody who wishes to ask for 
a loan, either of goods or money; but we should not turn 
away with a deaf ear from those in need. The Scriptures 
say, Do good and lend, hoping for no recompense. (Luke 6:35.) 
We should also have that beneficent disposition 
which desires to do good to all men, especially those of 
the household of faith. But we should use discretion and 
wisdom. Often the very best thing to do to a person is 
to lend him something, even if sure that he would not 
return it; for thus the way to his coming any more would 
be barred to some extent at least. 



WE FIND WHAT WE SEEK 

Question.— Please give the meaning of the text, "Seek 
and ye shall find."— Mark 7:7. 

Answer.— The above text illustrates a principle to 
which we have frequently called attention. We find what 
we seek! Those who approach the Bible with earnest 
desire to find in it God's Message, will be guided of the 
Lord. As it is written, "Blessed are they which do 
hunger and thirst after righteousness [Truth], for they 
shall be filled. "-Matt. 5:6. 

On the other hand, those who approach the Bible from 
the standpoint of cavil, unbelief, antagonism, are equally 
sure to find what they seek— flaws, contradictions, etc. 
Note how Thomas Paine and Robert Ingersoll illustrated 
this principle; and compare their experiences and findings 
with the blessedness of those who feast upon the Bible as 
the Lord's bountifully spread table of good things— 
"Meat in due season" for "the household of faith."— 
Luke 12:42. 

The same principle holds true with the SCRIPTURE 
STUDIES. As those who so desire can pick flaws with 
the Bible and turn and twist its statements into unreason, 
so the same class would surely be successful in similarly 
picking to pieces "The Divine Plan of the Ages." 



"ONCE IN GRACE, ALWAYS IN GRACE," CONTRADICTED 

Question.— What is meant by the Scripture which 
says that if one who has been righteous shall depart from 
his righteousness, his former righteousness shall not 



count, but that he shall die for his sin? And also the 
statement that one who was unrighteous and turned from 
his unrighteousness shall be saved?— Ezek. 33:13-16. 

Answer.— This Scripture emphatically contradicts a 
doctrine held by some Christian people, "Once in grace, 
always in grace"; or that one who has been favored of 
God can never lose His favor. The principle of this 
Scripture applies, at the present time, to those who pass 
from death unto life as New Creatures. They are on 
trial for life or death. Adamic sin no longer counts in 
their cases. If they remain faithful to the Lord they will 
get the blessing of eternal life; if unfaithful, they will 
die. If one should make a covenant with God and then 
fail to keep that covenant, he would lose his covenant-relationship 
with God as soon as he abrogated the contract. 
If we are faithful, He will be faithful in giving 
us life eternal. 

But this Scripture specially applies to the Millennial 
Age; for at that time all are to be brought to an opportunity 
for life everlasting. People will then realize that 
"the wages of sin is death." Then it will no longer be a 
proverb that the parents have eaten a sour grape and the 
children's teeth are set on edge, but each "shall die for 
his own iniquity." (Jer. 31:29; Ezek. 18:2.) There will 
be a test for life or death, just as there is now with the 
Church. Only those who are faithful in their trial will 
be granted everlasting life, in either case. All others will 
be cut off in death. 



"HE THAT JUDGETH ME IS THE LORD" 

Question.— Suppose one addicted to the use of tobacco 
and who began to realize its filthiness should resolve to 
discontinue it and should really desist from using it for 
a time, but later should resume the occasional use of it, 
and thus did not conquer in the matter, the spirit being 
willing, but the flesh being weak— would this cause the 
loss of the crown and relegate such an one to the "great 
company"— or might it lead to the Second Death? 

Answer.— The use of tobacco is a very filthy habit; 
and there are other habits that are esteemed filthy by some 
people, but not by others. We are not to draw any line 
which the Bible does not draw. It is not, therefore, for 
any of God's people to judge another in the meat offered 
to idols, or in the chewing of tobacco, or in any such 
matters. We should encourage each other in cleanliness 
of life. To our understanding, no one would be condemned 
to death for not controlling the tobacco habit 
or the coffee habit or the morphine habit. God alone 
knows how each is struggling; He alone knows those who 
are fighting courageously day by day to the end. We are 
not competent to judge. St. Paul says, "With me it is a 
very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of 
any man's judgment; yea, I judge not mine own self. 



...He that judgeth me is the Lord." (I Cor. 4:3,4.) 
We may not even too hastily judge ourselves to be worthy 
of the Second Death. It is to be left to God as to whether 
we are overcomers or not. With this in view it is our 
duty to strive earnestly and not to be discouraged ourselves 
nor to discourage others, but rather to uphold them 
and help them to greater courage, to greater zeal in the 
service of our Lord.

SOME INTERESTING LETTERS 
BLESSINGS OF COLPORTEUR SERVICE 

DEAR BROTHER:- 

I want to tell you in just a few words how very many 
blessings our dear Heavenly Father is bestowing on me in 
the little service I am privileged to render Him. I have been 
drawn so close to the Lord in my work, and am daily relying 
more on His help, looking for His leadings, and trusting His 
providences. It is so blessed to be close to the Master, to see 
and feel His guiding hand, and realize His presence. How 
sweet prayer becomes, and how precious the communion with 
Him! 

I have lately made six calls on interested ones, and hope 
to find more. It seems a mere coincidence, but I know it is 
God's hand, that when I give my canvass, often not even mentioning 
the Bible Society (for some are ever alert to prejudice), 
the first thing I know people take me in and show me the 
STUDIES, which perchance are in their bookcases. They seem 
somehow to associate us. Of course, I first draw them out, 
then I can more wisely, perhaps, make comments. I have three 
or four parties in mind that I have just found these last two 
weeks; they have become quite aroused and interested. 

We have no large class here, but are served from Dayton, 
bi-weekly, and meet for study semi-weekly. I shall urge our 
class to give public meetings, perhaps a series, shortly, for 
these people want to come. 

I can see that all Christians are more or less, even unconsciously, 
absorbing the Kingdom message, and other co-related 
matters, as given out by our dear Pastor, no doubt 
through the sermons and PEOPLES PULPrT distributed. And 
some are so truth-hungry! They confess themselves that 

R4971 : page 55 

there is a true famine in the land for the Word of God. I tell 
you we still have opportunities and find receptive hearts. 
Praise the Lord! 

One peculiar case we have found is a good, intelligent man 
who has read all six volumes; he reads the Bible continually. 
(He bought a Bible, Manna and gave a TOWER subscription.) 
We invited him to class, but he believes the churches have 



done so much harm that Christians ought to stay apart and 
not meet in congregations. We will call on him and ask 
others, especially brethren, to do so. 

One dear woman had one first volume of DAWN, and not 
knowing, even now, that I represented the same Society, confessed 
that about one or two years ago she ordered the other 
two volumes of a colporteur, but refused to take them when delivered. 
She said he was so nice about it, and it has troubled 
her ever since, so she had to confess to me. He told her he 
believed some day all would see the Truth. This was evidently 
Brother Bryant Campbell, who now, we are sure, is 
with the Lord. He canvassed here at the time, and one 
Methodist minister persecuted him, and prejudiced the people 
against him and his work. 

I thank you for your kind words of encouragement. The 
Lord bless you. Pray for me! 

Yours in the Harvest work, 

MRS. GEO. H. KELLER. --Ohio. 



"PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR" 

DEARLY LOVED PASTOR AND BROTHER IN THE LORD: 

With Christian greetings and a prayer of thanksgiving in 
my heart for this blessed privilege of fellowship, I wish to 
write to you for a little while. My dear husband wishes to be 
included in the spirit of this letter. 

It is seldom that he and I have the pleasure of meeting 
our beloved Pastor, so, every once in a while the desire to 
write you an expression of tender, Christian love becomes so 
great that the heart will no longer retain it, and out it comes 
at the end of this pen! 

R4972 : page 55 

If, partially, the consequence be an encroachment upon 
your time, I know you will forgive, as our dear, gracious 
Heavenly Father does when we make mistakes. 

On your return from abroad we cannot greet you as some 
others who love you, but let this letter convey to you our glad, 
loving "Welcome home!" 

And now, a few words relative to a little matter upon 
which I shall much appreciate having your opinion: 

Twice, recently, I have met friends who are studying the 
Truth and show every evidence of love for it. 

The question of Spiritism arose, and in each case the 
friend was not acquainted with the truth on this important 
Bible subject. I inquired, Would you not like the truth about 
this matter? Receiving an affirmative reply, I told the one— 
a brother— of the little book on SPIRITISM and he promised 
to read it, saying his thought had been to have absolutely 
nothing to do with the subject. 

To the other— a sister— I loaned my own book with the 
same words, that in this "evil day" it is our business to follow 
what the dear Lord indicates is necessary to our salvation, 



namely, the putting on of the "whole armor that we 
may be able to stand" in this particularly evil period. 

When next I met her she exclaimed, "O, Sister Erb, I 
could not read that awful book! I am sure that our Lord 
will never allow His children to come in contact in any way 
with anything so unholy as the demons." She quoted, "He 
will keep them, that that Wicked One touch them not." 

I have thought that possibly others are in doubt upon this 
subject so pregnant with awful possibilities— some, perhaps, 
who have recently embraced the true faith— and that a word 
of emphasis from yourself with respect to giving attention to 
the truth regarding Spiritism would be a help to them. 

With one more prayer now, added to the many I have 
offered at the Throne of Heavenly Grace on your behalf, I 
will close, hoping before very long to meet and greet you 
face to face. 

Your sister, by the grace of our dear Heavenly Father and 
through our dear Redeemer, 

MRS. JONATHAN R. ERB.-PA.

DATE OF THE MEMORIAL SUPPER 

The date for the celebration of the Memorial will be Sunday 
evening, March 31, 1912, after 6 p.m. According to the 
Jewish calendar the fourteenth day of the month will begin 
at the time mentioned, and it was on that day that the lamb 
was to be slain, and that our "Lamb" was slain. And it was 
on the night preceding that our Lord instituted the Memorial 
and symbolical eating of His flesh and the blood as the antitype 
of Israel's Passover Lamb. 

We refer our readers to the Sixth Volume of the SCRIPTURE 
STUDIES, Chapter XL, entitled "The Passover of the New 
Creation." There we have endeavored to set forth this subject 
in detail. We hope that all of God's dear people who trust 
in the merit of the precious blood of Christ for justification 
will celebrate this Memorial of the great Sacrifice of our Lord. 
And let us not forget that it also memorializes the consecration 
to death of all the members of the Body of Christ: "If 
we suffer with Him, we shall also reign with Him"; "If we be 
dead with Him, we shall also live with Him"; "This cup is 
the New Testament in My blood. "..."Drink ye all of it." 
-Luke 22:20; 1 Cor. 11:25; Mark 10:38.

"WHAT IS MAN?" 

"When I consider Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the 
moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained, what is man, 
that Thou art mindful of him, and the son of man, that 
Thou visitest him? for Thou hast made him a little 
lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory 
and honor; Thou madest him to have dominion over 
the work of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under 
his feet; all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts 
of the field, the fowl of the air, and the fish of the 
sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of 
the seas; O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is 
Thy name in all the earth!"— Psalm 8:3-9. 

THE SUGGESTION of the Prophet respecting 

man is one which we believe has occurred to 

every intelligent being. As one upon the 

deep looks out upon the vast expanse of 

water and the riding of the vessel upon it, 

he thinks, How little is man! How small 

a speck in the Universe! When we look 

up into the heavens and realize that they 

represent so much more of Divine power, 

we are still more surprised. When we consider 

the heavens, and realize that all these stars, except 

the planets which belong to our own system, are really suns, 

and that around each of these suns revolve planets, as 



our earth revolves around our sun, and when we think 
of the number of these suns and their planets, we are 
amazed, and we feel our own littleness all the more! 

We ask astronomers as to the number of these suns, 
and they tell us that there are a hundred millions of them 
in sight. And if we would average the planets around 
these hundred million suns at ten, it would be ten hundred 
millions of planets. And then they tell us, further, 
that if we could take our stand upon the very farthermost 
one of these we would see still beyond us as many more, 
and as many more. 

Our minds are appalled as we begin to think of the 
heavens, the work of God's fingers, and then consider 
man, how small a work in God's sight! We have an appreciation 
then of what the Scriptures say man is like in 
God's sight— as "the dust in the balance," that is not 
worthy to be taken into account. We have all been in the 
grocer's shop and noticed that he pays no attention to the 
dust in the scoop of his scale. So man is so small in the 
sight of the great Creator that we wonder that God should 
have any interest at all in humanity. 

"THOU MADEST HIM TO HAVE DOMINION" 

Except for the Bible we should have no knowledge of 
God's interest in us, and we might think that God is so 
great that He would pay no heed to us. But, when God 
reveals Himself to us in the Bible, we begin to see that 
there is not only Divine power exercised and manifested 
in the creation of all these worlds, but we see also this 
Divine power manifested in God's dealings with us, and 
also the love of God, which the Scriptures state "passeth 
all understanding." What wonderful condescension on 
the part of the Creator that He should give heed to us! 

But our text goes on to give us further information on 
this subject: "What is man that Thou art mindful of him, 
and the son of man that Thou visitest him? for Thou 
hast made him a little lower than the angels." Only a 
little lower is the thought! Of the holy angels the Scriptures 
give us to understand there are various ranks, some 
higher and some lower, but all perfect. Then in the 
world we have various orders of animal life— the beast 
of the field, the fish of the sea, the fowl of the air— and 
man, as the highest of these earthly beings; and he stands 
related to all these lower creatures as God does to the 
entire Universe; and this is the honor with which our 
great Creator endowed His human creatures ! 

So we are told in this Psalm, "Thou madest him to 
have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast 
put all things under his feet." What a wonderful creature 
man is, then, from this standpoint! While he is a 
little lower than the angels, so far as his nature in connection 
with the earth is concerned, and whereas the angels 
are more excellent so far as their natures are concerned, 
this Psalm speaks of man as being superior in 
that he has a dominion. The angels do not have dominion 



over other angels, but all are subject to the great Creator, 
God. 

But man, in the likeness of his Creator, has been given 
a dominion over the lower creatures, and in this respect 
it is a wonderful honor with which he has been crowned 
—"Thou crownedst him with glory and honor, and hast 
set him over the works of Thy hands." 

It might be asked with great propriety, If God is thus 
careful of humanity and has so highly honored His human 
creatures, why should He not have made a still better 
preparation for them in the world? Why is it that they 
are subject to the unfavorable conditions under which 
they now exist? Why are there sorrow, pain, sighing, 
crying and dying? Why are there tempests, storms, cyclones 
and tornadoes, famine, drought and pestilence- 
why all these things if God is so careful of us as His 
creatures? 

We would have no answer for all these questions were 
it not provided in the Bible. In this wonderful Book of 
all books, we have the key to the matter, the explanation, 

R4972 : page 60 

and that is: God provided originally that man should be 
subject to none of these difficulties and disasters. Man 
was made perfect and placed in favorable and perfect 
surroundings, in a perfect garden, eastward in Eden, 
with everything necessary for his welfare— no storms, 
no sickness, no tempests, no difficulties— and he might 
have lived forever. Such was the wonderful dominion 
of this human son of God. 

Why, then, the change? This wonderful Book answers 
that the change all came about because of sin. 
And so we read: "By one man's disobedience sin entered 
into the world (there was no sin in the world before), 
and death as a result of sin." (Rom. 5:12.) 
There was no dying on the part of man until sin came. 
So all the aches, pains, sorrows and sicknesses which we 
experience are parts of this dying process. And so the 
difficulty with us all is that by nature we are "children 
of wrath." 

Is Divine wrath eternal torture? No, indeed! That 
teaching was handed down to us, perhaps, by our well-meaning 
forefathers. The wrath of God, we see on 
every hand; as the Apostle Paul declares, "The wrath of 
God is revealed"— in our own bodies, our aches and pains, 
mental imperfections, physical imperfections and moral 
imperfections— these are all parts of this great penalty 
for sin. We read that when man became a transgressor 
God sent a holy angel to drive our first parents out from 
the Garden of Eden, away from the trees of life that 
were to sustain them in perfection, out into the unfinished 
earth. 

While the whole earth could just as easily have been 
made perfect, God left it unfinished, unprepared for man, 
and merely "prepared a garden eastward in Eden" for 



the trial of our first parents, because Divine wisdom foresaw 

R4973 : page 60 

that man would sin; and instead of making the whole 
earth perfect, God left it in an imperfect condition, except 
the Garden of Eden. So we read that when God 
thrust our first parents out of the Garden of Eden, He 
said, "Cursed is the earth [not I will make it unfit, but it 
is already] for thy sake, thorns and thistles shall it bring 
forth, and in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread 
until thou return to the ground; for out of it wast thou 
taken, for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." 

In other words, the great penalty against our race is a 
death penalty— "Dying, thou shalt die." (Gen. 2:17.) 
This has been upon our race for six thousand years, from 
the time that sin entered into the world. So all the pages 
of history from Adam's day to this are marked with sin 
and sorrow, pain and sighing, because we are all sinners; 
and because we are sinners, God is treating us according 
to His own purpose, "Dying, thou shalt die." 

But this is the sad side of the matter. Is there no 
other side, is there no hope for us? The same blessed 
Book— the Bible— tells us. The Gospel Message, which 
signifies "good tidings," declares that God has some good 
message for those whom He condemned to death. 

WHAT IS THE GOSPEL MESSAGE? 

We inquire, What is this good message? The Scriptures 
answer that the good message is that He who condemned 
us as unfit for eternal life has provided for our 
redemption; that His Son became our Redeemer; that 
Christ died, the "Just for the unjust," that He might 
bring all back into harmony with God. O, some may say, 
but did not Jesus die eighteen hundred or more years 
ago? Yes, truly. And have we not the same reign of 
sin and death as then? Yes. Where, then, is the blessing 
which was to come through Jesus? Well, we answer, a 
two-fold blessing has been provided. First of all, there 
is a blessing of hope, which some of God's people enjoy, 
a blessing of knowledge, that in God's "due time" He will 
bring in the wonderful things of which this Gospel Message 
tells. 

God having provided a Redeemer, there will be a resurrection 
of the dead; they shall not remain dead, but come 
forth. There shall be a New Dispensation, a glorious 
morning, in which all sin and sorrow will be done away. 
So the Scriptures assure us of that time that there shall 
be no more sighing, no more crying, no more dying, because 
all the former things, all the things of sin, the 
things of death, will have passed away. 

"THE CHURCH'S ONE FOUNDATION" 

And, we inquire, who is so powerful as to overthrow 



sin and death, and lift up humanity and bring them back 
from sin and weakness and imperfection and death? The 
Bible answers this question, that the One who will do this 
is the Great One who sits upon the Throne of God; as 
we read, "He that sitteth upon the Throne said, Behold, I 
make all things new!" 

But who is this? O, the very same One, who, by the 
grace of God, became our Redeemer— Jesus. He is to be 
the great King of kings and Lord of lords, and is to 
"reign from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of 
the earth." And under the blessed influence of that Kingdom 
the full blessing of God will come to the earth again! 
"All the blind eyes shall be opened, and all the deaf ears 
shall be unstopped." "The glory of the Lord shall be revealed 
and all flesh shall see it together." These are 
words of the Prophets given to us for our hope and the 
strengthening of our hearts, that we might turn from sin 
and become more and more the children of God. 

We have referred to the world and how it is to be 
blessed by the Messianic Kingdom, the Kingdom of God's 
dear Son, the Kingdom for which Jesus taught us to 
pray, "Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as 
it is done in heaven." But we see not all these things accomplished 
yet. We see not mankind brought back to perfection, 
nor the promise of the good tidings fulfilled 
amongst men. But we have a word from the Apostle upon 
this subject. He said, "But we see not yet all things put 
under man"; they are still out of harmony. But, says the 
Apostle, we see a beginning of God's work; we see Jesus, 
who, "by the grace of God, has tasted death for every 
man." We see more than that. More than eighteen hundred 
years have passed. Not only has Jesus tasted death, 
but a great many have been going into death, in answer 
to the call to be of the Bride of Christ, the Church of the 
First-born, to be associated with our Lord. This is the 
Church we sing about in our hymn:— 

"The Church's one Foundation, 

Is Jesus Christ her Lord; 
She is His New Creation 

By water and the Word. 
From heaven He came and sought her 

To be His holy Bride; 
With His own blood He bought her, 

And for her life He died." 

This, then, is the first work of God in the redemption 
of mankind— the gathering of the Bride of Christ, the 
Church, to share in His glory, honor and immortality. 
We hope to be of this class; and to this class belong the 
great promises that they shall share with Him in the 
First Resurrection, and then bless all the families of the 
earth with restitution. The world of mankind is to be 
restored to all that Adam had and lost, for all of which 
Jesus died at Calvary; and associated with Him will be the 
Church, called out of the world, a saintly class who have 



been walking in the footsteps of Jesus; as we read again, 

R4973 : page 61 

"Blessed and holy are they who have part in the First 
Resurrection, on such the Second Death hath no power; 
they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall 
reign with Him a thousand years."— Rev. 20:6. 

This will be the thousand years of Messiah's reign, 
the thousand years of the world's uplift, the thousand 
years in which Satan will be bound, the thousand years in 
which knowledge shall fill the whole earth, the thousand 
years in which the earth shall be brought to the Paradisaic 
condition, which was symbolically represented in 
the Garden of Eden— and when every creature in 
heaven and earth and under the earth shall be brought to 
that glorious condition where they will sing praises to 
God that sitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lamb, for 
ever and ever. 

And yet there is another side; for the same Scriptures 
which tell of the exaltation of the Church to glory and 
the blessings of the world through the Kingdom of Messiah, 
which tell that the earth will be the Paradise of 
God— these Scriptures also tell us of a class of incorrigibles 
who will be punished. After this class shall have 
been brought to a full knowledge of God and shall wilfully 
sin against Divine light and blessings, the punishment 
against these will be, not eternal torment, but destruction 
from the presence of the Lord and the glory of His power. 
-IThess. 1:9. 



R4973 : page 61 

THE FUTURE INHERITANCE OF THE NEW CREATION 

"If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with 
Christ, if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also 
glorified together."— Romans 8:17. 

THE DIVINE PROMISE is that the Kingdom 
of God will be amongst men— "under the 
whole heavens." The Scriptures state that 
both our Lord and the New Jerusalem, or 
glorious Kingdom of Messiah, are to come 
down from heaven to earth; and they call 
our Lord, therefore, Immanuel (God with 
us). During that thousand years God will 
in this sense dwell with men, walk with men. 
We already have this to some extent in our 
experience as Christians. God is with men, and Christ 
and the Church are with men, more or less contradicting 
and putting to shame the things of darkness of the present 
time. 
But with all these suggestions it is not necessary for 



us to suppose that the Kingdom will be earthly. On the 
contrary, the assurance of the Scriptures is that the 
Church must become spirit beings before they can inherit 
the Kingdom: "We shall all be changed in a moment, 
in the twinkling of an eye," while those of this class who 
have been previously dead will have an instantaneous 
resurrection; and thus we shall be "forever with the 
Lord"— not forever with the Lord on the earth, but always 
in the spirit condition. The angels are always in the 
heavenly condition, whether they are in heaven with the 
Father or on earth, and we shall always be in the heavenly 
condition— the spirit condition. 

Nothing in the Scriptures indicates that there will be 
a restriction upon the Church, that she should remain in 
one place more than another. The intimation seems to be 
that, after she shall have experienced her change, the 
Church will be for a short time absent from the earth and 
in the presence of the Heavenly Father. We read in the 
forty-fifth Psalm that the Bride is to be brought into the 
presence of the Great King, arrayed in glorious clothing 
of wrought gold— "in raiment of needlework." The members 
of the Body of Christ will all be on the spirit plane, 
whether they are afar off or near the earth. This is what 
our Lord meant when He said, "I go to prepare a place for 
you"— in the Divine family. This particular place is one 
that has never been filled by any others. 

The various orders of spirit beings created by the 
Father occupy each its own sphere. But there is no 
Church of Christ amongst these. The Church of Christ 
is invited to occupy a place next to the Lord, next to the 

R4974 : page 61 

Father, higher than all the other planes of spirit beings. 
At the first advent this place had not been prepared for 
the Church, although the Lord had it in mind. Our Lord 
ascended up on high to prepare this place. He did so 
by making an application of His merit to the Church 
class, by imputing His merit to them and permitting them 
to become participators with Him in His sufferings in 
the present time, that they might also become sharers 
with Him in the divine nature. Thus He prepared the 
way to enter into that highest of all spirit planes, the 
divine. 

We are not sufficiently informed respecting the spirit 
condition to know just how it would be possible for the 
Lord and the Church to remain in the Father's presence 
and maintain the government of the earth. Perhaps this 
course is possible. Yet again, such would perhaps not 
be a wise arrangement. Perhaps it would be necessary 
for them to be absent from the immediate presence of the 
heavenly Father and to approximate the earth, just as 
with Satan and his angels, who are in tartarus— cast 
down, separate because of sin. But Satan is to be bound 
for a thousand years; and the position which he has occupied 
is to be vacated. The entire Church is to be "caught 



up in the air" to be with the Lord forever— not necessarily 
in tartarus, but "forever with the Lord," that where 
He may be there they may be also, in harmony with the 
Divine will, to execute the Divine purposes. 

Our thought, then, is that The Christ will be very 
closely associated with our earth, just as Satan's kingdom 
has been; and that they will be equally invisible to men, 
who will not see them during the thousand years, just as 
men have not seen Satan and his fallen angels. But as 
Satan and his angels have been doing an evil work, so 
Christ and His Church will be doing a powerful work, a 
good work, a work on the spirit plane; and associated 
with them will be various agencies, one of which undoubtedly 
will be the "great company." The members of 
Christ are the ones that are mentioned as "kings and 
priests unto God," who shall reign on the earth. 

THE EARTHLY PHASE-INTELLIGENT, WILLING MEN 

Then there will be earthly agents of this Kingdom, 
just as Satan has his agents, who are sometimes under his 
control through ignorance and superstition, sometimes 
from mesmeric power, all of which will be removed at 
that time. But the agents of Christ will be intelligent 
and willing. At that time the Ancient Worthies will be 
"Princes in all the earth." All mankind will gradually 
come into fellowship with the Kingdom and, proportionately, 
indirectly, become associated with the Kingdom 
itself. Just as any good man helps a government, so all 
mankind will be blessed in proportion as they approve and 
uphold the Divine arrangements. 

Thus the Kingdom will be spreading for the thousand 
years, not only from one individual to another, but gradually 
bringing them back to full perfection. We read that 

R4974 : page 62 

"of the increase of His government and peace there 
shall be no end." It will conquer everything before it. 
Nothing shall stop it. Every evil thing having been destroyed, 
every creature in heaven and on earth and under 
the earth will be heard praising God. Every knee will 
bow and every tongue confess; and His Kingdom will be 
without an opponent "from the river unto the ends of the 
earth"— having accomplished its purpose. 

The Kingdom will then cease, in the sense that Christ 
will deliver the authority over to the Father. (I Cor. 15:24-28.) 
This does not mean that the Law of God will 
be disregarded, as it has been during the reign of sin and 
death. To meet the exigencies of the fallen condition of 
mankind, and to bring back as many as possible into harmony 
with the Divine arrangements, a special Kingdom 
will be established— the Messianic Kingdom— which will 
come in between the Divine government and mankind, 
because mankind in its weak condition will be unable to 
meet the requirements of the Divine Law. But when this 



Kingdom has restored mankind to perfection, it is the Divine 
purpose for Messiah to relinquish this subordinate 
Kingdom, which will merge into and become a part of the 
great Kingdom of Jehovah. Justice will then operate. 
There will be no place for mercy, and the Heavenly Father 
is not then represented as being a merciful King to His 
creatures. The Heavenly Father will then have made 
them perfect, so as to need no mercy, and they will be 
glad to meet all the requirements of the Divine Government, 
and will be blessed in so doing. 

THE CHRIST TO BE ASSOCIATE RULER OF THE UNIVERSE 

Having terminated this work our Lord will not be 
without an occupation; but, according to the Scriptures, 
He will continue to be at the right hand of the Majesty 
on High— next to the Father. He will relinquish the 
oversight of the affairs of earth, and will assume again the 
general position as Associate- Administrator of the affairs 
of the Universe in connection with the Heavenly 
Father. We are not to suppose, however, that the Heavenly 
Father and the Lord Jesus will be kept busy hearing 
and deciding cases and administering Justice, for the 
equilibrium will be such that there will be no necessity 
for such a course. The whole Universe will go on practically 
without any head; and yet there will be the Head. 
The Son will be next to the Father in authority; and 
next to the Son will be the Bride. The work that will 
thenceforth progress is not revealed to us except in a very 
indefinite manner. 

We understand by the power of telescopes that the 
suns have each a planetary system. If God made this 
earth a planet to be inhabited, it is only reasonable for 
us to infer that all the planets of the Universe will be inhabited, 
and that The Christ will behold the Heavenly 
Father and His wonderful Universe. The Power of the 
Heavenly Father is boundless, so far as we can understand. 
If after we have considered the hundred millions 
and more of suns and planetary systems beyond the power 
of human mind to contemplate— if then we realize that 
the Heavenly Father has made the position of Christ 
illimitable, and He has exalted the Bride of Christ with 
her Lord, then it is reasonable to assume that the work 
of Christ and the Church will be limitless, and that some 
blessed work for creatures not yet born is the work of 
all eternity. We simply wonder in amazement! We 
wonder at the greatness of His goodness to us, which is 
to lift us— the faithful few who make their calling and 
election sure— from our low condition to future glories 
interminable!

CLEANSING FROM FILTHINESS OF FLESH AND SPIRIT 



"Having, therefore, these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse 
ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting 
holiness in the fear of God."— 2 Cor. 7:1. 

IN OUR TEXT the expression, "filthiness of 

the flesh," seems to be a general one, in 

contrast with the Divine purity in which 

man was created. All violation of Law is 

sin; and all sin is symbolized by leprosy, a 

very filthy disease. The Apostle, however, 

does not mean that he and the other brethren 

were filthy in having the very gross sins 

that the world has; for any one worthy of 

the name of brother in Christ would have 

turned his back upon all gross sins and would have put 

away all those before he could have become a brother. 

But the Apostle is speaking of the "dearly beloved" who 

have left all these, who have left the "wallowing in the 

mire," as the Apostle Peter puts it. 

To what extent we may cleanse ourselves will depend 
upon the viewpoint from which we speak. The Apostle's 
thought seems to be that we continue cleansing ourselves 
from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, as though he 
were pointing to a progressive work— to a high standard 
toward which we progress: "Be ye perfect, even as your 
Father which is in heaven is perfect." (Matt. 5:48.) In 
one sense, this is impossible. With imperfect bodies, we cannot 
always do perfectly, even with the best of intentions 
and motives. But God's provision is that the blood of 
Jesus Christ keeps cleansing us from all sin, so that His 
people should maintain this very condition in the Lord's 
sight— a condition of perfection at all times. That is to 
say, if they find they have come short, they should go to 
Him for a covering of their blemishes. 

But even if the Lord's people do not recognize where 
they have done wrong, they should know that all have 
sinned and come short; therefore, they should entreat the 
forgiveness of their trespasses. They should come to the 
frame of mind where they will be willing to cover the 
weaknesses of others, as they desire to be forgiven by 
God. We cannot suppose that God would be in love with 
any one who is practising sin. But He has made that arrangement 
by which we may be cleansed from sin. Thus 
the Lord's people are exhorted to be "without spot or 
wrinkle or any such thing." Their robe is to be wholly 
without filthiness of the flesh. If a spot should appear, 
small or great, it would be the duty and privilege of the 
one whose garment is soiled to have it cleansed without 
delay and not to remain in filthiness. This matter of 
keeping our garment unspotted from the world is one that 
should have our continual attention if we would have the 
Lord esteem us without spot or wrinkle. 

WHAT CONSTITUTES FILTHINESS OF THE FLESH AND 
SPIRIT? 



"Cleanse yourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and 
spirit." It is the New Creature that is addressed. It is 
the New Creature that is to do the cleansing— the new 
will. The flesh is what remains of the old creature which 
has been reckoned dead as respects domination of mind 
or will. But the old body has been turned over to the new 
will to be its servant of righteousness, to be its tabernacle, 
until it receives its glorious body in the resurrection. The 
new will has the stewardship or responsibility over the 

R4975 : page 63 

old body. Not only are we not to permit it to practise 
sin, but we are to control it in the service of 
righteousness. 

The Apostle here says that we are to cleanse ourselves 
from the filthiness of the flesh; and we are to judge of 
what might be filthy habits— or of habits we have that we 
might afterwards think filthy, impure, undesirable. As 
rapidly as we come to recognize these, we, as New Creatures, 
will seek to expunge them, eradicate them, remove 
them. Sometimes filthiness of the flesh is manifested by 
uncleanness of the hands, uncleanness of the teeth, etc. 
From the time the Holy Spirit begins to operate, the 
Lord's people want their bodies washed literally; they 
want their hands clean; they want their teeth clean. 
Again, filthiness of the flesh might be in the nature of 
rubbing snuff on the nose, for instance. This would not 
be quite so bad as the chewing of tobacco, not quite so 
filthy as the smoking of tobacco. The same person at 
different times in his experience might have different conceptions 
of this matter, but as we come to see we should 
correct these habits. 

But above all, the Lord's people desire purity in their 
inward parts; and the Apostle says that we should cleanse 
ourselves from filthiness of the spirit. This does not imply 
that the New Creature is filthy, but that the mind is 
filthy. How could the mind of the New Creature be 
"filthy" or unclean? We answer that the New Creature 
must use the old brain; and it is for the New Creature to 
exercise control, not only in the things which we chew 
and take into our bodies, but also in the operation of the 
brain, so that we shall think purely; for the brain, as well 
as the hands and feet, is the implement, the servant, of 
the New Creature, who is responsible for these things. 
He is to show his loyalty to the Lord by the way he deals 
with these things entrusted to his care. 

Considering the latter part of the text, we are to understand 
that God will look even deeper than our words 
and actions— even to the thoughts and intentions of our 
minds, to see to what extent we would harbor an impure 
thought. If we find that there has been harbored in our 
mind a thought disloyal to the Lord and to the brethren, 
or a malicious thought, whether spoken or not, it is a 
sin, a blemish, a filthiness of the mind; for it is something 



out of harmony with us as New Creatures— out of harmony 
with our God. 

The Apostle puts cleansing the flesh first; not that we 
are to have the flesh clean before the mind, but we are 
more liable to see the defilements of the flesh than those 
of the mind. As we get into the practise of looking for 
the imperfections of the flesh, we are not to forget to look 
after the imperfections of the mind, as the Apostle exhorts. 
He proceeds to say that we are learning more and 
more, under the instructions of our Lord and Head, the 
Father's Representative. We are in the School of Christ, 
learning what the standards of truth and righteousness 
are. Now, if we would not do the things which would 
offend our earthly friends, then we should be very zealous 
lest we come short of doing the things which would be 
pleasing in the Father's sight. 

THE MISRULE OF THE MIND OF THE FLESH 

There is a difference to be observed between the spirit, 
which stands for mind, and the will, which is the New 
Creature. As an old creature we had both a mind and a 
body; and the mind in a more or less riotous manner had 
more or less irregularly governed the body. Sometimes 
one organ was in control; sometimes another; at one time 
the organ of alimentiveness, at another time, another 
faculty. But these qualities of the mind are more or 
less unbalanced by our conditions in life and our 
environment. 

The world in general seems to be running along this 
line. Today they find pleasure in one thing; tomorrow 
in another. Sometimes it is ambition. One may say, 
"I will be a great general," and that thought becomes the 
mastering element of his mind. With another, the chief 
thought is some scheme of motherhood; with another it 
may be pride of dress and show; with another it may be 
the love of money, which becomes the controlling element 
of mind; with still others it may be politics which takes 
possession of the life. In either case, it rules the life. 
Anything which would interfere with these aspirations 
would be pushed aside; and anything that would help 
them would be encouraged. 

But with the Christian the matter is different. His 
aspirations and ambitions are that he may be in harmony 
with God and have the blessings of eternal life, which it 
is God's will to give to any who are of the right attitude 
of mind. With the world, the first thought is, "I have been 
working for some time to be a politician, and I will continue" 
or "I have been striving for a certain position in 
society, and I will still strive for it"; or what not. Frequently 
the thought of becoming children of God and joint-heirs 
with Jesus Christ our Lord, is set aside as being too 
hard to strive for. Their thought is that they do not know 
whether or not they would ever get the things which "eye 
hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the 
heart of man" (I Cor. 2:9)— the things which God has 



prepared for those that love Him— for at first these things 
are not great inducements. This appreciation of righteousness 
is what the Scriptures intimate to be God's drawing 
influence. 

But if the right influences prevail, there will be a radical 
change of life, the reward of which, if faithful, is 
to be a high and glorious future. Our Lord said that we 
should first count the cost. Those who take heed to His 
counsel, in proportion as they may realize what that cost is, 
find it to be the putting aside of all earthly ambition or 
honor. These must all be laid aside or counted as loss or 
dross in contrast with God's glorious promises. In making 
up one's mind the decision is reached after a discussion 
of all the qualities of the mind. If there is not such a 
discussion, there is likely to be trouble afterward. Some 
element will say that it had not been consulted. Hence, 
one should do as the Lord said, "Count the cost!" 

LET THE WILL OF GOD RULE YOUR HEART 

To those who count the cost and make a full submission 
to God, it means not only a turning from sin, but 
more than that. It means the full surrender of all one 
has, every talent possessed, to the Lord Jesus. That 
function of the brain by which the various qualities of 
the mind are consulted and a decision reached, depends 
upon the force and weight the higher qualities of the mind 
have. By "higher qualities" we mean justice, appreciation 
of Divine mercy, reverence for God, for righteousness 
and for all things which are holy, etc. The individual 
who has not such a constitution of brain is not on trial 
for life at the present time. Only such as possess these 
qualities belong to the household of faith. Only such are 
begotten of the Holy Spirit. 

This action of the mind, of the spirit, when it determines 
or wills to accept the Lord's will, is best represented 
by a legislative chamber, as, for instance, the 
Congress of the United States or the Parliament of Great 
Britain. These bodies are composed of different members. 
The person who receives the largest number of 

R4975 : page 64 

votes has the largest influence, and may be said to have 
control of that Body, for he is the representative of the 
majority. So in our minds; having decided to surrender 
to God, these higher qualities have accepted the Lord 
Jesus as the great Head of the Church. Thenceforth the 
person is subject to the will of God. 

It is not that we put any quality of our mind to be 
ruler, but that we put the will of the Lord there and accept 
Him to be Ruler in our wills, in our minds. Now, 
having reached this position in which Christ is the great 
Head, we should seek not only to cleanse the expressions 
of our tongues, and our actions, but to cleanse 
our minds also and bring them into subjection. It is our 



reasonable service that we cleanse not only our bodies and 
our words, but the very inmost thoughts of our minds. 
Anything that could be injurious either to ourselves or to 
another— envy, strife, hatred, bitterness— is to be put down 
and submitted to the new regulations, the new will which 
has taken control. 

The very object of the begetting of the New Creature, 
the very object of giving it the opportunity of the present 
life, is to develop character and to crystallize that character. 
This seems to be the thought of the Apostle when 
he says, "Whom He [God] did foreknow, He also did 
predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son"— 
not partly conformed, but fully conformed to the image of 
His Son. Our mental state, our will, must be fully fashioned 
after the mind of Jesus Christ. And His will was 
full obedience to the Father's will, to the extent of self-sacrifice, 
even unto death. 



R4976 : page 64 

"PERILOUS TIMES SHALL COME" 

"This know also, that in the last days 
perilous times shall come."— 2 Tim. 3:1. 

WE ARE to distinguish clearly between the 

restraint of the fallen angels "in chains of 

darkness," and the binding of Satan, who 

is the Prince of demons. The binding of 

Satan, as the Scriptures set forth, is at the 

second coming of Christ: "And He laid 

hold of the dragon, that Old Serpent, which 

is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a 

thousand years." (Rev. 20:2.) And during 

that thousand years Christ and His saints 

shall reign as Kings and Priests unto God. The restraint 

of the inferior angels is mentioned by St. Peter and St. 

Jude. Speaking of these fallen angels, St. Peter says, 

"Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering 

of God waited in the days of Noah."— 2 Pet. 2:4; 

Jude 6; I Pet. 3:20. 

As we examine the Scriptures we see that there were 
angels of light who became disobedient, who left their 
primary estate as angels, and sought to become men, who 
assumed the human form. We find the record of them in 
Gen. 6:1-4: "The sons of God saw the daughters of men 
that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which 
they chose." There were children born to them. "And 
there were giants in the earth in those days,... 
mighty men which were of old, men of renown." Then 
the whole world was filled with wickedness more than during 
the sixteen hundred preceding years. And God swept 
away all mankind except those saved in the ark. 



SPIRITS SEEK TO MAKE VOID THE WORD OF GOD 

The Apostle proceeds to show what was done with the 
angels who fell. They have less power, less privilege, 
than formerly. Then, they had the power of materialization, 
and could not only eat and drink, but perform all the 
functions of men. After the flood they were restrained 
in chains of darkness; that is to say, they were restrained 
from materialization and from working their power in 
light, as they had previously done. However, they were 
still working, as when Saul sought the witch of Endor 
to inquire as to how the battle would go.— I Sam. 28:7-20. 

The Prophet Isaiah says we should not have anything 
to do with those "who peep and mutter" and who pretend 
to have communication with the dead. (Isa. 8:19.) 
But these fallen angels seek to make void the Word of 
God; hence the various personations of the dead, as in 
the case of Samuel to Saul. It is not to be supposed that 
Samuel would come and give the information which God 
had said that Saul should not have. The same principle 
applies down to our day. The fallen angels have not been 
able to do their work except as they have gotten possession 
of human bodies by getting possession of their wills. 

So we read in the New Testament that there are many 
possessed— not of devils, but of demons. Of these demons 
various accounts are given. When our Lord addressed 
the man who dwelt among the tombs, the Lord inquired, 
"What is thy name?" and the answer was, "Legion; for 
we are many." Not only one evil spirit had gotten into 
the man, but a host of them. When Jesus commanded 
them to come out of the man, they asked that they might 
go into the herd of swine. Jesus permitted them to go; 
and the swine ran down into the sea and were choked. 
It is recognized as a fact that swine are not easily stampeded. 
You could whip one of the swine, but if you 
want them to move, you must whip every one of them. 
Yet there were enough demons to enter the whole herd of 
swine. 

The fallen spirits seem to be thoroughly degraded in 
their appetites and desires. And while they prefer to 
obsess human beings, yet, rather than have no animal 
body at all, they prefer, as shown in the foregoing, to 
have the bodies of swine. No doubt our Lord knew what 
the result would be. It was intended to give illustration 
as to what are valuable things for us to know: First, 
as to the number of evil spirits indicated by the number 
in the herd of swine; and, secondly, to demonstrate that 
they have no power to enter even into dumb animals, to 
show that poor, dumb creatures are free from them, and 
to demonstrate that they cannot trouble us, except as we 
permit them, or tamper with, or allow our minds to come 
under their hypnotic or obsessing influence. 

MODERN UNBELIEF IN EVIL SPIRITS 

And there are similar illustrations. On one occasion 



the evil spirits spoke out, and when the Apostle Paul 

could stand it no longer, he rebuked them. In the case 

mentioned above, the man was clothed and in his right 

mind, sane enough, when rid of the evil influence. (Mark 5:2-5,15,19,20.) 

So it has been ever since. There are 

physicians who tell us that more than one-half of all those 

in insane asylums are there because of obsession by evil 

spirits. But there are many physicians who do not believe 

in evil spirits or in obsession. 

When the Apostles were sent out by our Lord, they 
returned to Jesus, saying, "Even the evil spirits are subject 
unto us through Thy name." (Luke 10:17.) Those 
who deny the Scriptures say that these people were deceived, 
and that our Lord was unscientific. Our holding 
is the reverse of this— that the Lord and the Apostles 
were scientific, and that the people of our day are deceived 
in supposing that there are no evil spirits. We see 
these operating today, sometimes foretelling the future, 
clairaudiently, so that mediums are able to hear and to 

R4976 : page 65 

know things that others about them are not able to hear 
and know. God's people should be on guard, lest they 
come under evil influences. We have known some people 
who have come under this power. 

There was a brother in Florida who held conversation 
with the evil spirits and explained to them the Bible; 
and he thought he was about to convert some. They 
gave very respectful attention for awhile and asked 
questions which he answered. But after awhile they 
seemed to have their curiosity satisfied, and talked in all 
sorts of vulgar language. The brother said he could not 
get rid of them. He wrote to us asking how to do so. 
We told him to exercise his will, and meantime to offer 
prayer to the Lord, as the only One who could rid him 
of the evil spirits. They finally left him. Their hold 
was broken. A lady who was a writing medium supposed 
that it was some dead friend writing through her. 
She came to believe that there were evil spirits taking 
hold of her hand to do this writing, and refused to have 
anything more to do with the matter. 

FALLEN SPIRITS REGAINING THEIR LIBERTY 

The question may be asked as to how it will be in the 
closing time of this Age. The Apostle tells us that these 
evil spirits are to be restrained until the judgment of the 
Great Day. What would seem to be implied? We answer 
that this is the Day of Christ, the thousand-year Day. 
As He has been dealing with the Church, so in the thousand 
years He will deal with the world. Messiah's Kingdom 
is the Kingdom for which we pray, "Thy Kingdom 
come!" The Apostle says that the fallen angels are restrained 
in chains of darkness until the Great Day. And 
so we find at this very time, this very Day, not only evidences 



of the inauguration of the New Dispensation— the 
blossoming of the wilderness, the electric light, and all 
the blessings belonging to this New Dispensation— but 
also the evidences that these fallen spirits are obtaining 
more liberty. We have reason to believe, on what we 
think reliable information, that there have been 
materializations. 

Spiritualists claim that, more and more, spirits will 
exercise this power of materialization. They say that it 
will be only a little while until the dead will be walking 
around amongst the living. And materialization is only 
one of the powers which they can use. It is the 
fallen angels who are representing themselves as dead 
humans, in order to deceive and operate contrary to the 
Divine arrangement and Plan; and these are still working 
as adversaries of God and opponents of righteousness. 
We should not be much surprised if there are some 
very startling things— very wonderful things— to happen 
in the near future. If we get any conception of the 
time before the flood, we realize that the earth was 
full of violence. God perceived that the thoughts of 
men's minds were evil and only evil. And so today. 

The Apostle tells us that in the dawning of this New 
Dispensation and the closing of this Gospel Age, men 
shall be truce-breakers— violent. He proceeds with an 
entire list. (2 Tim. 3:1-5.) This description is prophetic, 
we believe, of the time in which we are living. 
And this condition, we think, will be due largely to the 
evil spirits, just as in the days of Noah. Our Lord, giving 
an illustration of how things will be at His second 
coming, says that it will be as in the days of Noah- 
people will be eating and drinking, planting, etc. He 
mentions that people will be ignorant of the time of His 
coming; that as the flood came suddenly, so would come 
the time of the ushering in of the New Dispensation. 
Our thought is that probably there will be a good deal of 
similarity— not that the evil spirits will be able to break 
the bands, or chains, which have been put upon them, 
but that it will be part of God's Plan to let this happen. 
God has been restraining these evil spirits during the four 
thousand years since the flood. 

KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH A SAFEGUARD 

Speaking of ourself: if we were living today under the 
ordinary knowledge of mankind in general, and no more, 
we feel sure that we should not be able to maintain our 
position as a Christian. Our faith might waver; we might 
not be able to believe in the existence of God. But we 
think the hour is coming when there will be a test of this 
kind. Mankind will have reason to doubt whether there 
is any other God than nature, which is a very cruel god. 
Many are coming to believe even now that the Lord is 
merely a God of nature, and by processes of evolution 
has been creating the race in the earth. These will certainly 
come to a place where there will be a severe trial of 



faith. 

Already many are falling; many are standing aloof 
from God and the Bible. Incidentally, the Lord describes 
that time when He says He will proceed to "do His work, 
"His strange work"— the procedure which will seem most 

R4977 : page 65 

strange to mankind, causing great trials and difficulties to 
come upon the earth and upon the nominal Church systems 
and all who have identified themselves with nominal 
Church Christianity. Many will be thus caused to lose 
all faith. We know to expect these things and we have, 
therefore, blessing and keeping-power now. And perhaps 
we shall need this special help more in the next few years. 
Who can say? 

We can readily suppose that our Adversary will have 
increased power as this time of trouble comes on. We 
can suppose that the evil work which will be done will 
be done by Satan and his fallen angels, who will exercise 
a very baneful influence upon humanity. Some cases 
have been brought to our attention recently. One was a 
statement about a person who had had a picture manifestation. 
When the picture was developed, it showed 
a man who had been dead for some time. It is evident, 
then, that the evil spirits are able to exercise some influence 
which can produce a picture upon a camera. Another 
case drawn to our attention was that of a person 
who has "seen things." This person thoroughly believes 
that he has seen the things with his own eyes. How 
could this be so? We may not know all the powers 
which the evil spirits may be able to use, as, for instance, 
with those who are clairvoyant and are able to see at a 
distance. We have all heard of mesmerism— that a person 
under this spirit control would be able to tell accurately 
things taking place at a distance. This power was 
tested by having a person do certain things at a certain 
time; and the person under the influence of the evil spirits 
was able to fully describe the things that were taking 
place. We are not sure how these things were done. 
The person must have seen the thing pictured in the 
brain in some manner beyond our comprehension. We 
assume that it must have been the fallen angels who could 
give this picture upon the brain of the medium, who could 
give the medium the things she would see. In our 
dreams we see people walk and hear them talk. And if 
we could have such things given naturally, we can easily 
suppose the power the evil spirits could have in this matter. 
This does not, however, make us understand the 
philosophy of it. 

To what extent these things will be used in the future, 
we know not. We have no doubt that the things 
which will be permitted will be very startling. Even to 

R4977 : page 66 



those who have the right understanding of the Divine 
Plan of the Ages, the things which will be permitted will 
be very strange. We are prepared for almost anything 
that might be told. We are convinced of the power of 
these evil spirits who pretend to do these various things. 
In fact, we can see that while materialization would be 
possible to them, a representation upon the mind would be 
much easier; it would be easier to paint a picture upon 
the brain. 

The Lord's people should have on at all times the 
whole armor of God that they may be able to stand in 
this particularly evil day.

RIGHTEOUS REPROOF AND FORGIVENESS OF WRONG 

"Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him 
reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break 
my head."— Psa. 141:5. 

IN THE SCRIPTURES the word righteous 

is used in a two-fold sense. In one sense, 

absolute righteousness is referred to, as 

when we read, "There is none righteous, no, 

not one." In the text under consideration 

the intimation is given that our Lord Jesus 

is the Righteous One who smites. In this 

sense, of course, the chastisements would 

come from our Lord; and the one chastised 

would receive them with appreciation, 

knowing that the Wisdom, Justice and Love of God are 

connected with such reproof. But there is a secondary 

use of the word righteous, applying to mankind. Various 

persons are spoken of in the Scriptures as being righteous, 

not because they were perfect, but because they were 

right-intentioned, right-willed, and manifested in their 

conduct the Spirit of God, the spirit of righteousness. 

In this use of the word righteous, the text seems to 
imply that all who are the Lord's people should be able 
to give reproof and correction in righteousness in a manner 
that would be helpful to those corrected, and for their 
good; in a way that would bring a measure of comfort 
and blessing and refreshment; in a manner that 
would be like excellent or fragrant oil, whose perfume 
would linger for hours. With this thought before our 
minds, there is a valuable lesson here. First of all, we 
should be of those who receive the corrections as of the 
Lord; and who are glad to be set right if we are wrong 
in any manner; secondly, we should be of those who 
recognize that if reproof be proper to give, it should be 
of a kind that would not be injurious, but such as would 
be spiritual, uplifting and refreshing. 

In order to accomplish this end a reproof should be 



sympathetic. We should remember that all of the Lord's 
people are fallen according to the flesh, but are New 
Creatures in Christ; and, if they be New Creatures 
in Christ, they must have the mind of the Lord and 
desire to glorify Him. Any of the brethren giving 
a reproof from this point of view would recognize 
that the person reproved had not bad intentions, and 
would explain as gently and kindly as possible what are 
the real facts. A reproof of this kind should not be 
given suddenly; and the person reproving should judge 
of the punishment to be given and of the proper time, 
etc., as of the Lord. Thus should any one that is 
righteous do in administering reproof to another. It 
should be done only after careful consideration and 
prayer, and after having arrived at the conclusion that 
this is the best possible way to help the brother or the 
sister. If all reproof were given under such conditions 
we may readily suppose that it would be much more helpful 
than is the usual reproof. 

CRUSHING REPROOF IS UNRIGHTEOUS 

The expression, it "shall not break my head," would 
mean that a reproof should not be disastrous, not be 
crushing, but it should be an anointing or blessing. To 
crush the head would be to kill the person. The righteous 
are not in the world for the purpose of doing injury 
to others or of harming them, but for doing good in the 
world. Those who injure others are to that extent unrighteous. 
Those who use their criticism and reproof, 
etc., so as to exercise a crushing effect upon the reproved 
are not righteous. Such should learn how to properly 
administer criticism. They should learn that the 
Apostle's statement, "reprove," "rebuke," etc., was not 
made to all of God's people, but to Timothy, who was an 
Elder. And only those should be chosen as Elders who 
are men of moderation, men of development, men who 
have learned to control their own lives and their own 
tongues, so that they would not crush, but that their rebuke 
would be helpful and intended to draw the person 
nearer to the Lord, and to be encouraging and helpful 
generally. 

"REBUKE NOT AN ELDER" 

When St. Paul instructed Timothy not to rebuke an 
Elder, but to entreat him as a father, the Apostle did not 
refer to an Elder of the congregation, but a person older 
than one's self. Do not rebuke a person older than yourself. 
Treat him as a father; likewise the elder women as 
mothers; and the younger men as brothers, and the 
younger women as sisters. In other words, an Elder is 
not appointed in the Church to brow-beat or to trample 
down the liberties of others. The spirit of kindness, gentleness, 
etc., is the Holy Spirit. If an Elder rebukes in 
another spirit than this, he should remember that the person 



rebuked is not a child and should not be treated as a 
child— not reprimanded or denounced or told "This is all 
wrong!" Such an unwise course in administering a rebuke 
is a fruitful cause of difficulty. 

It would not be wise or kind or gentle for a younger 
person to lose patience with older people whom he feels 
should know about a matter and to say, "You ought to 
know all about this. I will give you a lesson." This kind 
of spirit has made difficulty in various places. Apparently 
the Apostle's remark is to the opposite of this course of 
conduct, and exhorts to kindness, gentleness, consideration 
of age and everything that might enter into the matter. 
It is very evident from different Scriptures that 
there was a family sympathy in olden times that we do 
not see exemplified today, as shown in the Apostle's statement: 
"Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father; 
and the younger men as brethren; the elder women as 
mothers; the younger as sisters."— I Tim. 5:1,2. 

Today it is the custom to be very polite toward strangers 
and very impolite toward those of one's own family; 
and some will be very polite amongst those who are outside 
and very impolite to those to whom they ought to 
give kindness and help and sympathy. The same thought 
seems to be given in connection with the admonition to 
"love as brethren." But today, if you want to find true, 
real friends, you do not often look for them in the same 
family. In this respect our progress has surely not been 

R4978 : page 67 

of the evolutionary kind. Father, mother, brothers and 
sisters should be treated with consideration, with kindness, 
with love. And this principle should be applied to 
the household of faith. 

"LOVE WORKETH NO ILL TO HIS NEIGHBOR" 

In 2 Tim. 4:2 the Apostle, as a minister of the grace 
of God, explains that the declaration of the Gospel may 
include three features: (1) reproof; (2) rebuke; (3) 
exhortation. But it is safe to caution all of the Lord's 
people against too liberal use of the first two features. 
In order to reprove properly, the heart should be very 
full of love and sympathy; else the reproofs and rebukes 
might be sharp and possibly do more harm than good. 
Even with the heart full of love, it requires a head that is 
exceedingly well balanced to be able to make use of reproofs 
and rebukes to good advantage to those who really 
need them. And herein God's people are to be "wise as 
serpents, harmless as doves." Exhortation is the form 
of service which quite evidently can best be used by 
the majority of the Lord's people. And even this form, 
as well as the other efforts, should be characterized by 
patience, long-suffering, brotherly -kindness. 

WHEN FORGIVENESS IS PROPER 



"Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass 
against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. 
And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and 
seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent, 
thou shalt forgive him."— Luke 17:3,4. 

God does not forgive our sins until we acknowledge 
them and ask His forgiveness. Our Lord expressly states 
the propriety of expecting those who trespass against 
us to make some acknowledgment of their fault before we 
express our full forgiveness. If he "turn again to thee, 
saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him." 

We are not to accept one portion of the Divine direction 
and to ignore another portion. We are not to say 
that our Lord meant it when He said, "Forgive him," and 
that He did not mean it when He said, "Rebuke him; 
and if he repent, forgive him." With the majority of 
people, however, it would be quite unnecessary to urge 
the propriety of repentance— unless they were the transgressors 
whose duty it is to repent. Most people are sufficiently 
disinclined to forgive to wait until their forgiveness 
is asked. 

WE SHOULD LIVE ABOVE TRIFLES 

On the other side of the question, however, a caution 
is necessary. The Christian is to have the loving, generous 
disposition of heart, a copy of the Heavenly Father's 
disposition. In trivial affairs he is to have so much 
sympathy and love that he will take no notice of the little 
wrongs, just as God for Christ's sake deals with us, unless 
it represents knowledge and wilfulness. Such a rule operating 
amongst Christians— a determination not to recognize 
as offense anything that is not purposely done or 
intended as an offense— would be a great blessing to all, 
and the proper, God-like course. The transgressions to 
which our Lord refers are not trivial affairs, things of no 
consequence, are not evil surmisings or imaginings, are 
not fancied insults, but positive wrongs done us, which are 
susceptible of proofs and on account of which it is our 
duty, kindly and lovingly and wisely, to give some proper 
rebuke— some intimation that we recognize the wrong and 
that it has grieved us and hurt us. Then comes the Divine 
rule respecting the one and only proper manner of 
rebuke given by our Lord (Matt. 18:15-17) and more 
than once elaborated in this journal and in our other publications. 
Our Lord intimates that disobedience of His 
commands evidences a lack in discipleship. Though He 
gave very few specific commandments, this command 
which He carefully marked out as the one, only way of 
adjusting a grievance, is utterly ignored by many advanced 
Christians. 

"EVEN AS CHRIST FORGAVE YOU" 

The disposition to forgive should be with us always, 



and should be manifested by us at all times. Our loving 
generosity and kindness and desire to think no evil— or 
as little as possible— should be shown in all the words 
and acts of life. This course is God-like. God had a kind, 
benevolent, generous sentiment toward us, even while we 
were yet sinners. Nor did He wait for the sinners to ask 
forgiveness, but promptly manifested His desire for harmony 
and His readiness to forgive. The whole Gospel 
message is to this effect: "Be ye reconciled to God." 
Our hearts should be so full of this disposition toward 
forgiveness that our faces would not have a hard look, 
nor our words of reproof a bitter sting. On the contrary, 
they should manifest the loving forgiveness that we should 
have in our hearts at all times. 

Our Lord particularly called attention to the difference 
between an outward and formal expression of forgiveness 
with smooth words, and the true forgiveness which 
is from the heart. The former, or outward forgiveness 
is only lip-deep, and means that a rankling of an evil, unforgiving 
spirit is within, and that it will be only a matter 
of time until the pent-up force of malice and hatred will 
break forth in words of slander. God reads the heart, 
and, whatever the lip-professions may be, He will not 
consider these unless the heart and the life correspond 
with them. It is vain, therefore, that anyone should say, 
"I love my brother," and at the same time seek, either by 
word or act, to do him injury. All the evil-speaking, 
malice, hatred, envy, strife, proceed from evil in the 
heart; hence the necessity, on the part of all who desire 
to be of the Lord's Body, that they "purge out the old 
leaven of malice" that they may be members indeed of the 
unleavened loaf— the Body of Christ. 

Forgiveness "in your hearts" is the condition which is 
always to obtain there. We should never harbor any 
other feeling than that of forgiveness and good-will 
toward all, no matter how seriously they may have trespassed 
against us. If this be the case, we shall be longing 
and anxious to exercise the forgiveness outwardly and to 
express it to the repentant ones. Hence we shall not seek 
to compel the most elaborate statement on the part of 
the penitent; but, like the father of the prodigal, to see 
the repentant one coming in an attitude of humility will 
touch our hearts and prompt us to go out part way to meet 
him, to forgive him, to greet him kindly and to put on 
the robe of fullest fellowship and brotherhood. 

"If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will 
your Father forgive your trespasses."— Matt. 6:15. 

HATE THE SIN, BUT NOT THE SINNER 

Our earliest definition of "Injure not" would probably 
have been that we should not kill or wound our enemies 
physically; but as we look at the Teacher and heed His 
words we hear Him say, "Learn of Me," and we note 
with the Apostle that though He did no sin, neither was 
guile found in His mouth, yet, "When He was reviled He 



reviled not again [in return]; when He suffered, He 
threatened not; but committed His cause to Him that 
judgeth righteously."— I Pet. 2:22,23. 

If we are faithful pupils it will not be long until we see 
that the perfect law of liberty, the law of Christ, is a discerner 

R4978 : page 68 

of the very thoughts and intents of the heart; and 

that while we must hate all sin, we cannot hate any sinner 

and yet have the love of God perfected in our hearts. 

We see that this means, not only that we must not retaliate 

and revile our foes, but that we must not even 

wish to do so. The evil wish must be conquered and the 

selfish conditions which gave it birth must be utterly destroyed 

and replaced with love— the Spirit of Christ. 

"COPIES OF GOD'S DEAR SON" 

We may learn a lesson from the fact that those two 
grand characters, John the Baptist and our Lord, each 
fulfilled his own mission, according to the Divine arrangement; 
but that they had different missions. John's 
mission was pre-eminently that of a reprover and reformer, 
and we are to understand that as a Prophet he 
was supernaturally guided in respect to the various features 
of the course he took. Our Lord's mission, on the 
contrary, was a different one; He was gathering to 
Himself those whom John's ministry served to arouse to 
righteousness and to zeal to know and to do the Lord's 
will. 

We who are called to be the Body of Christ and to 
follow Him may learn a lesson in this as respects our 
proper course. We are not sent forth as John was, to 
dwell in the wilderness, living and dressing uncouthly, 
and to criticise and denounce everything and everybody. 
Some of the Lord's dear people fail to notice that such 
commissions are special and very rare; and sometimes 
in following the wrong copy, they undesignedly bring 
reproach upon the Lord's cause. 

We are to be copies of God's dear Son, our Lord, and 
not to be copies of John the Baptist. We are not to stir 
up strife by trying to mind other people's business, nor 
to seek to govern all the affairs of this world, reproving 
emperors, kings, governors, etc.; but, on the contrary, 
we are exhorted by the Apostle to remember that what 
God sees fit to permit, we can see fit to endure. Even 
though we find many things which we cannot endorse, we 
may equally find ourselves able to avoid any special denunciation 
of them— especially of things which have no 
bearing whatever upon the proper understanding and 
fulfilling of the Lord's Word. The Apostle points out the 
proper position, saying, "As much as lieth in you, live 
peaceably with all men." And our Lord emphasized the 
same thought, saying, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for 
they shall be called the children of God."— Rom. 12:18; 



Matt. 5:9. 

AN UNWISE COURSE 

Some of the holiest of the Lord's people err on this 
subject in their own families, and needlessly arouse prejudice 
and opposition, and make their homes unhappy, by 
continually finding fault with things which, though not 
up to the standard of saintliness and cross-bearing, are, 
nevertheless, not immoral or wicked, even in tendency. 
Parents and guardians are surely to guard against all 
tendencies toward immorality, etc., but to find fault with 
those they love, merely because they are only nominal 
Christians and have the spirit of worldliness, is certainly 
unwise. The general life of peace and joy in the Holy 
Spirit is the very best reproof of worldliness they can 
give, and the very best recommendation of the glorious 
Gospel they profess. This is the epistle that will be read, 
the light that will reprove darkness. 

In other words, we must not expect from, nor try to 
force upon the unconsecrated the details of our own self-denials. 
We must wait until they shall see full consecration 

R4979 : page 68 

to be their "reasonable service" and present their 
bodies living sacrifices to God. Pastors and teachers, 
however, should seek to keep continually before the Lord's 
consecrated "flock" the high Scripture standard, realizing 
that many influences are continually at work to lower the 
standard of holiness and devotion. 

"WHAT MANNER OF PERSONS OUGHT WE TO BE?" 

How highly we, who belong to the Gospel Dispensation, 
should value its privileges and opportunities, seeking 
to "make our calling and election sure!" (2 Pet. 1:4-11.) 
If those who were called with an earthly calling, 
to be a "house of servants," rendered but a reasonable 
service when they engaged in the Lord's work zealously, as 
did John the Baptist, and were faithful, how much more 
zeal and energy ought we to put forth— we who have 
been favored so much more highly? "What manner of 
persons ought we to be, in all holy conversation and godliness!" 
-2 Pet. 3:11. 

Let us remember that this "high calling," this "heavenly 
calling," to joint-heirship with our Lord in the Kingdom, 
is a very special and a very limited call, that it will soon 
end, and that so far as the Divine revelation shows, it will 
never be repeated. In view of these things, let us lay 
aside every weight, and run with patience the race set 
before us in the Gospel, looking unto Jesus the author, 
until He shall have become the finisher, of our faith.— 
Heb. 12:1. 

"No looking back on Sodom's plains 



No listening still to Babel's strains; 
No tears for Egypt's song and smile, 
No thirsting for its flowing Nile. 

Tis but a little and we come 

To our reward, our crown, our home! 

Another year, or more, or less, 

And we have crossed the wilderness; 

Finished the toil, the rest begun, 

The battle fought, the triumph won!" 



THE FATHER HIMSELF LOVETH YOU 
John 16:27. 

Be still, my soul, Jehovah loveth thee! 

Fret not, nor murmur at thy weary lot; 
Though dark and lone thy journey seems to be, 

Be sure that thou art ne'er by Him forgot: 
He ever loves; then trust Him, trust Him still; 
Let all thy care be this— the doing of His will. 

Thy hand in His, like fondest, happiest child 
Place thou, nor draw it for a moment thence; 

Walk thou with Him, a Father reconciled, 

Till in His own good time He calls thee hence. 

Walk with Him now; so shall thy way be bright, 

And all thy soul be filled with His most glorious light. 

Take courage, faint not, though the foe be strong; 

Christ is thy strength! He fighteth on thy side. 
Swift be thy race; remember 'tis not long. 

The goal is near; the prize He will provide. 
And then from earthly toil thou restest ever, 
Never again to toil, or fight, or fear— oh, never! 

He comes with His reward; 'tis just at hand! 

He comes in glory to His promised Throne! 
My soul, rejoice! ere long thy feet shall stand 

Within the City of the blessed One— 
Thy perils past, thy heritage secure, 
Thy tears all wiped away, thy joy forever sure! 
— Horatius Bonar.

HE HEALETH THEIR DISEASES 

-MARCH 10.-MARK 1:29-45.- 

"Himself took our infirmities, and 
bare our sicknesses."— Matthew 8:17. 



TODAY'S STUDY follows closely the one of 

a week ago. When Jesus left the Capernaum 

synagogue, He went to St. Peter's 

home. There St. Peter's mother-in-law lay 

sick of a fever. It was the work of but a 

moment for the Savior to take her by the 

hand and raise her up to health. The fame 

of Jesus had spread and by evening there 

were crowds importuning His healing words 

and touch. "And He healed many that 

were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many demons, 

and suffered not the demons to speak, because they 

knew Him." 

But He did not remain to increase and deepen the 
favorable impression that He had made. The next morning, 
long before daylight, He left Capernaum and went 
into a desert place for prayer and communion with God. 
St. Peter and the others who had accepted the call to discipleship 
followed, and found Jesus later, and apparently 
urged His return, saying, "All men are seeking Thee." 
But Jesus replied, "Let us go elsewhere, into other towns, 
to preach there also." And He went into the synagogues 
throughout all that section, all of Galilee, preaching and 
casting out demons. 

Nothing is more attractive to the human mind than 
the miraculous power of healing disease. No one enjoys 
disease, pain and suffering. People would be glad to be 
healed of disease, even if they were assured that the 
cures were performed by the power of Satan himself. 
It should not surprise us today that many false doctrines, 
wholly out of harmony with God's Word, commend themselves 
to the poor, groaning creation by promises of relief 
from physical ailments, without medicine, and theoretically 
by the power and favor of God, and supposedly in 
proof of the doctrines advocated by the healers. 

But since these healers hold various and antagonistic 
doctrines, it is manifest that all are not of God, if any of 
them are. To our understanding, the Bible teaches that 
no miraculous healing at the present time is authorized 
by God's Word. St. Paul declared by inspiration that the 
gifts granted to the early Church and exercised by Jesus 
and the Apostles and those to whom they personally 
communicated them would pass away. We believe that 
they did pass away— that they gave place to the next and 
higher manifestation of Divine favor, namely, the fruits 
of the Holy Spirit— meekness, gentleness, long-suffering, 
and love— as evidence of God's favor and of membership 
in the Church of the First-born. The miracles which 
Jesus and the Apostles wrought were merely with a view 
to the establishment of the early Church. Nowhere is it 
intimated that it was the Divine will that all people 
should be healed of disease during this Age. 

The general healing of disease will doubtless be a 
prominent feature of the work of Messiah's glorious 
Kingdom after its establishment. Not only will the ailments 



of the flesh be lifted, but restitution processes will 
go on step by step, lifting humanity out of sin, disease 
and imperfection, up to full and absolute perfection, except 
in the case of those who wilfully and deliberately oppose 
the Divine arrangement, and who, in due time, will 
be cut off from life in the Second Death. All the remainder 
will ultimately reach the glorious condition of perfection 
mentioned in the Scriptures, where there will be no 
more sighing, no more crying, no more dying, because all 
the former things of sin and death will have passed away; 
because He that sitteth upon the Throne will make all 
things new.— Rev. 21:4,5. 

SATAN AN ANGEL OF LIGHT 

St. Paul intimates that Satan and his messengers, the 
fallen angels, would seek to transform themselves so as to 
appear "as angels of light," that they might exercise the 
greater influence over humanity and that thereby they 
might inculcate the more successfully false doctrines, 
subversive of true faith in God and His Word. We believe 
that the Apostle's words are particularly applicable 
in our day, and that many conscientious and good people 
are being deceived, and that miraculous healings are part 
of the Adversary's bait. It would not be appropriate for 
us to enumerate here the different doctrines which we 
believe are thus baited. We content ourselves by giving 
the Scriptural reason for expecting no miraculous healings 
from God at the present time. 

"WHO HEALETH THEIR DISEASES" 

It is quite true that under the Law Covenant which 
God made with Israel, He agreed that sickness should be 
a penalty for violation of the Law, and health a reward 
for the obedient. The statement of the Prophet, "Who 
healeth all thy diseases," was applicable physically to the 
Israelites under the Law Covenant. It has also a spiritual 
application to the Church, the New Creation. 

But the healing of the New Creature and the healing 
of his flesh are different things. The New Creature's 
soul sickness and heart troubles are all cured by the Good 
Physician— even though his flesh may suffer pain and go 
down into death. We are to remember that the condition 
upon which we were begotten of the Holy Spirit to 

R4980 : page 69 

be new creatures was a full surrender of the flesh and its 
interests as living sacrifices, holy and acceptable, which is 
our reasonable service.— Rom. 12:1. 

Nor is this any change from the Lord's dealings with 
the Church from the very beginning. So far as the records 
show all, or nearly all, who were healed by Jesus and 
the Apostles were "sinners." Surely there is no record of 
a single instance in which any of the Apostles were healed 



of any disease. Although St. Paul healed many sick, yet 
when Epaphroditus was sick and "nigh unto death" we 
have no mention of any attempt to miraculously recover 
him. 

Similarly, in the case of Timothy, we find that St. Paul 
neither sent him napkins and handkerchiefs for his healing, 
nor advised him to pray for his own healing, nor 
told him that he would pray for him, nor advised him to 
have others pray for him. On the contrary, he advised 
certain medicines, "for thy stomach's sake." Indeed, we 
believe that for God's consecrated people to ask for physical 
healing would be to attempt to take back again what 
they have specifically consecrated to the Lord— "even 
unto death." That the Lord specially overrules in the 
cases of many of His people to give them remarkable 
health and strength for their labors in His service, without 
their asking it, is another matter entirely. This, however, 
is in no wise in conflict with the fact that God used 
miracles amongst outsiders, amongst unconsecrated people, 
as a foreshadowing of the general blessings which will 
come to mankind under Messiah's Kingdom shortly to be 
established. 

Furthermore, let us remember that the miracles performed 
by Jesus and the Apostles were not attempts to 
heal all sickness, to banish pain and sorrow. They were 
merely intended to attract attention to the Gospel Message. 
The time when God shall wipe away all tears from off all 
faces, and when there shall be no more sighing and crying 

R4980 : page 70 

and dying, will be during and as a result of Messiah's 
reign of a thousand years.— Rev. 21:4. 

Today's study furnishes one proof along this line. 
Jesus did many mighty works in Capernaum, but merely 
to attract attention. He went to other cities and towns, 
leaving behind Him in Capernaum many sick and disappointed. 
Similarly, we read that when Jesus passed the 
pool of Siloam there was a great multitude of impotent 
folk there needing healing and waiting the opportunity to 
go down into the water therefor. Jesus merely observed 
one of that multitude and said unto him, "Take up thy bed 
and walk."— John 5:1-9. 

A CLEANSED LEPER THANKFUL 

Today's study mentions another case of healing. Leprosy 
was regarded by the Jews as an incurable disease, 
and as a type of sin. The leper of this lesson had faith 
in the power of Jesus, and came and kneeled before Him 
and entreated healing, cleansing. His prayer was answered, 
not because he was one of Jesus' disciples, nor 
because he promised to become one of them, but because 
of his exercise of faith, and in order to make of his case 
a testimony to the priests that Jesus exercised a power 
Divine. The cleansed leper was told to go, according to 



the Law, and present the customary offering, expressing 
his thanks to God and giving his testimony to the priest 
respecting his healing, and to have him examine him as 
the Law required. 

Jesus admonished the leper not to make known so 
great a miracle; but in his thankfulness he could not restrain 
himself; he told it everywhere. The result was 
that Jesus could not thereafter visit the large cities because 
he would be overwhelmed with the number of sick 
brought to him for healing. He therefore frequented the 
rural districts, but even then the people sought Him for 
healing, from every quarter. 

But alas! they were more appreciative of the restitution 
blessings than the great privilege which our Lord 
specially offered them of becoming His footstep followers 
and joint-heirs in His Kingdom, which, by and by, 
will dispense restitution blessings and healing far and 
near to every member of Adam's race condemned through 
the fall of Adam, and redeemed by the precious blood of 
Calvary. 



R4980 : page 70 

SIN-FORGIVENESS AND HEALING 

-MARCH 17.-MARK 2:1-12.- 

Text:— "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits: 
who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy 
diseases."— Psalm 103:2,3. 

WHEN LATER the Savior returned to Capernaum 

there was a crush to see and hear 

Him, and to bring the sick for His healing 

words and touch. The miracles which our 

Lord performed were specially with a view 

of getting the ear of the people for His 

Message— the Gospel of the Kingdom— the 

good news of the privilege of becoming sons 

of God and joint-heirs with Jesus in the 

Messianic Government, which would bless 

Israel and all nations with light, knowledge, and uplift 

from sin and death conditions. 

It was while He was thus preaching that some deeply 
earnest ones brought to Him a palsied man for healing. 
Unable to come into the house or its court because of the 
throng, they removed some of the tiling stones of the 
roof, and lowered the sick man into the presence of the 
preaching Savior. Such implicit faith, manifested by 
such heroic effort, could not fail to be appreciated by the 
Redeemer. 

But the unexpected happened. Instead of healing the 
man of his disease, Jesus exclaimed, "Thy sins are forgiven 
thee." Under God's arrangement with the Jews, 



under their special Law Covenant, original sin was typically 
atoned for by the typical sacrifices, and the people 
were held to account for their own transgressions of the 
Law. Hence, amongst the Jews, serious sickness implied 
serious sins. Thus Jesus on another occasion said to one 
of those whom He healed, "Thy sins, which are many, are 
forgiven thee. Go and sin no more lest a worse thing 
come upon thee." 

We are not to forget that such special dealings were 
with the Jews only— that they never applied to Gentiles 
nor to Christians, although it is quite true that certain 
ailments, such as syphilis, appear very generally to follow 
the transgressors of Nature's laws, whether they be Jews 
or Gentiles. The point we make is that God has no such 
Covenant with the Church, nor with the world in general 
today. Hence, the righteous are often sick, and the sinners 
healthy. 

"WHO CAN FORGIVE SINS?" 

When Jesus declared the sins of the palsied Jew forgiven, 
some of the audience declared that such language 
was blasphemy— that Jesus was arrogating to Himself 
a power which belonged to God alone. They did not stop 
to consider that if He were indeed the Messiah, the Redeemer, 
it would imply that He would possess the authority 
to cancel the sins from which He was redeeming men. 
Perceiving their thoughts, and knowing that thus they 
might stumble over a great truth to their injury, Jesus in 
a few words clarified the matter, saying to them, Which 
do you consider the easier, to tell a man that his sins are 
forgiven, or to heal him? He well knew that they would 
say that the healing was the more difficult, and, therefore, 
if Jesus were able to heal the man, there would be no 
reason why He should say, "Thy sins be forgiven thee," 
if He had not the power to forgive sins. In proof of this, 
He said to the palsied man whose sins he had forgiven, 
"Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house." Immediately 
the man was healed, and departed carrying his 
bedding. The people made way for him, and with amazement 
glorified God, saying, Who ever saw the like! 

AUTHORITY TO FORGIVE SINS 

There are certain great basic principles relating to 
God's dealings with humanity which should be recognized. 
Jehovah's Government is based, not upon mercy, but upon 
Justice; as we read, "Justice is the foundation of Thy 
Throne." In one sense of the word Divine Justice never 
forgives and never can do so, as we will explain. We 
read, "All His work is perfect." It is the Divine method 
that every creature of God shall be so perfect as to need 
no forgiveness, no allowance. The angels were created 
perfect, hence there was no need to provide forgiveness 
for them, because there would be no excuse for their 
sinning. Likewise man was thus created perfect, in the 



image and likeness of the Creator, and was without excuse, 
and therefore needed no provision for mercy so 
long as he was in relation with his God. 
When temptation came, man fell from obedience into 

R4981 : page 71 

sin, and from Divine favor and life into disfavor and 
under the death sentence. He was without excuse and 
Justice made no provision. But another feature of the 
Divine character, Love, while not in control, was brought 
into exercise for man's relief. But Divine Love or Mercy 
could not override or interfere with Divine Justice. In 
other words, God could not forgive a sinner whom He 
had sentenced to death. What He could do, and did do, 
was to provide in due time for man's redemption. All of 
Divine Mercy, therefore, flows through the channel of 
Redemption. 

Applying this principle to our Savior and to His 
teachings, we ask, How could He forgive sins when Divine 
Justice could not forgive sins, nor set aside the penalty 
of sin? The answer is, Jesus was the representative 
of Divine Mercy, and was at that time amongst men for 
the purpose of giving His life as a sacrifice on man's account, 
and therefore to Him belonged the distinctive 
honor of forgiving sins. But someone answers that Jesus 
had not yet died for man's sins, that He had not yet risen 
for man's justification, that He had not even appeared in 
the presence of God for the "household of faith." 

We answer that while it is true that he had not accomplished 
this work, and indeed has not yet fully accomplished 
His work (as the Redeemer and Restorer of men), 
nevertheless, He had begun the work, He had presented 
Himself as man's Atonement price at Jordan, at the time 
of His baptism. According to the Scriptures and the 
type, He at that moment surrendered His earthly all on 
man's behalf. 

However, His surrender of His all did not give Him 
the authority to forgive sins. It was the heavenly 
Father's acceptance of His consecration— Divine acceptance 
of Jesus' sacrifice that counted. God's acceptance 
of Jesus' sacrifice was manifested in His impartation of 
the Holy Spirit, which lighted upon Jesus like a dove, as 
was testified by John the Baptist, and also testified by 
Divine power which thereafter operated in and through 
Jesus for the healing of diseases. We see, then, that our 
Lord's words to the palsied man, "Thy sins be forgiven 
thee," were justified by the fact that He was in the position 
of making satisfaction for the sins of the whole 
world, and that the Father had already indicated the acceptance 
of the sacrifice which was then in process. 

"BLESS THE LORD, O MY SOUL" 

The text for this study comes from the Psalms, and is 
most interesting. The Prophet David may have appropriated 



the words to himself as a Jew, and may have 

thought of his own physical healing and blessing as evidences 

of the Lord's favor under the Law Covenant. But 

the prophetic application of this Psalm to spiritual Israel 

is still more interesting. The spiritual Israelites are New 

Creatures, and have this treasure in earthen vessels. 

With these it is the New Creature that recognizes his 
healing, his forgiveness, his reconciliation to God; and, 
according to God's promise, all things are working together 
for good to him, because he loves God and has 
been called according to the Divine purpose. Continually 
the New Creature has cause to exclaim, "Bless the Lord, 
O my soul, and forget not all His benefits, who forgiveth 
all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diseases!" St. 
Paul, carrying out this same thought, declared that the 
great Redeemer will ultimately present His Church before 
the Father faultless and perfect in love— "sown in weakness, 
raised in power; sown in dishonor, raised in glory; 
sown an animal body, raised a spirit body." We shall 
be like Him and see Him as He is and share His glory.

SOME INTERESTING LETTERS 
TOWER ARTICLE ON JUDAS HAD HAPPY EFFECT 

DEAR PASTOR AND BROTHER:- 

I write to say that I took the Vow on November 14 last, 
and request an interest in your prayers on my behalf, that I 
may be assisted in the keeping of it. Well I know that it is 
not only in the making of vows to the Lord that we are assisted 
and blessed, but in the paying of them. 

I have hesitated for a long time in taking the Vow, more 
because I thought it was too much for me than anything else; 
but the Lord has shown me there is nothing more in the Vow 
than is included in Romans 12:1,2. 

So after reading your article in THE TOWER, under the 
heading, "Was Judas a Hypocrite?" in the November 1 
issue, I decided quickly on binding the sacrifice to the altar. 

I might say in closing that the Lord continues to bless me 
richly through your writings. When I got the Truth I was 
a member of the Salvation Army, and much taken up with 
the "doctrines of demons." So you can see the great darkness 
I was in, and the many pleasant surprises the Lord had 
in store for me. Truly it was "good tidings of great joy" 
to me (and it shall be to all people). It is my earnest desire 
that I shall always be faithful to the dear Lord and appreciate 
more and more the channel He is using in bringing to 
the Household of Faith the "meat in due season." 

My prayer for you is that the Lord may ever be with you 
to comfort you under every discouragement, and to enlighten 
your mind more and more, and to strengthen you for the 
work He has given you to do. With much Christian love, I 



remain 
Your brother in Christ, DAVID STRATTON.-NJ. 



"PROCRASTINATION THE THIEF OF TIME" 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

In so many instances the Truth friends come to the 
meetings, either just at the opening hour, or after service 
has commenced, that it seems to me something might well be 
written on the subject, tending to correct this tardiness. The 
meeting is disturbed more or less by the late arrivals, who 
in most instances could just as well be present before the meeting 
begins. They make sufficient haste to get to the meetings 
on time, but they do not start this hurry early enough to be on 
time. 

Many deplore their inability to better serve the Lord and 
His Truth. They say, "I would like to do something for the 
Lord, but have no talent, or no opportunity for service." 
Bless their hearts! They could readily manifest a greater degree 
of zeal by being at the meeting thirty minutes before the 
opening hour, thus showing their love for the brethren and 
their appreciation of Christian fellowship. 

Perhaps in no other way could they so effectually indicate 
their desire to be of service to God. They are neglecting a 
golden opportunity, it seems to me. The natural disposition is 
to take the last possible street car that would bring one to 
the meeting in time to be at its opening, whereas we should 
surely seek to go on the earliest car possible. 

The fellowship of the saints is ofttimes worth more than 
what we get from the class lesson. This should prompt us 
all to be half an hour ahead of time rather than even one 
minute late. 

Should we not resist the temptation to be late in starting 
to meetings quite as much as the temptation to negligence in 
other respects? 

Your brother in the love and service of the Lord, 
J. A. BOHNET. 



WATCH TOWER BIBLE & TRACT SOCIETY:- 

The postal I mailed you brought in return mail the 
desired literature. Thank you. I have read and have 
made the Truth my own. And now I desire to co-operate 
in spreading the good tidings to others. Please advise how 
I may do this to the best advantage. I desire to meet all 
the expense incident to the distribution of literature, which 
I shall do myself. 

I enclose a dollar for The Watch Tower, which I desire 
to have regularly. 

May the Lord continue to bless you in your labor of 
love. 

With earnest prayers, S. L. DAVIS.— Pa.

"MILLENNIAL BEAN" SEED SUPPLY EXHAUSTED 

The requests for five of the prolific beans for seed by far 
exceed the supply donated by Sister Smith. We have filled 
the orders first received. 

In reply to various inquiries from those who requested 
these seed beans, we are informed by Sister Smith that there 
are advantages in planting them in an onion bed or row— 
at a distance of six feet. An insect, which proves destructive 
to the bean plant, seems to dislike the onions, and is thus 
kept away. After the onions are harvested, the beans grow 
very fast, if the ground is kept loose on the surface. It is 
also suggested that great care should be exercised in gathering 
the pods, not to injure the bushes, by pulling, or breaking 
off the leaves. If the first crop of beans is allowed to remain 
on the bushes until fully ripened, there will be no additional 
yield and the bush will die. If they are to bear repeatedly, 
the pods must be removed as soon as large enough 
to eat, we are told, and then new blossoms take the place 
of the first crop.

THE GOSPEL ST. PAUL PREACHED 

"For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ; for it is the 
power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to 
the Jew first, and also to the Greek."— Rom. 1:16. 



THERE ARE MANY religions, and it is a 

mistake that we have perhaps said in the 

past that there is no religion but one. A 

religion would properly be considered "Any 

system of worship by which any people 

recognize the Almighty and seek to do Him 

honor." We are, therefore, to recognize 

the various great religions that are in the 

world in the sense that we could not properly 

ignore them. We have, for instance, 

the Confucian teaching, the Brahmin teaching, the Buddhist 

teaching, the Mohammedan teaching, the Jewish 

teaching and the Christian teaching. These all present 

themselves to us as religious teachings. They all believe 

themselves more or less rational; they all believe themselves 

more or less reasonable. Every man tries to think 

that his own theory on any matter is a reasonable theory; 

and he is proper in so doing. 

In harmony with our text, we propose to compare the 
religion of Jesus with all other religions. In the beginning, 
we state with the Apostle, "I am not ashamed of 
the Gospel of Christ." Whatever may be said of other 
gospels, we believe, as Christians, that in the Christian 
religion we have that of which no man need be ashamed. 
There may perhaps be certain features and forms of 
certain creeds of which we might be ashamed— that do 
not come up to our highest ideals. But the Christian 
religion, as presented in the Word of God, should be the 
Standard of Christendom; and of that we are not ashamed. 
It will compare with all other religions in the world, and 
come off victorious, in every sense of the word. All of 
these various religions seem to recognize that man is in 
an imperfect, unsatisfactory, sinful condition; therefore, 
each of these religions seeks to present certain tenets, 
or teachings, that will help man up out of his imperfect 
condition, back into harmony with his God. 

A COMPARISON OF RELIGIONS 

If we consider the teachings of the Mohammedans, we 
find that they have certain qualities which are very advantageous, 
and other qualities which we could not so 
highly commend. Their endeavor is not to do injury, 
but to make man better. Their theory is that mankind 
are fallen and need lifting up out of their fallen condition. 
The same may be said of the teachings of the 
Brahmin, the Confucianist and the Buddhist. They are 
all more or less presentations of what are supposed to 
be cures for man's fallen condition, cures for his unsatisfactory 
attitude. 

Some of these religions pronounce one kind of a 
penalty for those who will not accept them, and others 
declare other kinds. Some offer one kind of reward for 
those who accept and follow their teachings, while others 
offer other kinds of rewards. But all agree that man 
needs to be elevated and lifted up out of his fallen condition, 



which is sinful and unsatisfactory. There seems 

to be in every man, naturally, without any education on 

the subject, something which tells him that he is not perfect; 

that he is not in full accord with his own conscience, 

not in accord with his own highest ideals of the 

Divine mind. 

All religions, therefore, recognize this principle of sin 
and propose remedies therefor. We see the evidence of 
this as manifested in their disciples everywhere. Many 
seek to crucify the flesh in one form or another— some 
by flagellations, some by restraints upon the various liberties 
of life, some by holding their hands in the air for 
days, seeking to become holy and thus appease their god. 

But none of these things, in the light of the Gospel 
of Christ, seem to be the highest and noblest ideals. 
Doubtless all have done some good and uplifted some 
men out of the degradation in which they were. Mankind 
might have been worse off if it had not been for these 
religions. 

But now, if we compare these with the religion of 
Jesus Christ, we believe everything is to be said in favor 
of the religion of Christ. In the first place, all these 
religions more or less resemble the Jewish religion, which 
is of God, and hence all these religions are more or less 
in harmony with God's proposition. 

God's proposition to the Jews was, "Do these things 
and ye shall live," have everlasting life. That was the 
Covenant made by God with them at Mount Sinai, at the 
hands of Moses. They thought at first that they would 
surely be lifted up out of sin, because God had given 
them a Law, and by keeping it they would be perfect and 
be brought into harmony with God. In this they were 
mistaken, for, as they found out, as the centuries passed, 
none of them were able to keep the Law, because it is 
the measure of a perfect man's ability; and none of them 
could measure up to the perfect man. 

Israel found, therefore, as the Apostle states it, that 
"by the deeds of the Law shall no flesh be justified in 
God's sight." And they found also that the Law, instead 

R4982 : page 76 

of perfecting, justifying them, and giving them 

eternal life, brought to them a greater realization of sin 

than they ever had before. And this was the real blessing 

of the Law Covenant— it showed them their sinful condition 

and their inability to lift themselves out of it. 

But the Jews do not recognize that great fact today, for 

if they did they would be crying to God for mercy instead 

of hoping to keep the Law and thus justify 

themselves. 

The same thing might be said to be true of all the 
heathen religions. All offer help by which mankind may 
make themselves perfect, but none are able to make themselves 
perfect, and they all realize that they are sinners 
and imperfect to the last degree. There is, therefore, 



nothing that is logical in any of these religions, because 
they all start out to claim that a man ought to be perfect, 
ought to be holy, and are agreed that he is not. As 
before called attention to this agrees with the words of 
God with respect to Israel, "By the deeds of the Law 
shall no flesh be justified in His sight." God's Word 
agrees with all of these— that man is a sinner, that he 
cannot do the things that he would, that his ideals are 
to be and are higher than his capacity and ability. And 
so St. Paul declares, "We cannot do the things which 
we would." 

ALL THE RACE SOLD UNDER SIN 

Christianity answers that the reason is that we are 
fallen creatures, sold under sin. Who sold us, when and 
where? The Bible answers that "By one man's disobedience 
sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and 
so death passed upon all men." Death has passed upon 
the entire race and thus impoverished it mentally, morally 
and physically, so that now, because of the fall, we 
cannot do the things which we would like to do. 

The Bible tells us that originally Adam was not in 
our condition, but was perfect and could keep the Divine 
Law perfectly, but that "we are sold under sin." And 
so the Prophet David expresses the same thought, "Behold, 
I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother 
conceive me." So we behold that we are a race of sinners, 
imperfect mentally, morally and physically, and 
therefore unable to keep the Divine standard or Law. 
What, then, does Christianity offer us that no other religion 
offers us? Christianity offers us a Savior, and no 
other religion offers a Savior. 

Christianity recognizes that the condition came about 
by the disobedience of one man, Adam, and it sets forth 
Jesus as the One who redeems man from that death sentence 
that came upon our first parents: "As by a man 
came death, by a man comes also the resurrection of the 
dead"; "For as all in Adam die, even so all in Christ 
shall be made alive," writes St. Paul— "every man in his 
own order." Here, then, Christianity has a logical superiority, 
in that it provides for a satisfaction of Divine 
Justice. 

All religions say that it is Divine Justice that is opposed 
to sin, but Christianity offers a satisfaction for 
Divine Justice. "Christ died for our sins"; "He gave 
Himself a Ransom for all"; "He is the propitiation [satisfaction] 
for our sins, and not for ours only, but also 
for the sins of the whole world," writes the Apostle. So, 
then, Christianity is not only more logical, but is more 
just— it recognizes Divine Justice. 

We must recognize that if God condemned the world 
understandingly and truly, as the Great Judge of mankind, 
there must be some satisfaction of Justice ere the 
Chief Justice of the Universe could set aside the penalty 
and release the culprit. Man has sinned and the great 



Chief Justice has passed the sentence, and there is no 
way to revoke that sentence, except by meeting it. And 
so Christianity sets forth that our Lord Jesus came into 
the world to meet the penalty, and that He, "by the grace 
of God, tasted death for every man."— Heb. 2:9. 

Christianity has another superiority over all other religions, 
and it is this: it recognizes a love and compassion 
upon the part of God that no other religion recognizes. 
All these religions do recognize a God, and we claim it 
makes very little difference whether they call Him Allah, 
or Jehovah, or some other name. They recognize, we 
believe, the same, one God, but they do not recognize His 
real traits of character. They perceive His Justice, and 
their own transgressions of Divine Justice, but they do 
not see the merciful provision that God has made. Their 
God is represented by the Chinese idol, which pictures to 
them the character of God. 

We remember a Chinese banner we once saw. The 
figure on this banner represented a very demon-like character, 
and lightning was represented as flashing from his 
closed fist. He was a god to be feared, one who would 
take vengeance upon them. 

THE GOD OF THE BIBLE IS THE GOD OF ALL GRACE 

The God of the Bible, however, while just, is not a 
vengeful God, not unkind; but, on the contrary, He is 
the God of All Grace, the Father of Mercies, from whom 
cometh every good and perfect gift. And the great Gift 
that He gave is the greatest of all gifts, the Gift of His 
Son, for man's sin, that thus He might offer a satisfaction 
to His own Justice. Nor was this arbitrarily at the 
expense of, or contrary to the will of the Redeemer; because 
the Scriptures make clear that it was by virtue of 
the "prize" set before our Lord; as we read, "For the 
joy that was set before Him, He endured the cross, despising 
the shame."— Heb. 12:2. 

This love of God is not content with merely the provision 
of the Savior, and the arrangement that if anybody 
shall hear and believe he shall be blessed; but this love 
of God proposes to go still further, namely, that He who 
thus redeems the race shall become the King of earth; 
and His scepter, His rule, shall be "from sea to sea, and 
from the river to the ends of the earth," until "every 
knee shall bow and every tongue confess" to the glory 
of God; and "the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the 
whole earth as the waters cover the great deep." Thus 
every creature shall come to know that there is a God, 
and that the way He proposes to be just and merciful 
is through His Son, who is to be the great Deliverer of 
the race. 

In what way will this great Deliverer come? This is 
a part of the Gospel, a part of the "good tidings." It 
will be through His great Kingdom, which He will set 
up in His own due time. His Kingdom will not be merely 
for the rich or powerful, but for the poor also: "He shall 



lift up the poor from the dunghill," is a part of the 
prophecy. His power and influence will be the great 
moving principle that will level the whole world of mankind. 
As the Scriptures declare, all men are on a common 
level before God, for all have sinned and come short 
of the glory of God, and all are recipients of Divine 
mercy. 

The blessing of the Lord will be that all may come 
back; and when thus brought back to all that was lost 
in Adam and redeemed by Christ, they will be able to 
keep the Divine Law perfectly, and will therefore to all 
eternity be in covenant-relationship with God. For those 
who refuse to enjoy that blessing prepared for them, the 
Scriptures clearly declare that God has provided the 

R4982 : page 77 

Second Death— not a place of torment— "The soul that 
sinneth it shall die"; "The wages of sin is death." 

"THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD" 

"But," someone may say, "what about the Church? 
You have been speaking about the world and what Jesus 
will do for it; what about the Church?" Those of us 
who have experienced this Salvation know that as a 
power it has not lifted us physically to perfection, but 
it has a power that has come into our hearts, into our 
minds, through faith, transforming, renewing us— our 
minds, our wills. The Lord's true people were once aliens, 
strangers and foreigners to the Lord, but by a knowledge 
of the Savior have become transformed in their lives, 
so that now they are seeking to walk, not after the flesh, 
but after the spirit, the spirit or mind of God, the Divine 
will. 

Here we see the difference between the Jew under his 
Covenant of Law and the Christian under the higher 
Covenant that the Lord has made at the present time. 
The Apostle said that the Jew could not do the things 
that he would; but he declares equally strongly that "the 
righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in us, who walk not 
after the flesh, but after the Spirit."— Rom. 8:1. 

How is this possible? Are we better than the Jews? 
Are we of less fallen nature than the Jews, or made 
perfect? Nay, verily. The Apostle explains that for the 
class called out during this Gospel Age there is a special 
arrangement in operation, and God deals with these according 
to their minds, their wills, their intentions, so 
that under this Covenant of Grace we are counted as 
fully keeping the Divine Law— the righteousness, the full 
meaning of the Law, is fulfilled in us who are walking 
not after the flesh but after the spirit— not up to the 
spirit, but after the spirit. 

But how could we be fully justified if not able to 
walk up to the spirit? The answer is that the blood 
cleanses us and commutes our sins; Christ imputes His 



perfection and righteousness to us, so that our best endeavors 
are accepted in Jehovah's sight as perfect, for 
we are justified, not according to the flesh, but according 
to the spirit. 

Another way in which the Gospel of Christ is superior 
to all others is that this Gospel is world-wide. No other 
Gospel of which we have knowledge is world-wide. The 
Gospel of the Son of God is that "Jesus Christ, by the 
grace of God, tasted death for every man," rich and poor, 
Jew and Gentile, every nation and people and kindred 
and tongue. "There's a wideness in God's mercy like 
the wideness of the sea." We know of no other religion 
that is so unbiased, that recognizes no national lines, that 
has the thought that we are one race, which sprang from 
one man, condemned through one man, and redeemed 
through the Man Christ Jesus, and that all are to have 
a blessing— no other religion under the sun! 

The religion of Christ, of which we are not ashamed, 
is best in this, that it is the most God-like religion, because 
of its breadth, because of its justice, because of its 
impartiality, because of its love, its goodness and merciful 
qualities. It shows forth, as does no other religion, the 
Justice, Wisdom, Love and Power of Jehovah, our God. 
To Him be glory and honor and dominion forever! 



R4983 : page 77 

THE PRAYERS OF THE NEW CREATION 

PRAYER TO GOD, communion with Him, 

is a great privilege and an evidence of His 

favor. God does not grant us this privilege, 

however, in order that He might be 

informed of our desires, for since we are 

imperfect ourselves our desires cannot be 

perfect: "We know not what things to 

ask for as we ought;" and He does for 

us better than we know how to ask or think. 

Nor does God permit us to pray to Him 

that we may inform Him regarding matters here; for He 

knoweth the end from the beginning, as well as every 

intervening step. But He has instituted prayer for our 

benefit and comfort and instruction. 

The object of prayer is to bring the heart and the 
mind of the child of God into contact with the heart of 
God, that he may be enabled thus most fully to realize 
the Fatherhood of God, His love and His deep interest in 
every item of our welfare; that in deep affliction we may 
unburden our hearts to God and thus have forcibly 
brought to our attention His love and care and wisdom— 
for our encouragement, not His; for our strengthening, 
not His, and for our joy. 

This opportunity is not for us to instruct Jehovah 
how to arrange matters for the best, but to bring our 



hearts to realize Him as the Center of wisdom and power, 
that having unburdened our hearts, we may be prepared 
to listen for His answer and advice through His Word. 
And he whose knowledge of prayer is confined to the 
meager information he has imparted to God with "much 
speaking," and who has never learned to listen for the 
answer to his prayer from the Word of God, has, as yet, 
measurably failed to appreciate the object of prayer. 

Earnestness in God's service will bring His children 
to Him frequently, to realize at His feet His sympathy 
with them in the difficulties, discouragements and trials 
of life, as well as to ask His guidance and overruling of 
every affair of life, and through His Word to hearken 
to His wisdom, which will enable them to serve Him 
acceptably. 

The province of prayer is to ask for only such things 
as God has already declared Himself well pleased to 
grant. And while we may freely speak to Him as a 
Father, and tell Him how we understand His Word, and 
the confidence and trust we have in its ultimate fulfilment, 
yet we must not only avoid telling the Lord of our will 
and our plans, and what we would like, but we must avoid 
and put far from us any such spirit, and must recognize, 
and bring ourselves into full accord with His will and His 
plan for accomplishing it. If this thought were appreciated, 
it would cut short some of the "long prayers," 
"much speaking," and "vain repetitions" by which some 
endeavor to instruct the Lord in their wishes regarding 
every matter under heaven. It would send them speedily 
to the Word of God to search diligently the Plan of God 
that they might labor as well as pray in harmony with it. 

While assuring us that the Father cares for us, and 
is well pleased to have us come to Him with sincere 
hearts, the Master informs us of the conditions upon 
which we may expect an answer. He says, "If ye abide 
in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye 
will, and it shall be done unto you."— John 15:7. 

"ABIDE IN ME" 

The conditions of the above statement, or promise, are 
two; the first is, abiding in Christ. But what is it to 
abide in Christ? Only those can abide in Christ who are 
in Christ, who have come into Him by faith, repentance 

R4983 : page 78 

and consecration; and to abide in Him means that the 
faith will abide, the repentance for sin and the opposition 
to it will abide, and the consecration to the Lord and His 
service will abide, and it will be manifest that our will 
has been wholly consecrated— swallowed up in the will of 
Christ. 

The other condition is also a weighty one: "If My 
Word abide in you." Ah! how evident it is that our Lord 
meant to associate Himself and His Word, the Scriptures, 



in the minds, in the hearts, in the lives of all who are 
truly His! They must search the Scriptures to know the 
will of the Lord; to know what He has promised and 
what He has not promised; to know what they may ask 
and what they may not ask; and, ascertaining these, one 
fully consecrated— one controlled entirely by the will of 
God— will not want to be, to have, or to do anything except 
that which will be pleasing to the Lord in respect to 
himself. 

When this position has been reached, the will of Christ 
governing him, the words of Christ abiding in him, we 
can readily see that whatever would be asked by one thus 
well informed with respect to the Divine promises and 
fully submissive to the Divine will would be things which 
the Father would be pleased to grant in answer to his 
requests. 

These requests would probably be as simple as was 
the Master's petition when He prayed, "Not My will, but 
Thine, be done!" (Luke 22:42.) In such a condition 
prayers are always answered; but in such a condition the 
prayers would be very modest. One's prayers under such 
circumstances would be more a thanksgiving for blessings, 
an expression of confidence and trust, and the committal 
of his way unto the Lord, confidently realizing the 
promise that to him under such conditions, all things 
(even seeming disasters and troubles) shall work together 
for good. Hence, whatever came, such a one 
could realize his prayer answered. He could rejoice evermore 
because he is prepared to rejoice in tribulation as 
well as in prosperity, in the path of service. He has no 
will to oppose whatever God permits, knowing that it will 
work out good. 

Such, amongst the Lord's people, could not pray that 
their own will be done; for they have no will except 
God's. Those who abide in Christ, and in whom His 
Word abides, can pray for their enemies and those who 
despitefully use them and persecute them, though they 
cannot pray God to open the blinded eyes of their enemies 
at once, nor in their way. Realizing from the indwelling 
Word of God's promise that the blinded eyes shall all be 
opened to the Truth, they can abide His time. Going to 
God in prayer they may express their forgiveness of their 
persecutor, their interest in him, and their patient waiting 
for the day when "the knowledge of the Lord shall fill 
the whole earth as the waters cover the sea"— ocean deep 
—and His will shall be done on earth even as it is done 
in heaven.— Isa. 11:9. 

ANSWERS OFTEN DELAYED 

The answer to our prayer is not always granted immediately; 
but after we have made sure that our requests 
are in accord with the promises, those things which lie 
very close to our hearts become our continual prayer, associating 
in our minds with all of life's duties and interests, 
the heart gravitating continually toward the thing 



we have desired of the Lord, and on suitable opportunities 
repeating to Him the request. This is the kind of 
prayer which the Lord commended, saying, "Men ought 
always to pray and not to faint." (Luke 18:1.) The 
Lord's people ought to continue asking for the right things 
with some degree of persistency, and should not grow 
weary, hopeless, faithless, faint in their hearts. 

Doubtless there are many reasons why the Lord does 
not promptly grant all of our requests which are in accordance 
with His will, in harmony with His Word. We 
may not know all of these reasons; but some of them are 
apparent. Undoubtedly one reason for the Lord's delay 
in answering us is often to test the strength and the depth 
of our desires for the good things that we request of 
Him. 

For instance, He informs us that He is more willing 
to give His Holy Spirit to us who ask than are earthly 
parents to give good things to their children. Yet the 
giving of His Holy Spirit is a gradual process; and we 
are enabled to receive it only in proportion as we are 
emptied of the worldly or selfish spirit. It requires time 
to become thus emptied of self and prepared for the mind 
of Christ; in some it requires longer for this than in 
others; but all need emptying in order to receive the 
refilling. 

He that seeketh findeth, but the more he seeketh the 
more he findeth; to him that knocketh it shall be opened, 
but his continual knocking and his increasing interest in 
the knocking means his increasing desire to enter, so that 
as the door of privilege, of opportunity, swings slowly 
open before him, his courage and his strength increase 
as he seeks to avail himself of the opening. Thus every 
way the blessing is greater than if the Lord were to 
answer the petitions hastily. 

We are to think of our Heavenly Father as rich and 
benevolent, kind and generous, yet wise as well as loving. 
We are to suppose that He will have pleasure in giving 
us the desires of our hearts if those desires are in harmony 
with His plan, which He has already framed on 
such lines as to include not only our very highest and 
best interests, but the highest and best interests of all 
His creatures. Then, whatever comes, His well-informed 
children can have all the desires of their hearts, because 
their hearts are in full accord with the Lord; and they 
desire nothing of the Lord except the good things of 
His purpose and promise. 

"DESIRE, UTTERED OR UNEXPRESSED" 

When thus considered, not as a begging arrangement, 
nor as an occasion of instructing the Lord as to our wills, 
but as a season of union and communion of heart with 

R4984 : page 78 

the Father, in which we may relieve our burdened or perplexed 



hearts and realize Divine sympathy, calling to mind 

Divine promises, reviewing Divine care, and expressing 

our confidence in God's many promises, thus bringing 

those promises afresh and close to our hearts, as though 

God now audibly uttered them in our hearing— thus considered, 

how proper, yea, how necessary is prayer to the 

true child of God! He cannot live without it. To break 

off this communion would be like stripping a tree of its 

leaves; their removal would stunt and hinder its 

development. 

But to suppose that Christian life depends solely upon 
prayer without earnest study of God's Word, is like supposing 
that a tree could flourish from its leaves only, 
without roots and soil. Both are needful. As good soil 
and roots will produce leaves and fruitage, so, likewise, 
the promises of God's Word absorbed by us will naturally 
lead to good works and to communion with God in prayer, 
without which the fruits of the Spirit would soon wither 
and disappear. 

No wonder, then, that Jesus both by precept and by 
example said, "Watch and pray" (Matt. 26:41), uniting 
the conditions necessary to our development. Some pray 

R4984 : page 79 

and neglect to watch; others watch and neglect to pray. 
Both these errors are serious; and it is not possible for 
us to decide which is the more serious neglect, since either 
would work disastrous loss of the great "prize" for which 
we are running. 

Nowhere is prayer defined as a duty, though its necessity 
is stated. The Father desireth such to worship 
Him as worship Him in spirit and in truth (John 4:23); 
and it would be contrary to this principle to define prayer 
as a duty, and to stipulate a set time or place or a formal 
manner. The earnestness of the service and the peculiarity 
of the circumstance will regulate the frequency and 
the subject matter of prayer. 

No form of prayer is furnished in the Scriptures. 
Even the Master, when asked by the disciples for instruction 
on the subject, gave them, not a form to repeat, but 
merely an idea or example of how to arrange their prayers 
to God. He did not say, Pray this prayer, but, "After 
this manner pray ye." Our prayers, then, should be after 
this manner— not an assortment of extravagant demands, 
but the simple expression of the earnest heart: first, 
acknowledging and paying homage to God as our Father, 
the Almighty and Hallowed One; second, expressing our 
expectation and trust that His Kingdom is coming according 
to promise, and our eagerness for it, and for the 
time when His will shall be done on earth as in Heaven; 
third, our reliance upon Him for "daily bread," which 
He has promised us; fourth, our acknowledgment that 
our ways are not perfect and of our reliance upon His 
favor (granted through Christ Jesus) for forgiveness; 
and our willingness to exercise forgiveness toward our 



debtors, toward those who trespass against us. 

"OUR FATHER, WHICH ART IN HEAVEN" 

The term, "Our Father," is one of special endearment. 
The affection of a true father for his child, being one of 
the most precious in the world, is used to illustrate the 
relationship of the Lord's consecrated members to the 
Creator. It is necessary to be some time in the School 
of Christ as disciples, learners, before we are able properly 
to appreciate the meaning of this word "Father" as 
applied to God; but the more we come to know of the love 
of God, which passes all understanding, and the more 
we are enabled to draw near to Him through faith and 
obedience, the more precious will this term Father become. 

"Hallowed be Thy name," expresses adoration, appreciation 
of Divine goodness and greatness, and a corresponding 
reverence. In addressing our petition to the 
Lord our first thought is to be, not a selfish one respecting 
ourselves, nor respecting the interests of others precious 
to us; but God is to be first in all of our thoughts 
and aims and calculations. We are to pray for nothing 
that would not be in accord with the honor of our Heavenly 
Father's Name; we are to wish for nothing for 
ourselves or for our dear ones that He would not fully 
approve and commission us to pray for. 

Perhaps no quality of heart is in more danger of being 
blotted out amongst professing Christians today than this 
thought of reverence for God. However much we have 
grown in knowledge, and however much we have gotten 
free from superstitions and errors, and however advanced 
in some respects is the Christian's position of today over 
that of a century ago, we fear that reverence has been 
losing ground, not only in the nominal church, but with 
many of the members of the one "Church of the Firstborn, 
whose names are written in heaven." (Heb. 12:23.) 
Every loss of reverence is a distinct disadvantage, both 
to the Church and to the world, paving the way to various 
evils, and ultimately to anarchy. 

As God and His glory and honor are to be first in the 
minds of His children, so their next thought should be 
for the coming glorious Kingdom, which He has promised 
shall bless the world. However much our own personal 
interests and affairs may be pressing upon us, and however 
much we may desire to have the Lord's blessing and 
guidance in them, they are not to outrank our appreciation 
of His beneficent arrangements which He has so 
clearly promised in His Word. We are to remember that 
the Kingdom, when it shall come, will be a panacea for 
every ill and every trouble, not only for us, but for the 
whole world of mankind. We are not, therefore, to permit 
our own personal needs to be too prominent, but are 
to remember that the whole creation is groaning and travailing 
in pain together, waiting for this glorious Kingdom 
and the blessing upon all the families of the earth, which 
our Heavenly Father has promised shall yet come through 



the Seed of Abraham. 

This thought respecting the Kingdom, its necessity, 
and the blessings that it will bring will keep prominently 
before our minds our own High Calling to joint-heirship 
with our Lord in this Kingdom. And in proportion as 
that hope is clearly before our minds it will be, as the 
Apostle explains, as "an anchor of the soul, both sure 
and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the 
veil. "--Heb. 6:19. 

This anchorage of hope in the future, in the Kingdom, 
will enable us to pass safely, and with comparative quiet, 
through the trials and storms and difficulties of this present 
evil world. More than this, our thoughts respecting 
the Kingdom will remind us that if we are to be heirs 
of the Kingdom it will be necessary that we have the appropriate 
discipline and training now. This thought in 
turn will make all the afflictions and trials of this present 
time seem to us light afflictions; for we know that they 
are working out for us a far more exceeding and eternal 
weight of glory. Thus the very offering of this prayer 
in its proper order will bring us a measure of relief from 
our perplexities, trials and disappointments before we 
reach the appropriate place to mention them at the Throne 
of grace. 

"THY WILL BE DONE ON EARTH" 

This petition offered from the heart implies that the 
one offering it has made a full consecration of his will, 
his heart, to the Lord; and that as he hopes for the 
Kingdom by and by to come and subdue all unrighteousness 
and to establish the Divine will from sea to sea, and 
from pole to pole, so now, the petitioner, being in accord 
with the Lord's will, and thus wishing that it might be 
universally in control, will see to it that this will is ruling 
in his own heart; that in his own affairs God's will is 
done to the best of his ability in his earthly condition, 
even as he hopes to have it perfected in the Kingdom 
soon to be established. 

No one can intelligently and honestly offer this petition, 
unless he both desires and endeavors to have the 
Lord's will done in himself while on earth. Thus a blessing 
comes to the one who offers this petition before he has 
asked any special blessing upon himself or others. The 
mere thought of the Divine arrangement brings a blessing, 
a peace, a rest, a satisfaction of heart. 

"GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD" 

The thought in this petition seems to be that of continual 
dependence upon the Lord, day by day, for the things 
needed— accepting for each day the Lord's providential 
care and direction of our affairs. Daily bread should 
here be understood in the broad sense of food and raiment 

page 80 



—things necessary. The Lord's people, who recognize 
Him as their Father, must trust Him as children, while 
seeking to use the various instrumentalities and opportunities 
within their reach. They are to provide the 
things necessary for themselves, yet to recognize the 
Divine provision and care which has pre-arranged matters 
so as to make their present conditions and blessings 
attainable. 

Agnosticism and Higher Criticism in general may 
deny, if they please, Divine providence in connection with 
the grains and other supplies for man's necessities; but the 
eye of faith sees behind these supplies the Love, the Wisdom 
and the Power of God, making ready for man's necessities, 
and giving the things necessary in such a manner 
as will be for the advantage of mankind— through sweat 
of face, etc. 

"FORGIVE US OUR SINS" 

To petition the Lord for forgiveness of sins implies 
that we are at heart opposed to sin, and that any sins committed 
have not been wilful; and that the Lord, according 
to His Covenant of grace with us, agrees to accept 
the intentions of our hearts instead of the actual, full, 
complete, perfect obedience to the Divine requirement, 
in thought, in word and in act. This petition, then, signifies 
that we recognize that the Robe of Christ's righteousness 
granted to us has become spotted or sullied; 
and that we desire to be cleansed, so that we may again 
be "without spot or wrinkle or any such thing." This 
cannot refer to wilful sins, for as the Apostle explains, 
"If we sin wilfully, after that we have received the 
knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice 
for sins," and hence, no more a basis for forgiveness; 
and the end of wilful sin is the Second Death. (Heb. 10:26.) 
It is, however, proper to remark that there are 
what might be termed mixed sins— sins in which a measure 
of wilfulness may have combined with a measure 
of ignorance or inherited weakness. 

In the case of such sins the Lord expresses His willingness 
to cancel the wrong upon its being promptly repented 
of; but He reserves to Himself the giving of stripes, or 
chastisements appropriate and necessary to His child as 
an instruction in righteousness and correction of weaknesses, 
etc. 

Happy are they who, with growth in grace and 
knowledge, find their hearts so fully in accord with the 
principles of the Divine arrangement that they will never 
transgress with any measure of wilfulness; but blessed 
also are those who, finding some measure of wilfulness 
in their deflection from the Divine rule, are pained thereby, 
and who, as the Apostle says, are led to discipline or 
correct themselves that they may the more quickly learn 
the lessons, and bring their bodies more completely into 
subjection to the new mind— "I keep under my body and 



bring it into subjection, lest that by any means, when I 
have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway." 
"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be 
judged."--! Cor. 9:27; 11:31. 

"THOSE WHO TRESPASS AGAINST US" 

As we are imperfect and cannot keep the Divine Law, 
so likewise others are imperfect. As the degrees of deflection 
from the Divine Law vary with the degrees of 
the fall, so also we must expect that the trespasses of 
ourselves and others, one against another, will vary, according 
to the natural temperament, weakness, etc. As 
we realize that we have received, and will still need Divine 
compassion and mercy in respect to our shortcomings, 
so the Lord teaches us that we must exercise similar benevolence 
toward our fellow creatures, both in the Church 
and outside. 

Elsewhere He lays down this rule very stringently, 
that if we do not from our heart forgive those trespassing 
against us, neither will our Heavenly Father forgive us 
our trespasses. Thus the Lord would develop in His 
consecrated people the spirit of the Father, even as He 
instructed us, saying, "Be ye perfect, even as your Father 
which is in Heaven is perfect."— Matt. 5:48. 

Perfection is to be the standard. However far short 
of it we may come, we can have no lower standard; and 
in proportion as we are striving for that standard and 
realize our own weaknesses and imperfections, we should 
have proportionate compassion upon fellow creatures and 
their shortcomings toward us. This is love, sympathy, 
compassion; and whoever does not attain this degree of 
love which will have compassion upon others and their 
weaknesses, and which would be ready and glad to forgive 
them, is deficient in love; and whoever does not 
succeed in this matter to the extent of being able to love 
his enemies, so as to even pray for them, that person fails 
to reach the mark of character which the Lord demands, 
and he may be sure that his own deviations from perfect 
rectitude will not be overlooked; for he is lacking in the 
one important quality of love, which covers a multitude 
of sins of every kind. None, surely, will gain a place in 
the Kingdom class, in the Bride class, except those who 
have this forgiving quality, this quality of love. 

"BRING US NOT INTO TEMPTATION" 

We are to remember the words of the Apostle (James 1:13) 
to the effect that God tempteth no man, and are 
to apply this thought to our prayer. So our prayer will 
not signify that we fear that God will tempt us; but that 
we entreat Him that He may guide our steps, our cares 
in life, so that no temptation, no trial, shall come upon us 
that would be too severe for us; that He may bring us 
by a way in which we shall not be tempted above that 
we are able, and provide a way of escape when we are 



sore distressed. The Apostle assures us that this is the 
Divine will; and that such a prayer would be in accordance 
with it. He says that God will not suffer us to be 
tempted above that we are able, but will with every temptation 
provide also a way of escape. The temptations 
are of the Adversary, and of our own fallen natures- 
through our own flesh, and through the weaknesses of 
others. God is not responsible for these; but He is able 
to guide the way of His people that they shall not be 
overwhelmed in these natural difficulties, weaknesses, 
besetments, nor by the wiles of the Adversary. 

"DELIVER US FROM THE EVIL ONE" 

There never was a time when there was greater need 
of this petition than at the present. The Evil One is 
specially seeking to trap and ensnare the Lord's people 
at the present time; and the Scriptures inform us that 
God is permitting this; and that thus He is sending strong 
delusions upon the world and upon the nominal church. 
Our Father is permitting this because the time has come 
for a complete separation of the "wheat" from the "tares." 
He has promised, however, that those who are truly of 
the "wheat" class— the sanctified in Christ Jesus, who are 
seeking to walk in His steps— shall not be stumbled, shall 
never fall, but shall have an abundant entrance ministered 
unto them into the everlasting Kingdom. The question, 
then, is one of loyalty of heart to the Lord. 

The trial of this "day shall try the work of every man 
[in the Church] of what sort it is." This trial will be so 

page 81 

severe that if it were possible the "very elect" would be 
deceived; but this will not be possible; for the Lord will 
specially care for these. Nevertheless, the Lord will be 
inquired of by His people in respect to these matters 
which He has already promised, and as they pray, "Deliver 
us from the Evil One," they surely will labor in the 
same direction. It is our expectation that very shortly 
now the forces of evil will gain much greater strength 
than at present, "with all deceivableness of unrighteousness." 
Meantime the Lord is staying the adverse forces 
that His true people may put on the armor of God and 
be able to stand when the evil day shall come. 



R4984:page81 

THE SCRIPTURAL RULE FOR ADJUSTING MISUNDERSTANDINGS 

WE CANNOT IMAGINE a case in which a 
brother with average intelligence would 
need comfort and counsel in a misunderstanding 
other than that for which the 



Lord has provided in Matt. 18:15-17. If he 

has been in the habit of seeking sympathy 

in a busy-bodying manner, the sooner he 

knows that his course is wrong the better. 

He should learn to use his own mind along 

lines where there is positive instruction in 

the Scriptures. The Lord says to any one who has aught 

against his brother, "Go and tell him his fault between 

thee and him alone." If the matter is too small to mention 

to the brother, it is too small to notice and should 

be forgotten. 

There are no exceptions to the rule laid down in Matt. 18:15-17; 
but there might be, under some circumstances, 
an interpretation of the rule. For instance, if the matter 
were in a family, there might be circumstances in which 
it would be proper to go to the head of the family. If it 
were in an institution, where the individual might be 
merely a representative of the Society, it would be proper 
to go to the head of the Society. Such a course would 
result from following Matt. 18:15, in its logical trend. 
But these are minor applications of the rule, which is 
neither voided nor avoided, but in applying which wisdom 
is being used in determining how the matter may be carried 
out. 

There is no doubt that much of the trouble in the 
world is the result of misunderstanding. It therefore behooves 
every one of the Lord's people to "put on love, 
which is the bond of perfectness," and to overlook much 
of what others do. (Col. 3:14.) And yet it would be 
proper for one who thinks that he has been wronged to 
go to the offending brother and have a clear understanding. 
To do so would result favorably in nearly every 
case. 

The instruction in Matt. 18:15-17 is given, of course, 
only to the brethren, the Church, and is not, therefore, to 
be applied outside. But whoever learns to apply this rule 
to the brethren will find that it commends itself to his 
best judgment as a wise course of conduct in all the affairs 
of life. Thus his natural inclination will be to apply 
the same principles in connection with worldly matters 
and worldly people. He must, however, use wisdom in 
considering which would be the wise way to deal with 
the world. Some of the deep and precious things which 
belong to the Church the world would resent. So the 
Lord admonishes that we should not "cast our pearls before 
swine." 

While we are endeavoring to do good to all men, yet 
in the case of the brethren there should be no discrimination 
in this matter. We might say, however, that some of 
the Lord's people seem to be unduly and unreasonably 
exercised along some lines. For instance, if a brother 
should find another brother in the Truth who seemed to 
discriminate in his feelings and apparently to be more appreciative 
of another than of himself, he should not take 
offense. He should say, "There are differences of character 
and temperament; and Brother B. might commend 



himself to Brother A. more than would another. All that 
I may ask is that Brother A. shall love me; that he shall 
not hate me; that he shall not do me injury." Nothing 
in the Word of God indicates that the brethren are all to 
be esteemed alike! 

Our Lord Himself showed just such a discrimination 
in His love. He did it, however, "without partiality and 
without hypocrisy." But because of the differences in 
our fallen human nature some of the brethren are more 
congenial to us than are others. We should, therefore, 
be content to have the love of the brethren, and should 
endeavor to merit more of it— and to have our words and 
conduct such as to become more lovable to the brethren 
and thus to draw more of their esteem. The way to do 
this is, not by finding fault with those who do not love us 
up to the highest degree, but by trying to develop that 
character which would merit a fuller measure of love. 

If such a question as this be raised and is not treated 
along the lines of Matt. 18:15, one should advise thus: 
"Brother A. seems to have none but the kindest feelings 
toward you, dear brother." Then if Brother B. says that 
he does not receive Brother A.'s love and companionship 
as does Brother C, one might reply, "Well, my dear 
brother, have we not the right to have a special fellowship 
with one if we do no injury to another? I think that we 
have, and that we have the Lord's example in this direction. 
This does not mean that I should treat you unkindly. 
It is not wrong for a brother to have more or 
less of a preference, providing that he does not use this 
preference to offend another intentionally." 

VARYING DEGREES OF LOVE 

Love is not justice. Love cannot be commanded; it 
must be induced; and there must be a cause for the love. 
It would be thoroughly out of order for any one to tell 
us that we should love God if He were not a lovable 
Being. Similarly, how could we love any creature who 
is unlovely? We love the brethren because we see something 
of God-likeness in their good intentions, and in the 
fact that they have given their hearts to the Lord. 

In a case where the brother's flesh is much fallen, we 
have largely a compassionate love, rather than a loving 
admiration; for only in proportion as we see character-likeness 
to Christ can we truly love His followers. But 
we should regard every brother and every sister with a 
sincere desire to do them good; and the same love, of 
course, should extend, as we have opportunity, to the 
world in general. 

The great difficulty in cases of misunderstanding is 
that the Lord's counsel is not accurately followed. Good, 
honorable brethren, anxious to do right, who apparently 
would be quite competent to advise others, seem to think 
that theirs is a different case— seem not to exercise the 
proper judgment. Instead of going to the brother and 
saying, kindly, "Brother, I have come to see you in reference 



to a little matter, following the advice of Matt. 18:15," 
he, on the contrary, meets the brother and says, 
"Brother, you have done so and so." He goes to the 

R4985 : page 82 

brother, not to be reconciled, but rather, dictatorially, to 
show him that there is something wrong. This is not the 
right way to go about a matter. As surely as Justice is 
the foundation of God's Throne, just so surely are those 
who pursue this course failing to follow the principles 
of justice; they are failing to develop the Lord's character 
and will fail to win the prize. 

The spirit of the Lord's injunction is to help a brother, 
not to twit him, nor to anger him, nor to tease him; not 
to entrap him into saying what he did not intend to say, 
nor to distort the meaning of what he has said. Such is 
not the right spirit. No brother should be approached in 
this manner. But the matter should be considered in the 
most kindly way; and if then— in spite of all that one 
can do— the wrong is continued, we should have nothing 
more to say. Some might say, "He did not apologize." 
The Lord did not say anything about his apology. But 
if he recognizes that he is wrong and fails to apologize, 
he is doing himself injury. 

LET US BEWARE OF BUSYBODYING 

If the second step in Matt. 18:15-17 be found necessary, 
it should be taken only after very deliberate thought 
and prayer, with the desire to make sure of doing the 
Lord's will. First of all, one should make sure that the 
matter is of sufficient importance to ask the brethren to 
go along ! and that it is something against us, not against 
another; that it is not busybodying; that it is something 
that is being done now. If this is the case, take two 
others along. Do not say, "If I ask you to go along, be 
sure to stand by me." We may be the ones in error; and 
if we are we should be more anxious to be corrected ourselves 
than to have the other brother corrected. 

If we make sure that the matter is important, we 
should select two that we think would be friends of the 
brother injuring us— fair-minded, honorable people in the 
Church. Then, after the party has met with the offending 
brother and discussed the case, it would be proper for 
these brethren to advise us. If the advice were something 
that we could follow, we should do so and bring 
peace and harmony. 

But if this course should avail nothing and the injurious 
actions should continue, then it would be proper 
for us to bring the matter to the attention of the Church. 
The two brethren who went with us, and decided with us 
that it was impossible to persuade the evil-doer to alter 
his course, should say to the Elders of the Church that 
they had a case to present for a hearing; but they should 
not make charges. The Church is merely to hear the 



matter, to see whether there is any real cause of complaint. 
But at this stage of the affair they know merely 
that there is a case to be heard. Then the Elders should 
call a special meeting for such a purpose, saying to the 
Church that there is a case to be brought before the Class, 
and asking what time would be convenient for them to 
hear the matter. Then the Church should decide when 
to call a meeting to consider the case. 

This would be the time for the one against whom the 
complaint lodges to say to the Elders, "It is true that 
there were charges made against me by the brother, and 
that two others afterward came with him. But I claim, 
brethren, that the charges are not true, that the matter is 
one of my private concern, and that others have nothing 
to do with it;" or whatever he wishes to say. Then there 
must be brought evidence to show that there is really a 
matter to come before the Church, that it is not merely a 
case of busybodying; for the Church must not meet together 
to participate in busybodying. 

Then it would be proper for the Elders to learn 
enough to decide whether or not the Church would be 
busybodying in this man's affairs— merely enough to inform 
themselves whether it were a matter to come before 
the Church. If they thought that it was not, they should 
say to the offended one, "This brother is not doing you 
an injury." But if either of the parties still thought that 
it should be brought before the Church-that Matt. 18:15-17 
had been followed as far as possible to this 
point— and if the Elders of the Class were unwilling to 
bring it before the congregation, then it would be proper 
for the congregation to determine whether or not they 
would hear the case, and their hearing should be final. 

HOW TO CONDUCT A CHURCH TRIAL 

In any matter heard before the congregation there 
should be an opportunity for each one interested to present 
his side of the case— the one to state his trouble and 
the other to answer. At no stage of the proceedings 
should unkind words be permitted. The person who attempted 
to use them should be considered reprehensible 
on that account, and his conduct worthy of being judged 
a misdemeanor. This course is the one which the Lord 
evidently intended should be followed. The point, however, 
always to be borne in mind is whether people are 
really busybodying in other men's matters— a course 
which should not be encouraged, either by the Class or 
by the Elders. People waste a great deal of time in evil 
counsels, in a manner quite contrary to the Golden Rule 
and to Matt. 18:15. 

If the congregation, after patiently hearing definite, 
positive charges of sufficient importance, finds that notwithstanding 
these various steps the brother against whom 
complaint is made has really been doing wrong and is 
continuing to do so, they should decide that he is guilty 
as charged. The vote of the Church should be unanimous, 



if possible; all partisanship should be ignored. Since they 
are not condemning any one to eternal torment, nor judging 
him in any way, their advice must not carry with it 
any penalty whatever. They are merely advising the 
brother that his conduct is contrary to the Scriptures; 
and that if he does not change his course, they cannot 
longer treat him as one of the Lord's people. 

In disfellowshipping him, they are not to ill-treat him; 
for we do not act so with publicans and sinners. But we 
would not ask a publican or a sinner to take part in the 
service, either as an Elder or as a Deacon or in any 
other capacity; so the offending brother is not to be 
asked to offer prayer, or to do anything that an outsider 
would not be asked to do. Thus the congregation would 
withdraw their fellowship. He is a brother still, but not 
in the best of standing; for he has neglected to hear the 
voice of the brethren in the way that the Lord has 
directed. 

It might be possible, however, for a whole class to 
go astray in its judgment in a matter, and to decide 
against a brother who was in the right. This brother 
might then say, "My dear brethren, I appreciate your 
view in this matter; and I am sorry that anything in my 
course should seem to be worthy of condemnation. I 
promise you that I will modify the matter as best I am 
able. Although in justice to myself I cannot alter my 
view, nevertheless, in respect to your united voices I will 
not in the matter follow my judgment, which I feel is 
the correct one. And if, therefore, I suffer some injustice, 
the Lord will count it to me in the nature of a 
sacrifice for the sake of His Body, the Church. So, then, 
dear brethren, while thanking you for your kindly expressed 

R4985 : page 83 

sentiment, I still wish you to know that it does 

not do me justice. And I think that you will inform me 

of your change of mind on the subject if you ever should 

change." 

If the brother were really in the wrong, he might 
say, "Well, then, put me out!" The Class might say, 
"We are not putting you out. Do not say that you will 
withdraw from us. We will not take your remark for 
your answer. We hope that the Lord will have you see 
that our action has been most kindly, brotherly, and that 
it is a part of our duty now to conform to the views of 
the Class. If the Lord shows us that we are wrong, we 
shall be very glad to acknowledge it. But in the meantime, 
dear brother, we do not wish to offend you, but 
merely desire to do our duty to the Lord and to His 
Word." 

This course would be the proper one; we should not 
erect a barricade between brethren. But it would be 
very easy to do injury to such a brother by saying, "Well, 
never show your face here again unless you take back 
every word you have said." The majority of people have 



so much self-esteem that they would not go back after 
such a statement; whereas they might do so if the Spirit 
of the Lord, the Spirit of love and justice is manifested.

PERFECTION OF ORGANISM NOT NECESSARY TO TRIAL FOR LIFE 

"He must reign till He hath put all enemies under His feet; the 
last enemy that shall be destroyed is death."— I Cor. 15:25,26. 

THE DIVINE arrangement respecting Messiah's 
Kingdom seems very clearly stated 
in the Scriptures. Our text above, if no 
other, proves that Messiah's Kingdom will 
not be dealing with perfect conditions. By 
the sealing of the New Covenant He will 
make satisfaction for the sins of the world; 
and those of the world who prove worthy 
have God's assurance of attaining eternal 
life. The great work will be that of uplifting 
mankind out of sin and death conditions. For this 
reason He will rule as King and will officiate as the great 
Priest. The basis for this is the fact that our Lord Jesus 
purchased the world through the merit of His sacrifice. 
"Where a tree falleth, there shall it be." (Eccl. 1 1:3.) 
So, as mankind go down into death, there they remain. 
In the awakening from death there will be a resuscitation 
to practically the same conditions— mentally, morally and 
physically— which they had before they went into the 
tomb. If mankind came back from the tomb perfect, no 
one would have any way of identifying himself. If one 
were raised perfect in every thought and word and act, 
he would not know himself; for all those things composing 
his identity would be gone. Hence, he would have 
no way to distinguish himself from the rest of mankind! 
The world will be resuscitated with the same kind of intelligence 

R4986 : page 83 

in which they went down into death. But theirs 
is a death condition, and the very object of Messiah's 
Kingdom is to uplift out of that condition, and to raise 
up that which was lost to the perfection of man's nature. 
The Scriptures show us that at the end of the thousand 
years of Christ's reign the whole world will be 
turned over to the Father; and the race will then have 
a trial time, a testing, just as Adam had when he was in 
Eden. For "a little season" Satan will have the power 
to tempt mankind as he tempted Mother Eve. But the 
world should then be so thoroughly established in righteousness 
of heart that nothing which Satan or any other 
being could bring upon them in the way of temptation 
would make them sin; and those who will not have learned 



to hate sin and to love righteousness will not be fit for 
eternal life. We read that fire [judgments] will come 
down from heaven and destroy such. 

ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF TRIAL 

But we are to remember that there is another trial 
which precedes that occurring at the end of the Millennial 
Age. From the very time when the Kingdom shall have 
been established, the world will be on trial. Under The 
Christ's beneficent rule some will avail themselves of the 
opportunity to rise gradually back to the perfection of 
human nature, lost in Eden; others, apparently, according 
to the Scriptures, will still maintain an attitude of rebellion, 
loving sin and hating righteousness. These will be 
granted a hundred years (Isa. 65:17-25) of trial, even 
though they do not come to perfection of mind and body, 
because of their rebellious attitude of heart. 

Such are spoken of as children, in comparison with 
others of that day who will live on and become perfect. 
Messiah, as the great Judge, will cause such to die accursed, 
condemned, cut off from further opportunity of 
attaining life; for such will not have benefited by the 
merit of Christ and the Kingdom of Christ. And if this 
would be true of their condition after one hundred years, 
we may infer that if any, who during the first hundred 
years had proved faithful, should during the second hundred 
years assume a position against righteousness, 
such would then be cut off from life. 

"THE SAINTS SHALL JUDGE THE WORLD" 

"Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the 
world?" (I Cor. 6:2.) We certainly know it. The work 
of giving mankind the necessary knowledge and assistance 
will be in the hands of Christ and the Church. The final 
sentence against sinners will be destruction, death, as is 
clearly shown in the parable (Matt. 25:31-46) where Jesus 
(with the Church) is pictured in power and great glory 
judging the world, "For God hath appointed a day in 
which He will judge the world in righteousness by that 
Man whom He hath ordained" (Acts 17:31)— the Day of 
the great Messiah, the antitypical Moses— Jesus, the Head, 
and the Church, His Body. The parable shows that the 
work of the Millennial Age will completely separate the 
"sheep" class from the "goats"— the "sheep" being on the 
right hand (place of favor) and the "goats" at the left 
(place of disfavor). At the end of the Age Messiah will 
destroy the goat class and, in the Father's name, bless all 
the sheep class. But nothing is more evident than that 
the trial for life or death will proceed during all the Millennial 
Age— throughout all that thousand-year Judgment 
Day. 

MERIT IMPUTED BY THE GREAT ADVOCATE 



Now the Church is on trial for life or death, and Christ 
gives us an imputation of His merit and thus covers our 
weaknesses and shortcomings. By and by, He will give 
the world actual perfection on condition of perfect obedience. 
But now, under the great Advocate's imputation of 
righteousness, the decision regarding the Church comes 
in a few years from the time when we reach the point of 
consecration unto death. If this time is sufficient for the 
accomplishing of the trial of the Church, then we can see 
that a hundred years is ample time for the world to see 

R4986 : page 84 

whether they will make even a little progress upward on 
the Highway of Holiness. 

The testing of the Church we recognize as a fact; for 
the Apostle points it out to us. If those who are now 
consecrated should fall away into sin, there remains no 
more sacrifice for sins. (Heb. 10:26,27.) Why? Because 
the imputation of Christ's merit will not be repeated 
to any. If we get the imputation of Christ's merit in this 
present life, then there will be no further imputation for 
us. Those who do not get the imputation of Christ's merit 
now, as the Church, will never get it; but instead they will 
get the benefit of the New Covenant. The effect, however, 
in either event, will be a life or death trial and a 
life or death sentence. 

"BE THOU FAITHFUL" 

In the case of the Church, if we were faithful until the 
very last day of our experience and on that day proved 
unfaithful, it would certainly settle the matter as to our 
future. Similarly, we may say of the world that, if any 
should prove unfaithful during their trial in the next Age, 
their trial would end immediately and, undoubtedly, the 
sentence would be to the Second Death. In other words, 
the trial continues until each individual has been either 
rewarded or punished; and every act down to the last has 
to do with the sentence of that trial. 

In Ezekiel there is an intimation along this line, where 
God says, "But if the wicked will turn from all his sins 
that he hath committed, and keep all My statutes, and do 
that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall 
not die. All his transgressions that he hath committed, 
they shall not be mentioned unto him; in his righteousness 
that he hath done he shall live. ...But when the righteous 
turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth 
iniquity,. ..shall he live? All his righteousness that 
he hath done shall not be mentioned; in his trespass that 
he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in 
them shall he die." (Ezek. 18:21-24.) This seems to be 
the principle of Divine Justice, and one to which we can 
all readily assent, and which we can recognize as just and 
righteous altogether. "Just and true are Thy ways, Thou 
King of saints."

THE GOSPEL ONLY FOR SINNERS 

--MARK 2:13-22.-MARCH 24.- 

Text:— "I came not to call the 
righteous, but sinners."— Verse 17. 

THE TERM "Publican" in Jesus' day was applied 

to Jews who served the Roman Government 

as tax collectors in Palestine. The 

name was a reproach because the Jews held 

to the Abrahamic promise that the whole 

world should be blessed by them as God's 

peculiar people. They held that this meant 

that they should not only be free from all 

other governments, but that they should be 

the masters of the world. And if so, all 

other nations should be paying them tribute and they 

should pay tribute to none. The most public-spirited Jews, 

therefore, declined to be the agents of the Roman Government 

in the matter of collecting tribute or taxes, and 

the tribute-takers or publicans were looked upon with disdain 

as being unfaithful to their religion and to their 

nation. 

The term "sinner," as frequently used in this study and 
elsewhere in the Gospels, was applied to all Jews who 
were careless in respect to the orthodoxy of their day, 
for the orthodox Jew of that time (and today) took pride 
in his religion and boasted of his holiness— as, for instance, 
the word "Pharisee" signifies "holy person"— one 
scrupulously careful in observing the smallest details of 
the Law. There was a wide breach between these zealous 
followers of Moses' Law and the mass of the nation who, 
because of not making special profession, were altogether 
classed as "sinners," or persons not up to the orthodox 
standard of carefulness of form, ceremonies, etc. 

The Pharisees would tolerate and eat with the Sadducees, 
although the latter were practically unbelievers, 
because they were of the wealthier and therefore more 
respectable class; but they entirely ignored and would 
not eat with their less particular brethren, whom they 
in general styled "sinners," regardless of their having true 
moral status. 

Our Lord's disciples were nearly all gathered from this 
lower or less orthodox and less educated class of Jews. 
Because of our Lord's talents the Pharisees would have 
been glad to have Him as one of their number, provided, 
of course, that He would side with them and uphold them 
in their more or less hypocritical pretentions of perfection 
and holiness. But Jesus denounced the claims of the 



Pharisees as hypocritical, and told the common people 
plainly that there were "none righteous, no, not one"— 
that all needed Divine mercy, and that really the humble 
and contrite would be much more acceptable to God than 
the boastful, the proud, the self-conceited. 

MATTHEW THE PUBLICAN 

Today's study tells of the call of Matthew to be one of 
the twelve Apostles. His original name was Levi, just 
as Peter's original name was Simon. He belonged to 
the Levitical tribe, but his acceptance of service under the 
Romans as a tax collector socially degraded him and 
classed him as a "Publican." Perhaps the quality of independence 
and humble-mindedness which influenced this 
man to become a tax collector and to brave the scorn of 
his fellow-countrymen were qualities which really favored 
him in respect to the Divine invitation to become a disciple 
of Jesus. We may be sure this was true from the 

R4987 : page 84 

fact that Jesus gave him a special invitation to become 
His disciple, and from the fact that he was in the heart 
condition to forsake all of his earthly goods that he might 
be a member of the Messianic class. We cannot suppose 
that the Master would call to discipleship any but a noble 
character, nor can we suppose that any others would have 
accepted the call as did Matthew. 

Matthew was a householder and promptly invited 
Jesus and His followers to dinner. He invited in also 
numbers of his friends, and these, like himself, were of 
the ostracized class— publicans and sinners. The scribes 
and Pharisees watched Jesus closely, and when they perceived 
that He ate and mingled with the less respectable 
and less orthodox, they disesteemed Him, also, and put 
the question squarely to Jesus' disciples: "How is it that 
your Master eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners, 
and yet claims to be holy?" 

This afforded Jesus the opportunity which He desired 
of giving a great lesson in a few words. He replied to 
them, "They that are whole have no need of a physician, 
but they that are sick; I came to call, not the righteous, 
but sinners." Here we have the key to much of the misunderstanding 
of the Gospel in that day and now. The 

R4987 : page 85 

first lesson that all must learn is that all sin is condemned 
of God— the little and the large— and that all unrighteousness 
is sin, and that there is "none righteous, no, not one." 
In other words, each must learn that he himself is a 
sinner, and under Divine sentence and needing forgiveness, 
before he can come into fellowship with God or 
become partaker of God's provision for eternal life. The 
publicans and sinners were indeed condemned of God, and 



the scribes and Pharisees, members of the same imperfect 

race, were also under Divine sentence; but the latter did 

not admit their sinfulness and imperfection nor seek 

Divine forgiveness, while the former, admitting their sins, 

were the more ready to accept forgiveness. Jesus illustrated 

this matter in one of His parables saying, A certain 

Pharisee went to the temple to pray and, full of self-confidence, 

thanked God that he was not as other men, 

nor even like the poor Publican near him. The Publican 

also prayed; but in humility, feeling that he was a sinner, 

besought Divine forgiveness. Jesus declared that the less 

moral man, the less scrupulously careful man, the Publican, 

was nearer to Divine Justice than the more careful, 

more upright, more orthodox Pharisee, because the latter 

failed to acknowledge his sins, his imperfections, which 

could be forgiven only through their acknowledgment. 

Hence the declaration of Jesus that He "came not to call 

the righteous, but sinners." There were none righteous 

to call, for all are sinners, and those who thought themselves 

righteous had a barrier before them which hindered 

their coming to the Lord under the call of this Age. 

"THY DISCIPLES FAST NOT" 

About that time a fasting season was observed by the 
Pharisees, and also by those who had accepted the teachings 
of John the Baptist; but Jesus had said nothing to 
His disciples about fasting up to that time. Now the question 
arose, Why was this? The Savior's explanation was 
that while He was with them it should properly be considered 
a time of rejoicing and feasting rather than a 
time of fasting and sorrow. Would a betrothed woman 
sorrow and weep and fast while her betrothed was present? 
Nay. Yet, in subsequent days, after his departure, 
in her loneliness, and especially if she thought of the long 
delay in his coming to receive her to become his wife, she 
would sorrow. So Jesus intimated it would be with His 
followers. They would have plenty of opportunity to 
weep and fast after He would be gone and while waiting 
for His return. 

Fasting should not be considered a matter of obligation 
or command, but rather a voluntary sacrifice of present 
and temporal good things that the mind and heart might 
go out the more earnestly after the things not seen as 
yet, but hoped for. Thus for eighteen centuries God's 
people have been fasting and praying and waiting and 
longing for the Bridegroom's return. But in the time of 
His presence, their fellowship with Him, their joy in the 
realization of the completed promise, will wipe away their 
tears and "give them beauty for ashes, and the oil of joy 
for. ..the spirit of heaviness." 

THE CHURCH A NEW CREATION 

It was difficult for the Savior's hearers to get a proper 
focus upon His teachings. They could understand John 



the Baptist's preaching of repentance and reformation; 
but when Jesus declared, "The Law and the Prophets 
were until John, and since then the Kingdom of Heaven 
is preached"— this was so radical a proposition as to be 
difficult for the masses to grasp. What could be higher 
than the Law and the Prophets? What door could be 
opened to the followers of Jesus which had not been 
open to their forefathers? Was not their Jewish nation 
God's Kingdom? Did not King David sit "upon the 
throne of the Lord"? Was it not promised that Messiah 
should sit upon David's throne? 

Sympathetically we must concede that it was difficult 
for the Jews to understand that before the blessing could 
come to natural Israel, another, spiritual Israel, must be 
selected. By way of emphasizing this thought, our Lord 
gave two parabolical illustrations, saying, No man sews 
a piece of unshrunken cloth upon an old garment, because 
the shrinking of the new cloth would pull away the old 
and increase the difficulty. Likewise, no one would think 
of putting new wine which had not yet finished its fermentation 
into old wineskins, whose elasticity had been 
exhausted, for the old wineskins would be burst by the 
fermentation of the new wine. 

These illustrations show that the Gospel teaching is 
not a patch upon the Jewish Law, but is a new proposition. 
And the new wine of the Gospel Dispensation must 
be put into new wineskins that will be able to stand the 
stress of the fermentation sure to come. Thus our Lord 
did not attempt to engraft His teachings upon the Jews, 
but called out of Judaism a special class, which the 
Scriptures denote as "New Creatures in Christ." It is 
to these that the new wine of the Gospel Message is 
committed, and these are to experience the fermentation 
incidental to the preparation for the Kingdom— trials, 
disciplines and testings. 



R4987 : page 85 

"THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD" 

-QR. REVIEW-MARCH 31. ~ 

"Text:— "The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and 
to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light 
is sprung up."— Matthew 4:16. 

IN THE BIBLE symbols light stands as the 

representative of God, of Christ, of the 

Church, of Truth, of influences for righteousness, 

which by and by as the Sun of 

Righteousness shall arise with healing in 

its beams for the cure of all the masses of 

the earth. It will scatter the darkness of 

sin, ignorance and superstition— the works 



of the Prince of Darkness, who will then 

"be bound for a thousand years that he 

may deceive the nations no more until the thousand years 

are finished." Of the heavenly Father we read, "God is 

light, and in Him is no darkness at all." 

Of Jesus we read, "I am the light of the world." Of 
the Church in her present condition we read, "Let your 
light so shine before men that they may see your good 
works and glorify your Father which is in Heaven." "Hide 
not your light under a bushel, but set it on a candlestick 
that it may give light unto all that are in the house." 
Nevertheless, "The darkness hateth the light, neither 
cometh to the light," and "the whole world lieth in the 
Wicked One"— in darkness. Notwithstanding the faithfulness 
of Jesus and the few light-bearers enlightened 
with the Holy Spirit of which they are begotten, still 
"darkness covers the earth and gross darkness the 
heathen." 

This same thought pervades the Scriptures from first 
to last, namely, that for six thousand years, from the time 

R4988 : page 86 

of the entrance of sin to the second coming of Jesus, the 
world will be subject to a reign of sin and death— it will 
be under a pall of darkness, ignorance, superstition, sin, 
etc. The only ones who will see the path of righteousness 
distinctly will be those guided by the "lantern"— God's 
Word. They are represented as saying, "Thy Word is 
a lamp to my feet and a lantern to my footsteps." St. 
Peter, writing to the Church from the same standpoint, 
declares, "We (the Church) have a more sure Word of 
prophecy whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as 
unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day 
dawn."-Psa. 119:105; 2 Peter 1:19. 

The Prince of Darkness has been in command for 
centuries. The only lights of the past were the noble 
Prophets of the Jewish line whose lights affected few in 
their own nation, and were not discernible at all amongst 
the heathen world. John the Baptist, we are told, was 
a burning and shining light, and Jesus was a still more 
brilliant light, and His faithful few during the past 
eighteen centuries have shined forth, reflecting their 
Master's light. But all of these have had comparatively 
little influence in the world. It still lies in the Wicked 
One— in darkness, seeing not, neither understanding Divine 
things; it is still "waiting for the manifestation of 
the sons of God." 

A BETTER DAY COMING 

Our text tells of a better day sure to come. It is not 
sure to come because of the operation of the evolutionary 
law, for the natural law would seem to contradict such 
a thought. Darkness leads on to darkness more intense, 
and while light begets light, darkness begets darkness, and 



the masses are in the darkness, and in the Wicked One, 
the Prince of Darkness. Never, then, might we hope for 
the abolishment of darkness except in the way in which 
God has foretold it— through the establishment of Messiah's 
Kingdom— through the shining forth of the Son 
of Righteousness— the Church in glory.— Matt. 13:43. 

Our text is a quotation from the Old Testament; it 
had a beginning of its fulfilment in our Savior and in 
the Apostles. The people of Palestine, long in doubt, 
uncertainty, etc., saw a great light in Jesus and His teachings. 
And throughout this Gospel Age, for more than 
eighteen centuries, this great Light has been exercising 
a feeble influence amongst men. The Light itself has 
been pure— the Divine Word and the principles of Divine 
righteousness. But, alas! few have been faithful in receiving 
the light in its purity and in reflecting it forth 
upon others. 

In general the light has been corrupted by human 
selfishness, by sin. As a consequence the name Christian 
today does not stand for all the blessed light and truth 
and grace and faithfulness to God and to the principles 
of love which the Master showed forth and inculcated. 
Instead the name Christian today is borne by about four 
hundred millions of humanity, many of whom, judged by 
the Divine standard of their "fruits," are children of the 
Wicked One, children of darkness, who merely use the 
garment of light, the name Christian, as a heavenly livery 
whereby to appease their own consciences and to increase 
their opportunity for selfishness and acquisition, quite 
contrary to the Leader whom they profess to be following, 
"the True Light." 

"WHICH LIGHTETH EVERY MAN" 

The Apostle declares that Jesus "is the true light 
which lighteth every man that cometh into the world." 
(John 1:9.) The expression, "true light," implies that 
there are false or imitation lights, and of these we know 
that there are many— lights of heathendom and lights of 
Christendom. The only true light, however, is that which 
shone forth in our Savior's teachings and example. It 
has thus far enlightened only a few, a "little flock." 
These, like their Master, are urged to let their light shine 
before men that others may take knowledge that they 
have been with Jesus and learned of Him— that they are 
His disciples, His followers, bearing, in His footsteps, 
the same light which shone forth from Him. 

After eighteen centuries of experience of the light 
battling with the darkness, and at times being almost 
quenched thereby, we might well ask, what hope is there 
that this prophecy will ever be fulfilled— that Jesus, as 
the Light of the world, will enlighten every man born 
into the world? The Bible answers that God will fulfil 
this very matter in His own time, but that God's time 
cannot be hastened— that before the world will be enlightened, 
a saintly class, the Church, the Bride of Christ, 



must be enlightened, and must be completed and glorified 
together with her Lord. 

FOR ONE THOUSAND YEARS THE SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS 
WILL SHINE FORTH 

Then, and not until then, will the Savior and His 
Church in glory be the great Sun of Righteousness which 
will arise over the earth, and shine forth for the healing 
of the people, for the scattering of the darkness of sin 
and the lies of error— the bringing of life, peace, joy and 
blessing to all who will accept the favor in harmony with 
the Divine requirements; but to smite down and utterly 
destroy the Night, and those who will still love darkness, 
and would corrupt the earth. 

For a thousand years the glorious Sun of Righteousness 
(Christ and the Church, His Bride), will shine out. 
The work will be thorough and complete. Adam and his 
every child will be fully brought to a knowledge of the 
Truth, and will enjoy the blessed opportunity of coming 
back into harmony with God, by the restitution process, 
of which St. Peter tells us in Acts 3:19-23. This will 
not mean that the world will ever become members of the 
Bride class, or ever attain the spirit nature. It means 
restitution to the condition first enjoyed by Adam, lost 
by sin, but redeemed by the sacrifice finished at Calvary. 
It means human perfection to all the willing and obedient 
of Adam's race through the heavenly Second Adam and 
the heavenly Second Eve. 

It means a world-wide Paradise, filled with the blessings 
of the Lord, who has promised that the earth, as 
His footstool, shall be made glorious. It means that, with 
the destruction of the wilfully disobedient, this earth will 
be like heaven. The Savior's prayer will reach fulfilment; 
God's will shall be done on earth even as it is done in 
heaven. This in turn will mean that "every knee will 
bow and every tongue confess," both of the things in 
heaven and of the things on earth, to the glory of God. 
And this signifies that there shall be no more sighing, no 
more crying, no more dying on earth, even as none of 
these things are in heaven. 

Then our text will have most ample fulfilment— all 
mankind shall see the great Light which God has provided; 
even those "in the shadow of death" must come 
forth, that all may be enlightened by this "true Light 
which lighteth every man that cometh into the world." 
O, the happy day that is coming to our poor, sin-cursed 
earth! There shall be no more curse, thank God! Instead 
of the curse shall be the Divine blessing; "and every 
creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth shall 
be heard saying, 'Praise and glory and honor and dominion 
and might be unto Him that sitteth upon the Throne, 
and unto the Lamb, forever'"!

SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS 
FEAR THE ADVERSARY'S TACTICS 

Question.— "Your Adversary, the devil, as a roaring 
lion walketh about, seeking whom he may devour; whom 
resist, steadfast in the faith." (I Pet. 5:8.) In what 
sense does the Adversary go about as a roaring lion? 

Answer.— The Scriptures give us various illustrations 
of Satan, the "angel of light." He is compared to a serpent, 
a roaring lion, etc. Of course, he does not fill all of 
these pictures at one moment, nor does he go about as a 
roaring lion all the time. It is the custom of the lion to 
roar when in pursuit of food. The roar of the lion makes 
his prey— including human beings— semi-paralyzed. From 
personal observation, we see that fear is one of the most 
disastrous things for the Lord's people to have— except 
"fear of the Lord," which is proper fear. As God incites 
by love, so Satan incites through fear, through false doctrines, 
the root of error, which so terrorizes mankind as 
to the future. This kind of influence from the Adversary 
is what is meant by the Apostle. But we are to resist 
Satan. 

Once the Apostles were under threat from the Jewish 
Sanhedrin; and they prayed, "Now, Lord, behold their 
threatening s." This statement, however, does not prove 
that the men of the Sanhedrin were devils, nor that they 
were viciously inclined of themselves. So today there are 
some people more or less beclouded by the threatenings of 
those who are seeking to intimidate the Lord's people. 
We are to be of good courage. When we hear the roaring 
of the lion we are to remember that the Lord is on our 
part and that He does not cause us to fear. The thought 
that Satan opposes us and that we are contending, not 
merely with the fallen flesh, but also with wicked spirits 
in high positions of power, would appal us if we did not, 
by positiveness of decision, acquire great help from other 
unseen powers. From the instant that we resist temptation 
and stand up for the Lord and His cause we become strong 
in the Lord and in the power of His might. "If God be 
for us, who can be against us?" 

LIGHT INCREASES RESPONSIBILITY 

Question.— "If I had not come and spoken unto them, 
they had not had sin; but now they have no cloak for their 
sin."— John 15:22. Please explain. 

Answer.— Our Lord explained to the Scribes and 
Pharisees that the light of His teaching gave a greater 
responsibility to those who heard it than to those who 
had not heard it. If they had never come in contact with 
the light, they would never have sinned against the light; 

R4989 : page 87 



and therefore, their sin was greater in proportion to the 
greater blessing. 

So it is today. If you had never had your eyes opened, 
if you had never heard more than the heathen, then you 
would not have any more sin than other heathen people 
whose eyes have never been opened. But when you sin 
with a measure of wilfulness against the light and knowledge, 
your sin will be the greater. Your responsibility is 
in proportion to the light. This seems to be the reasonable 
view of the matter. 



DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FRUITS AND GRACES OF SPIRIT 

Question.— What is the difference between "the fruits 
of the Spirit" and "the graces of the Spirit?" 

Answer.— The expression "fruits of the Spirit" has 
very much the same significance as "graces of the Spirit." 
One term might be proper to use at one time and the 
other at another time, according to the figure of speech 
which would be appropriate. If we were speaking of a 
quality which was being developed, it would be proper to 
think of the fruitage of the Spirit— those beautiful qualities 
worked out in our lives through the indwelling of 
the Spirit of God. If we were speaking more particularly 
of the individual and his conduct, we might more appropriately 
say that the graces which he manifested and 
which he had developed were brought out through his 
possession of the Holy Spirit, through his possession of 
the spirit of love.

"THE RESURRECTION OF THE JUST AND OF THE UNJUST" 

THE RESURRECTION of the just could not 
mean a resurrection of those who had been 
perfect, for there are none perfect, none 
just, "no, not one." "The resurrection of 
the just," then, must mean the resurrection 
of those who have been justified; and the 
justified are those referred to in the Scriptures 
of whom Abraham was an example. 
Abraham believed God, and was justified 
by faith. It was the faith that justified, 
and the works corroborated the faith. 

So with the Church of this Age. The Apostle says, 
"Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through 
our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom, also, we have access by 
faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in 
hope of the glory of God." (Rom. 5:1,2.) We are not 
only justified out of sin, but are also brought by operation 
of our faith into the glorious standing of members of 
Christ; and we may hope to participate with Christ in the 
glories of His Kingdom in the future. It is one thing 
to be freed from guilt, and another thing to be raised 
to the position of sons of God, heirs of God and joint-heirs 
with Christ, our Lord. 

The resurrection of the dead is similarly spoken of in 
John 5:28,29, where we read, "Marvel not at this, for 
the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves 
shall hear His voice, and shall come forth." The Lord 
does not mean merely all the good, for He also includes 
in this all that are in their graves. We read in the context 
that they that have done good shall come forth "unto 
the resurrection of life"; those who have done evil shall 
come forth to "damnation." The word damnation, in 
the Greek, signifies a crisis, a turning-point, a decision. 

THE RESURRECTION OF THE CHURCH 

Those whose faith enables them to stand through evil 
report and through good report, and who thus fulfil the 
Divine requirement, are character-likenesses of Jesus. 
These now pass from under the condemnation condition to 
the life condition. As the Apostle says, "We know that 
we have passed from death unto life, because we love the 
brethren." (I John 3:14.) This passing from death 
unto life is not in the full sense in the present time. By 
faith we are reckoned dead with Christ, counted members 
of His Body. That future life is reckoned to us. We 



are counted as having it; and this is our condition because 
we have the Divine approval. 

Since there is none good, the only sense in which one 
could "do good" would be by coming into accord with God 
by obedience, as under the Covenant which prevailed 
with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, or under the still higher 
Covenant that prevails with the Church in this Gospel 
Age. We have this testimony, that we are pleasing to 
God, who indicates His pleasure by begetting us of the 
Holy Spirit. In contradistinction, the world are aliens, 
foreigners. (Eph. 2:19.) By this Holy Spirit, this 
"unction from the Holy One," therefore, we have the 
evidence of acceptance with the Father. 

The outcome will be, that those having this approval 
of God, having passed the trials and testings which they 
have received— for He receiveth no son whom He does 
not scourge (Heb. 12:6)— and having proved faithful to 
the end, will be raised by the Lord to the very highest 
place— glory, honor and immortality. This is the crown, 
or very highest pinnacle of life that could be imagined. 
So, then, those who will have part in this First Resurrection 
will reign with Christ a thousand years. This 
is the first class mentioned by the Apostle. They are 
approved; they shall come forth to "life resurrection." 

What is the significance of "life resurrection"? We 
answer that these shall come forth to perfect life instantly. 
As St. Paul says, "It is sown in dishonor, it is 
raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in 
power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spirit 
body." Thus instantaneously these blessings come to 
them. They have their trial in the present time and, 
therefore, theirs will be the chief resurrection. 

THE RESURRECTION OF THE WORLD 

But all will have a resurrection. How will the resurrection 
of the world differ from that apportioned to the 
Church? The world has not had the Divine approval; 
the heathen have not had the Divine approval. The 
Apostle says, "How shall they believe in Him of whom 
they have not heard?" (Rom. 10:14.) They are not fit 
for heaven. They are not fit to be with the angels or with 
the saints, no matter how they came to be in this condition. 
They came into this condition because of heredity, 
as children of Adam. But they could not have the same 
kind of resurrection that those will receive who have 
God's approval now, at the time of their death: "Be thou 
faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life." 

So with the majority of those in Christian lands. 
They could not be thought to be fit for heaven or to have 
God's approval in any sense of the word. And they know 
it. They confess it themselves. Nobody could deny that 
nine hundred and ninety-nine out of every thousand are 
living "after the flesh." They are not saints, but have 

R4989 : page 92 



the Divine disapproval, some having heard more of the 
Word of God, and some having heard less. 

THE GENERAL RESURRECTION TO BE GRADUAL 

"Those who have done evil" will come forth to the 
resurrection of "damnation" (Greek, krisis), resurrection 
of trial, resurrection of testing. What kind will it be? 
The Scriptures show us that it will be a gradual resurrection. 
During the thousand years of Christ's reign the 
people will be awakening from the sleep in the tomb. 
This awakening will be a preparatory work, not the full 
resurrection, which will require the entire thousand years. 

But the Divine provision is that the account will have 
been settled for the whole world, so that when they shall 
come forth from the tomb in the future they will be in 
the hands of the Redeemer, whose Kingdom will be worldwide. 
They will have the opportunity of being raised 
again to that which was lost. Human perfection was lost, 
which includes not only perfect physical health, but perfect 
mental power; for mental power depends upon the 
brain, is affected by the brain, as well as by the body, so 
that men are now in a dying condition, mentally, morally 
and physically. 

None will be fully raised, from imperfection to perfection, 
until the end of the thousand years. All who will 
respond to the beneficent arrangements will secure that 
which Father Adam enjoyed at first— perfect manhood. 
Those who will not be obedient to the requirements of 
Christ's Kingdom will be cut off in the Second Death. 
They will be destroyed as brute beasts, having had the full 
measure of Divine favor.— 2 Pet. 2:12. 

"And the rest of the dead lived not again until the 
thousand years were finished." (Rev. 20:5.) When the 
sentence came upon Father Adam he was thrust out of 
Eden. All of his children have been born dying, and are 
still in a dying condition. Therefore, the raising of man 
out of sin and death will be the bringing of him to full 
perfection— perfect life. This will be a gradual process. 
They will be made more alive and more alive, and less 
dead and less dead, as the thousand years progress, and 
none will get the resurrection life until they are raised 
to the condition of perfection— perfect life in the image of 
God, which was lost by Adam. 

BURNING OF THE WORLD SYMBOLICAL 

The Scriptures declare that "the earth abideth forever" 
and that "God formed it not in vain; He made it 
to be inhabited." (See Eccl. 1:4; Isa. 45:18.) It has 
not yet reached the blessed condition when it will blossom 
as a rose, although it is in process of completion. At 
the end of the thousand years of Christ's reign, the whole 
earth shall have been brought to perfection. In the 



R4990 : page 92 

prophecies, mountains are symbolical of kingdoms. In 
2 Peter 3:12 the Apostle's words signify that there will 
be a great conflagration and that the heavens also will 
be on fire, but that, nevertheless, there will be a new order 
of things, to take the place of the old order; and under 
this new order of things there shall come a blessing to 
all in the earth. The word "fire," in this sense, signifies 
destruction of the present order of things, of the kosmos— 
not the ge, the earth, but the social system, society as at 
present organized. 

We not infrequently hear people say, "Well, matters 
are getting pretty hot!" Yes, the battle between capital 
and labor is getting hotter, as is evidenced lately in the 
labor troubles, particularly in Great Britain and the United 
States. But the time of conflagration will be such a "time 
of trouble" that it will entirely consume the present order 
of things, a time of trouble, therefore, that will be Epoch-making 
and the new Epoch will be introduced immediately 
thereafter. 

MOUNTAINS SYMBOLIZE KINGDOMS 

We remember riding over the mountains once with an 
Adventist. The Adventist brother said, "Do you not think 
it will be a glorious time when these mountains will be 
brought down to a level?" We said, "Dear brother, the 
mountains are very beautiful, very useful." He said, 
"You cannot raise corn on this mountain." "Well," said 
we, "go to the prairie if you want to raise corn." Then 
he said, "What do you think the Scriptures mean when 
they say that the mountains shall be brought low, and 
when they speak about the melting of the earth"? We 
said, "Dear brother, the 'mountains' there are kingdoms. 
We read that 'the Mountain of the Lord's house shall be 
exalted in the top of the mountains'; it will be the chief 
Mountain or Kingdom."— Isa. 2:2. 

THE RESURRECTION WILL LEVEL ALL CLASSES 

The Psalmist tells us that "the mountains shall be removed 
and carried into the midst of the sea," mountains 
being symbolical of the kingdoms, of the governments of 
the earth, and society in general, the elements which support 
the governments. (Psa. 46.) St. Peter also speaks as 
though the whole world will be consumed by fire. These 
things are symbolical, implying that the people who are 
now in a low condition will be brought up, and that those 
who are high will be brought low. Thus there will be a 
leveling process. 

We remember the statement of the Scripture in 
Zephaniah, "Wait ye upon Me, saith the Lord." Here 
Jehovah is speaking to the Church, telling us that we 
should not be dissatisfied, that we should not be anarchists 
and strife-breeders: I shall attend to this matter Myself. 



You can rest with the present order of things. 

"Wait ye upon Me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise 

up to the prey; for My determination is to gather the nations, 

that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon 

them Mine indignation, even all My fierce anger; for all 

the earth shall be devoured with the fire of My jealousy." 

That this fire is not literal is shown in the next sentence: 

"Then will I turn unto the people a pure Message, that 

they may all call upon the name of the Lord to serve Him 

with one consent."— Zeph. 3:8,9. 

WHEN "THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE SAY, 'COME'" 

It will be the work of the thousand years of Messiah's 
reign to thus make known the pure Message of God, the 
pure Word of God. We all see, as we look back, that a 
pure Message of God has not been declared to mankind, 
but creed contradicting creed, making confusion worse 
confounded. The Lord, however, will pour out His Spirit 
upon all flesh, and the knowledge of the Lord shall cover 
the earth as the waters cover the great deep. (Isa. 1 1:9; 
Hab. 2: 14.) As the Revelator puts it, "the river of the 
water of life" will flow freely.— Rev. 21:6; 22:1,2. 

We see that there is no Throne yet established and that 
there is no Bride now. We are waiting for the time to 
come when the Throne will be established and when "the 
water of life" will flow out. In the future it will be "a 
river of the water of life." This cannot take place until 
the second coming of our Lord; consequently, it will be 
after that, in the glorious time of Messiah's Kingdom, 
when the Spirit and the Bride will say, "Come!" The 
election of the Church of God will then have been completed; 
and every creature will come to a knowledge of 

R4990 : page 93 

the Truth and will have the opportunity of attaining to 
the full perfection made possible by the redemptive work 
of Christ. 

THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE CHURCH TO EARTHLY 
SOCIETY 

The spirit condition is spoken of as a heavenly condition 
in the sense that the words heaven and heavenly in 
the Scriptures are used to signify higher. So the heaven 
to which the Church will be taken is this higher condition. 
But the mission of the Church in the next Age is in connection 
with humanity. We are, then, to understand that 
the Lord and the Church will be present, operating through 
human, earthly agents; supervising, overruling. 

We have an example of this invisible power in Satan, 
who has been ruling here for over six thousand years, 
through his agents. His work is a deceptive work. He 
has ruled mankind through ignorance, superstition, etc. 
But the rule of Christ will be the scattering of error, superstition. 



The world shall know the Truth that the Truth 

may make them free. Those who will receive the Truth 

will receive the freedom and will eventually attain the 

liberty which belongs to the sons of God. Men will be 

quite visible to The Christ, but they will be invisible to 

men. It is in respect to these that the Lord said that the 

twelve Apostles shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging 

the twelve tribes of Israel— that the Apostles shall be associates 

with Him in judging and ruling the world. 

Then there is another class: "Ye shall see Abraham 
and Isaac and Jacob and all the Prophets in the Kingdom 
of God"; but our Lord does not say a word about their 
seeing Himself or His Apostles. He and His Apostles 
will be in the invisible phase of the Kingdom. So it is 
written, "Instead of Thy fathers shall be Thy children, 
whom Thou mayestmake Princes in all the earth." (Psa. 45:16.) 
The patriarchs will be considered the children. 
A father is a life-giver. While in one sense of the word 
Abraham and Isaac, etc., might be considered fathers, yet 
by virtue of Christ's redemptive work He will give them 
life and they will be His children; for whoever gives life 
is the father and whoever receives life is the child. They 
will be Princes in all the earth, not on the heavenly plane, 
but on the earthly plane, having obtained the "better resurrection" 
because they were faithful. Each one of them 
will be a sample of perfect manhood; and each one of them 
will be a prince or ruler. Their wisdom will be a wisdom 
superintended by the Church in glory. 

THE OBJECT OF THE INDIVIDUAL TRIAL OF MANKIND 

Mankind will need to be put on trial to see whether or 
not they will accept God's Plan with the knowledge they 
will have received. If they accept they will be adjudged 
worthy of everlasting life. If they fail to come into harmony, 
they will be adjudged worthy of everlasting death. 
But this judgment will be passed by Christ and His Bride. 

So, then, we see that there is a great judgment or trial 
coming to the world to give them the opportunity of 
deciding whether or not they will come into harmony with 
the arrangements of Christ's Kingdom. In the work of 
judging, the Church will be associated with Christ. We 
read that God "hath appointed a day, in which He will 
judge the world in righteousness by that Man whom He 
hath ordained" (Acts 17:31), Christ, the Head, and the 
Church, His Body. Again, "Know ye not that the saints 
shall judge the world?" (I Cor. 6:2.) Therefore our 
own judgment or trial takes place in advance, that we 
may be prepared to try or judge the world; and by the experiences 
through which we have passed, we may be assistful 
to them, as they shall be on trial and under our 
control.

DEGREES OF SIN AND THEIR PUNISHMENT 

THE QUESTION is often asked, "Is there 
any special punishment for thieves, murderers 
and other criminals, or will they, if 
repentant, be received into the Kingdom 
along with those who have tried to do 
right throughout their lives?" 

This question can be viewed from two 
standpoints. God Himself is the great 
Determiner of right and wrong. Everything 
that is right God approves; everything 
that is wrong God disapproves. The things that 
God approves are those things that are good, helpful and 
favorable for everybody. The things that God disapproves 
are the things that are wrong, unjust, injurious 
to every one. Therefore God has condemned certain 
things as sin, because He would have us free from 
those things that are unjust or injurious to ourselves or 
to others. Whoever, therefore, commits sin, violates, 
first of all, a Divine command, and to that extent has a 
certain penalty attached to him for that wrong doing. 

We speak of certain persons as "sowing their wild 
oats." What does this expression signify? It means 
that they are now contracting habits which are injurious, 
not only to their own health and happiness, but probably 
to that of others. As a result of practising sin they are 
sure to bring upon themselves a degradation of both mind 
and body. Thus sin brings its own reward in a natural 
way. Whoever sins will suffer, is the general Law. But 
aside from that Law, there is a God, who has given certain 
commands and certain penalties that go with those 
commands. 

R4991 : page 93 

WHO ARE THIEVES AND MURDERERS? 

God's standard of righteousness is much higher than 
is man's present standard. Our Lord gave very fine 
meanings to the words "thief," "adulterer," and "murderer." 
He taught that anyone who is angry with his 
brother without a cause is in danger; that he who looks 
upon another's wife with impure desire has committed 
adultery. (Matt. 5:22,28.) These are very fine distinctions. 
Moreover, we must all admit, as Shakespeare has 
said:— 

"Who steals my purse steals trash; 



But he that filches from me my good name 
Robs me of that which not enriches him, 
And makes me poor indeed." 

Many people have been guilty of stealing the good 



name of others; many have been guilty of murder in the 
sense that they hate others. When it comes to the point 
of deciding who are the most guilty murderers and 
thieves, we are not competent to judge, for we are not 
able to know the qualities of mind and the weaknesses 
with which each person was born. God only could tell the 
degree of wrong in any of these cases. There are some 
people who are, we might say, naturally good; others 
seem to have been born with less patience. Some who, 
naturally, would not get angry with their brother, nor 
with any one, as soon as some one else would, may never 
be in danger of committing murder, either literally or 
figuratively; for they are born with the quality of 
forbearance. 
As these may not manifest any special patience 

R4991 : page 94 

more than that with which they were born, so others may 
manifest special qualities because of the condition in 
which they were born. 

The world has learned the necessity of restraining 
those who are injurious to others. The judgment of the 
people of the State of New York is, according to the 
law, that no murderer shall be at large. He shall be confined; 
for a murderer is not a safe person to permit in 
society. Therefore, he is put into prison or is executed. 
This is the general judgment, outside of God's judgment. 
The best thing for him and the world in general is that he 
go down to hades, sheol— the great state of death, where 
he cannot murder anyone else. The Scriptures agree 
with the laws of the State of New York, that if a man 
commits heinous crimes he should be punished. 

GOD IS TRAINING THE JUDGES NOW 

But so far as taking the position of a judge is concerned, 
we are not capable of doing this. God alone, at 
the present time, knows how much more worthy of punishment 
some are who are in prison than some who are 
out of prison would be for something else. The offense 
of the prisoners might outwardly be the greater crime; 
that of those who are not confined might be just as great 
a crime from the Divine standpoint; for they might be 
sinning against greater light and ability. No one but God 
could tell. Therefore, "Judge nothing before the time." 
-I Cor. 4:5. 

When is "the time"? People are always glad to get the 
chance to judge others. Someone may ask, "When may 
we have the chance to judge? We would like to have it 
now." We reply, "Yours is the wrong spirit. Get rid of 
it or you will never be a judge at all. God is selecting 
another class to be judges— a saintly class that will be 
fully satisfied to judge nothing before the time, but to 
leave everything to Him. He says, "This is the kind I 
want. I will select them." The Apostle says, "Know ye 



not that the saints shall judge the world?"— I Cor. 6:2. 

We shall judge the world, not now, under present 
conditions, but after we shall have been changed in the 
First Resurrection, changed in a moment. The Apostle 
explains what that change will mean to us— "Sown in 
weakness, raised in power; sown in dishonor, raised in 
glory; sown an animal body, raised a spirit body." (I Cor. 15:42-44.) 
When we reach that condition of bodily 
likeness, as well as character-likeness to our Lord, we shall 
be His associates, His Wife, the Royal Priesthood. Then 
there will be plenty of time for us to judge the world. 
All the lessons we get now will only develop us for that 
time. All the experiences we have with ourselves— you 
judging yourself and I myself— the better we shall be 
prepared for the opportunity which God will give us by 
and by. 

A JUDGE MUST POSSESS PERFECT SELF-CONTROL 

Whoever has not learned to rule his own spirit, is in 
no condition to rule others. Whoever has not learned to 
judge his own heart motives and has not put a restraint 
on them to the best of his ability, is not prepared to sit in 
judgment upon another. Those who are now being 
selected of the Lord are not by nature free from imperfections, 
but have many of the same weaknesses that 
others have. 

Nevertheless, they are seeking to judge themselves, to 
be transformed by the renewing of their minds, to get 
self-control, or as the Bible says, to "overcome." All 
those who will be with the Lord in Kingdom glory and 
power and the work of the Millennial Age will be "more 
than conquerors through Him that loved us" and bought 
us with His own "precious blood."— Rom. 8:37; 
I Pet. 1:18,19. 

Various qualities of murder, lust, covetousness, etc., 
are more or less seen in the unbalanced mental and 
moral conditions resulting from the fall. We see how 
this is operating in the whole world. Some are so mentally 
unbalanced they are put into asylums. Some are so 
morally unbalanced they are not permitted to be at large, 
but must of necessity be put into prison. Others are able 
to be about in the world and have their liberty, but they 
are not sound of mind. "There is none righteous; no, 
not one" (Rom. 3:10), is the Bible declaration. 

Since we have learned to appreciate the Bible teaching, 
to see that a great fall came upon our race six thousand 
years ago, and that all are born in sin and "shapen 
in iniquity and in sin did our mothers conceive us" (Psa. 51:5), 
it gives us a great deal of sympathy for many 
poor people; and as we have more strength of character, 
mentally and morally, than some of them, we thank God 
and say, "Who hath made thee to differ?" 

We were, perhaps, born differently from many; and 
what we did not get by heredity, we got through grace; 
so our strength of character is not of ourselves. It is all 



by God's grace that we are better than others; and it is 
not for us to glory, but to give thanks. So we have sympathy 
for murderers, thieves and vagabonds in general; 
and we believe the Lord has. 

This does not mean that we have the kind of sympathy 
which would say, "Open wide the prison doors and 
let every one out!" No, no! Some who have received 
the Truth while in prison have asked us to intercede in 
their behalf, that they might be released; and we have 
answered that we were not sure but that they were better 
where they are; for in prison there is less temptation 
than in the world. Liberty is a good thing; but it 
brings a responsibility and additional trials as well. 

SIN AND DEATH ARE HEREDITARY 

As we consider the weakness and sinfulness of humanity, 
the question naturally arises, "Why is this so?" 
The Scriptures, not the Evolution theory, give us a satisfactory 
answer to the question. 

When God placed our first parents in the Garden of 
Eden, He made this proposition to them: "If you do 
right, as I command, you may continue to live; but if 
you do wrong, contrary to My command, you shall die." 
Our first parents disregarded the Divine command and 
were disobedient. God immediately sentenced them to 
death. Death was the penalty of disobedience. In other 
words, God said, "If you are a sinner I will not permit 
you to live. Those to whom I wish to grant eternal life 
are those who will gladly obey My Law." For, as Jesus 
said, true worshippers will "worship the Father in spirit 
and in truth; for the Father seeketh such to worship 
Him. "--John 4:23. 

But in addition to having the death sentence passed 
upon him— whether that death come sooner or later- 
Father Adam received other punishment, aside from that 
penalty. Ejected from the Garden of Eden, he was 
brought into contact with thorns and thistles; he labored 
with sweat of face; he had the sorrows and troubles that 
come with the decaying body. All these things were the 
result of sin. 

But so far as God was concerned, the penalty 
of sin was the death sentence merely. In effect God 
had said, "You are not fit to live; you are not fit for 
everlasting life; you shall not have everlasting life." 
But through the sacrifice of His human nature, Jesus, by 
the grace of God, has tasted death for the whole world 

R4991 : page 95 

of mankind— Adam and all his children, all of whom will 
ultimately be redeemed from God's sentence. They will 
be redeemed from death in order that Jesus may, during 
His Messianic reign of one thousand years, lift them up 
out of sin and degradation. 



THE TRANSGRESSOR MAKES HIS OWN WAY HARD 

But do you ever think to what extent man degrades 
himself? To that extent he will be more degraded than 
is necessary; and whenever the time comes for his uplifting, 
the lower he is, the more difficulty there will be in 
getting him up again. Since God's arrangement for lifting 
mankind out of the death condition is that he must 
help himself, each man must labor to rise from his degradation, 
and must be assisted in his labor. But by his own 
efforts he must get out of the difficulty. No man will 
get out by saying, "I would rather be out of this and 
have life." The way back to perfection will be an up-hill 
way. It will not be the narrow way of the present time- 
darkness on every hand, a strait gate, etc.— but a highway, 
an upward way, something favorable to the person 
going up. He cannot roll up, but will be required to put 
forth some effort to get up. He will not be required to 
put forth so much effort in a month or in a year or in 
ten years, as we have to put forth, but he will have a 
good share of the thousand years of Christ's reign in 
which he can gradually rise up out of his imperfection. 

R4992 : page 95 

We, on the contrary, are required to turn from sin to 
righteousness and to make a full sacrifice of ourselves to 
the Lord. Then we must walk in the Narrow Way to 
the best of our ability. In this we have the Master to 
help us; but ours is a short, sharp period of fiery trial; 
and if our trial is hard, we have the assurance that there 
is a great reward to those who come off victorious in 
this battle against self and sin. 

In a word, then, when people die, that is the end of 
things, in one sense of the word, and not an end in another 
sense of the word. When a man is dead he has 
come under the full sentence of the Law, for the Law 
said, "Thou shaltdie." 

THE WORLD'S HOPE IS THE RESURRECTION 

A junk heap represents the condition of humanity, as 
well as it can be represented. Some people will go to a 
junk pile and find a great deal of value there; they can 
do something with this, that and the other thing. Our 
Lord is the greatest Restorer ever known. When His 
Kingdom is set up, He will take over the world of mankind, 
approximately 20,000,000,000 of humanity-Adam 
and his children, all in their broken, fallen condition; 
and then the great work of refreshing and restoring will 
begin. The sawing, the hammering and the filing, if 
you please, will continue during the whole thousand years 
of the Millennial reign. 

So, you see, the condition into which a man gets himself 
now has a great deal to do with his future. Many will 
be so degraded that when they come forth from the tomb 



they will have a very difficult time. Some of these are 
mentioned in the Scriptures. We are told that some will 
come forth to shame and lasting contempt. There are 
many people who will come forth to shame. After they 
had died, many have been found to have been defaulters; 
many people have been found to have indulged in very 
criminal acts; yet perhaps no one knew it while they 
lived. These things came out after their death, and some 
things may not have come out yet; but we may be very 
sure that when the Lord's time shall come for the general 
opening up, there is nothing hidden that will not be 
disclosed. Therefore, keep your records as clear as possible. 
Whatever is there will surely be made manifest, 
is the Lord's declaration of the matter. 

When the world's history shall all be known, some that 
we have thought to be very honest, just people, we may 
find to have been just the reverse; and others who may 
have been thought to be dishonest may be found to have 
been very honest. The judgment of the world is not 
always right. This is one reason why the Lord warns His 
people not to judge at the present time. We are not 
competent now. The Lord will judge in the future. 
When that time comes and the whole world of mankind 
are brought forth to have their trial before the "Great 
White Throne," the books will be opened. Then some 
will have shame, and some will have great contempt, which 
will last just as long as they are contemptible. How long 
will they be contemptible? Just as long as they remain 
in the wrong state of mind. But if they will obey the 
terms and regulations of the Messianic Kingdom they 
will rise daily out of their degradation and meanness, 
coming back more and more to the perfect likeness of 
God in the flesh, as represented in Adam. 

As mankind rise from their fallen condition, so this 
contempt will pass away. At that time people will perhaps 
say, "Well, you know he was a very wicked man in his 
time. He suffered contempt when it was first realized 
what a degraded character he was." Or, "She was a 
wicked woman, but now see what a change has come 
over her! See how well she has gotten along! See 
what effort she is putting forth! See what character she 
is developing!" And all will rejoice to see the change. 

By the end of the Millennial Age, one who was in 
shame and contempt at the beginning will, if he has 
taken the right course, have been lifted up above it. We 
see the principle illustrated in the Scriptures. Saul of 
Tarsus was in shame and contempt because he was a 
murderer and blasphemer. But we do not hold him in 
contempt. Neither do we hold St. Peter in contempt 
because he denied the Lord. At that time it will be said 
of the world just as we say of the Apostles when we 
see what wonderful characters they were afterwards. 
When the world shall have been brought to a knowledge 
of God and His righteousness under the favorable conditions 
of the Kingdom, restitution will take out of them 
all imperfections and give them all the good qualities 



that God originally gave to the perfect man, when God 
said that he was "very good." 

WHO MAY ENTER THE KINGDOM 

But do not the Scriptures say that no murderer shall 
enter the Kingdom of God? Yes. The Scriptures state 
that murderers will not be in the Kingdom, that they will 
be outside— have no part in it— "without are murderers," 
etc. (Rev. 22:14,15.) This statement does not signify 
that a man who has once been a murderer might not 
reform and become a saint and an heir of the Kingdom. 
We have already referred to one murderer mentioned in 
the Scriptures, guilty of the murder of St. Stephen, Saul 
of Tarsus, who afterward became one of the most notable 
Apostles. He was a murderer, the responsibility of 
Stephen's death lay at his feet. He was a member of the 
Sanhedrin and approved of the stoning of Stephen, without 
which approval the latter could not have been stoned. 

So when we read that no drunkard or murderer of 
robber shall enter the Kingdom, the New Jerusalem, how 
shall we understand it? In this way: that when during 
the Millennial Kingdom all mankind shall have the opportunity 
of coming into harmony with God, those who 
maintain a sympathy or love for unrighteousness of any 
kind will not have Divine approval. They will not be 

R4992 : page 96 

permitted to enter within the gate of the City, which 
symbolically represents the Kingdom and the Divine favor. 
Originally, Jerusalem represented the Church. "I will 
show thee the Bride, the Lamb's Wife"; and "the wall 
of the City had twelve foundations [foundation stones], 
and in them the names of the twelve Apostles of the 
Lamb." (Rev. 21:9-14.) But into that City there would 
be brought the good only. 

So all the world of mankind who will come into 
harmony with God will come into that City, into the 
New Jerusalem and Kingdom of God, and outside of 
that City will be found all impure characters. We have 
them pictured in this statement, that liars and murderers, 
etc., shall have their portion in the "lake which burneth 
with fire and brimstone." This "lake of fire and brimstone" 
is as symbolical as is the City. As the City is not a literal 
city of gold, neither is the lake a literal lake of fire and 
brimstone. That City was pictured by Jerusalem, and 
the "fire" by Gehenna. As the offal of the literal city of 
Jerusalem was put into the Valley of Hinnom for destruction 
and for the purification of the city, so all the offal 
of the Millennial Kingdom will be destroyed and be kept 
outside of the Golden Jerusalem. That will be a glorious 
Kingdom, free from anything that would be a blight or 
blemish or sin; and all who love unrighteousness, in any 
sense of the word, will be destroyed in "the lake of fire," 
which is, we are told by the Revelator, the Second Death. 



-Rev. 21:8. 

R4992 : page 96 

"YE ARE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD" 

"Let your light so shine before men that they may see 
your good works, and glorify your Father which is 
in heaven."— Matt. 5:16. 

WE NOTICE that our Lord's statement in this 

text draws a particularly sharp line of 

demarcation between the Church and the 

world. He is not their Father, but our 

Father; it is not their light, but our light. 

The Lord was addressing the Apostles in 

particular and all the "overcomers" of that 

time. But He gives us elsewhere to understand 

that we who believe the testimony of 

the Apostles are counted in as the same 

class, so that these words are applicable to us also today. 

This statement implies that the class which the Lord 

acknowledges as His disciples have some special light that 

marks them out as light-bearers. This light that has come 

to us is the illumination referred to by the Apostle Paul in 

other places. This illumination that we have received is 

the light of the Holy Spirit. 

One does not receive this light when he says, "I will 
lie no more; I will cheat no more; I will blaspheme no 
more." If anyone were in a state of alienation from 
God it would be very proper for him to turn from these 
sins. But turning from sin would not make one a child 
of God. We know a great mistake is generally made in 
the world by thinking thus. There is only one way of 
coming into this relationship of sons, and that is the way 
that the Scriptures set forth— faith in our Lord Jesus 
Christ, full confidence in the Divine arrangement of which 
He is the Center, a faith which works, a faith which 
would lead us to the point of full consecration— baptism 
into His will. It is the strait gate and narrow way. 

THE LIGHT IS THE HOLY SPIRIT 

No one is in the family of the Lord at the present time 
unless this person has entered through the strait gate into 
the narrow way. Such begin to be marked by the Holy 
Spirit, which illuminates their hearts and minds, giving 
them a clearer light on things in harmony with righteousness. 
This illumination, this light which is in us, the 
Lord says we should be careful lest we lose it. If 
that light should go out, we would be in greater darkness 
than we were before. 

In another place it is written, "Quench not the Spirit." 
(I Thess. 5:19). It could be extinguished entirely. We 



are, therefore, to keep it as an evidence that we are children 

R4993 : page 96 

of God. And if this light be in us we should not keep 
it secret, not put it under a bushel. We should not say, 
"We know not the Man"— we know not Jesus. For if 
any one is ashamed of Him, He will withdraw the light 
from such a one. One who is ashamed of Him and His 
cause is ashamed of everything that is right. Such have 
no right to be in the Church; for the Church are to be the 
Body of Christ and joint-heirs in the Kingdom of glory 
and in the work of judging and uplifting mankind. 

So, then, we must not be ashamed and hide our light 
from the masses of men. We have a new illumination. 
We are to set our light upon a candlestick that all within 
the house— our own family, our own household, our 
neighbors— may see it burning; that they may all know 
that we have a light upon the character and Plan of God; 
that we see the difference between sin and righteousness, 
justice and injustice. 

OUR LIVES SHOULD CONFORM TO OUR PROFESSION 

Whoever holds up a light must of necessity confess the 
light he is holding. Of some our Lord said that they 
confess with their mouths, but deny in their lives. We 
are to let our light so shine that it will bring honor to the 
Father's name. This means that our whole lives are to be 
in conformity with the professions we are making, so that 
others will see and say, "Well, that man believes what he 
preaches. It is good that such a person lives in our neighborhood. 
They may not always prefer us for companions, 
for wherever the children of the light go, it has a 
reproving influence. 

Let us not be surprised, then, if when our neighbors 
have a reception and entertainment they say, "We will 
omit their names, for we shall have some wine and some 
good times, and we do not want them in." We are not to 
expect the world to love us. We are not to marvel if it 
goes to the other extreme. Yet not all of the world will 
hate us. Some will criticize and find fault; others will 
notice a consistency and say, "It looks to me as though 
this is genuine." 

We are living epistles, "known and read of all men." 
(2 Cor. 3:2.) The light is conspicuous because the darkness 
is general. We are not to consider this text as being 
in conflict with that which says we are not to let our left 
hand know what our right hand does, nor do our good 
deeds to be seen of men. There is a difference between 
doing our good deeds to be seen of our neighbors, and in 
doing them to be seen of our Father. The person who is 
doing his good deeds to be seen of men will be noticed 
by people in general, who will say, "Well, I do not believe 
that he means half he says. He is a hypocrite." 

But the person who is living to glorify the Father will 



not do good to win applause for himself. Whatever he 
does in the way of charities, or in visiting the sick, etc., 
he will prefer to do it in an unostentatious manner, making 
as little show about his good deeds as possible. Consequently, 
the result will be beneficial to himself and to 

R4993 : page 97 

the person to whom he ministers, for he does these things 
for the glory of God. 

HOW THE WORLD CAN GLORIFY GOD 

The latter part of the text says, "and glorify your 
Father which is in heaven." It was not the Master's 
expectation that the little light which the disciples would 
let shine would have a convincing effect upon the world, 
and that they would all fall down and bow before the 
Father. Even if the whole world knew about the narrow 
way, only a few would be willing to undertake to walk 
in it. Therefore the Lord hides these things from the 
world, and reveals these secret things respecting the great 
"high calling" to the meek, to the humble, to those 
to whom the knowledge would be most advantageous. 

How do the world, then, glorify the Father which 
is in heaven? How would men glorify our Father? We 
answer that there is a difference between vicious, worldly 
people and well-meaning worldly people. We are inclined 
to believe that the majority of mankind, who are in alienation 
from God and who have no ear to hear the message 
of the "narrow way," have, nevertheless, an appreciation 
of righteousness. And if without too much cost they 
could be righteous, just, generous and all that would be 
noble, as represented in perfect humanity, they would like 
to be so. Many of the world have an appreciation of 
nobility in others. They would like to have it themselves. 
The difficulty is that the cost of righteousness is more 
than they are willing to pay. 

This class say, "We approve the righteous way, but at 
the present time it is too difficult. To walk in it would 
mean the blighting of all our hopes and prospects. We 
would have to consider whether we could make such 
transactions as would bring us prosperity. These things 
are too difficult now. If there was just as much reward 
to do right as to do wrong, we would prefer it. We honor 
God. We honor the principles of righteousness. We see 
some of the principles of righteousness exemplified in 
these peculiar people. They are of God. We appreciate 
these things. Indeed, it is the ideal life. They glorify 
God. Evidently God is a righteous God; and we hope He 
will not do too much harm to us. But we cannot let go 
of the things of this world. Perhaps we may become 
saints before we die. Who knows?" So they have the 
idea that they will be neither too saintly, nor too bad! 

ST. PAUL'S LIGHT SHONE BEFORE RULERS 



The influence of light is christianizing, civilizing, 
uplifting and produces a regard for right, an appreciation 
of right and wrong, a respect for God. But we are not to 
think that the building of cathedrals, etc., has had an 
enlightening influence in the world, nor that the members 
of these institutions have the light. They admit, themselves, 
that they are not saints. Only a small number 
in the world have been saints. 

But this minority has had an influence all down 
through these eighteen hundred years— and it is having 
an influence today. Look at Jesus and the Apostles! 
See how the light from their lives and conduct has had 
an enlightening influence upon the world in leading men 
to honor our Father! Every one of the Body of Christ 
all down the Gospel Age has had light, has had influence 
to some extent and has had something to do with scattering 
the darkness and inculcating reverence for the 
Heavenly Father. 

We see an illustration of this in the Apostle Paul, who 
was suffering for righteousness' sake. He was before the 
Roman Governor; and as St. Paul reasoned of righteousness, 
temperance and the coming judgment, or retribution, 
Felix trembled. He apprehended; he was convinced. He 
said, "Here is a man who is living in harmony with these 
principles of righteousness. The life of this man Paul 
shows what right is, and that my life is wrong. And if 
the Lord is to reward right-doing and punish wrong-doing, 
this Paul will get good things from God. But what 
shall I get?" So he trembled. 

There is a natural dread in mankind because they 
know that they deserve punishment. The Scriptures tell 
us that there will be a righteous recompense of reward. 
St. Paul's words were a great blessing to Felix, for that 
light which was shining out of Paul's life and words led 
Felix to see his wrong condition. He might have thought, 
"It will be altogether right for God to give me some 
punishment for my sins." 

Again, as the Apostle was reasoning before Agrippa 
and Festus, Agrippa said, "Almost thou persuadest me to 
be a Christian." St. Paul said, "I would to God that, not 
only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both 
almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds." 
(Acts 26:28,29.) Having the thought pass before his 
mind, however, did not make Agrippa a saint. But he 
had heard the things which led him to appreciate his own 
fallen condition. He saw that St. Paul was suffering for 
right-doing and that he was suffering for wrong-doing. 
He saw that God is a God of justice. 

GOSPEL AGE THE CHURCH'S DAY OF VISIT ATION-THE 
MILLENNIUM THE WORLD'S 

Another Scripture somewhat along the same line reads, 
"Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles 
that.. .they may glorify God in the day of visitation." 



(I Pet. 2:12.) This shows us a distinction between the 
day of their visitation and the day of our visitation. This 
Gospel Age, the present life, has become the day of our 
visitation, when in the Divine favor it is the time of forgiveness 
of our sins and of our being brought into relationship 
with the Father. 

No one can have these blessings now except he can 
exercise faith; otherwise he does not have his day of 
visitation now. "We who believe" and "enter into rest" 
are having our "day of visitation." God has come to us 
now, and has adopted us into His family. And His Plan 
is that if it so be that we are willing to suffer with our 
Lord, we shall also reign with Him in glory. This is our 
visitation day of honor. 

Will the remainder of mankind have a day of visitation 
and honor? Most assuredly so; they will have opportunity 
to avail themselves of the redeeming work of our 
Savior. If their ears are not open now to hear and their 
eyes to see, the day will come when this will be so; if not 
now, in the blessed opportunity we have, then it will come 
by and by. But if we have our day of visitation and 
neglect these things; if after having put our "hand to the 
plow" and having received of the good Word of God, we 
look back; and "if we sin wilfully after that we have 
received the knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no 
more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for 
of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour 
the adversaries" of the Lord.— Heb. 10:26,27. 

But those who do not share in this "day of visitation" 
will have an opportunity of coming into harmony with 
God later. If they cannot be reached by the gentle 
methods mentioned and the visitation by which God is 
calling out the special class now, they will have an opportunity 
in the next Age, when judgment will be laid to the 
line and righteousness to the plummet; when all the 
righteous recompense of reward will be brought to bear, 
to give each one according to his course.

LOVE OF THE BRETHREN A CRUCIAL TEST 

"Behold, how good and pleasant it is for brethren 
to dwell together in unity."— Psa. 133:1. 

PSALM 133 is evidently prophetic and seems 
to refer to the brethren in "the Church, 
which is the Body of Christ." This thought 
is implied in the second verse, which says, 
"It is like the precious ointment upon the 
head, that ran down upon the beard, even 
Aaron's beard, that went down to the skirts 
of his garments," which is a picture of the 
Holy Spirit running down over the Body of 



Christ, the Church. 

The Psalm seems to be specially applicable to our day, 
although it has always been a pleasant sight to see 
brethren dwelling together in unity. In times of persecution 
there would be greater unity, because there would be 
fewer likely to attach themselves to the Church; outside 
persecutions would be likely to deter all but the truly 
consecrated. Such persecutions all would be likely to feel, 
and only those who had common interest and common 
cause would be drawn together. 

But as persecution would cease and as more would 
come into the Church, who were not so zealous, the opportunities 
for differences would seem to increase. Although 
today there is much opposition to the children of light, 
there is, apparently, little persecution. The Truth has attracted 
a number, some of whom, probably, are not all 
that they should be. In fact, none of them are what they 
desire to be— copies of God's dear Son; but each and all 
should be striving to attain to the standard. 

CAUSES OF FRICTION INCREASING 

It might at first seem strange that there would be any 
friction between these favored children of God. One 
would suppose that their hearts would be so filled with the 
Holy Spirit that there would be no room for the weeds of 
hatred, envy, strife, jealousy, and that these would be 
crowded out by the fruits of the Spirit. Perhaps such 
was the condition when we first made our consecration; 
and there was no room for these works of the flesh. But 
it seems that the causes of friction are increasing rather 
than diminishing. It is proper, therefore, that we should 
note the source of the difficulty and thus be enabled to 
ward off the danger and to be peacemakers amongst the 
brethren. "Ye that are strong ought to bear the infirmities 
of the weak." (Rom. 15:1.) If this standard be the 
measure, there are not so many strong as we might have 
hoped; therefore, it behooves each of us to become strong 
and helpful to the weak brethren in the Church. 

One thing to be considered is that there is more opportunity 
for friction amongst those who are spirit-begotten 
New Creatures than there is amongst the world, as a 
whole; that is to say, a company of people in the nominal 
Church would find it easier to live together in unity and 
peace than would a company of people more thoroughly 
enlightened, energized by the Truth. This statement 
might seem strange at first, but becomes more apparent 
as we examine. In the nominal Church religion is more 
a matter of form. With nominal Christians it is customary 
to dress up and attend meetings, to sit quietly and 
then to return home. Pleasant things are noticed, as, for 
instance, the sunshine, the flowers, the bonnets. Thus 
the day passes. But with those more enlightened there is 
a greater activity of mind, of thought. We, too, love the 
flowers, and all things provided for us by our Heavenly 
Father. We discuss these— and there is much opportunity 



for discussion; for as no two persons look exactly alike, 
so no two persons think exactly alike. 

Some of the Lord's people boast that they do their own 
thinking. But the wisest course is for us to do our own 
believing. Some subjects are matters of inference and 
not of knowledge. We are taught of God. He tells us 
thus and so in His Word, and, if we accept these propositions 
as they come from the Lord, we can do so without 
too much discussion. It is pleasant, of course, for us to 
philosophize on the teachings of God's Word; it is our 
privilege to believe that which the Lord has stated to us. 
But whatever philosophizing we do should be kept in 
restraint and in harmony with the Divine statement. And 
when we remember that while we are philosophizing each 
other one is philosophizing also, we see where comes in 
the doctrinal difficulty. 

These different doctrinal matters are drawn from the 
Scriptures. But as soon as we begin to reason about the 
things not written, there is danger of conflict. Whoever 
sticks most closely to the Word of God will thereby not 
only do himself good, but will also be able to avoid controversy 
with other brethren and their philosophies. We 
presume that the Lord would not be averse to our having 
certain reflections along certain lines. We are, nevertheless, 
to remember that if we have a thought and present it 
to the brethren, and it does not seem logical to them, we 
are not to force it upon them, nor are they to force their 
views upon us. The difficulty seems to be that there is 
a tendency in such matters to fight each thought to the 
finish, to want everybody to agree with us, whereas 
the proper way is to be content and let the matter rest. 

Each brother has a right to his own opinion. We have 
no right to make our own views tests. The things that 
are tests are the things given us in the Scriptures; as, for 
instance, it is a test with us and as to our standing with 
the brethren that we should believe that Jesus Christ is 
the Anointed One and the Savior of the world; that we 
are to be joint-heirs with Him and share in His inheritance; 
that we are bought with a price; that we are to 
have share with our Lord in the sufferings of this present 
time and in the glories to follow. 

Such plain Scriptural statements are to be the ground 
of our belief, and not any fanciful interpretations put 
on them by some others. Some see the more general outlines; 
some see the details and fail to see the general 
outline. While those who possess the different casts of 
mind are to be neither blamed nor praised, yet they 
must grasp the thought that we are to be willing to suffer 
for the Truth— in our loyalty to God, to the brethren 
and to the Truth in general. 

THE TRUTH ATTRACTS STRONG CHARACTERS 

We are to remember that these brethren who find it 
so difficult to dwell together in unity have this difficulty 
in part because of their real intrinsic worth, or character. 



There are some people whose characters are like putty; 
there are others in whom you can make a momentary 
dent, as in a rubber ball; still others are like diamonds. 
The class that are diamond-like have attained a firmness 
of texture, of character. If we put a number of balls of 
putty, a number of rubber balls and a number of diamonds 
into a pan and shake them well, the diamonds will 
scratch everything with which they come in contact, 
because they are so hard. The Lord is not looking for 
the rubber ball class now nor for the putty class. In due 
time the Lord will deal with all classes— the people who 
are of the putty kind and the people who are of the 
rubber ball kind. But we know that the Truth is appealing 
now only to the jewel class, the diamond class. 

When learning that there is danger of stumbling each 
other, wounding each other, the knowledge should give 

R4994 : page 99 

us wisdom. We should be appreciative of the fact that 
these brethren have real characters, and that they are not 
of the putty kind. Even their differences show character. 
We should try to appreciate the fact and so to exercise 
ourselves as not to irritate them. We are to counsel 
them, and to remember that they, as New Creatures, are 
just as desirous of pleasing the Lord as we are. We 
must, therefore, have patience with each other. There 
is one text in the New Testament which declares, "We 
know that we have passed from death unto life, because 
we love the brethren." (I John 3:14.) The intimation 
is that some of the brethren would be hard to love, and 
that, unless we had passed from death unto life, we would 
be unable to love them. 

The Truth seems to take hold on the stronger characters 
rather than on the weaker ones. The former 
have in their flesh more of the firmness, grittiness and 
combativeness than have many others, who are too pliable 
and "wishy-washy" to be acceptable to the Lord 
as members of the "little flock" of overcomers. Thus we 
see that the very quality which makes us acceptable to 
the Lord and which is one qualification of the overcoming 
position, is a serious disadvantage in some respects, when 
a number of these come together as a Church. 

Even a diamond surrounded by mud would cut nothing, 
would scratch nothing; but place a dozen diamonds together, 
and the more you get rid of the mud element 
the more gritting, scouring and cutting there is likely 
to be. So it is with the Lord's jewels— the more they 
come together, the more they get wakened up, the more 
opportunities there will be for friction, and the greater 
necessity there will be that all be thoroughly imbedded 
in and covered with the Holy Spirit, which, like oil, is 
smooth and unctuous and tends to prevent friction.

JESUS' SOUL RESURRECTED 

--I CORINTHIANS 15:1-1 l.-APRIL 1 .- 

Text:— "This Jesus hath God raised up, 
whereof we are all witnesses."— Acts 2:32. 

TODAY'S STUDY leaves the words and 

works of Jesus and, appropriate to the 

Easter season, we are to consider our 

Lord's resurrection. At the very outset 

we are confronted with certain errors which 

have gradually crystallized around the central 

truths of God's Word. One of these 

errors is the supposition that the resurrection 

of the dead, which the Scriptures hold 

forth as the hope of the Church and of the 

world, is to be a resurrection of the bodies which go down 

into death. 

This mistake has given ground for Infidelity to sneer 
at this precious doctrine of the Bible. We are asked, 
How could the dust which once constituted the bodies of 
thousands of millions of humanity ever be re-collected 
and rearranged so that we could say that those bodies 
were resurrected? The infidel urges that many of humanity 
have been eaten by fishes and animals, and many 
other corpses have been absorbed by vegetation, which 
in turn has been eaten time and again by man and beast, 
entering into the many organisms. The proposition is 
manifestly unanswerable, yet it does not refute the Bible 
teaching of the resurrection, but merely our creedal misapprehensions 
of the Bible teaching. What the Bible does 
teach is that the real man is the soul, the being, and that 
he persists while gradually his body keeps changing— 
sloughing off. 

Scientists estimate that the human body undergoes a 
complete change every seven years, so that a man fifty 
years old will have lost seven different bodies through 
natural wastes. None of those bodies was the man himself, 
for he is the soul, the intelligent personality, which 
used those different bodies. According to the Bible, the 
process of rejuvenation would have continued everlastingly 
had man by obedience continued in Divine favor 
and in the enjoyment of the everlasting life promised. 
It was sin, therefore, that brought the death penalty— the 
death of the soul. It was Adam's soul that sinned, it 
was Adam's soul that died. "In the day that thou eatest 
thereof thou shalt surely die"; "The soul that sinneth, 
it shall die." 

The result of this Divine sentence upon man would 
have been extinction— he would have been on the same 
plane as the brute, without a provision for eternal life, 
had not God in great mercy provided a redemption— that 
Jesus Christ by the grace of God should taste death for 



every man. The death which Jesus experienced was exactly 
the same kind as the one which destroyed Adam— 
the soul of Jesus died, as the ransom price for the soul of 
Adam (including Adam's posterity). Thus we read of 
Jesus, "He poured out His soul unto death"; "He made 
His soul an offering for sin." 

It is by virtue of this corresponding price which Jesus 
paid that ultimately Adam and all of his posterity, every 
soul of man, will be granted a release from the death 
penalty— a resurrection from the dead. It will be a resurrection, 
not of the dead bodies, but of the dead souls. 
In the resurrection God will give to each soul a body as 
it has pleased Him.— I Cor. 15:38. 

The few during this Age who have become followers 
of Jesus, begotten of the Holy Spirit, will be granted 
spirit bodies like to the Savior's. The remainder of mankind, 
not having been begotten of the Holy Spirit, will 
in the resurrection be granted human bodies, the same 
as they previously had; and their raising up will bring 
them eventually to all the perfection of the first Adam, 
unless they refuse the grace of God, in which event they 
will die the Second Death, from which there is to be no 
resurrection. 

It is because God has provided for such a resurrection 
of the souls of men that the Scriptures speak of humanity 
as not being dead in the same sense that the brute beasts 
are dead— actually. On the contrary, they speak of the 
souls of men as being asleep— awaiting the resurrection, 
when they shall be quickened to life, in conjunction with 
the bodies which God will supply at that time— earthly 
bodies to mankind in general, heavenly bodies for the 
saintly few who will receive the Kingdom. 

JESUS' SOUL RESURRECTED 

St. Peter on the Day of Pentecost declared that the 
Holy Spirit then bestowed came as a result of our Redeemer's 
death and resurrection and ascension on high. 
It proved that He had appeared in heaven on behalf of 
those who desired to be His followers, His Bride class. 
St. Peter argues backwards to prove that while the sacrifice 
of Jesus, finished at Calvary, was to pay for Divine 
reconciliation, nevertheless there could have been no 
reconciliation if Jesus had remained dead. Hence he 
laid stress upon the fact of His resurrection, and he reminds 
us that this was foretold. The Prophet David declared, 
"Thou wilt not leave My soul in sheol, nor suffer 
Thine Holy One to see corruption."— Acts 2:27. 

R4994 : page 100 

St. Peter's quotation of this, in the Greek, substitutes 
the word hades for sheol, showing that the two words 
have the same meaning— the tomb, the state of the dead. 
St. Peter points out that the Prophet could not have used 
the word respecting himself, because his soul was left in 



hades, and his flesh did see corruption. St. Peter said, 
"David has not ascended into heaven, and his sepulcher 
is with us to this day." (Acts 2:34,29.) He proceeds to 
point out that the words were a prophecy of the resurrection 
of Jesus, that His soul, poured out in death as the 
redemption price for Adam's soul and for the race, was 
not left in death, in sheol, in hades, but He was raised 
from the dead. 

St. Paul tells us that "He was put to death in flesh, 
but quickened in spirit." He declared that Jesus, in His 
resurrection, was exalted to a higher than human nature, 
to a higher than the angelic nature— far above angels 
and principalities and powers— the divine nature. 

OUR DIFFICULTY SOLVED 

Many have supposed that the fact that our Lord appeared 
as a man to His disciples after His resurrection 
proves that He is still a human being, "a little lower than 
the angels." This is a great mistake. He was the 
Church's Forerunner, and St. Paul explains the Church's 
resurrection, saying, "It is sown in weakness, it is raised 
in power; it is sown an animal body, raised a spirit 
body." Hence the resurrection of Jesus must have been 
as a Spirit Being. Again we read, "Now the Lord is that 
Spirit. "-2 Cor. 3:17. 

In considering the Lord's eight appearances to His 
faithful ones after His resurrection, we should remember 
that He had two purposes to serve: (1) He wished 
them to know that He was no longer dead. (2) He also 
wished them to know that, resurrected, He was a Spirit 
Being of the highest order, with all the privileges and 
powers that spirit beings like the angels exercise. As 
angels could materialize and appear in the flesh and then 
disappear, and had done so in the past, so did Jesus. In 
order that they might not misunderstand He appeared in 
different forms; on two of the occasions, in forms representing 
the Crucified One; on the six other occasions, 
in various forms, as the gardener, the sojourner, etc. 

In the last verse of our study the Apostle sums up the 
essence of his preaching, saying, "So we preach and so 
ye believe." This, in the first verse of our study, St. 
Paul calls the Gospel; and the word "Gospel" signifies 
"good tidings," which St. Paul and the other Apostles 
preached, namely, that God, in His own due time, four 
thousand years after sin had entered the world, had provided 
a Redeemer, who had died a ransom price for the 
man Adam. The Redeemer had risen that He might, as 
Jehovah's Anointed One, the Messiah, confer upon the 
human race the blessed opportunity for restitution to all 
that was lost in Adam, and redeemed at Calvary. 

But before this could be accomplished, the Church, the 
Bride class, must be selected from amongst mankind, to 
be the Second Adam's Bride, on the same plane of glory 
as the Second Adam, for the regeneration of all the willing 
and obedient to human perfection— all that was lost.

WHICH DAY IS SABBATH? 

--MARK 2:23-3:6. -APRIL 14.- 

Text:— "The Sabbath was made for man, 
and not man for the Sabbath."— Mark 2:27. 

THAT THE BIBLE teaches some important 

lessons respecting the Sabbath is undisputed, 

but what that lesson is is much 

questioned. The fourth commandment of 

the Decalogue refers to the seventh day 

and requires its observance as a day of 

rest, and no more. The Ten Commandments, 

as a whole, were the basis of the 

Law Covenant, compulsory upon every Jew. 

The Jew keeping all of those commandments 

was promised everlasting life. Failure to keep 

them all condemned him afresh. There can be no doubt 

on this point. 

However, in our Lord's time, Jewish religionists had 
become to a considerable degree formalists, and greater 
stress was laid upon the literal commandments than on 
their real spirit, their real meaning. Jesus reproved this 
on several occasions, saying to the Doctors of the Law, 
"You bind heavy burdens upon the people." For instance, 
to hunt for a flea on the Sabbath was construed to be a 
violation of the fourth commandment, a breaking of the 
Sabbath, for it was claimed that the man was hunting as 
truly as though it were a buffalo or a lion. 

Similarly, as mentioned in this lesson, fault was found 
with our Lord's disciples because, passing through a wheat 
field, they rubbed out some of the grains in their hands 
and ate them. This was construed as a violation of the 
Sabbath because it was threshing, winnowing, whether 
the amount was small or great. Jesus did not violate the 
Sabbath ordinance nor teach men so. He was a Jew and 
bound to keep the Sabbath law to the full. He did object 
to such nonsensical misinterpretations as we have 
mentioned. In this study He shows that the Sabbath was 
ordained for man, and that it is a mistake to suppose, as 
some then and some now seem to suppose, that God made 

R4996 : page 100 

man simply to keep the Sabbath. One day of rest to six 
of work was intended for man's comfort and protection, 
and at the same time to symbolize a certain great lesson, 
which we shall note hereafter. 

Jesus, knowing the mental attitude of His hearers in 
respect to ancient customs, supported His teaching by 



citing them to what David did— that in an emergency he 

ate some of the show bread, unlawful except for the 

priests, and that doing so he was not punished, not considered 

blameworthy. Jesus, as the Son of Man, was 

Lord of the Sabbath, and had a right to explain its true 

import. 

Later Jesus went into the synagogue where there was 
a man who had a withered hand and they watched Him 
to see if He would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they 
might accuse Him. Addressing them, Jesus said, "Is it 
lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil, to save 
life or to kill?" They made no answer. The Savior was 
grieved and angry with a righteous indignation that men 
should so seriously mistake and misrepresent the Divine 
arrangement as to think it sinful to relieve human distress 
on the Sabbath. Then He said to the man, "Stretch 
forth thine hand!" It was healed. But the Pharisees, 
more zealous for their theory than for the truth, for the 
letter of the Law than for the spirit of the Law, were 
angry and took counsel with the Herodians how Jesus 
might be destroyed— be killed. 

LORD OF THE SABBATH 

No commandment was given by Jesus or the Apostles 
to the Church respecting the Sabbath day. The early 
Church evidently did observe the Jewish seventh day in 
many places, and in some places the first day of the week, 
the anniversary of the Lord's resurrection; and sometimes 

R4996 :page 101 

they observed both of these days. But their observance 
was not that of law or command, for the Apostle wrote, 
"Ye are not under law, but under grace." They had the 
privilege of keeping either or both of those days holy, 
sacred to the Lord, resting from earthly affairs and giving 
themselves peculiarly to spiritual matters. 

So with us today. We are glad that one day in the 
week is so generally observed as a day of rest or Sabbath 
(Sabbath day signifies rest day). We are glad that the 
day so generally set apart is the first day of the week, because 
it so beautifully commemorates the Christian's 
hope, attested by our Lord's resurrection from the dead 
on that day. And if God's people had two Sabbaths, or 
seven of them in the week, we believe they would have 
that much more of blessing. 

Indeed, to the Christian, every day is Sabbath, every 
day should be used as holy to the Lord, and nothing should 
at any time be done contrary to the Divine will or the 
principles of the Divine Government. Jesus' declaration 
that He was Lord of the Sabbath reminds us afresh of 
St. Paul's declaration that God the Father rested from 
His own work on the Seventh Day; He left the work entirely 
for Jesus to do. The Seventh Day of Jehovah's 
rest was one of the great Days of the Creative Week, 



each seven thousand years long. Six of these great days 
had passed and man's creation was in the end of the sixth. 

Having established His human son in Eden as the god 
or ruler of the earth, Jehovah rested or ceased from His 
work during the Seventh Day or seventh period of seven 
thousand years. Six thousand years of this seventh period 
have already passed and Jehovah God has rested, ceased 
from His work— He has not interfered to assist man or 
lift him out of sin and degradation. Another thousand 
years of the seven remains, but God will not personally 
engage in man's rescue even then. Why not? Because it 
is a part of the Divine Program to leave fallen man and 
his rescue entirely in the hands of Jesus. He is Lord of 
this Great Seventh Day. 

MAN'S SEVENTH DAY 

This entire period of seven thousand years which constitutes 
the great Seventh Day or Sabbath, with God, is 
divided with man into seven great Days of a thousand 
years each, in six of which he has been under a reign 
of sin and death, toil and suffering; but the Seventh, or 
Sabbath of a thousand years, has been appointed for his 
rescue and uplifting and blessing. In that glorious Seventh 
thousand-year period Jesus is to be Lord. It will 
be the great Antitypical Sabbath, and the great Antitypical 
Jubilee for mankind. The six days of toil will terminate 
in the great Sabbath of Messiah's glorious reign 
and the blessing of all the families of the earth. 

THE CHURCH'S SABBATH DAY 

St. Paul clearly intimates that to the Church, the New 
Creation, every day is a Sabbath day, in the sense that 
God's consecrated people rest as God rests, in faith, in 
hope, in trust that Jesus will eventually deliver the groaning 
creation and bring them into a glorious Sabbath, Rest. 
St. Paul says, "We who believe do enter into rest." Literally, 
we who believe have a perpetual Sabbath. Seven 
days in the week, and fifty-two weeks in the year our 
hearts rest in the Lord and take comfort in the glorious 
promises of His Word through faith. Thus we rest from 
feelings of responsibility and worry on account of the 
world's salvation in exactly the same way that the heavenly 
Father rests. 

We, like the heavenly Father, have the fullest confidence 
that the Redeemer will yet accomplish the blessing 
of all the families of the earth, and bring all the willing 
and obedient into the great Rest Time of the future— the 
thousand years of the Messianic Kingdom, in which the 
world will be released from the slavery of Satan, sin and 
death— in which the groaning creation "will be delivered 
from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty 
of the sons of God"— so many as are willing and obedient. 

But while the Church is thus resting by faith and 
now enjoy a Sabbath, even though, according to the flesh, 



we are passing through tribulation hoping to attain a 

share in Messiah's Kingdom, the Apostle points out that 

"There remaineth a rest for the people of God"— still a 

different one from that which we now enjoy. The actual 

rest or Sabbath will be not merely that of faith and rest 

of heart, it will include also a rest from all labor, while 

our works will follow with us. In other words, the resurrection 

change will bring us full relief from the trials, 

the toils of the way, and usher us fully into the glorious 

blessings of the resurrection state. 



R4996 :page 101 

WHY MEN FEAR THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST 

ALL MEN realize that they come short of 
perfection. Additionally, nearly all realize 
that in the past of their lives lie crimes 
more or less serious. In the majority of 
minds fear is instinctive. Under proper 
limitations it is a healthy condition. "Let 
us fear lest a promise being left us of entering 
into His [Divine] rest, any of you 
should seem to come short of it." The 
fear [reverence] of the Lord is the beginning 
of wisdom. "-Heb. 4:1; Psa. 111:10. 

But the Adversary has taken advantage of this proper 
and wholesome fear through what the Apostle terms 
"doctrines of devils." Thus from infancy an abnormal, 
irrational fear has obtained a lodgment in nearly every 
mind, heathen and civilized. Of this fear the Lord, 
through the Prophet, says, "Their fear toward Me is 
taught by the precepts of men." (Isa. 29:13.) These 
"precepts of men," or human traditions, have grossly misrepresented 
God and His Word; and alas! many, even 
Bible students, are seriously handicapped by these devilish 
theories established in a period of ignorance and superstition, 
but supposed to be based upon the Divine Word. 

THE TIME OF RESTITUTION IS THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 

Amongst other false theories respecting the second 
coming of Christ we have the view held by our Adventist 
brethren, that the moment of the Lord's coming will be 
the "crack of doom" to the world and the inhabitants 
thereof— marking the end of hope for all not previously 
brought into relationship with God through Christ, as 
saints. And Adventists are not alone in this theory. 
Practically the creeds of all denominations teach the same 
thought, which is the very reverse of the Scripture 
presentation. 

St. Peter describes the time of the second advent and 
the blessings that will then come to mankind. He says, 
"Times of refreshing [greenness— springtime] shall come 



from the presence of the Lord; and He shall send Jesus 
Christ, which before was preached unto you, whom the 
heaven must receive [retain], until the Times of Restitution 
of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth 
of all His holy Prophets since the world began."— 
Acts 3:19-21. 

The Scriptures teach that Christ Jesus and His glorified 
Church will together "judge the world." (Acts 17:31; 
I Cor. 6:2.) The judging of the world is commonly supposed 

R4997 : page 102 

to signify a condemning, or damning of the world. 
The real thought, however, is that having condemned the 
whole world through one man's disobedience, God has 
arranged that the entire race of Adam shall have a full 
fair, personal trial for life or death everlasting, as a result 
of the redemption accomplished by our Lord Jesus. If 
God had shown no mercy, there would have been no 
redemption and no future judgment. The trial of Adam 
six thousand years ago had its result and its penalty, 
under which sin and death have reigned for six thousand 
years. 

Having provided the Redeemer, God is about to establish 
the Messianic Kingdom for the very purpose of 
giving to all humanity a special, personal opportunity for 
reformation, uplift, sanctification and the attainment thus 
of life everlasting. Only the preliminary steps of this 
great plan have yet been taken: 

(1) The Redeemer has died, the Just for the unjust. 
-I Pet. 3:18. 

(2) He has appeared in the presence of God for us, 

the Church, and thus, as our Advocate, has made it possible 
for us to become His Bride, or, under another figure, 
"members of His Body."-Heb. 9:24; 2 Cor. 11:2; 
I Cor. 12:12. 

(3) This offer, or opportunity for the Church, has 
separated from the world all those who accept this High 
Calling. They become Spirit-begotten children of God 
and, prospectively, joint-heirs with Jesus. They now 
share with the Redeemer in sacrificing the earthly life 
and, if faithful, will by and by be granted a share with 
Him in the glorious work of His Kingdom— the judging 
of the world— the giving of the world a fair, impartial 
trial for life everlasting or death everlasting.— Rom. 8:17. 

"WHO SHALL STAND WHEN HE APPEARETH?" 

However, there is another side to this question. The 
Scriptures indicate that at His Second Coming only the 
saintly ones will be ready to receive the Master with joy; 
that at that time the masses of mankind will be so associated 
with sin and injustice that, instead of being worthy 
of His approval, their course in life will come under 
reprobation and stripes. Hence, it is written, "Go to now, 
ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall 



come upon you"; "Woe unto you that are full now."— 
Jas. 5:1; Luke 6:25. 

Babylon the Great is to fall; and the wonderful institutions 
of civilization, which are partly good and partly 
bad, will be found only partly satisfactory to the new King 
and the rulers of His Government. This will mean that 
many who are now stewards of wealth, influence, position, 
honor of men, etc., will be called to account and dispossessed 
of their stewardship. Their realization of their 
losses is figuratively represented in the Scriptures as wailing 
and howling and misery, as that class will suffer the 
loss of practically all upon which they are now setting 
their affections. 

We are not saying that the poor are more righteous 
than the rich, but this class are more numerous; and 
those who have little of this world's goods and who are 
used to trials and scarcity will probably feel less the great 
time of trouble impending than will some who have long 
rested in the lap of luxury. 

Under various symbolic figures the Bible graphically 
pictures this day of trouble which is approaching— as a 
whirlwind, as a fire, as a tempest, as a flood, as a "time of 
trouble such as never was since there was a nation." That 
this great day is near, and "hasteth greatly," has been distinctly 
shown recently and is shown again today in the labor 
disturbances of Great Britain. There a startled world 
has been given a glimpse of the fires of passion and anger 
and resentment which are smouldering beneath the surface 
and which will shortly envelop the world in a fiery 
trial, the like of which the past has never known.— 
Dan. 12:1. 

"HE SHALL JUDGE THE WORLD IN RIGHTEOUSNESS" 

From this standpoint the apprehensions of mankind 
are well based in respect to the Great King's disapproval 
of much that is carried on in the world in the name of 
civilization, yea, in the Master's own name! But let us 
not dwell too much upon this side of the question. "Sufficient 
unto the day is the evil thereof." Let us rather 
point men to the glorious silver lining to that dark cloud 
which draws daily nearer and nearer. Let us point men 
to the glorious blessings of Messiah's Kingdom, and teach 
them to pray, "Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done," 
and to strive to understand and appreciate the principles 
governing that Kingdom; peradventure they may pass 
through the time of trouble with the less injury. 

Hearken to the words of the Prophet (referring not at 
all to the Church, which is accounted worthy to escape 
those things coming upon the world, but speaking to 
mankind in general and exhorting the better element of 
the world), "Seek righteousness, seek meekness; it 
may be that ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord's 
anger." (Zeph. 2:3.) It surely will be true that the 
more meek and more righteous men may be the better 
they will be prepared for the awful shock and terrible distress 



of that day of trouble, which as a plowshare will 
prepare the hearts of mankind to receive the good seed- 
the Message of Divine Truth and Grace, which then 
will be made known to every creature.

QUESTIONS RE ATONEMENT 

A DEAR BROTHER asks some questions, the 
answers to which, we believe, will be helpful, 
both to himself and to others— either 
by confirming their understanding of the 
Truth or by correcting misunderstanding. 
We trust that the answers will be helpful 
to many of our readers:— 

Question.— Would it be right to say that 
all the merit of our Lord's sacrifice is 
imputed to each and every individual when 
Scripturally he becomes a believer? 

Answer.— No; the entire merit of our Lord's death 
was already in the hands of Justice when Jesus ascended 
up on high, but it was not applied in any degree nor to 
any person. According to the Divine intention that merit 
is to be applied for Adam's original sin and for all the 
sins of his children, which are the result directly or indirectly 
of original sin. Thus we might say that every 
member of Adam's race has a personal, individual interest 
or share in that redemptive merit, coming to him by 
Divine arrangement. 

Our Lord left the early Church with the instruction 
that they should tarry at Jerusalem for the anointing of 
the Holy Spirit, the evidence of their forgiveness of sins 
and of their adoption as children of God. He ascended 
on high and appeared in the presence of the Father— for 
the entire Church of the First-borns. The imputation of 
His merit was for them all, as well as for the representative 
few of the Lord's followers who waited for the 
blessing in the "upper room." 

R4997 : page 103 

Question.— You have pointed out that no less than 
the full merit of Christ would be sufficient for the sins 
of any individual of the human family. How, then, shall 
we think of sub-dividing this merit amongst these various 
individuals composing the Church of the First-borns and 
amongst the individuals who will compose the restitution 
class of the future? 

Answer.— The placing of the entire merit of Christ 
in the hands of Justice guarantees to Justice a full satisfaction 
for all the Adamic weaknesses of all mankind- 
even before that merit is specifically appropriated. And 
since the Church was a part of the world, for whom the 



sacrificial merit is a sufficient price, God could be just in 

imputing to each one coming in the name and merit of 

Jesus a sufficiency of His merit to make up for the imperfections 

and shortcomings; and so of this entire class 

—"the Church of the First-borns." The imputation of this 

merit to the Church as separate and apart from the world 

engages and obligates that merit for awhile in making 

good the imperfections of the flesh of the Church, so as to 

permit this class to offer to God a justified, and, therefore, 

an acceptable sacrifice. 

But this is merely imputed or loaned to the Church, 
because the Church does not wish to keep the earthly rights 
of Jesus. The Church wishes to sacrifice its all and thus 
to follow the example of Jesus. And the great High 
Priest imputes to them enough of His merit to make the 
Church's offering acceptable when offered by the High 
Priest. When all of the Church of the First-borns shall 
have attained to the rewards of the spirit nature, all of 
the merit of the High Priest, Jesus, will be released, so 
far as they are concerned— the whole amount will again 
be free in the hands of Justice, as it was when Jesus 
ascended up on high. 



R4998 : page 103 

Question.— Would it be correct to say that the merit 
of Christ cannot be compared to a garment or robe until 
after consecration? 

Answer.— A robe is a covering. The wedding robe of 
the parable represents our Lord's merit imputed to His 
people as a covering for their blemishes or imperfections 
of the flesh. This robe takes cognizance of the Church 
as the prospective Bride who acknowledges the Headship 
of Jesus her Lord. Another figure represents the members 
of the Church as wearing white robes and hoods or bonnets, 
the illustration of the under-priesthood. In this 
figure the priests represent the brethren or Body members 
and indicate that they are not independent, but under and 
subject to the Headship of Jesus. 

The robe of Christ's righteousness imputed to the 
Church as a covering for her blemishes and to make 
her acceptable gives place to or becomes transformed 
into a robe of her own righteousness, in the resurrection. 
As our Lord Jesus is represented as robed in white linen, 
so the Bride is pictured as arrayed in fine linen, "the 
righteousness of the saints." The imputed robe merely 
covers our fleshly blemishes and imperfections in the 
present time. 

The new body which God will give us in the 
resurrection will be perfect of itself and need no imputation 
of the merit of Jesus. The spirit body of those 
who will attain to the "first resurrection" will be absolute, 
complete, perfect, as was the resurrection body of Jesus. 
The robe of Christ's righteousness, imputed to cover our 



fleshly imperfections, we will need no more, because we 
will no longer have the fleshly imperfections. 

The new robe is said to be embroidered. And this 
figure carries with it our endeavors at the present time 
to develop the character-likeness of Jesus— to perfection, 
in the spirit. As we read, "It (the New Creature, the 
soul) is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is 
sown in dishonor, raised in glory; it is sown an animal 
body (needing the imputation of Jesus' merit); it is raised 
a spirit body" (in full possession of a merit of its own). 



Question.— Will any of those found worthy of a place 
in the Bride company wear Christ's robe of righteousness? 

Answer.— We understand that all who make the consecration 
do so and are accepted, in one hope of their 
calling, and that that one hope is the hope of being a 
member of the Bride class and joint-heir with Christ. 
The fact that there will be a "great company" is a special 
favor ordained of the Lord in the interest of those who do 
not prove sufficiently zealous to be counted in with Jesus 
as "more than conquerors." 

The "great company" of Revelation 7:9 is composed of 
such as fail to come up to the highest standard of sacrifice 
required of the Lord, but who, nevertheless, will 
prove not unfaithful in their final test. These are said 
to have not kept their garments unspotted from the world; 
hence the requirement that they shall wash them in the 
blood of the Lamb— prove their loyalty under discipline 
and stress, having failed to prove it by voluntary obedience 
unto sacrifice. Thus both the Bride and her virgins who 
follow her all wear the Bridegroom's robe (justification) 
in the present life. And all in the future life will attain 
perfection on their own account. 

This imputed robe will not be needed by the "great 
company" after they shall have experienced their "change" 
to the spirit condition; for they, too, will be changed, in 
a moment and thereafter possess an individual perfection 
of their own. 



Question.— Will not the Church when she shall have 
passed under the veil have all the merit of Christ in her 
hand to put on the mercy-seat? 

Answer.— No; the Church has nothing whatever to do 
with atoning for sin, even as the under-priests had nothing 
whatever to do with the presentations of the Day of 
Atonement blood on the propitiatory. 

A correct view of the matter, we believe, is this: The 
High Priest, Jesus, ascended on high and made imputation 
of His merit to the Church. Those who waited in 
the "upper room" for the Pentecostal blessing had presented 
themselves before God, desiring to be accepted of 
Him as sacrifices. They did not sacrifice themselves, 



they merely presented themselves for sacrifice. Thus 
we read, "I beseech you, brethren, that you present your 
bodies living sacrifices." The presentation matter is ours, 
not the Lord's; the acceptance of the offering as a sacrifice 
is wholly the Lord's— the High Priest's work. With the 
acceptance of our flesh as a sacrifice we cease to be as 
men and thenceforth in the sight of God and of each 
other we are living members of the Anointed One— the 
High Priest. 

The High Priest accepted the Church as a whole 
through its presentation at Pentecost. And in harmony 
with the Scriptures we come into this favor or 
grace, which remains open until the last member of the 
Body of Christ shall be perfected and pass beyond the 
veil. The work beyond the veil will not be ours as under-priests. 
It will be the work of the High Priest to sprinkle 
the blood of the Lord's goat as He sprinkled the blood of 
the bullock. The figure of the "Bride" is to be distinctly 
eliminated in any thought of sacrifice, and is to be merely 
associated with the Redeemer and Bridegroom, as joint-heir 
in His Kingdom. The figure of the under-priests 
is the one which applies to the Church in respect to all 
sacrificial matters.

"YE WERE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE" 

(I CORINTHIANS 6:20.) 

IT WILL BE noticed that the Apostle refers, 

not to the world, but to the Church in the 

statement, "Ye were bought with a price, 

even the precious blood of Christ." Other 

Scriptures tell us that "Jesus Christ, by the 

grace of God, tasted death for every man" 

—that He redeemed the world. We are to 

remember, however, that this work of redemption 

covers centuries. Promises respecting 

it were made long centuries before 

Jesus came. He accomplished a certain portion of the 

work— the all-important part of giving Himself a Ransom 

price for all— laying down His life. 

But while His life was thus laid down, to be the price 
of the sins of the whole world, it has not yet been applied 
for the world's sins. If it were, then the world would no 
longer be under Divine condemnation, "children of 
wrath," but would in some sense of the word be back in 
fellowship with God. The price laid down by the Redeemer 



at Calvary is eventually to be made applicable to the sins 
of the whole world, but not yet. It will not be made 
applicable to the whole world until after the gathering 
out of the world— of all nations, classes— the Bride of 
Christ, the "elect." 

In harmony with this we read that our Lord Jesus 
after His resurrection ascended up on high, there to appear 
in the presence of God for us— for the household of 
faith— not for the world. Hence any blessing, and reconciliation 
with God, any arrangement of Divine favor 
and everlasting life, is not open to the world, but merely 
to believers, the "household of faith": "To us who believe 
He is precious"; "We have an Advocate with the 
Father, Jesus Christ, the Righteous." Unbelievers have 
no Advocate with the Father, and consequently have no 
forgiveness of sins, no reconciliation, but are still under 
the condemnation of death. "We have escaped the condemnation 
that is on the world." 

How fully these different texts of the Divine Word 
dovetail with each other and with the facts! We have 
peace; the world has no peace. God is our Father; the 
world is under condemnation, and are "children of wrath," 
under sentence of death, and not recognized by the Creator 
in the present time, although the Scriptures show us that 
He has very gracious plans and arrangements for mankind 
in general by and by— during the Messianic reign of Jesus 
and the Church, His Bride. Then, in this class, the Seed 
of Abraham (Gal. 3:29), all the families of the earth will 
be blessed. 

THE WORLD IS NOT YET BOUGHT 

Would it be right, some one inquires, to say that the 
world is "bought with a price"? We answer that it would 
not be strictly right to say, but we need not quarrel 
with those who fail to state the matter in exactly the 
proper language. Rather, we might surmise that they are 
speaking of things that are not yet accomplished as though 
they were already finished. God assures us that in due 
time the price which our Lord laid down at Calvary will 
be made applicable to the world under the gracious terms 
of the New Covenant, which He will make first with 
Israel. Nevertheless, the point stands out clearly and distinctly 
that thus far the Ransom-price has not yet been 
applied to any members of Adam's race except the household 
of faith— believers. All things belong to these. 
Nothing belongs to the world as yet. 

The privilege granted to the Church through her great 
Redeemer and Advocate is that His merit imputed to her 
permits her to share with Him in His sacrifice of the 
earthly nature, and to become joint-heirs with Him in 
His glorious arrangements of glory, honor and immortality 
on the Divine plane. 

When we speak of the Church of the First-born we 
are to remember that the words carry us back to the 
typical first-borns, who were delivered from death on 



the occasion of the first typical Passover. There the 
first-borns of Israel were passed over or spared when 
other first-borns perished. Subsequently, they were all 

R4999 : page 107 

exchanged for the one tribe of Levi, which thereafter 
was the tribe of the first-borns, and as such was set 
apart for Divine service in connection with the Tabernacle, 
and later the Temple. They were not all priests, 
though this was the priestly tribe. Only a few out of 
the whole number were selected for the priesthood. So it 
is with the Church of the First-borns; they will all be 
overcomers, they will all be loyal and faithful to God, 
but only a "little flock" will be found specially saintly, 
holy, acceptable unto God through Christ, and these will 
be the antitypical Priests: "Ye are a Royal Priesthood." 
-I Peter 2:9. 

Hence James declared (1:18), "Ye are a kind of 
First-fruits unto God of His creatures." Of course, our 
Lord Jesus was primarily the First-fruits of all God's 
creatures. Secondarily, the Bride class will be a part of 
that First-fruit company. Then there will be a large company 
of saintly people who will come through "great tribulation," 
"will wash their robes and make them white in the 
blood of the Lamb," and attain the spirit nature. These 

R4999 : page 108 

also will be a part of the First-fruits of God to the spirit 
nature— all on the spirit plane. Then will come God's 
favor to mankind in general— the after-fruits of His 
earthly creation— a great company, gathered during the 
Millennium. All of the evil doers and corrupters of the 
earth will be destroyed, but those in full perfection will 
be a glorious fruitage unto God. 

St. Paul writes respecting the resurrection of "every man 
in his own order"— his own band or company. The first 
of the earthly nature to experience resurrection— that is, 
a full resurrection, or raising up completely out of death 
and imperfection— will be the Ancient Worthies, but they 
will not be part of the First-fruits unto God of His creatures, 
for they will be, with the remainder of mankind, 
regenerated by The Christ, the Giver of everlasting human 
life, secured at the cost of His own sacrifice. With all the 
remainder of humanity, they will come under the terms 
of the New Covenant. Indeed, they will be the first to 
be blessed by that New Covenant arrangement. But since 
the Divine Programme deals with the world as a whole, 
Messiah will not deliver up any portion of the world, 
even those perfected, until the end of the thousand years 
of His reign of glory and restitution. Consequently, the 
Ancient Worthies will belong to the "after-fruits"— the 
human fruitage of the Divine Plan connected with our 
earth. 

At the close of the thousand years, when Messiah 



shall have completed the work of restitution for all the 
willing and obedient, and shall destroy in the Second 
Death all refusing to make progress toward righteousness, 
then the Mediator steps out from between God and 
men and leaves the world exposed to the full demands 
of Divine Justice in letter and in spirit. This will not 
mean their injury, because in perfection humanity is quite 
capable of being and doing all that Divine Justice requires. 
The whole world then being perfect there will be 
no excuse necessary for any of them, and hence no mediation 
on behalf of any will thereafter take place. 

It will be at that time, after the Mediatorial Kingdom 
shall have passed, and Jesus shall have delivered up the 
Kingdom to the Father (I Cor. 15:27), that Satan, the 
personification of evil, will be loosed from his prisonhouse 
for a little season— to tempt, to test, to try, to prove 
all those that dwell upon the face of the whole earth. 

In the thousand years of Messiah's Kingdom they will 
be shielded from all outside temptations and will be helped 
over and forgiven the imperfections of the flesh, while 
attaining the fleshly perfection. But at the close of the 
thousand-year period, having attained the perfection of 
the flesh, and having had large experience with sin and 
righteousness, good and evil, it is as proper that they 
should be tested as that Adam was tested in the beginning 
—tested to see whether or not the lessons, blessings, experiences 
and opportunities have fully committed them 
as lovers of righteousness and haters of iniquity. If these 
have then the trials that will come upon them through the 
permission of sin and temptation will be met accordingly, 
with loyalty to God, to the truth and to righteousness. All 
such will gain the victory over the temptations. 

But such as really at heart still love sin will be entrapped 
and ensnared and manifested. Then the trials or 
judgments from Heaven will destroy them and Satan, 
that the world may be cleansed of all who love sin, and be 
enjoyed thereafter only by such as love righteousness 
and hate iniquity. 

True, God knowing the heart, could judge all of those 
people without any testing by Satan, but many of His 
creatures, unable to read the heart, might wonder respecting 
the Divine Justice which would smite down 
some of their fellows who outwardly were righteous, and 
they might consequently be continually in fear and trepidation 
lest they should thus be smitten down; hence the 
Almighty has adopted the method of making this temptation 
open and above board, to be witnessed by angels and 
men. Thus it was with Adam in his trial, in his sentence, 
and in the execution of the penalty. Thus it will be at the 
close of the Mediatorial reign of Christ. Those who then 
sin wilfully will be violators of the New Covenant and 
will die accordingly, just as Adam violated the Covenant 
under which he was placed, perfect, holy and with the 
promise of everlasting life. 

The fact that this testing of mankind will be after the 
end of the thousand years of the Mediator's reign, when 



He shall have delivered up the Kingdom to the Father, 
does not prove that the glorified Jesus will have nothing 
to do with the destruction that will come upon Satan and 
those obedient to Him. Quite to the contrary. As Jesus 
was the Divine Agent, Instrument, Word, Mouthpiece, 
Logos, in all the work of creation, and prior to undertaking 
the Mediatorial work, so, highly exalted now in honor, 
next to the Father, and at His right Hand of Power, 
He will undoubtedly be the Father's Representative in 
that judgment upon the wilful sinners, who with Satan 
will be consigned to the Second Death. 

Here the question may arise in the minds of some, 
What did the Apostle mean when he said in I Corinthians 15:25,26, 
"He must reign until He hath put all enemies 
under His feet; the last enemy that shall be destroyed 
is death"? 

The Apostle is speaking of those things which are 
against or contrary to mankind— those things which hinder 
men from keeping the Divine Law, and thus being in full 
harmony with their Creator. Every such thing is an 
enemy, and is to be destroyed and be put out of the way 
—ignorance, superstition, vice, human weaknesses, are 
some of the enemies of righteousness, and, therefore, enemies 
to the best interests of humanity. Death is such an 
enemy, because it is death working in us that causes all 
of our difficulties. 

All the imperfections, whether moral, or physical, or 
mental, are the workings of death. Because death is thus 
working in humanity, therefore the righteously intentioned 
cannot do the things that they would. The work 
of Messiah's reign will be to put down, to put away, not 
only other oppositions, but this opposition of the workings 
of death. Gradually mankind will be lifted up, up, 
up, out of all that weakness, out of death, to the full 
perfection of his being. Then death will be destroyed— 
the Adamic death, which came upon all men through one 
man's disobedience, and which is to be canceled, done 
away completely, because of Christ's obedience, even unto 
death. 

Only toward the close of that thousand years of the reign 
of the great Mediator will this work of completely overthrowing 
death be accomplished. Then all mankind will 
have been delivered, not only from the tomb, but from 
every shade and degree of death— the whole world will be 
alive in the same sense that Adam was alive before death 
passed upon him, or he was affected by the sting of sin. 

Then the Kingdom will be turned over to the Father. 
Those who will die during the thousand years, as wilful 
evil doers, will die the Second Death. It is not an enemy 
of man; it is the righteous sentence of a righteous God 
in the interest of His creatures— those who wilfully prefer 
sin shall be destroyed from amongst the people, because 
their influence will be to corrupt the earth. The Second 
Death, therefore, is not included amongst the enemies, 
and is not the death that Jesus will destroy. 



R4999 : page 109 

Neither is Satan one of the enemies whom Jesus will 
then destroy. He was an enemy before man sinned, and 
his rebellion was not brought about by man's sin. He was 
subject to Divine authority before man was created, and 
will be a subject of Divine authority after man shall have 
been redeemed and restored. It will not be for the Mediator 
to deal with him, but for Divine Justice to determine 
his deserts. Besides, it is said that he will be destroyed in 
the Second Death, in the death from which there will be 
no redemption, no resurrection, no recovery.

MOSES AS A MEDIATOR 

THE LAW COVENANT instituted at Mount 
Sinai was not made with Moses, but with 
the people of Israel, as Moses declared: 
"And Moses called all Israel, and said unto 
them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments 
which I speak in your ears this day, 
that ye may learn them, and keep and do 
them. The Lord our God made a Covenant 
with us in Horeb. The Lord made not this 
Covenant with our fathers, but with us, 
even us, who are all of us here alive this day."— 
Deut. 5:1-3. 

Moses was merely the mouthpiece of that Covenant. 
The word Mediator signifies, go-between; as Moses said, 
"I stood between God and you." (Deut. 5:5.) The terms 

R5000 : page 109 

of the Covenant and the arrangements of the Mediator 
place the responsibility upon the Mediator as the representative 
of the people, and as the representative of God 
to the people. 

Correspondingly Christ is the Mediator of the New 
Covenant. He is not yet completed. The Head has finished 
His work, ascended to glory, and has become the 
Advocate of those who desire to become members of His 
Body, and for eighteen centuries God has been receiving 
the members of the Body of Christ, the Mediator, into 
relationship with Himself. Soon the last member of the 
foreknown and foreordained number of the elect will have 
been called, accepted and found faithful; and then this 
Age will end, because the great Prophet, Priest, King, 
Judge and Mediator will be complete. And more than 
this: He will have finished His sacrifice— the sacrifice 
of the flesh, the merit of which is to go to Israel and the 
world, under the terms of the New Covenant: "They shall 
obtain mercy through your mercy."— Romans 11:31. 



So it was in the type. Before the Law Covenant was 
inaugurated, Moses took bulls and goats and slew them 
and used the blood thereof for the sprinkling of the Tables 
of the Law, representing the Almighty and His obligations 
to the Covenant, and then he sprinkled the people, bringing 
them under the obligations of the Covenant. The 
antitype of this is that immediately after The Christ is 
glorified beyond the veil, He will apply the merit of His 
sin-atonement of Calvary for the satisfaction of the whole 
world, and as the basis of the New Covenant which will 
be inaugurated with Israel, as promised.— Jeremiah 31:31. 

TO THE JEW FIRST IS THE DIVINE ARRANGEMENT 

The sprinkling of Israel will come first— "To the Jew 
first" is the Divine arrangement, as the offer of the privilege 
of becoming members of Spiritual Israel was 
first offered to the Jews. But it will not cease with them. 
Many nations will be sprinkled— all who will. 
The knowledge of the glory of the Lord will fill the 
whole earth, and many nations shall say, "Come, let us go 
up to the house of the Lord; He will teach us of His way, 
and we will walk in His paths, for the Law shall go forth 
from Mount Zion (the heavenly or spiritual Kingdom) 
and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem" (the earthly 
phase of the Kingdom, represented by the Ancient Worthies, 
whom Messiah will make Princes, or rulers, in all 
the earth). 

It will be seen that while it took but a moment to 
sprinkle the Tables of the Law, it must have taken Moses 
a considerable time to sprinkle all the people, numbering 
millions. And, in the antitype, that work lasts for a 
thousand years. During the entire thousand years of the 
reign of Christ upon His Mediatorial Throne the work of 
sprinkling the people— the work of justifying them, making 
them acceptable, cleansing them from sin, and bringing 
them into relationship with the Covenant and its demands 
of perfect obedience— will be in process. At the 
close of the thousand years, when all the people shall have 
been sprinkled— when all who desire to avail themselves 
of God's gracious arrangement through Christ shall have 
done so— the Mediatorial Kingdom will come to an end; 
having finished its intended work the disloyal and disobedient 
will be destroyed in the Second Death. Thenceforth 
the New Covenant between God and men will remain 
a perpetual Covenant. Through all eternity it will 
be true that Jesus was the Mediator of that Covenant, 
but His mediatorial office will not continue. 

"STILL BELOVED FOR THE FATHERS' SAKES" 

So it was in the case of Moses: The Law Covenant 
which he mediated was binding both upon God and Israel 
for a time whether Moses lived or died. Long after his 
death it was still spoken of as the Mosaic Law Covenant, 
and Moses was referred to as the one who mediated that 



Covenant. Since the people could not fulfil the demands 
of the Law, they could not have the everlasting life which 
it promised, but instead received its curse or condemnation 
of death. The atonement day, year by year, took 
knowledge of this fact and typically made satisfaction 
for the sins of the year, and gave the Israelites another 
year's opportunity in God's favor, to try whether or not 
they could obey the Law and gain everlasting life. But 
since the Temple has been destroyed, and the Jewish 
Priesthood lost, they have had no further repetition of 
the atonement day sacrifices for now more than eighteen 
centuries, and hence, for all this period of time, they are 
completely cut off from manifestations of Divine favor. 
The Apostle, however, assures us that they "are still beloved 
for the fathers' sakes," and that in the Divine Plan 
a blessing is yet to come to them. 

That blessing will come to them under the New Covenant, 
established by the Better Mediator. All who will 
accept Him and the gracious arrangements of His Mediatorial 
Kingdom will attain the highest blessings promised 
to their nation, and become associated in the Kingdom, 
which for a thousand years will bless all people with the 
gracious opportunity for returning to Divine favor on the 
same terms— obedience to the extent of ability and faith 
in the Redeemer. 



"Bride and Bridegroom, then appearing, 
Shall illuminate earth's gloom; 

And the nations will be shouting, 

Lo! our King! make room, make room. 

O! the times of glad refreshing, 
Soon shall bring a sweet release, 

Through the glorious reign of blessing, 
Through the mighty Prince of Peace."

BEWARE OF PRIDE IN THE HEART 

"Every one that is proud in heart is an 
abomination to the Lord."— Prov. 16:5. 

PRIDE IS VERY DECEITFUL and frequently 
cloaks or covers itself with humility. 
Because of our own imperfections it 
is well for us not to become judges of 
others, but merely limit our judgment to 
the outward manifestations. The Lord says, 
"By their fruits ye shall know them." 
(Matt. 7:20.) We are to judge the outward 
conduct, but we cannot go beyond 



and say what is of the heart. Errors 

of judgment are not an abomination to the Lord. He may 
look upon mistakes with sympathetic eyes. People are 
not responsible for those qualities which have come down 
to them by inheritance. Without judging individuals we 
may see certain conduct sometimes which may seem to be 
pride, yet is not pride. 

We have seen people who have a great lack of self-esteem, 
a great lack of vanity, but who may have large 
approbativeness. They do not think so much of themselves 
as they wish others to think of them. They say, 
"If people knew me as I know myself, I would simply be 
a cypher in the world." There is a certain amount of 
truth in this. People with small self-esteem are often 
taken to be proud, when it is really not the case. In trying 
to look as though they were somebody they will carry 
themselves as though they thought they were everybody. 
Such persons are simply laboring in an unfavorable condition 
in which they were born. We cannot think that the 
Lord would abominate them. They are very often little 
to themselves and very humble with the Lord. Yet they 
try to make themselves appear in as favorable a manner 
as possible. We must admit that there is a propriety in 
this to a certain extent. It is wise for them to try to 
overcome their weaknesses of nature. They should try to 
think soberly of themselves (that is, to be of sound mind), 
and they should try not to overdo matters. They must 
act with meekness, as well as feel and think meekly. 

There is another class who have a large amount of 
self-esteem, yet who think, "I do not wish others to know 
that I have this high opinion of myself, therefore I will 
cloak it. I will endeavor to speak very humbly. The 
Scriptures say that we should be humble, therefore when 
I speak of anything I will try to speak from this standpoint." 
Such people very frequently get a gloss of 
humility of an outward kind. Some people really think 
that this course is right. If they are sincere in their conduct, 
we cannot suppose that the Lord would abhor them. 

Our thought, then, is that in this text "The proud in 
heart" are the haughty-minded— those who feel haughty 
toward others and are not sympathetic, who think of 
themselves more highly than they ought to think, who 
despise others. The heart of such a one is not that which 
God could love or that anyone could love; it is an abomination 
in the Lord's sight. 

WHY PRIDE IS AN ABOMINABLE TRAIT 

An abomination is that which is extremely displeasing 
—that which is repulsive— that which a person should not 
wish to entertain— should not harbor— must reprove. 
There must be some reason why God declares Himself 
thus in opposition to pride. We perceive that no one 
really has anything whereof to be proud. As the Apostle 
suggests in one place (I Cor. 4:7), "What hast thou that 
thou didst not receive? Now, if thou didst receive it, 



why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?" 
What have we that we have not received of the Lord? 
If whatever we have received is a gift, where is our 
right to be proud of it? Evidently, such would be a very 
wrong condition of mind to be in— to be proud of things 
not our own, not of ourselves, but a gift. 

There is, therefore, no reason for any to be proud; 
but there is every reason to be thankful to the Great 
Giver of all good. And that which is true of us is true 
also of the angels. Hence, there is nothing in all the 
Universe for any of God's creatures to be proud of. 

R5001 :page 110 

Whatever conditions they are in are not of themselves. 
God seems to have arranged the conditions for humility, 
so that there could be no ground for pride. 

Pride is merely selfishness, self-laudation; and selfishness 
is another name for sin. Sin and selfishness, therefore, 
are in opposition to the Divine Character and the 
Divine Plan— totally in opposition to it. It is, therefore, 
the right and proper thing that God should have the proud 
in detestation. Not having used His blessings aright, they 
could not have His favor. Whether they be proud of 
mental attainments, proud of physical strength, proud of 
wealth or ancestry, or proud that their "ancestors were 
monkeys," matters not. It is all pride, and an abomination 
to the Lord. 

THE MOST DETESTABLE FORM OF PRIDE 

But evidently the most detestable form of pride is pride 
in the Church— as though we had made the Plan and 
could boast in it! We do, indeed, see that anyone 
making the Plan might justly feel proud of it. But 
when we remember that none of us made the Plan, but 
that we are privileged to see it, we should be filled the 
more with humility, and should try day by day to better 
glorify His Name for the blessings which He has provided 
for the whole world. 

We cannot suppose that any kind of pride would be 
more detestable in God's sight than pride of the Truth. If 
anyone should continue in such a course, manifestly it 
would lead him out of the light. We see this principle 
illustrated well in the case of Satan. Noble, grand, he 
allowed pride to enter his heart and said, "I will ascend 
above the others; I will have an empire of my own." 
And this pride made him the opponent of God. (Isa. 14:12-17.) 
He is known in the Scriptures as the Adversary, 
Satan, the Devil. 

All those who have the spirit of pride fail to recognize 
that "every good and perfect gift cometh down from the 
Father of Lights." (Jas. 1:17.) Every such one, therefore, 
has the spirit of the Adversary instead of the Spirit 
of God. If it be allowed to grow and bring forth fruit, it 
will lead eventually to the Second Death. It is appalling 



to see the nature of the temptations that come to God's 
people! But we are not to judge their hearts, to determine 
whether it is a pride of heart or not; for it may be 
merely a deception for a time. And even though they 
may miss the "high calling," they may get a place in 
the "great company." And when we see that the conduct 
is not at all in accord with what we should expect in 
those blessed with the Truth, it should make us all search 
our own hearts to see to what extent we have the same 
traits of pride. 

Perhaps this quality of pride is nowhere more manifested 
than in some of those who have been in the Truth 
for quite a while. Sometimes it is on the part of the 
sisters. Sometimes they are very proud of what they 
know and very domineering in their manner, seeming to 
think that they know it all. Sometimes it is on the part of 
the brethren, in whom a spirit of pride appears. They have 
been placed as Elders. They see that they themselves 
are right and others are wrong. Sometimes this leads to 
an attempt to override the liberties of the congregation 
and to hold power in their own hands. 

R5001 :page 111 

"BE NOT MANY TEACHERS" 

It may not always be our privilege to mention such a 
matter. Such things may be matters that belong to a 
class. But, as one Pilgrim brother remarked some time 
ago, "Brother Russell, I sometimes think that, when we 
get beyond the veil, we shall be astonished to find how 
few of those who have exercised positions of prominence 
in the Church will be amongst the elect." It behooves 
us all who are associated in the Lord's work to watch 
ourselves closely, that if we find the slightest tendency 
in this direction of pride we may stamp it out as we would 
some contagious disease, knowing what the effects are 
upon others. We should be sympathetic with those who 
are beset, but not with the difficulty. We are reminded of 
the Apostle's words, "Be not many teachers, knowing that 
we shall receive the greater condemnation." Those who 
have seen the Truth clearly and have some talents and 
opportunities will have the severer trial on that account. 

Recently we have heard of some trials in the Class 
Extension work. The opportunities of Class Extension 
have resulted, in some cases, not advantageously. Some 
of great self-esteem have felt that they should be in the 
work, determining that they would tell the Class what to 
do. Some good brethren may have done this; some 
noble men may have done it. But in doing it, they were 
not acting wisely, we believe. 

As we said at first, it is not well for us to judge 
the heart. Everyone is privileged to preach as he may 
have opportunity. He may go forth entirely at his own 
expense and opportunity. He may preach all that he 
can. Good men have done so. There is nothing 



in the Scriptures to prohibit it. But to try to coerce a 
Class— trying to recognize the Class in some sense and to 
ignore that Class in another sense— is not the right thing. 
If the Class is supposed to express the Divine will, the 
individuals should acquiesce in what the Class decides. 



R5001 :page 111 

THE MORTAL BODY THE SERVANT OF THE NEW MIND 

"I keep my body under, and bring it into subjection, 
lest that by any means. ..I myself 
should be a castaway."— 1 Cor. 9:27. 

ST. PAUL was a most successful soldier of the 
cross; and from his Epistles we gain much 
information as to how to fight our own 
weaknesses successfully. In our text the 
Apostle speaks particularly of himself, with 
the evident intention of teaching a lesson 
to all of the Lord's people whom he addressed 
at that time or who would receive 
his word subsequently— including ourselves. 

The thought is not that we are to keep 
each other under, nor that the Lord is keeping our 
bodies under, but that a special commission is given to 
us in respect to our own bodies, and that we ourselves 
will be held accountable for their conduct. This statement, 
"I keep my body under," would be true only of one who 
has been begotten of the Holy Spirit, and who has become 
a New Creature in Christ Jesus. But although the individual 
is reckonedly a member of the Body of Christ, 
adopted into God's family, and called a son of God, he has 
not as yet, of course, received the spirit body promised 
him, but is waiting to receive it in the resurrection. 

GOOD INTENTIONS NOT SUFFICIENT 

Meantime God calls upon all spirit-begotten ones to 
demonstrate their loyalty to righteousness and their faithfulness 
by practising upon their mortal bodies. When 
coming into Christ, they made a full consecration of themselves, 
of their bodies and all that is theirs, to the Lord's 
service. It was on account of this Covenant of sacrifice 
that they were counted as members of the Body of Christ 
and begotten of the Holy Spirit— sons of God. It is not 
sufficient, however, to declare our intention; but God 
allows the difficulties and trials of life to prove our faithfulness 
to the sacrifice we have made. And while making 
provision for the blemishes of our mortal body, He, nevertheless, 
holds us responsible for our bodies, for our words 
and our actions. He calls us to be New Creatures; and 
we must develop our characters to such an extent 
that the New Creature will fight down, to the best of his 



ability, everything opposed to the new will. The first part 
of the text declares, "I keep my body under," that is to 
say, in subordination, under restraint. 

Those who deal in horses tell us that all horses must 
be broken; and that to break a horse is difficult of accomplishment 
and requires a great deal of force. The object 
in thus dealing with the horse is not to continue to break 
the animal every day, but to break him once for all, that 
he might be put to some service. This illustration seems 
to fit the Apostle's thought. 

As a New Creature the Apostle had a mortal body 
which was rebellious against God's will, and thus must 
be dealt with in a firm manner, in order to bring it under 
the control of its master— the new mind, whose Head is 
Christ. If the body be taught this lesson of submission, it 
may be a good, useful servant of the new master and 
serve unto death, just as a horse may be broken in and 
serve his master well. This is the thought in the Apostle's 
words, "I keep my body under." In substance the Apostle 
says, "I must break in this human nature, force it into 
harmony with the new will, and bring it into subjection, 
making it a servant to myself, the New Creature. This 
I do because this is the Divine will and the very thing 
to which I have been called. 

As a New Creature I wish to show that I am loyal 
to the principles of righteousness and truth everywhere. 
But this old body is more or less in rebellion against God 
and against the principles of the Divine arrangement. 
And it is my duty to see to what extent I can carry out 
this proposition— the bringing of the old mind into subjection 
to God and to righteousness. And in proportion 
as I make myself a servant of righteousness, God will 
use me, and to that extent I shall grow and become an 
overcomer. By doing these things an entrance will be 
administered to me into the everlasting Kingdom of Jesus 
Christ. But if I fail to carry this out, I shall fail of the 
character-development which all must have who would 
be accounted members of the Body of Christ." 

As St. Paul says in another place, God foreordained 
that He would have a Church, and that all who would be 
of this Church should become copies of His Son, Christ 
Jesus. (Rom. 8:28-30.) So, if St. Paul would remain a 
member of this Body of Christ, he must keep his human 
body under, must subordinate his earthly nature, not 
merely bringing it into subjection to things which would 
be for righteousness and truth, but also bringing it into 
subjection as regards natural things. So must all do 
who would come off "more than conquerors" in the good 
fight; it is necessary that we should carry out this fulness 
of service; that we should be faithful unto death, and that 
we should show this consecration, not only in our minds, 
but also in our mortal bodies. 

When the Apostle says here that he would be in 

R5002:page 112 



danger of being a "castaway" if he did not bring his body 
into subjection, and thus prove to be an overcomer, it 
is tantamount to saying that he would fail to make his 
calling and election sure. He was called to become an 
heir of God and joint-heir with Jesus Christ. If, therefore, 
he should fail to perform his part of the contract 
of sacrifice, he would become a castaway in respect to this 
election. He would not gain the election. He would lose 
in the race in which he had started. 

HABITS MAKE CHARACTER 

It is our duty to watch ourselves that we do no harm, 
that our body does good service and not injury to ourselves. 
A man or a woman or a child who goes through 
the house slamming doors, and merely says, "I was in a 
hurry and could not help it," is not gentle. He is not a 
gentleman, or she is not a gentlewoman. Whoever fails 
to cultivate gentleness is failing to cultivate the fruits of 
the Spirit. He is losing a glorious opportunity of practising 
upon himself— of keeping his body under, of getting 
himself into the way of doing things in a sensible, reasonable 
manner. The person who bangs doors and goes 
about noisily is one who does not think of other people 
and their interests. When we talk about ourselves all the 
time and think about ourselves all the time, it is an evidence 
of selfishness. In all these things the Lord expects 
us to keep our bodies under, and to show carefulness in 
keeping our bodies under, in the little things of life as 
well as in the great things. 

If our Lord Jesus were here, none of us would expect 
Him to go about noisily, slamming the doors of the house, 
or to be wasteful. Our Lord was most economical in the 
two cases where He fed the four thousand and the five 
thousand. Although there was plenty of food to feed the 
multitude, He told His disciples to "gather up the fragments 
that remain, that nothing be lost."— John 6:12. 

Thus did God's dear Son view matters; and we desire 
to be copies of Him. In building character we must 
wilfully and intentionally do right. The person who practices 
in the little things will be also careful in the larger 
matters. Even the pins, the needles and the paper we 
should use carefully. Not that any should be miserly— 
not willing to give one a pin if he wants one— but do not 
think to waste even them, saying, "Oh, the pins cost only 
a trifle, anyway!" The Lord was always generous, but 
He was economical. So we should all be. We should 
keep the body under the new mind. The new mind should 
be looking out for these matters and keeping the old 
body in service. 



R5002:page 112 

APOSTOLIC SUCCESSION UNSCRIPTURAL 



-MARK 3:7-19; MATTHEW 5:13-16.-APRIL 21.-- 

Text:— "Ye did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed 
you, that ye should go and bear fruit."— John 15:16 (R.V.). 

TODAY'S LESSON shows the particularity 

with which the twelve Apostles were 

chosen. Many were the Redeemer's followers 

at times, both men and women, but 

only The Twelve were specially deputized 

as His mouthpieces and representatives 

among men. Some of the things said to 

and respecting them are equally appropriate 

to every one of Jesus' followers, but other 

things said to The Twelve and respecting 

them apply to none others of their day or since— for instance, 

the Savior said to The Twelve, and to none others, 

"Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in 

heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be 

loosed in heaven. "-Matt. 16:19; 18:18. 

The import of these words clearly is that the persons 
indicated were assured that they would be so specially 
guided of Divine providence in all their efforts that they 
would set forth as the Divine will amongst men nothing 
to which Heaven would not assent. And, on the other 
hand, they would declare not binding upon the followers 
of Jesus only such things as in God's sight would not 
be binding. In those twelve men, therefore, we recognize 
a plenary inspiration, or special guidance not accorded 
in this particular degree to others of the "brethren." 

We do not forget that Judas was one of the original 
Twelve and that, proving traitorous, "He went to his own 
place." We remember also that he was specifically referred 
to by the Prophet David, through whom the Divine 
message came, that another would take the Apostleship 
which Judas forfeited. What we do claim is this: that 
the announcement was prophetically made of a successor 
to Judas, so as to teach us that the appointment of his 
successor was exceptional and not the rule; that aside 
from this one case there would be no successors. 

Surely there is no intimation in the New Testament 
that as one after another of the Apostles died other men 
were recognized as succeeding them. On the contrary, 
the Scriptures repeatedly refer to the "Twelve Apostles 
of the Lamb." Moreover, as the Jewish Dispensation 
began at the death of Jacob, in the recognition of his 
twelve sons, so the Christian Dispensation began at the 
death of Jesus, in the recognition of His twelve Apostles. 
And as one of the tribes of Israel was cut off, and is not 
mentioned in the enumeration in the Apocalypse, but the 
tribe of Manasseh substituted, so amongst Jesus' Apostles 
Judas is dropped and a successor is appointed. 

ST. PAUL TO SUCCEED JUDAS 



In the past we may have read too carelessly the account 
of how the eleven faithful Apostles exceeded their authority 
in the selection of Matthias to take the place of Judas. 
It was proper enough that they should scan the prophecies, 
and that they should note, as they did, God's declaration 
of the unfaithfulness of Judas, and that another was to 
take his special place in the Church; but they should have 
remembered that they had not as yet qualified as Apostles 
themselves. They should have remembered that whatever 
Apostolic or special power they exercised during Jesus' 
ministry came to them from Him and not from the 
Heavenly Father— that Jesus endued them as His representatives. 
They should have remembered that the Master 
specifically told them to do nothing until after receiving 
the Heavenly benediction, saying, "Tarry ye at Jerusalem 
until ye be endued with power from on high." 

Accrediting them with the very best of heart intentions, 
it was, nevertheless, effrontery on their part to 
select two names and to determine that one or the other 
must be the successor of Judas. They had no authority 
for so doing. As for the one upon whom the lot fell, 
Matthias, we hear nothing further of him. On the contrary, 
in God's due time, He Himself brought forth Saul 
of Tarsus, an Israelite indeed, a Pharisee of the Pharisees, 
who, however perverse in his conduct, was thoroughly 
conscientious, and verily thought he did God 
service. 

St. Paul himself tells us that he was not one whit behind 
the very chiefest of the Apostles, and that in respect 
to visions and revelations he had more than they all. He 

R5002:page 113 

goes back to the time when Christ appeared to him on 
the way to Damascus and when He declared to Ananias, 
"He is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My name unto 
the Gentiles and to kings, and to the people of Israel." 
St. Paul tells us that he found evidences that God had 
chosen him for a special service, from his mother's womb. 
And such special preparation and supervision we doubt 
not was applicable to all of The Twelve, even as also 
with John the Baptist in his work.— Acts 9:15; Gal. 1:15. 

"A CROWN OF TWELVE STARS" 

The Lord's specialization of the twelve Apostles is 
variously referred to. He said: "Have not I chosen you 
twelve?" and again, "Ye shall sit on twelve thrones." 
In the symbolical book of Revelation He pictures the 
Church as a woman, clothed with sunlight, standing over 
or near to the moon, which symbolizes the Jewish Law 
Covenant; and upon her head was a crown of twelve 
stars, representing the twelve Apostles of the Lamb. 

Again, later on in the same book, we find pictured 
the Church in glory beyond the veil, the Bride— the New 
Jerusalem. Of this City we read that it had twelve foundations, 



all precious stones; and in the twelve foundations 

were the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb. We 

believe that we need no better evidence on the subject. 

The recognition of successors to the Apostles was 
one of the first errors after their death. Every bishop 
was recognized as one of the successors and hence as 
possessing Apostolic authority. It was not long until 
the words of the original Twelve were neglected. The 
living bishops were acknowledged as speaking with the 
same Divine authority— up-to-date. Later great Church 
Councils were called, in which these bishops, as claimed 
successors to the Apostles, decided what should and what 

R5003 :page 113 

should not be allowed by the Church, what was and what 
was not orthodox. 

It can be readily seen that this exaltation of false apostles 
(Rev. 2:2), contrary to the Divine arrangement, 
opened a flood-gate of error, however well intentioned all 
concerned may have been. It is surprising that so many 
still hold to the creeds thus formulated by pseudo-apostles. 
The need of the hour is a recognition of these facts and 
an abandonment of all those creeds and a return to the 
words of Jesus and the Apostles and the Prophets. Only 
thus can we hope to regain the position lost. Only thus 
can we extricate ourselves from the multiplied errors represented 
in the six hundred divisions of the church of 
Christ, and of their six hundred variations of the original 
Gospel Message. Only thus can we return to the "one 
Lord, one Faith, one Baptism," one Father, one Savior, 
and one "Church of the First-born, whose names are written 
in heaven."-Eph. 4:4-6; Heb. 12:23. 

GOOD OMEN FROM ROME 

If it is surprising to find the head of the Church of 
Rome leading the way back from this error, it should all 
the more be a cause for rejoicing, and this is just what is 
taking place. The Pope, realizing that the public no 
longer have reverential confidence in the bishops as inspired 
men, the successors of the Apostles, realizes also 
the need of some great publicly acknowledged standard of 
Divine truth. Undoubtedly it is this which led "the holy 
father" to send a circular letter to all the cardinals and 
bishops urging upon the Catholic public to study the Holy 
Scriptures— the words of Jesus and the Apostles, and 
their explanation of the Law and the Prophets. 

Alas, that Protestants should be laggards at this moment! 
that many of the great and learned of them are 
today inclined to make sport of the entire subject of 
Divine inspiration! Alas! Protestants are being told by 
the Higher Critics that Jesus and the Apostles were 
undoubtedly deceived when they made quotations from 
the Old Testament Scriptures and accredited them to 
Moses, Isaiah, etc., for the Higher Critics are wiser (?) 



than Jesus and the Apostles. 

The latter portion of our study, from St. Matthew's 
Gospel, does not refer particularly to the Apostles, but 
chiefly to all who become followers of Christ, and believe 
on Him through their word.

THE PALACE OF BLESSEDNESS 

--APRIL 28.-MATTHEW 5:1-12.- 

Text:— "Blessed are the pure in heart, 
for they shall see God."— Verse 8. 

OF THE GREAT TEACHER we read, "He 

spake as never man spake." He was the 

Man Christ Jesus, but He was not a fallen 

man, not a sinner. His life was transferred 

from a heavenly to an earthly condition; 

hence, as a Man, He was "holy, harmless, 

undefiled and separate from sinners." (Heb. 7:26.) 

More than this, at the time of His 

consecration to death, He entered into a 

covenant of sacrifice with Jehovah, and 

thereupon He received His anointing of the Holy Spirit 

—this was the power of the Highest. What need have 

we for wonder, then, when we read that He taught as 

one having authority— as one who knew, who understood 

clearly and positively the things which He presented! 

The eight Beatitudes illustrate the difference between 
the teachings of Jesus and all other teachings from every 
other quarter. He had a new view of what to present. 
His is a different Message from all other messages to this 
day. While other teachers instructed the people to hold 
up their heads, to remember noble ancestors, etc., and 
thereby be blessed, Jesus encouraged His hearers to realize 
that the poor in spirit, the humble-minded, would receive 
the great blessings. 

While other teachers held forth the rich, the great, 
the learned, the mighty, the influential amongst men as 
the patterns to be copied, if happiness would be attained, 
Jesus, in these beatitudes, sets forth the reverse. His 
prescriptions for happiness have indeed been followed by 
a few, and these alone appreciate their merit and are 
finding the blessings promised, both for the present life 
and for that which is to come. 

The contrast between the Ten Commandments of the 
Mosaic Law and the eight Beatitudes declared by Jesus on 
the Mount, illustrate in considerable degree the difference 
between the Law Dispensation, and the Dispensation of 
Grace. The Law commanded the "house of servants" 
what they should and what they should not do. "Moses 
was faithful as a servant over all his house." (Heb. 3:5,6.) 



He delivered to the "house of servants"— typical 
Israel— the Divine Law, by the keeping of which they 
might be blessed and used in the Divine service. 

But the Gospel Message is a still higher one. It does 
not ignore the Law given by Moses to the "house of 
servants." It recognizes the Law as just, and holy, and 
good, and that Israel did not obtain that which they 
sought, because unable, through the weakness of heredity, 
to keep the spirit of God's perfect Law. The New Dispensation, 
which Jehovah inaugurated through Jesus, provides 
a full Ransom sacrifice for all sinners, and proposes 

R5003 :page 114 

ultimately to bless and to assist all out of all the weakness 
of heredity— not only Israel, but the entire race of 
Adam. The Law feature will be maintained, but grace 
and mercy will come in to render the necessary assistance 
to the keeping of the Law. But before that New Era 
of world blessing is introduced, the Divine arrangement 
proposes to gather a special class, all of whom must be 
"copies of God's dear Son." (Rom. 8:29, Diaglott.) 
These are to be His joint-heirs, in every sense of the word 
—in the sufferings and self-denials and persecutions and 
sacrifices of the present life, as well as in the glories, the 
honor and immortality of the future life. 

CALLED TO BE THE ELECT 

The Mission of Jesus and His teachings, at His first 
advent, were not to the world, but to a special class: "He 
that hath an ear to hear, let him hear." The Message 
for the world will go forth at His second advent, and we 
have the assurance that then all the blinded eyes will be 
opened and all the deaf ears will be unstopped, and the 
knowledge of the glory of God will fill the whole earth. 

In today's study, Jesus was addressing such of the 
Jews as had the hearing ear, such as had an inclination 
to be His disciples. He was addressing the class to whom 
He said, "If any man will be My disciple, let him deny 
himself and take up his cross and follow Me, that where 
I am there shall My disciple be." It was to this class 
that the Beatitudes were spoken, not with thunderings of 
Sinai, not with threats of vengeance and death if the lessons 
were not learned. 

The Master was addressing such as believed on Him, 
the class for whom He was about to appear in the presence 
of God, after finishing His sacrificial work, to impute 
to them His covering for their blemishes and imperfections, 
and to give them a standing with the Father, 
and to make their sacrifices "holy and acceptable to God." 
(Rom. 12:1.) He was instructing these as to how they 
could best make their calling and election sure, how 
they could the more successfully win the great "prize" to 
which they were called. Others may gather precious lessons 
from these Beatitudes, but only the spirit-begotten 



can appreciate them fully. 

THE PALACE OF BLESSEDNESS 

The foundation of the Palace of Blessedness is Humility. 
None can ever hope for a share in the Messianic 
Kingdom except as he is humble-minded: "Blessed are 
the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven." 
To such and such only will this great blessing come. It 
would never do for God to accept as a member of the 
Kingdom class one possessed of the spirit of pride and 
selfish ambition. In Satan's experience we have an illustration 
of what pride might accomplish. God proposes 
that humility shall be a primary test as respects the Bride 
class. 

The Palace Reception Room, upon the foundation of 
Humility, on the ground-floor of the Palace, is the chamber 
of Sorrow— mourning. Only such as know what it is 
to be touched with the feelings of human infirmities can 
be members of the Royal Priesthood, which by and by is 
to deal with and assist back to harmony with God whoever 
wills of all humanity. Besides, this Reception-Room of 
sorrow and mourning seems necessary for our complete 
separation from the things of the world, the flesh and 
the Devil. Few have ever been saints without passing 
through sorrowful experiences. We remember Jesus' 
words, "Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy 
laden, and I will give you rest." Yes, the Reception 
Room of mourning is necessary for us before we can 
appreciate the comfort which God has provided for this 
particular class— "His elect": "Blessed are they that 
mourn, for they shall be comforted." 

The Palace Library is Meekness. None can be successfully 
taught of the Lord and fully enjoy the Palace 
of Blessedness without the quality of meekness or teachableness. 
Into this Library the follower of Jesus must 
frequently go, there to learn valuable lessons, without 
which he could not make progress in his faith-building 
and character-development: "Blessed are the meek, for 
they shall inherit the earth." As members of Messiah, 
heirs of God and joint-heirs with Jesus, their Lord, 
these will come into the full possession, the full control 
of the earth. For a thousand years this control will be 
maintained while mankind will be taught valuable lessons 
and be uplifted out of sin and degradation and death to 

R5004:page 114 

the perfect manhood lost by Father Adam, redeemed by 
Jesus. Only at the close of the Messianic reign will The 
Meek turn over their inheritance, the earth, to mankind. 
Then those of the earth who will receive the control will 
be such of mankind as will have learned their lessons of 
meekness. 

The Dining Room: Hunger for Righteousness. All 
who will be joint-heirs with Christ will be lovers of righteousness 



and haters of iniquity, in likeness of the Redeemer. 

It is very important, therefore, that in our 

Palace of Blessedness we have a large and well-appointed 

Dining Room, where our hunger and thirst for righteousness 

may be encouraged and satisfied at the same time. 

"Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness, 

for they shall be filled." They will get their fill of 

it, for their own perfection in the First Resurrection, 

and in the establishment of righteousness in all the earth, 

during the thousand years of Messiah's reign. 

The Door of the Palace: Mercy. One of the most important 
lessons for the New Creature to learn is love, 
sympathy, mercy. In the Divine arrangement we must 
go out and in this door constantly. Our own imperfections 
continually require Divine mercy and should as continually 
impress upon us the merciful disposition toward 
those with whom we have to do. Only thus will we be 
fitted and prepared to be faithful and merciful members 
of the Royal Priesthood in dealing with and blessing the 
world of mankind during the Messianic Kingdom. 
"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy"; 
"If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your 
heavenly Father forgive your trespasses"; "Forgive us 
our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against 
us." 

The Palace Window, through which we may see God, 
is Purity of Heart. We cannot, while in the flesh, attain 
absolute purity in thought, word and deed, but we can 
have heart purity— pureness of intention and desire. Only 
such as have this heart condition may hope to attain the 
Kingdom honors and to see Him whom no human has 
seen, neither can see. "Blessed are the pure in heart, for 
they shall see God." 

The Parlor of our Palace is represented by the characteristics 
of the Peacemaker. It implies a certain resistance 
and victory in respect to our own affairs, furnishing 
us the opportunity to help others. "Blessed are 
the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of 
God." 

The Kitchen of our Palace represents the trials and 
difficulties incidental to the rounding out of our characters 
as a whole and our proper nourishment and upbuilding 
spiritually. "Blessed are ye when men shall revile 
you and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for 
My Name's sake; rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for 
great is your reward in heaven." 



R5004:page 115 

THE RICH MAN IN HELL 
-MAY 5.-LUKE 6:20-26; 16:19-31.— 
Text:— "A man's life consisteth not in the abundance 



of the things which he possesseth."— Luke 12:15. 

NOT ALL THE POOR are to be blessed and to 

inherit the Kingdom of God, etc., as set 

forth in this lesson. We are to notice particularly 

the setting of the Master's words. 

He lifted up His eyes on His disciples, and 

said, "Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the 

Kingdom of God"— "ye shall be filled" — 

"your reward is great in heaven." Undoubtedly 

poverty is a greater aid to discipleship 

than wealth. The cost of discipleship 

is the surrender of every earthly ambition to follow 

in the footsteps of Jesus. 

The rich are disadvantaged because theirs would be 
the greater sacrifice. "How hardly shall a rich man enter 
into the Kingdom of God"— become a joint-heir with 
Christ in His Messianic Kingdom which for a thousand 
years is to bless the world! The rich are disadvantaged 
because their wealth preserves them from many trials to 
which the poor are subjected. They have so many consolations 
and comforts now that the thought of sacrificing 
these to follow the Master appalls them, and the Kingdom 
glories seem to them less real and less attractive than to 
the disconsolate. 

The lesson for us is that if we would win the great 
Prize and the Kingdom we must not set our hearts upon 
earthly things, nor trust in uncertain riches. Contrariwise, 
we must realize that our all, much or little, is the 
Lord's, and that faithfulness in sacrificing what we have 
will decide whether or not we shall share His glory. 

THE RICH MAN IN HELL 

The second part of our lesson is one of our Lord's 
most striking parables. We read that He opened His 
mouth in parables and dark sayings, "that, hearing, they 
might hear and not understand." Of all our Lord's parables 
this one has been most seriously misunderstood. Indeed, 
it is accepted as a literal statement, notwithstanding the 
fact that we read again, "Without a parable spake He 
not unto them." Only a slight investigation, however, is 
necessary to demonstrate that this is a parable— that it 
would be unreasonable to consider it to be a statement of 
literal facts. For instance, it would be unreasonable to 
suppose that a man would be sent, after death, to torment 
merely because in the present life he fared sumptuously 
every day, lived in a fine house, and wore purple and fine 
linen. Nothing whatever is said about the character of the 
man, good or bad, and we are not permitted to add to the 
Word of God. The Rich Man represented a class. 

Similarly, the poor man, after death, must have symbolized 
a class, because no reason is given for his blessing 
after death, except that he was poor, covered with sores 
and lay at the rich man's gate eating his crumbs. 

Considered as a parable, this is one of the most interesting 



and helpful of all our Lord's utterances. The Rich 
Man of the parable represents the Jewish nation, highly 
favored of God. The bountiful table represents the rich 
promises of the Law and the Prophets, which were theirs 
alone up to the time that they nationally died to those 
favors. The Rich Man's purple clothing represents royalty 
—the fact that they were God's typical kingdom. 

David and Saul sat upon the throne of the kingdom 
of the Lord, and when the kingdom was removed in the 
days of Zedekiah the declaration was made that it would 
afterward be restored, with Messiah as King. The "fine 
linen" of the Rich Man represented the justification which 
God had granted to the Jewish nation alone thus far. It 
was a typical justification, accomplished through the Law 
Covenant and its sacrifices for Sin Atonement administered 
by a typical priest year by year. 

A harvesting of the Jewish people began with our 
Lord's ministry and lasted for forty years. It ended in 
the year A.D. 70, when the Rich Man, as a nation, died 
at the hands of Titus and the Roman army. Nationally, 
the Rich Man is buried, and will be non-existent until the 
due time, when the Lord's blessing will return to the 
Jewish people, as explained by St. Paul in Romans 1 1:25-35. 
But although nationally dead, the Jewish people have 
been very much alive ever since, and have been ostracised 
and persecuted and tormented with fiery trials. 

Although the nation of the Jews contains representatives 
of all the tribes, it is specially represented in Judah 
and Benjamin; and hence these two tribes constitute the 
one Rich Man. The other ten tribes, "scattered abroad," 
would proportionately represent the "five brethren" mentioned 
in the parable. This thought is confirmed by the 
statement, "They have Moses and the Prophets, let them 
hear them." None but the twelve tribes of Israel had 
Moses and the Prophets. 

LAZARUS IN ABRAHAM'S BOSOM 

Lazarus, the poor outcast, who was longing for a share 
of the Rich Man's favor and privileges, represented a 
certain class of Gentiles, such as the Centurian, whose 
servant Jesus healed, and who had such faith in Jesus that 
he said, "I am not worthy that thou shouldest come into 
my house, but speak the word and my servant shall be 
healed." Jesus declared that He had not found such 
faith as that amongst the Israelites. Another of these 
Gentile outcasts was the Centurian Cornelius, the first 
Gentile received into the Gospel privileges. Of him it is 
written that he reverenced God, prayed always, and gave 
much alms to the poor. 

Of the same Lazarus class was the Syro-Phenician 
woman, who besought Jesus that he would heal her daughter. 
Because she was a Gentile Jesus answered, "It is 
not proper that I should take the children's bread and 
give it to dogs"— the Gentiles— "dogs" being a familiar 
name for all outside the pale of Judaism. The woman at 



once recognized the application and answered, "Yea, 
Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the 
children's table." In answer to such faith Jesus granted 
her a crumb from the Divine table. 

Here, then, we see the Lazarus class, sin-sick, covered 
with sores— because not sharers in Israel's yearly sin-atonement 
sacrifices— hungry, because all of the promises 
of God primarily belonged to Israel— the companions of 
dogs, who licked their sores— this also intimating that 
they were Gentiles. They were outside the gate of Divine 
favor, this illustrating the same lesson— that they were 
"aliens, strangers and foreigners to the commonwealth of 
Israel." This Lazarus class, composed chiefly of Gentiles, 
had as its nucleus "the outcasts of Israel"— the publicans 
and sinners, who heard the Gospel Message gladly, but 
whom the Scribes and Pharisees rejected, disfellowshipped 
and put out of the synagogues, disowning them as Jews. 

The parable pictures a great change in this Lazarus 
class— they died to the conditions wherein they then were. 
They ceased to be the poor beggars, aliens and strangers, 
sin-sick, weary and hungry. But Lazarus was not buried, 
as was the Rich Man; "he was carried by the angels" to 
the bosom of Abraham. The angels were the Apostles 
and ministers of the Gospel— specially St. Peter and St. 
Paul. These declared to the Gentiles that whereas once 
they were "aliens, strangers and foreigners to the commonwealth 

R5005 :page 116 

of Israel," they were now "brought nigh" 

through faith in the Lord Jesus, and through the begetting 

of the Holy Spirit. 

Abraham typified God, the Father of the faithful, and 
the carrying of Lazarus to "Abraham's bosom" symbolically 
said that the outcasts of Israel and the worthy 
Gentiles became children of God, children and heirs of 
Abraham, who typified God. Thus also wrote the Apostle, 
"Ye are brought nigh through the blood of Christ"; 
"If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's Seed, and heirs 
according to the promise." The promise reads that "all 
the families of the earth shall be blessed" by this Seed 
of Abraham. Thus St. Paul wrote, "Israel hath not obtained 
that which he seeketh, but the elect obtained it, 
and the rest were blinded," and "wrath came upon that 
people to the uttermost," "that all things written in the 
Law and the Prophets concerning them should be fulfilled." 
-Rom. ll:7;IThess. 2:16; Luke 21:22. 

The Jew in his misery has beheld with jealous eye 
the favor of God manifested toward those whom he despised. 
He has even humbled himself to ask that relief 
might be sent to him through Christian Gentiles— symbolically, 
even "one drop" of refreshment. But no relief 
will be afforded until the end of this Age— until the Messianic 
Kingdom shall be established; and then Israel (both 
dead and living) shall obtain mercy through the elect.— 
Rom. 11:31,32. 



One fulfilment of the request of the parable for a 
"drop of water" occurred several years ago when the Jews 
memorialized President Roosevelt, requesting his good 
offices with the Russian Government for the abatement of 
the persecutions of the Jews there. The President replied 
that he regretted the inability of complying with the 
request because the etiquette of nations prohibited such 
a suggestion being offered by one nation to another with 
whom it was at peace. 



R5005 :page 116 

LOVING OUR NEIGHBORS 

--MAY 12. -LUKE 6:27-38; ROM. 13:8-10.- 

"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."— Romans 13:9. 

TODAY'S STUDY is from Saint Luke's account 

of the Sermon on the Mount. It does 

not profess to be a regulation for the world, 

but merely applies to saints— to those who 

have consecrated their lives fully to follow 

in the footsteps of Jesus— to suffer with 

Him that they may also reign with Him. 

Even these may not be able to live up to 

every feature of the Master's instructions, 

because of weakness in their fallen flesh. 

We must take the Master's words here and elsewhere addressed 

to the faithful as representing the full, complete, 

perfect standard. It is for each disciple to recognize 

this supreme standard and to measure and gauge his 

thoughts and words and doings thereby, and to as closely 

as possible attain this standard. 

We are to remember, however, that as no Jew could 
keep the Law in its spirit, perfectly, neither could any of 
any other nationality keep it. The Jew's failure to keep 
the Law meant his failure to gain everlasting life, but we 
(the followers of Jesus) are not under the Law Covenant, 
but under Grace. We are to keep the Divine Law as 
nearly as we possibly can and to accept by faith God's arrangement 
for us in Jesus— that "by His stripes we are 
healed," our shortcomings are made good. 

Thus doing our very best, yet surely coming short, the 
Apostle's words apply to us: "The righteousness of the 
Law is fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh, but 
after the spirit." We walk after the spirit, and would 
walk up to it if we could, but, being unable to do so, "The 
blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin." This is 
the happy state of all who through faith and consecration 
become children of God during this Gospel Age. Their 
faith and good intentions and good efforts, by the grace of 
God, make good their deficiencies. 

As for others than God's people, He does not speak to 



them at all, except to tell them that they are sinners under 

the sentence of death, but that He has made provision for 

their reconciliation through the blood of the cross, and that 

whether they become disciples of Christ or not under the 

call to Brideship, nevertheless their words and conduct in 

the present life will all advantage or disadvantage them in 

the life to come. In this secondary way the world— all 

mankind aside from the Church, the consecrated— may be 

measurably enlightened by the Master's teachings in this 

lesson, even while it is not addressed to them. They may 

see its high standards and appreciate them to some extent, 

but not fully, unless they realize that the Church Class, 

called in this Gospel Age, is required to undergo special 

trial, testing, proving, as to loyalty to God, meekness, gentleness, 

patience, long-suffering, brotherly kindness, love. 

"BUT I SAY UNTO YOU" 

The two tables of the Law given to Israel were a requirement 
of Justice, but Jesus and His followers take a 
still higher plane and, waiving their own rights, they become 
sacrificers of their own comforts, preferences, desires, 
to the doing of the Divine will, to the serving of 
the brethren and mankind in general. Justice never requires 
sacrifice. Thus discipleship and attainment with 
Jesus of a share in the sufferings of this present 
time and in the glory that shall follow mean something 
more than merely rendering to every man his due, for no 
one has a right to render to another less than his due, nor 
to do injury to another. Jesus not only did no injury, 
but, additionally, He sacrificed His own rights on behalf 
of mankind, and He set His disciples an example that they 
should walk in His steps.— I Pet. 2:21. 

The path of love is, therefore, as Jesus describes it, 
under present conditions, a "narrow way"; narrow is the 
gate, difficult the way of life now open. Only the saintly 
few will be willing to walk therein, and only these will 
gain the great Prize, "the pearl of great price," joint-heirship 
in Messiah's Kingdom. Hearken! Do not 
merely observe the Golden Rule toward your enemies, but 
love them, and "do good to them that hate you, and bless 
them that curse you, and pray for them that despitefully 
use you." 

The Master's expression, "Unto him that smiteth thee 
on the one cheek offer also the other," is to be taken as 
signifying simply, Do not render evil for evil, even though 
he smite thee on the other cheek also. Our Lord Himself, 
when smitten, according to the report, did not invite the 
smiting of the other cheek, but rather He defended Himself 
to the extent of criticising the evil deed. But if He 
had been smitten on the other cheek also, let us not for a 
moment think that He would have resisted, in the sense 
of rendering blow for blow. 

The next statement is more comprehensively given by 
Saint Matthew. "If any man sue thee at the law and take 
away thy coat, withhold not thy cloak also." The follower 



of Jesus may flee from an adversary, or he may resist him 

R5005 :page 117 

to the extent of proper expostulation, but he is to be thoroughly 

responsive to all government; if the court decides 

that his coat and his cloak shall both be taken from him, 

he shall unmurmuringly submit, even though he realize 

that such a procedure would be unjust and quite at variance 

with the Divine regulation. Saint Paul as well as 

Jesus used argument in his own defence, not only with the 

mobs, but also before judges; but they resisted the law— 

never. 

"THIS IS A HARD SAYING" 

"Give to everyone that asketh of thee, and of him that 
taketh away thy goods ask them not again." The broadest 
interpretation we could consistently give to this would 
be— Be generous, tender-hearted, err on the side of too 
great generosity rather than to be hard-hearted, selfish. 
The Lord could not have meant us to take His words with 
absolute literalness; as for instance, Give a child a razor 
if it cries for it; or, Give money to the dissipated, that 
they may injure themselves still more. The spirit of a 
sound mind forbids that we should understand the Master 
to teach that we should do anything for another or assist 
him in any manner that would be really to his injury. This 
is expressed in the next statement: "As ye would that 
men should do unto you, do ye also to them likewise." 
We would surely not wish men to grant a request of ours 
if they sincerely believed they would be injuring us. Our 
Master's words inculcate love, beneficence, and must not 
be construed to the contrary. 

Very evidently our Lord was setting up His teachings 
in contrast with the maxims of the Pharisees, the holiness 
people of that day. He wished His disciples to see His 
teachings in their ultra light. To love another because 
he loved us, or to give to another in the hope that he would 
equally befriend us, or to do any good act with a hope to 
have as good or better return, would have nothing specially 
creditable in itself. It would be doing from a 
selfish motive. 

Jesus' disciples, on the contrary, are to do good for 
principle's sake and for goodness' sake— to be in full accord 
with the Heavenly Father, to have His smile and 
approval. They are to take Him as their Example and 
to remember that in proportion as they are godlike they 

R5006 :page 117 

show forth the spirit of sonship. As, therefore, God is 
kind to the unthankful and to evil-doers, so we should be 
who have His spirit and who are seeking to walk in His 
way, in the footsteps of Jesus. The Heavenly Father is 
the Example, and although we cannot come up to that 



Example, we can show our loyalty, our faithfulness, by 
copying Him to the extent of our ability. 

MERCIFUL TO OBTAIN MERCY 

The world during Messiah's Kingdom will be under 
instruction and lessons, which will include mercy, and an 
assurance to the willing and obedient of perfection by the 
close of the Kingdom. But the Church class, now called 
out, will have no such long period for their character development, 
and since they will not attain that perfection 
here but will require Divine mercy, through the imputation 
of Christ's merit to cover their blemishes, therefore 
the Lord has arranged that these must expect mercy only 
in proportion as they will show mercy to others. In other 
words, all the followers of Jesus have many imperfections 
to be covered by Divine mercy, or else to be atoned for 
by stripes, punishments, before they die. 

In order to develop His saints in generosity and forgiveness, 
mercy, the Lord has agreed that He will be 
merciful to them in proportion as they will be merciful to 
others. What a wondrous reward and what a wondrous 
incentive! Our Lord's prayer is in agreement with this: 
"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass 
against us." This does not relate to the Adamic 
guilt of the saints, but to their daily shortcomings; their 
share in original sin and condemnation was canceled 
through the merit of Christ before they were accepted as 
His disciples or became followers in His steps as sons of 
God. What an incentive to God's people to be generous, 
forgiving, large-hearted, thus cultivating the Heavenly 
Father's spirit and character, and to be in that condition of 
heart where they can receive richly of Divine bounty and 
mercy at the throne of grace! 

"OWE NO MAN ANYTHING" 

Love may go beyond the Law and do more than Justice 
could require— in self-sacrifice— but it cannot do less. He 
who loves his neighbor will be fulfilling the Law toward 
him to the best of his ability. Hence, as the Apostle explains, 
to those who are in Christ all the commandments 
are covered in their covenant of love. They would not 
injure their neighbor's interests, either by stealing from 
him, or by bearing false witness against him, or by coveting 
his things or interests, desiring to take possession of 
them, or by murder or adultery; nor in any other manner 
would they encroach upon their neighbor's rights and 
interests. 

Although not under the Law of the Ten Commandments, 
the Christian is under the Law of the New Commandment, 
the Law of Love, which is so much higher 
that it includes every other law that could be given. Love 
works no kind of injury to its neighbor; love, therefore, 
is the fulfilling of that feature of the Divine Law which 
applies to our duty toward our neighbor, to love him as 



ourself. But love can do more than this, and in the case 
of Jesus it did more, for in love He surrendered His 
rights, privileges, etc., and died, the Just for the unjust, 
that He might bring us to God. And He is our Example 
as surely as we are His disciples, followers, and prospectively 
His joint-heirs in His Kingdom. 



R5006 :page 117 

CHRISTIANITY AND THE LAW 

--MAY 19.-MATT. 5:17-26.- 

"He that loveth his neighbor hath 
fulfilled the Law. "-Rom. 13:8. 

JESUS AND HIS APOSTLES expounded the 
harmony between Christianity and Judaism, 
nevertheless comparatively few Christians 
today seem to grasp the subject clearly. Today's 
study aims to make clear their distinctions 
and harmonies. 

The Great Teacher declared that He came 
not to destroy the Law and the Prophets, 
but to fulfil them. While the Law was 
spoken of as Moses' Law, it was really the 
Divine Law given to Israel as a basis for the Divine 
Covenant with that nation, and Moses merely stood as 
mediator of that Law Covenant— that agreement by which 
Israel was obligated to keep the Law, and God was obligated 
if they did so to grant them everlasting life, Divine 
favor and the glorious privilege of being His instruments 
for the blessing of all nations, under Messiah's Kingdom. 

The failure of even the most sincere Israelites to gain 
the promised everlasting life proved, not that God's Law 
was an unjust one, which would need at some time to be 
set aside as unworkable, but that Israel, like the remainder 
of the world, shared by inheritance Adamic weaknesses, 

R5006 :page 118 

which so impaired their moral quality that they could not 
keep God's perfect Law— in its spirit; the spirit of the 
Law our Lord defined to be whole-hearted love for God 
and "Golden Rule" love for the neighbor. 

The Gospel of Jesus magnifies the Jewish Law by 
admitting its righteousness, its reasonableness and by admitting 
that the fault is entirely with humanity. The 
proposition of Jesus in respect to His followers is this: 
He, being perfect, was able to keep the Mosaic Law perfectly, 
and He had a right, therefore, to everlasting life, 
and needed not to have died; but instead of retaining His 
life He laid it down sacrificially, as a part of the great 
Divine Plan for human redemption. That sacrifice will 



bring to the world the blessed privileges and opportunities 

for eternal life which, it has been promised, Messiah's 

Kingdom will bring. But meantime the Redeemer, carrying 

out Jehovah's plans, offers an imputation of His merit 

to any who have His spirit— that of full consecration to 

do the Father's will by laying down the present life sacrificially, 

to gain with the Redeemer a heavenly, spiritual 

life, glory, honor, immortality, the Divine nature, as Messiah's 

joint-heir in His Kingdom. All who would thus do 

would be counted as a part of the spiritual Seed of Abraham, 

through whom all the families of the earth will 

eventually receive their blessing. 

This offer was made to the Jew first; but, after gathering 
all the willing and obedient of that nation, the call 
was extended to the willing and obedient having ears to 
hear and hearts to obey regardless of all national lines. 
To all these the terms of discipleship were made clear- 
terms of self-sacrifice unto death: "If any man will be My 
disciple let him deny himself and take up his cross and 
follow Me; and where I am there shall My disciple be." 

This class was promised everlasting life, even though 
they were unable to keep in every particular the spirit of 
the Mosaic Law. The Jews reasoned that this was a setting 
aside of the Law; Jesus and the Apostles answer, No. 
These disciples or followers of Jesus sacrifice their earthly 
interests and rights and thus become reckonedly dead to 
earthly things. God accepts their sacrifices and begets 
them of the Holy Spirit. Thus they become New Creatures 
in Christ. These New Creatures are not under any 
Law of sin and death, nor have they any imperfections. 
"The Law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made 
them free from the law of sin and death."— Rom. 8:2. 

But, the objector asks, how could God accept a blemished 
offering? and, furthermore, are not these New 
Creatures held responsible for the conduct of their flesh, 
so long as they live— until their sacrifice is completed? 

The Scriptures answer. The great High Priest, who 
presents these offerings as part of His own sacrifice, 
covers their imperfections and blemishes by an imputation 
of the merit of His own sacrifice, which is already in 
the hands of Justice waiting for application on behalf of 
the sins of the world. When this High Priest thus presents 
us to God, covered with His own merit as a robe, 
we are assured that the sacrifices are "holy and acceptable 
unto God."— Rom. 12:1. 

As for subsequent weaknesses of the flesh, the New 
Creature is indeed held responsible for its mortal body, 
but since our High Priest tasted death for every man and 
for all sins of heredity, therefore these New Creatures in 
Christ are assured that all their trespasses, whether of 
ignorance or weakness, may be forgiven, and that the Redeemer, 
their Head and Representative in glory, will 
upon application impute His merit for the cancellation of 
such imperfections, that they may thus be maintained in 
their standing with the Father, "without spot or wrinkle 
or any such thing."— Eph. 5:27. 



Thus are the demands of Divine Law met in respect 
to the Church. But the Church's covenant means more 
than merely the observance of the Law; it is a covenant to 
sacrifice, and Justice, the Divine Law, could not demand 
sacrifice. The Church's covenant, which she shares with 
her Lord and Redeemer, is an agreement to sacrifice all 
earthly interests in the doing of the Divine will at any 
cost. The reward for the keeping of this covenant will 
be obtained in the First Resurrection change to heavenly 
glory, honor and immortality. The terms of this covenant 
read: "Gather together My saints unto Me, saith the 
Lord, those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice." 
-Psa. 50:5. 

FULFILLING THE PROPHETS ALSO 

To the Jew it seemed as though the Gospel invitation 
would make void all the Prophets, of whom Saint Peter 
said that all the holy Prophets since the world began had 
spoken of restitution times and blessings at the coming of 
Messiah. (Acts 3:19-21.) To the Jew it still seems as 
though there must be some mistake, that if Jesus were the 

R5007 :page 118 

Messiah He should have begun a work of restitution, a 
work of social, moral, intellectual and physical uplift for 
mankind, using Israel as His channel, His agency. The 
Jew points to the eighteen centuries of Christian preaching, 
and says if Christians be right it makes void all of 
the prophecies of the past. What is the answer to this? 

Jesus gives the answer, saying that the prophecies are 
being fulfilled. The prophecies tell not only of Jesus but 
also of His brethren, the "little flock," the Bride class; 
and that class must be selected before other features of 
the prophecies can be fulfilled. "I will declare Thy name 
unto My brethren." (Psa. 22:22; Heb. 2:12.) This is 
the present work— the work of selecting the class mentioned 
by the Psalmist, saying, "I have said ye are gods, 
all of you sons of the Highest; but ye shall all die like 
men."— Psa. 82:6. 

The Law and the Prophets point out the necessity of 
a Priestly class under the High Priest— of a sacrificing 
class which would become a Royal Priesthood. These 
prophecies are in process of fulfilment; neither the Law 
nor the Prophets are being ignored. Soon this feature of 
the Divine Plan will have been accomplished; the Church 
will be glorified with her Lord, and then those features 
of the Law and the Prophets which dazzle the eyes of 
Israel will begin to be fulfilled, and will bring them blessing, 
and through them blessing to the world, far beyond 
their highest conceptions. 

If therefore any of the followers of Jesus should violate 
the Ten Commandments and teach men so to do, it 
would manifestly be done through ignorance and misunderstanding 
and he would thus mark himself as a follower 



of Jesus on a low plane— one of the least in the 

Kingdom. This would apply amongst the Lord's followers 

at the present time: the Church is the Kingdom in 

embryo, and any brother in such an attitude should be considered 

by the brethren as weak and should not be given 

a position of prominence in the service of the Church. 

THE PHARISEES' STANDARD LOWER 

In Jesus' day the Pharisees prided themselves on their 
zeal for the Law and found fault with Jesus' disciples and 
with Himself for healing the sick on the Sabbath. Instead 
of admitting their claims Jesus repeatedly showed 
them to be fallacious. They were particular respecting 
the little requirements of the Law, but were careless respecting 
its spirit of love. This Jesus termed hypocrisy; 
He declared that unless His followers would be nearer 
right in heart than were the Pharisees they would not 
get into the Kingdom at all. (We must remember the difference 

R5007 :page 119 

between the embryo Kingdom which was inaugurated 
at Pentecost and the glorious Kingdom into which 
the faithful will be ushered by the First Resurrection 
change.) 

Unless His followers would have more of the spirit 
of the Divine Law than the Pharisees they would not 
be fit for the begetting at Pentecost— none but those 
who love righteousness and who thus have the spirit of 
the Divine Law are acceptable at all in the Church— 
"the Church of the First-Born, whose names are written 
in heaven." 

The Pharisees held the letter of the Law and said, Beware 
lest you kill a man, for that would subject you to 
judgment or trial before the council, or local court of your 
town; but Jesus taught that hatred is murder, even if it 
do not go to the length of killing. So high is this standard 
amongst the Lord's consecrated people that for one of 
them to be even slightly angry would be a serious matter; 
and if he were angry enough to call a brother Christian 
"a fool" it would imply that he were in serious danger of 
the second Death— Gehenna. All Christ's followers, 
therefore, must not only guard their actions but also their 
lips and the very thoughts of their hearts, that even in 
thought they shall be in fullest accord with the very spirit 
of the Divine Law of love; and if on approaching the 
throne of grace they find any other spirit in their hearts 
they should go no further toward God, but first be reconciled 
to their brother. Under a parable of arrest, condemnation 
and imprisonment our Lord teaches His disciples 
that if they have a wrong feeling toward a brother 
they should make great haste to settle the matter. Every 
moment of delay endangers their spiritual standing with 
the Lord and makes it more difficult for themselves in their 
relationship with God. 



The intimation is that if we have wronged a brother 
and delay to make the matter right and the case come 
before the Lord for settlement, we will be obliged to 
suffer the full penalty of our neglect, "the uttermost farthing, 
before we will be fully restored to Divine favor 
and fellowship. 



GOD'S INHERITANCE 

EPHESIANS 1:18. 

And can it be 

That God designs with you and me 

Forevermore to dwell? 

Can His great might 

Secure for us the right 

To be His Israel? 

A people chosen to proclaim His worth, 

To sound the praises of His glory forth, 

To lead the van of an adoring earth? 

This poor, weak clay 

Can He transform in such a way 

That it shall yield Divinity? 

This sin-stained mind 

So cleanse that He in us shall find 

Affinity? 

Th' abode of His eternal rest, 

That habitation which He loveth best, 

His chosen Zion? City ever blest? 

If this be so, 

Not all the wealth this world can know 

Will me suffice: 

Nor name, nor fame, nor power, nor pleasure here below 

My soul entice. 

How poor these transitory things of earth 

Beside this treasure of unending worth, 

This Heavenly fellowship, this Royal birth! 

And can it be 

That down throughout succeeding ages He 

With ardent longing waits 

Th' eventful day 

When— sin all purged away— 

We'll sit within His gates? 

Can we be subjects of our God's desire? 

Doth He our loving fellowship require? 

And to this height may such as we aspire? 

How good to know 

His never-failing Word proclaims it so ! 
Here, Lord, I give myself to Thee, 
Work out Thy gracious purposes in me 



Until in Heaven Thy blessed Face I see, 
And dwell with Thee through all eternity. 

WM. W. JOHNSTON.-Africa.

THE WORLD'S CONVERSION 



REPORT OF MISSIONS INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE, INTERNATIONAL BIBLE 
STUDENTS ASSOCIATION 

AT ITS CONVENTION held September 1-10, 

191 1, the International Bible Students Association 

appointed a Committee to tour the 

world and supply an unvarnished report of 

the true condition of affairs in Oriental 

lands amongst the peoples usually termed 



"heathens." 

The proposition of a certain Laymen's 
Missionary Movement to promptly collect 
$30,000,000 and immediately convert the 
world naturally aroused the query respecting the possibility 
of attaining such desirable results. No doubt 
existed that benevolent people would willingly expend 
thirty million dollars, and much more, if the results aimed 
at could be attained. On the other hand, many rumors 
had been reaching Europe and America respecting the inefficiency 
of the Missions and Missionaries already in the 
Oriental lands. These tales possibly had something to do 
with the falling off of contributions to Missionary Societies. 
It is the thought of many, however, that the secret of 
the curtailment of donations to various propaganda is the 
same as applies to the home work of all Christian denominations. 
The secret is that the masses of the people, 
as well as the wealthy, are rapidly losing faith in revealed 
religion— in the Bible. 

The Higher Critics in all of our Colleges and Seminaries, 
and in the chief pulpits of Christendom, have for 
fifty years been carrying on a subtle warfare against the 
Bible. Are we not now beginning to see the fruits of 

R5008 : page 123 

their labors in a general agnosticism? Many manifest 
their loss of faith merely by a non-attendance at religious 
services, and by failure to contribute as formerly to religious 
benevolences. Others are showing their agnosticism 
by joining Socialism, which many believe is gradually 
leading them to atheism and anarchy. 

Bible Students of the I.B.S.A. are very generally of 
the opinion that the Bible teaches that nothing short of 
Messiah's Kingdom in power and great glory can scatter 
the thick religious darkness in the world— that nothing 
short of that Kingdom, as the "Sun of Righteousness," 
can scatter the darkness that covers the earth and the 
gross darkness that benights the heathen. These Bible 
Students very generally hold that the Bible teaches that 
the Bride of Christ (the saintly few of this Gospel Age) 
must be completed, and must by the First Resurrection be 
glorified with the Redeemer and sit with Him in His 
throne, before the time will come when Jesus shall enlighten 
the world. 

In other words, "Jesus is the true Light which lighteth 
every man that cometh into the world." But, in Divine 
providence, the world separates itself into two distinct 
classes. The first and smaller class consists of those 
"Elect" who have the hearing ear, the understanding and 
appreciating heart, and the willing mind to be the footstep 
followers of Jesus, and thus to gain the great prize 
of joint-heirship with Him in His Kingdom. To these 
the light of Truth comes now. To others, the non-elect, 
it will come by and by, when, according to Divine 
promise, "All the blind eyes shall be opened, and all the 



deaf ears shall be unstopped." 

EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW 

These Bible Students are very generally agreed that the 
long-promised "Golden Age" of Messiah's Kingdom is 
near at hand. Very generally they quote and rejoice in 
such Scripture promises as, "When He shall appear, we 
shall also appear with Him in glory." (Colossians 3:4.) 
This appearing or revealing will be to the world, respecting 
whom Saint Paul writes, "The whole creation groaneth 
and travaileth together until now, "..."waiting 
for the manifestation of the sons of God." They quote 
and rejoice in the promise which declares, "If we suffer 
with Him we shall also reign with Him." Gladly, therefore, 
do they rejoice in tribulations and misrepresentations 
and whatever Divine Providence permits, knowing that 
all of these things are working out for them a far more 
exceeding and eternal weight of glory— in the Kingdom. 

These Bible Students have come to very generally understand 
that the Scriptures teach that Messiah's Kingdom 
must first enlighten the world before, "Unto Him 
every knee shall bow and every tongue confess to the 
glory of God." Hence, while sympathetic with all good 
works, these Students are not expecting the world's conversion 
as the result of Missionary effort, and are not disappointed 
that the eighteen centuries of the preaching of 
the Gospel has not brought such a result. 

A MESSAGE TO ALL NATIONS 

The interest of these Bible Students in the present 
status of missionary work centers in the fact that they 
understand the Bible to teach that the preaching of the

R5008 : page 124 

Gospel in all the world has been eminently proper, not 

with the expectation of converting the world, but, as the 

Master said, to give a witness to all the world, and to 

gather an elect few from all nations, peoples, kindreds 

and tongues for membership in His Bride class— to sit 

with Him in His throne during the thousand years, cooperating 

in the work of uplifting the race as a whole. 

Indeed, we understand that one of the principal motives 
associated with the sending out of the Committee of 
Investigation was to ascertain whether or not there would 
appear to be saints in those distant lands, who, as yet, 
have no knowledge of "the Gospel of the Kingdom," and 
of the fact that we are now in the harvest time of this 
Age, and probably very close to the dawning of the New 



Dispensation of Messianic glory. It was with this in view 
that the Association privately authorized Pastor Russell, 
its President, to spend as much as seven thousand dollars 
in publishing the Gospel of the Kingdom in Oriental lands, 
provided in his judgment and in the judgment of the 
Committee there were saintly hearts and minds in those 
lands likely to appreciate the message and to be ripened 
thereby for the heavenly "garner." 

The Committee did not find the time at their disposal 
sufficient to permit them to visit Burmah, Africa and Australasia. 
It recommends that another Committee be appointed 
for that work, and that it have due consideration 
at the next General Convention of the I.B.S.A. This 
Convention is announced to be held at Pertle Springs, 
Chautauqua grounds near Warrensburg, Mo., June, 1-8, 
1912. 

The gentlemen who have served on this Committee are 
all earnest Bible Students. Their zeal in the matter of 
this investigation may be judged from the fact that they 
not only paid their own expenses, but additionally defrayed 
Pastor Russell's and all secretarial expenses. These 
gentlemen have long been deeply interested in the propagation 
of the Gospel, both at home and abroad. From 
the first we thought the Committee a remarkably fair one, 
and we believe the Report fully justifies that opinion. 
While it tells some plain truths, and lays bare some important 
facts, it is in no sense harsh or unkind, but on the 
contrary, sympathetic. 

So interesting is the Committee's Report and so instructive 
that we have practically devoted one entire number 
of THE WATCH TOWER to its presentation. We trust 
our readers will understand and appreciate our endeavors. 
We are printing a very large edition of this number, believing 
that it will be of interest to many outside our 
present list of subscribers. All such are cordially invited 
to become subscribers, and to join with us in the study of 
our Heavenly Father's Word in its own light— without 
the "spectacles" of any denominational creed. We 
can supply a large demand for extra copies of this issue, at 
5c. per copy, postpaid, to any part of the world. Tell 
your friends desiring these to address THE WATCH 
TOWER, Brooklyn, N.Y. The committee's report follows: 

THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS VISITED 

Our first stop was at the Hawaiian Islands. Our investigations 
were practically confined to Honolulu, the 
principal city, but there we were in touch with the general 

R5008 : page 125 

situation throughout the group of thirteen islands. We 
were astonished to note the degree of civilization manifested 
by the entire population, composed of Hawaiians, 
Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, Koreans, Portuguese and 
Americans. Of the two hundred thousand population, 



about seven thousand are Americans or of Caucasian 
mixture. 

Many of the natives live in very cramped quarters, in 
what is termed "slum districts." These, nevertheless, are 
not so much inferior to American slum districts as one 
might suppose. 

We visited a "Settlement," a philanthropic arrangement 
of very simple character in the midst of the poor 
and for their assistance. It has a playground for children, 
swimming baths, a gymnasium and entertainment room, a 
dispensary for simple remedies, a kindergarten room, and 
alongside an apartment for the convenience of consumptives, 
to whom advice is given respecting the care of their 
health and the avoidance of the spreading of the infection 
to their families. The gentleman in charge explained 
to us that the city of thirty thousand is divided into eight 
districts, and that eight ladies visit these districts regularly 
every ten days, and their compensation is from $90 to $100 
per month. The sugar planters and principal merchants 
consider it a good business enterprise to thus safeguard 
the city against cholera, yellow fever and bubonic 
plague, and care not 
that it is under 
Church control and 
so accredited. 

We visited the 
Kakemhame School, 
founded by Mrs. 
Bishop, a Hawaiian 
Princess, who became 
the wife of an 
American Banker. 
Her estate maintains 
the school at an expense 
of $70,000 per 
year. Only boys 
and girls with Hawaiian 
blood can enjoy 
the benefits. It 
is conducted on a 
luxurious scale, but 
appears to be of a 
very practical character 
and bound to 

exert a civilizing influence. 
The school 
has about 250 pupils, 
a neat little chapel 
and the necessary 

appointments for literary and manual training. The 
pupils look bright and healthy. 

We also visited the Mid-Pacific Institute. The boys' 
buildings are separate from those for the girls. The total 
number of pupils was approximately 220, and about evenly 
divided between the sexes. They have their board and 
lodging and schooling. A nominal charge of $1 a week 



is made, but nearly all are charity pupils, we were told. 
They seem healthy and happy. The classes were much 
smaller than in America. The grading is very similar 
to that of our public schools, with the addition of excellent 
homing influences and instruction for the girls in sewing, 
cooking, etc., calculated to turn them out useful and helpful 
wives. Our best wish for American and European 
children is that they could have as good a start in life as 
have the pupils in the schools we visited here. Nearly all 
the teachers, male and female, are American, bright and 
intelligent and above the American average. We did not 
learn their rate of pay. 

"NOW I LAY ME DOWN TO SLEEP" THE NEAREST APPROACH 
TO RELIGION 

We were rejoicing to think that such practical arrangements 
had been made along humanitarian lines, and 
it was with considerable surprise that we learned afterwards 
that nearly all this work is included in the reports 
of the American Missionary Association and the American 
Board of Christian Foreign Missions. Nothing connected 
with the schools gave any indication of their connection 
with religious or missionary institutions. The 
only statement of a religious service coming to our attention 
was that the smaller children knelt by their beds on 
retiring at night and sang, "Now I lay me down to sleep." 

R5009 : page 125 

Indeed, we inquired respecting Christian instruction and 
were informed that the attempt to give it would alienate 
the pupils and thus cause the disruption of the schools. 
We were informed that chapel services are held on Sunday, 
and also Sunday-school exercises, but that comparatively 
few of the children attend. The only hope seems to 
be that the civilizing and educating of these children 
would later on make them more amenable to Christian 
instruction. 

Departing we were invited to speak a few words of 
encouragement to the pupils of the girls' school. We 
sought to impress upon them the advantages of their 
pleasant and comfortable surroundings, and we connected 
these creature comforts with the Savior and the influence 
which doctrine exercises upon the hearts of mankind who 
properly receive it. We exhorted them to give Jesus a large 
place in their appreciation and affections. Whether it was 
imagination or not, it seemed to us that about half of the 
faces grew dark and scowly while we spoke, and we 
associated this impression with what the teachers had 
told us respecting the opposition to everything Christian. 
Nevertheless, they sang us their Hawaiian farewell song 

R5009 :page 126 

in the natural tongue, which surprised us by its rich and 



musical qualities. 

We visited the Y.M.C.A. in its new building. We 
learned that its cost, $140,000, was subscribed in six days. 
It is conveniently arranged for its purposes. In the basement 
are bowling alleys; on the ground floor, the main 
offices, a cafe, a reading room, comfortable lounging seats, 
a room for checkers, chess and dominos, and quite a 
large room for billiards. On the next floor above is the 
gymnasium, which is evidently one of the prominent features. 
Also on this floor is a large room for night school 
instruction. Above the gymnasium, on the third floor, 
we understand, there is an auditorium, and also a small 
room on the first floor for class purposes. The building is 
in charge of very pleasant gentlemen, who treated us 
cordially. 

It is our opinion that the work in Hawaii is a good 
one, viewed from the humanitarian standpoint, but an utter 
failure viewed from the standpoint of Christianization. 
So far as we could discern, faith in the Redeeming blood 
of Jesus, in His resurrection and in His coming Kingdom 
have never been taught. But alas! this is becoming 
too true in Europe and America and amongst Christian 
people of all denominations. Only comparatively few 
any longer sing understanding^, "In the Cross of Christ 
I glory." 

A gentleman who had resided in the city for forty-two 
years remarked that in his opinion the Hawaiians are 
retrograding, are less reliable, less temperate and less 
moral than they were twenty-five years ago. 

REPORT ON MISSIONARY WORK IN JAPAN 

We found the Japanese a very interesting people. We 
traveled nearly seven hundred miles through Japan, and 
visited various cities aggregating four and a half millions 
of population, which is about one-tenth of the entire population 
of Japan. We found the people industrious, peace-loving, 
polite and kind to each other, and towards foreigners. 
Although our visit was in the holiday season, when, 
according to their custom, over indulgence in liquor would 
be pardonable, nevertheless our entire party, scattered for 
the purpose of wide observation, noted only twelve intoxicated 
persons, and three of these were Europeans. Parental 
love and care were in evidence everywhere. We heard 
not a harsh expression from parent to child, nor to any 
one, and witnessed only one altercation, and it trivial. 
Everybody seemed industrious, minding his own business, 
and happy. Our united comment was, Would to God as 
favorable conditions prevailed in Europe and America! 
We noted nothing resembling profanity, and upon inquiry 
were told that they use no profanity, and that their strongest 
expression is "beka"— fool. 

We did not, however, conclude that the fretfulness, 
unhappiness, quarrelsomeness and rudeness and boisterousness 
frequently in evidence in Europe and America 
are attributable to Christianity. On the contrary, we surmised 



that Divine Providence had sent the message of 
the Gospel in the direction of the more rude or combative 
race, which received the letter and form of Christianity in 
a measure, without generally entering into its spirit of 
meekness, gentleness, patience, long-suffering, brotherly 
kindness and love. Our comment further was that if the 
Japanese should receive the letter of the Gospel and its 
spirit they would have less difficulty than the Europeans 
and Americans in the development of the fruits of the 
Spirit, because naturally more disposed toward gentleness, 
patience and brotherly kindness. 

WHAT OF THE MISSIONARY EFFORTS? 

These observations of the Japanese gave us the keener 
interest in our investigation as to how much, if anything, 
Christianity has to do with these conditions, to what 
extent Japan is Christianized, etc. Our findings in the 
matter at Tokio will serve to illustrate. Our Committee attended 

R5009 : page 127 

nine religious services, besides the two addressed 

by Pastor Russell. The average attendance at the nine 

meetings was 59, the smallest being 9, and the largest 

250, including the ministers. Two of these services were 

in the English language; the others were in Japanese and 

addressed by Japanese ministers. One of the sermons 

in the English tongue was along the line of Evolution. 

Although many Japanese understand English they rarely 

attend preaching in that tongue. We saw but one Japanese 

at the two English services and he, apparently, 

was a servant in waiting. We were very agreeably surprised 

to note the deeply reverential attitude of the majority 

of those attending the Japanese services, and that 

fully two-thirds were males. We congratulate the laborers 

in this missionary field on the devout appearance of the 

43 1 Japanese worshipers observed by us at the seven meetings 

referred to. Of course, it is impossible to tell 

accurately the attitude of the heart from the outward 

demeanor, but reverential attitude and attention should 

count for considerable. 

ENCOURAGEMENTS AND DISCOURAGEMENTS 

It was plainly evident that the Missionaries are feeling 
a considerable degree of discouragement, nor can 
we blame them. So 
far as we could learn 
their work made considerable 
progress until 
twenty years ago, 
since which time a 
wave of unbelief has 
swept over Japan, 
just as in Europe and 



America. Today the 

Japanese minds, like 

the minds of their 

European and American 

cousins, are full 

of interrogation 

points. In other 

words, the spirit of 

agnosticism is more 

and more prevalent. 

It is affecting the 

Missions and their 

work, and also affecting 

Buddhism and 

Shintoism. Although 

Buddhist temples, recently 

built, are gorgeous 

affairs, and 

although a million 

dollars has just been raised to build a new Buddhist 

temple near Yokohama, nevertheless, it is admitted that 

Buddhism is on the wane— that the number who attend 

the temples to pray and worship are fewer than formerly, 

and generally of the more ignorant classes. 

The present trend of the Japanese religious sentiment 
is toward infidelity, doubt and atheism. An inquiry 
as to the religious sentiment in three of the Japanese 
schools (University of Tokio) recently showed the following 
religious census: 

Christians, 4; Buddhists, Confucians and Shintos, 17; 
noncommittal, 46; atheists, 60; agnostics, 282; total, 409. 
This is a terrible picture, true also, we fear, of many colleges 
in America and Europe. 

Christianity in Japan is in much the same condition 
as in America and Europe, in two respects. (1) A certain 
number are true worshipers, devout believers, but 
they are few. (2) A larger number associate for the 
advantages they gain in one way or another— as, for instance, 
the privilege of night schools, Y.M.C.A. gymnasiums, 
etc., etc. There is considerable sympathy for 
Christianity amongst those who are at heart agnostics, 
and who class Jesus as a great teacher along with Confucius 
and Buddha, but who see nothing and know nothing 
respecting His redemptive work. These realize that 
Christianity has been helping on in the work of Japanese 
civilization, and would be sorry to know of anything 
calculated to hinder the work of the Missionaries. Christianity 
and all other religions in Japan are on the 
defensive. 

JAPANESE DEMAND PROOFS BEFORE ACCEPTING DOCTRINES 

The active minds of the Japanese know that 
Buddhism cannot answer their questions respecting God 
and the future, and they come to the Missionaries and 
native Christians with questions, for which they have as 



yet received no satisfactory reply. In consequence, they 
are holding aloof and saying, There is some good in all 
religions, perhaps, but apparently all of them have more 
or less of error and superstition. We will take advantage 
of the kindly interest of these foreigners in our welfare. 
We appreciate the fact that they have invested millions 
of dollars in churches and colleges in our land. We are 
confident they have done us good and helped to some extent 
to break from us the shackles of religious superstition. 
We will attend their schools and avail ourselves 
of their kindness, and endeavor to show a kindly disposition 
toward them; but we do not believe in Jesus as 
a Savior; we merely recognize Him as a great teacher. 
We think, therefore, that it is unnecessary that we should 
be baptized. We see not how this would have anything 
to do with our character. The fact of the matter is we 
believe we get as good moral teaching from Buddhism 
as from Christianity. We will stand aloof, doubting if 
there is any positive truth on these subjects. Thus it will 
be seen that the attitude of the Japanese toward Christianity 

R5010 :page 128 

is very much the same as the general attitude of 
the public throughout Christendom. 

We should note that considerable educational work 
is being carried on at Tokio by the Methodist brethren. 
Dr. Spencer informs us that they have an attendance of 
about 350 girls and 550 young men in their college. 
They seem to be well equipped. We could wish that the 
youths of the middle and lower classes in Europe and 
America were as well provided for. 

The Missionaries themselves appear to be an earnest 
band, but considerably discouraged. And no wonder! 
Outsiders report that they have considerable denominational 
conflict and jealous competition, but that steps are 
now being taken for a general religious Federation. The 
Missionaries freely admit that in their schools and other 
work it is necessary to lay stress chiefly upon moral 
conduct and to say little or nothing about Jesus' redemptive 
work and other doctrines— otherwise they would 
lose their hold upon the pupils, who evidently attend the 
schools chiefly for the educational advantages they offer. 
We repeat that the Missionaries of Japan have our congratulations 
upon the work done years ago and our sympathy 
in respect to the discouragement of the present, 
and the unfavorable outlook. What the Japanese need is 
"the Gospel of the Kingdom," announcing the second 
coming of Jesus as the Messiah of Glory, to rule, heal 
and instruct all the families of the earth. Pastor Russell's 
sermons gave them more food for thought than they had 
ever before enjoyed. 

THE CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK IN CHINA 

At no place were we able to penetrate beyond 125 



miles inland in the great Empire of China, of 320,000,000 

people. But directly and indirectly we visited and inspected 

the conditions of life in about fifteen cities and 

villages, whose combined population was about 4,000,000. 

We saw many sad sights and heard many sad stories, 

but also both saw and heard other things 

which comforted and encouraged us. 

We were specially impressed with the 
business faculties of the Chinese, with 
their energy and general contentment, 
and, alas, also impressed with the filthiness 
and unsanitary conditions in which 
we found them in their large cities. Both 
young and old, male and female, work, 
and apparently willingly. 

China entire may be said to be revolutionized; 
few apparently have any 
sympathy with the Manchu Dynasty, 
which has just abdicated. The remarkable 
thing is that the revolutionists, 
hampered for lack of money, have been 
able to accomplish so much and to have 
preserved order so well. True, lawlessness 
has in several instances gained the 
upper hand; and, of course, it is still 
possible that the entire social fabric may 
be destroyed. There is a reason, however, 
why this seems improbable: For 

long centuries the various provinces of China have maintained 
a kind of local autonomy, not unlike that of Canada 
and Australia in respect to the British. These provinces 
or states have long had states rights, slightly after the 
fashion of the American Union. 

MISSIONARIES IN CHINA 

Without doubt missionaries have accomplished considerable 
in China. It is difficult, however, for the Chinese 
to differentiate between Christian missionaries and Christian 
tourists, Christian soldiers and sailors, Christian merchants 
and tradesmen and Christian clergymen who preach 
to such of these as attend Divine service. Gradually, however, 
we believe they are getting a proper focus upon the 
matter. We must sympathize with them in this; if we 
could put ourselves in their places, how strange it would 
all appear to us! The aloofness of the foreigners and the 
disdain with which they usually treat the natives is quite 
unfavorable also to true Christian progress here. Moreover, 
although the Chinese are aware that some good 
people are sending large sums of money in their interest, 
building colleges and hospitals and churches and schools 
and Y.M.C.A. buildings, with gymnasia, billiard rooms, 
bowling alleys, etc., they find it difficult to harmonize this 
benevolence with the fact that foreigners all conspire to 
keep wages at the lowest point— hindering as much as 
possible any advance in prices or such improvement in 



conditions as would raise prices. 

Under all these conditions it seems remarkable to us 
that Christian missionary effort has accomplished so much 
as we perceive. It seems the more amazing when we 
reflect on the Gospel message which Christendom has had 
to offer, namely, that only the saintly few have the 
slightest prospect of heaven, and that all the vast remainder 
of China's hundreds of millions and their forefathers 
are doomed to an eternity of torture. 

But with all this handicap we found some Chinese 
Christians who gave every evidence of deep sincerity. 
Some foreigners, however, told us that they were merely 
"rice Christians." This may be true of some, but we feel 
sure it is not true of all— nor even of a majority. Comparing 
the native congregations with Christian gatherings 
in Europe and America, we have every reason to believe 
that the comparison favored the Chinese. They listen 
more respectfully, reverentially and earnestly than do the 
majority of congregations in Christian lands. 

THE OUTLOOK 

The outlook is both favorable and unfavorable. It is 
unfavorable in that China is now coming under the influence 
of Higher Criticism, Evolution, etc.— not from the 
missionaries, however, who seem to be more loyal to the 
Bible than are the ministers of Christendom. This flood 
of infidelity is coming from Japan. 

The slowness of the Christian progress in China of 
late may be judged from the report of one Y.M.C.A. 

R5010 :page 129 

secretary from America. He said that in ten years the 
Association had succeeded in bringing only 25 persons 
into membership with the different Christian churches of 
all denominations. And the Y.M.C.A., be it remembered, 
is chiefly a moral club dominated by Christian influence 
—much the same as in Europe and America— and 
apparently the chief recruiting ground for the churches. 
So far as we were able to sense the situation from the 
missionary viewpoint it is this: The influence of Christianity 
has brought a measure of enlightenment to the 
Chinese which led up to the recent revolution. The revolution 
itself is dominated by the Christian 
Chinese, partly because they are the more 
intelligent. The solid front which Chinese 
religions have heretofore maintained is 
breaking. Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism 
still dominate the masses, but 
many are saying, We are non-sectarian; 
we take the best of all these religions 
and admit that there are good things also 
to be said respecting Christianity. The 
progressive Chinese of the revolutionist 
party proclaim that henceforth China 



shall be known as one of the Christian 

nations. By this they do not mean, however, 

that the Chinese will be converted 

to faith in Jesus as the Redeemer of the 

world and their personal Savior, but 

merely that China recognizes that the nations 

which call themselves Christian, are 

more wise, more intelligent, less superstitious, 

better educated and better warriors 

than the nations which recognize 

Buddhism, Brahminism, Taoism, Mohammedanism, etc. 

The statement, therefore, simply means that the Chinese 

propose to adopt Occidental manners and customs and, 

so far as possible, Occidental lines of thought. 

DIFFICULTIES SHOULD BE PROMPTLY REMOVED 

But while the psychological moment for the spread of 
Christianity would appear to have arrived, there is a difficulty. 
The Chinaman is perplexed by the 600 different 
denominations of Christians and the 600 different theories 
of salvation which they represent. Once awakened to 
thought he is more critical, if not more logical, than the 
masses of Christendom in respect to what he will accept 
instead of the doctrines he proposes to drop. He asks 
the missionaries all kinds of questions, the majority of 
which receive no satisfactory answer. One of the principal 
difficulties is on the subject of the Trinity— how there 
could be one God and He of three different persons, or 
how there could be three different Gods and yet these 
three be only one person; and how the one God could be 
dead for three days and raise Himself from the dead. The 
Chinese mind seems unable to grasp this mathematical 
problem. 

As between the Protestant Hell and the Catholic 
Purgatory, the Chinaman is also perplexed. He wants to 
know where Hell and Purgatory are located, and who 
knows and how he knows. He seems perplexed to understand 
how a just and loving God should bring so many 
people into existence for such a fate. While Christianity 
appeals to them in some ways, it repels them along these 
lines; the poor Chinese are really in a quandary. The 
trend amongst the more thoughtful ones seems to be to 
consider all religions as more or less superstitions, useful 
merely for the control of the more degraded and vicious. 

In view of these limitations, the missionaries now find 
it inexpedient to discuss doctrinal matters. Instead, the 
chief attention is given to schools, colleges, hospitals, Y.M.C.A. 
privileges, sports, etc. Their hope is that this 
beneficial influence may gradually attract more and more 
the Chinese, and that thus will spring up a preference for 
Christian methods and places of worship over and above 

R5011 :page 129 

those of other religions. 



WHICH IS THE RIGHT SHIP? 

One missionary likened the Christian church and its 
salvation to a large ship: The passengers board the 
vessel in confidence, trusting all to the officers, and do 
not study the maps, charts and compass nor inquire particularly 
respecting the machinery. So all desiring to be 
saved, he said, should get into the Church and live and 
rest there contented, without inquiring particularly into 
doctrines, trusting implicitly to the final outcome. 

But some of the hearers inquired, Which boat— which 
church? Are there not many Christian boats, Catholic 
and Protestant? Which one will surely be properly navigated 
and bring all of her passengers to the heavenly 
port? 

Such knotty questions are, of course, perplexing to 
the missionaries, unused to such close reasonings in their 
own lands. We sympathize with the missionaries, realizing 
that they are in a very difficult situation. In conversation 
many of them manifested great earnestness and real 
piety and deplored their inability to accomplish greater 
results along religious lines. Others, a minority, we hope, 
seem to have a narrow and hypocritical spirit. Sent to 
convert the heathen they would like to make such reports 
as would please and not discourage those who sent them 
forth, especially in view of the fact that the Home Secretaries 
write them that donations are falling off and 
that encouraging reports must be made. 

Much has been said respecting the fact that the missionaries 
live in palatial residences and hold themselves 
so aloof from the people whom they would interest that 
the latter discount all their professions of love and sympathy. 
Having heard such reports we sought to determine 
whether or not they were truthful, and, if so, the 
cause. We did find palatial residences of ministers in 
Hong Kong and Shanghai, but these were not, strictly 
speaking, missionaries who served the Chinese. These 
ministers serve and are chiefly supported by Americans, 
British, Germans, etc. (merchants, consuls, military officers, 
etc.). One of these serves the Union Church in 
Shanghai at $2,400 gold ($4,800 Chinese money) per 

R5011 :page 130 

year. Of course, out of this he can well afford to live 
quite luxuriously in China. It is true that the missionaries 
also live in compounds, near the college buildings, separate 
entirely from the natives. These substantial structures, 
of course, must appear to the natives as palatial, 
greatly in contrast with their own hovels. 

But we have not the heart to blame Western people for 
desiring to live according to their own standard when it is 
possible. No doubt some of them would serve with equal 
zeal if they had nowhere to lay their heads superior to the 
native house-boats on the river or the hovels on the shore. 



As one of them very frankly said, The constant din and 
hum of voices from earliest morning till latest night is 
very wearing upon the more delicate nervous systems of 
Caucasians and calculated to bring on nervous prostration, 
hence the better houses, purer air, better food, etc., 
may be considered almost in the light of necessities. Nor 
can we suppose that those who sent forth the missionaries 
and are paying their expenses desire them to live on the 
same level as the Chinese, even if their health would 
permit. On the whole, the average missionary seems to be 
doing in this respect about as faithfully as the majority 
of Christian people and Christian ministers in their home 
lands. So far as their clothing is concerned, we saw 
nothing that would be considered extravagant, even 
though much superior to the poor toggery of the majority 
of the natives. 

THE RED CROSS SOCIETY 

We have for years heard much of famines and consequent 
pestilences in China and these have usually been reported 
from practically the same district— the valley of 
the Yangtse River, which is navigable by large vessels 
for 900 miles. There is no doubt about the distress; many 
of the poor people are in a very pitiable condition. This 
is the third year in succession in which they have suffered 
famine. Even the seed sown was lost by reason of the 
great freshets. It is safe to say that two millions are on 
the verge of starvation— many have already starved to 
death. Money and rice from America have been poured 
into this district time and again, giving a moiety of relief, 
but the cause of the trouble remains— the river conditions. 

The American Red Cross Society, organized for the 
preservation of life, and having as its President the Honorable 
William H. Taft, sent engineers to look into the 
difficulties and to confer with the Chinese Government 
respecting a permanent remedy. It has required time to 
make surveys and for engineers to decide what is necessary. 
The matter had reached a satisfactory conclusion 
and work was about to be begun when the revolution interrupted. 
It is anticipated that the new government will 
take the matter up. The engineer in charge, Mr. Jameson, 
informed us that he hopes to put to work speedily 
on the necessary improvements 30,000 of the destitute, 
and thus help a little in stemming the famine difficulties. 
While the matter is not under missionary auspices, 
it nevertheless has, in the minds of the Chinese, a 
missionary association and a helpful influence. Indeed, 
it is only along the lines of higher civilization that any 
considerable work can be accomplished now in China. 
Nevertheless, the Chinese are awakening and, like the 
Japanese, are wanting a new religion, rational as well as 
reverential. Is it not the same in Europe and America? 

Pastor Russell addressed the natives on two occasions. 
Considerable interest was manifested and Chinese reports 
of both discourses were published, the publishers proposing 



to continue such publications weekly after the manner of 
the American and British newspapers. Something in his 
presentation seemed specially to strike interest and convince 
many of his hearers. In response to an offer of 
free reading matter in English, many addresses were 
handed in. 

THE MORALS OF CHINA 

The Chinese moral standard differs considerably from 
ours, but they apparently respect their own; there is no 
obtrusion of the nude and lewd. We saw no immodest 
dressing— nothing to suggest impurity or licentiousness. 
Mr. Lerrigo, Secretary of the Canton Y.M.C.A., informed 
us that the Chinese of the Association had recently 
purchased a moving-picture outfit, but that they immediately 
objected to the immodesty of some of the pictures, 
which would be thought all right in Europe and 
America. A censorship committee was appointed, and 
every picture in the slightest degree immodest is eliminated. 
In their Christian gatherings the sexes sit apart. 
When we sought for photographic views representing the 
Chinese, their customs and homes, we found them all 
modest, chaste. Vulgar, foolish and immodest pictures 
there were on sale, but they were of European manufacture, 
and apparently sold to Europeans and Americans. 
A missionary of thirty years' residence assured us that 
the moral status of the people in general is quite good, 
excepting that of the Buddhist priests. 

UNITED STATES MISSIONS 

Our visit to the Philippine Islands gave us a greatly 
increased respect for the American flag. The change 
wrought in the twelve years of American supervision of 
the Philippines is little short of a miracle. Little did we 

R5011 :page 131 

suppose that our Government had been carrying on so 

benevolent a work as we there beheld. True, it is not a 

missionary work in the proper sense of that term, in that 

it is not attempting to give the Filipinos religious instruction 

of any kind. Nevertheless, the work is very similar 

to that which all Foreign Missions are now attempting in 

Oriental countries— a work of education and moral and 

social uplift, etc. The officers and soldiers 

whom we met were a credit to the greatest 

nation in the world, including the 

Major General commanding the forces 

of the Philippines, the Civil Governor 

and those of the civil service officials 

with whom we became acquainted. 

When our Government took over the 
control of these Islands from Spain there 
were thousands of Jesuits and Friars in 



the Islands in control of vast estates, but 

the people were ignorant. These friars 

still own 95 per cent, of the property within 

the walled city of Manila, we were 

told. The Government rents from them 

considerable property, paying $4,000 gold 

rent per year for one building alone. 

Nothing has been done by the United 

States Government against Catholicism; 

no Protestant denomination has been 

favored in any manner. Instead a thousand 

American teachers were imported, 

of whom 800 still remain. These are now supplemented 

by 6,000 native teachers. The Filipino thirst for education 

is rapidly increasing. The Legislature has recently 

determined upon the erection of 400 new school houses 

and the addition of many teachers. Do you have compulsory 

education? we inquired. The answer was, It is 

unnecessary; we cannot equip the schools rapidly enough 

as it is; we 

are obliged 

to run two 

shifts in order 

to accommodate 

those 

who are anxious 

to learn. 

An up-to-date 
hospital 
has been 
erected; it is 
probably as 
complete as 
any hospital 
in the world, 
and its free 
dispensary 
has the 
distinction of 
being sixth 
in the world's 
record of 
cases treated 
in a year— 
80,000 cases 
last year. 

Steam 
railways, 
electric railways, 

etc., with modern buildings and a newly dredged 
harbor are rapidly increasing the business interests and 
lifting the people from serfdom and peonage to intelligence 
and good citizenship. 

R5012:page 131 



UNITED STATES TREATING FILIPINOS AS AN ELDER 
BROTHER 

To give an idea of the progress made, we note the 
fact that at a meeting addressed by Pastor Russell there 
were present about 1,000 Filipino young men, ages from 
18 to 30, who understand English, and who gave the very 
closest attention. Following the address some 300 applications 
for literature were voluntarily handed to Pastor 
Russell. This is in keeping with the general manifestation 
of this people for knowledge along every line. Another 
indication of their progress was manifested recently. A 
proposal was made that a Y.M.C.A. for Filipinos be 
established. The American Central Committee made an 
offer of $140,000, provided the Filipinos of Manila themselves 
would raise $80,000. The amount was more than 
subscribed— $100,000 was contributed. 

To our surprise, the Governor General and others assured 
us that all of these improvements are being made 
by the Filipinos themselves— at their own cost. The 
United States Government merely supervises the matter 
through its representatives. The judges, physicians, 
nurses, teachers, schools, are all paid for out of Filipino 
funds under our Government's wise and economical management 
of their affairs; as an elder brother doing for a 
younger. We felt proud indeed of the record. When 
we contrasted the results here manifested and the benevolent 
methods used with the selfish exploiting practices 
only too common, we thanked God that whatever the 
blemishes of our Government and whatever its shortcomings, 
it has a record for justice second to none ever made 
in this world's history, and that without hypocrisy. 

This fairness manifested by our Government is telling 
upon the Filipinos, who at first misunderstood. It is also 
influencing the large number of Chinese residing there. 
Indeed, the whole world is taking notice; but alas ! we 
fear that no colonizing nation is ready to follow the example. 
The peoples of the Orient are practical and nothing 
could much more commend to them the principles of 
Christianity than our Government's course. Quite to the 
contrary, the operations and exploitations of European 
governments have given the missionaries a very uphill 
work in what they have sought to do. The very fact that 
these exploiting governments have backed up and protected 

R5012:page 132 

the missionaries has had, we believe, an influence 
derogatory to missions. 

THE MALAY PENINSULA 

Your Committee visited Singapore and Penang and 
had interesting and profitable experiences. The greatest 
missionary effort in both places appeared to be under 
Methodist control. The work being done in these two 



Malayan centers reminded us very much of what we have 

already mentioned respecting the work in progress in the 

Philippine Islands. Like that, it seemed 

to be chiefly a work of secular education, 

and quite successful, although conducted 

along different lines. The Government 

subsidizes the schools liberally, besides 

which a tuition fee is charged. In these 

respects we believe the work less successful 

than that in the Philippines, where 

the education is free, and where the 

Government provides the schools and 

teachers and cannot supply them rapidly 

enough. 

These Methodist schools in Singapore 
and Penang, so far as we were able to 
learn, have 2,500 and 2,000 pupils respectively 
in attendance, and with Government 
subsidization, are self-supporting. 
These pupils are attracted from all parts of the 
Peninsula, and some from Siam and from Sumatra, across 
the Straits. Naturally the expenses attaching to these 
scholarships must reduce the number in attendance and 
confine it to the comparatively better-off classes. In the 
Philippines, on the contrary, the free schools and their 
teachers are scattered everywhere, and all people, rich 
and poor, have educational opportunities. While, therefore, 
we highly commend the work being done here, we 
still believe that the American plan is the superior one. 
It is astonishing to note how anxious the peoples of these 
parts seem to be to gain an education. 

Inquiry respecting Christianity amongst the students 
revealed the fact that a certain amount of religious matter 
is introduced daily, in that the sessions are opened with 
prayer, and some of the simpler Bible stories and parables 
are brought to the attention of the pupils. Of course, 
only a small proportion of the entire attendance at these 
schools ever take the full course of instruction, but we 
are informed that one-quarter of those who do graduate 
profess Christianity, as preferable to the religion of their 
birth, although they do not very generally join any of the 
Christian churches. We were glad to learn that here, as 
well as in China, prejudice against Christianity is 
rapidly breaking down, and that the Chinese who predominate 
here prefer American and English teachers 
rather than their own. Indeed, they are quite willing to 
pay good salaries for competent teachers, who are in 
demand. 

We did not have favorable opportunities for contact 
with the native Christians, who are of many nationalities. 
We learned with pleasure, however, that while they are 
few in number, they give evidence of sincerity. Other 
denominations were represented as active, but in a much 
smaller way, and much less successful than the work 
noted. 



CHRISTIAN INFLUENCE IN INDIA 

For centuries India has been a missionary field— particularly 
the southern portion, and the Island of Ceylon 
adjacent. Tradition has it that St. Thomas, one of the 
twelve Apostles, visited Ceylon and Madras. A cathedral 
to his memory stands in Madras, covering, it is claimed, 
his grave. The legend is quite specific. We were shown 
the cave where he was attacked by the Brahmins, but 
from which he escaped. About two miles from it is what 
is termed Mt. Saint Thomas. This is the place where, 
supposedly, he was speared to death by a Brahmin. Of 
course, these incidentals may have belonged to some other 
man by the name of Thomas, and centuries of time may 
have confounded him with the Apostle Thomas. But that 
some man by the name of Thomas, a Christian Missionary, 
visited those parts long ago could scarcely be questioned. 

Additional tradition shows that at a very early period 
Syrian Christians made a settlement on the southwest 
coast. They still maintain an organization, and a church 
history running back from twelve to fifteen hundred years, 
and they now number about a quarter of a million in the 
Province of Travancore, whose population is about three 
millions. 

The London Missionary Society, a Congregational institution, 
has carried on a work in Travancore since 1806. 
They have had some success, almost exclusively with the 
lower castes, some of whose forbears were slaves. They 
claim now a church membership of ten thousand. Although 
Travancore is one of the smallest of the India 
Provinces, we have given it prominence because Christian 
missionary effort here appears to have reached a 
better development than elsewhere, so far as we could 
discern. The natives are very poor, but industrious, and 
apparently honest-hearted. The higher castes, which adhere 
to Hinduism, seem not averse to Christianity, but reject 
it, because to them it seems less logical than their 
own beliefs. The natives from the lower castes, reached 
by the Gospel message, have certainly been blessed above 
their fellows still remaining under the grosser superstitions 
and idolatry of Hinduism. 

Northward from Travancore and Madras we found 
evidences of missionary activity, but they were newer and 
their successful work correspondingly less in evidence. 
We were pleased, however, to note that some amongst the 
natives in all parts give evidence of great sincerity and 
Christian devotion to the extent of their knowledge of 
the Lord and His Word. These, however, of course, are 
very isolated cases, just as this class of Christians is scarce 
in every part of the world. 

METHODS EMPLOYED TO INTEREST NATIVES 

Various are the methods used by the Missionaries to 
gain a hold upon the people of India, and to lift them 
from idolatry and superstition. The college appears to be 



the most attractive bait. There is a thirst for knowledge, 
even though it be less in India than could be wished for. 
In only one locality did we hear of children being hired 
to attend school by the payment of a trifling sum. We 
were told that for this inducement the parents would compel 

R5012:page 133 

the attendance of the children, but not without it. In 
various parts of India there are academies and colleges 
controlled by the Missionaries. These are attractive to the 
young men, because of the educational facilities. The 
students are not required to make any profession of Christianity 
in joining the schools, but rather are assured that 
no attempt will be made to indoctrinate them. These students, 
we are advised, come largely from the upper Brahmin 
caste, influence with which is much coveted by the 
Missionaries. 

Inquiry as to how Christian interest was sustained 
amongst these young men brought the answer that the 
majority, after graduating, scoff at Christianity, and 
claim a superiority for Hinduism. They seem to catch 
in the schools the spirit of "Higher Criticism." We cannot 
surely tell the mental attitude of these young men 
when they enter the schools, because we know that the 
influence of the schooling in the colleges in Christendom 
tends to similar unbelief in the Bible. Inquiry respecting 
the status of the Protestant Missionaries on the subject 
of faith in the Bible brought the report that many of them 
are Higher Critics and Evolutionists, who no longer believe 
in the Bible as the inspired Word of God. It seems 
to be conceded, however, that higher critical teachings 
are not conveyed to the scholars in a public manner, but 

R5013 :page 133 

rather, as in Christendom, covertly. 

We found evidence of very sincere Christian endeavor 
on the part of the Missionaries in the past, with some 
fruitage in consecrated natives. We found the Missionaries 
of the present time earnest and attentive to their 
work, but, like ministers of Christendom, they seem to 
have had their spirituality sapped, devitalized, and, probably, 
by the same influences— "Higher-Critical-Infidel-Evolutionary" 
theories. Only one missionary did we hear 
of preaching eternal torture, and he was a new arrival on 
the field. Contact with "heathendom" seems to fully settle 
in the minds of all reasoning people that God never intended 
the eternal torture of all except the comparatively 
few who put their trust in the redemptive work of Jesus, 
and subsequently seek to walk in His steps. 

SINCERITY OF MANY NATIVES EVIDENT 

On every hand may be seen evidences that the poor 
Hindus are as sincere at heart in their worship as any 



Christian could possibly be. There is not 
the slightest sign that the devotions of 
the majority are hypocritical— "to be seen 
of men." Although their devotions are 
performed publicly, fearlessly, they are 
reverential and seem to be addressed to 
some unseen god, even though crude idols 
are at times apparently used to represent 
him, according to a philosophy which we 
are unable to appreciate. However, when 
we remembered the terrible mental pictures 
of the Almighty drawn by some of 
our creeds, and contrasted these with the 
ugly idols worshipped by some of these 
poor peoples, we felt inclined to say that 
of the two the creed idol was the more 
repulsive. 

The Salvation Army has recently entered 
the missionary lists in India. Its 
sympathetic method of mingling with and 
aiding the lowest caste to better ideas of 
home-life and cleanliness is commendable. If only their 
fifes and drums called the people to hear of God's love, 
and the good tidings of His provision for all in Messiah's 
Kingdom, what good they might accomplish! They are 
making quite a show of success by attracting to their 
service young teachers, "catechists," from other missions, 
by more liberal allowances for their expenses. 

MORE THAN EDUCATION NEEDED TO LIFT NATIVES OUT 
OF SUPERSTITION 

At Benares we had a Christian native for a guide, and 
he informed us that many of the poor people who were 
bathing in the Ganges, and hoping thereby to wash away 
their sins, had been educated, some of them in Christian 
schools, so that quite a good many of them were conversant 
with the English language. This surely was a very 
discouraging discovery. It indicated that even more than 
education is necessary to lift these peoples out of their 
deep-seated superstitions. 

Missionaries and Christianity have frequently been 
blamed with doing injury to the people. Many say, "You 
can trust a native who has not professed Christianity, but 
beware lest you ever trust one who has been Christianized 
—they are not dependable." It may be that something 
connected with Missionary effort promotes dishonesty in 
those who receive its benefits, but in our opinion the Missionaries 
and their methods are less to be blamed than the 
Europeans residing in India and transient visitors. Apparently 
the more consecrated people of Christendom remain 
at home. There can be no doubt that the influence 
of the white man in a general way upon the people of 
India has to a considerable extent been demoralizing, and 
this demoralizing influence, exercised by representatives 
of Christendom, seems to more than counteract the helpful 



influences of the Bible and the Missionaries. The natives 
of lower castes look up to the whites, but find their 
disgraces easier to copy than their graces. 

In Madras we became acquainted with a native Christian 
worker who was conducting a temperance mission. 
We remarked that we had been greatly surprised to find 
the natives quite free from the influence of intoxicating 
liquors, and that we were surprised at his having 
a Temperance Mission. He corroborated our understanding 
of the matter that Hindus and Mohammedans, 
who constitute the bulk of the population, repudiate intoxicating 
liquors. He said that his labors were chiefly 
amongst the young natives who were influenced by Christianity, 
and who were rapidly becoming addicted to intoxicating 
liquors. We learned also that amongst the 
Mohammedans there is a class increasingly numerous 
which, following the example of the whites, are becoming 
skeptical of religion and correspondingly dissolute in their 

R5013 :page 134 

habits. As for the whites, nearly all seem to use liquors 
and tobacco. The irreligion and nominalism of the majority 
of the whites discount greatly all missionary efforts. 

A REVIEW OF THE COMMITTEE'S TOUR 

The Committee traveled in India about four thousand 
miles altogether— by railway, bullock-carts, automobiles, 
pony-carts, jinrickshas, carriages, etc. 

From the Straits of Malay our party came to the Island 
of Ceylon. We had some interesting experiences in its 
chief city, Colombo. A number of Bible students of that 
place met us on our arrival, and gave us hearty greetings 
of welcome. Our fellowship with them was sweet, 
and three of them subsequently accompanied us for a few 
days through the Travancore District of India. Here in 
Colombo a meeting had been arranged for in the Public 
Hall, to be addressed by Pastor Russell. Although the 
hour appointed was early, the house was crowded, about 
900 being present. Close attention was given, and at the 
conclusion of the meeting many addresses were handed 
in for literature on Biblical topics. 

Another interesting experience worth relating was a 
visit by the Committee to the Lepers' Hospital on an 
island adjoining the city. The hospital is presided over 
by an educated Indian of the Parsee faith, who with 
great cordiality arranged for Pastor Russell to give an 
address (through an interpreter) to the lepers. Many 
heard with interest, and amongst them some inquired for 
literature. 

TRAVANCORE PROVINCE-INDIA 

A full week was given to southwest India, and it was 
worthy of it. Our first stop was at Russell-Purim, the 



principal point at which Brother Davey for two years has 

let shine the "Gospel of the Kingdom." Pastor Russell 

preached there twice through interpreters to audiences 

variously estimated from two to five thousand. Nearly 

two miles from the meeting place we were met by a thousand 

of the natives who escorted us to a hastily improvised 

auditorium. A fife and drum corps preceded us, 

while behind us came bagpipes, tom-toms and various 

musical instruments unknown to us. Many of those who 

met us carried banners of welcome and marched ahead of 

our motor car, while on either side were 

lined up others who greeted us, singing 

native hymns of welcome. Our Committee 

was quite unprepared for such a 

reception, and in the general din could 

merely express our appreciation by bowing 

to the multitudes who walked and 

ran before, beside and behind us to the 

meeting place, constantly joined by other 

hundreds on the way, and finally by thousands 

who were waiting for us at the 

auditorium. 

When we stepped upon the platform 
each member of the Committee was 
presented with a garland of flowers, 
strung after the native style. These were 
hung about our necks. To each of us 
was presented also a bouquet of flowers 
handsomely arranged in a manner which, 
we were informed, to the natives signified 
peace, love and good will. Next came 
fans and a glass of cocoanut milk. It was following 
these experiences and refreshments that Pastor Russell 
gave his address. Following the first address we were 
introduced to some of the officials of the vicinity. 

NAGERCOIL -MISSION CENTER 

Our next stop was at Nagercoil, where the London 
Missionary Society has a college. We were kindly received 
by the Secretary in charge, and, as per arrangement 
made in advance, Pastor Russell delivered an address. 
The auditorium was crowded, as were the doors 
and windows, while hundreds were unable to get within 
hearing distance. Natives constituted the audience, except 
the white teachers. Amongst them, we were informed, 
were educated Hindus as well as Christians, and nearly all 
were men. 

TRIVANDUM-THE CAPITAL 

The next stop was at Trivandum, the capital of 
Travancore. Two meetings were held in Victoria City 
Hall, which on both occasions was crowded to overflowing. 
We cannot, of course, know to what extent the hearers 
received the message. It was quite manifest, however, 



from their conduct, that some of the Hindus had 
come to sneer at anything Christian. It was equally 
manifest that by the time of the close of the meeting 
most of this disposition had faded away; the faces were 
earnest— many of them markedly sincere. They heard 
the Bible defended and Christianity upheld with more of 
an appeal than ever before to the Bible, as well as to 
reason. Nearly 200 requested literature, expressing a desire 
to study further the matter which they had heard— 
some of them expressing deep concern. 

Five other less important places were visited and meetings 
held ere 

WE REACHED MADRAS 

In Madras we had very interesting experiences also. 
Three meetings were held in different localities, all of 
them crowded. Nearly three hundred applications for 
literature were handed in. It was while in this vicinity 
that we visited the Mount of Saint Thomas, where, according 
to tradition, the Apostle Thomas, as before referred to, 
suffered martyrdom by a spear-thrust at the hands of a 
Brahmin. 

THE VIZAGAPATAM MISSION 

We had an interesting visit to Vizagapatam, which 
has a mission now under the control of the Canadian Baptists, 
having been transferred to them by the London 
Missionary Society. A public meeting was held in the 
chapel and we attended. The missionary and his wife 
were present, and also two men and two women, native 

R5014:page 135 

teachers or workers. It was Quarterly Meeting Day, and 
about six boys and six girls repeated Scripture verses, 
committed to memory, in the presence of an audience of 
about forty adults. These missionaries and teachers- 
yea, and all missionaries— have the sympathy of the Committee, 
for we realized that they have a difficult proposition 
—an impossible one, so far as the conversion of 
the world is concerned. 

CALCUTTA-CITY OF PALACES 

Some of us journeyed from Madras to Calcutta, while 
another passed through the Mysore District to Bombay. 
All of our experiences were interesting. We were impressed 
with the fact that while the natives respect the 
whites as a superior race, they are perplexed with some 
of their religious teachings, and inclined to think that 
many professing Christianity are only partially sincere in 
professing such beliefs— for instance, Mohammedans 
cannot receive the "Doctrine of the Trinity." They accept 
our Old Testament Scriptures, but declare that these 



forbid the worship of any but the one God. They therefore 
oppose Christians in preaching that there are three 
gods, even as they oppose the Hindus for preaching that 
there are five thousand gods. 

All (Hindus and Mohammedans) are perplexed that 
these superior whites should insist on justice, kindness 
and love and yet teach that the Creator is devoid of these 
qualities— that He foreordained their forefathers to an 
eternity of torture, well knowing what He was doing, and 
that He has allowed ignorance to prevail in the earth 
over the masses of mankind, while demanding knowledge 
and faith as a basis for salvation. They say, What we 
already believe seems to us more reasonable than this. 
We have some bad gods of our own, but none of them are 
so vicious as the Christian God is represented to be. We 
also have kind and generous gods and merciful gods, and 
these teach us that we must be kind and generous toward 
each other and towards even the brute beasts. Why, they 
ask, should we leave our own faith, which is older than 
yours, to accept your views, which are less reasonable, just 
and loving than our own? 

RELIGION NOT GENERALLY TAUGHT 

Of course, missionaries find it very difficult to answer 
such propositions. One result is that little is said about 
the future punishment of unbelievers, etc. If much were 
said on these subjects, Hindu children would not be allowed 
to attend the schools. To maintain a hold upon 
the children, to be able to make interesting reports of the 
progress of their work, and to seemingly justify their continuance 
in the work, the pupils must be held on to. Religious 
instruction is generally avoided, except at times, 
when it is optional with the pupils to attend. 

Another matter connected with the schools should be 
mentioned: Of late years, the Government has been fostering 
education by giving liberal allowances to schools 
of a satisfactory curriculum. But the Government requires 
that such schools, aided out of the public treasury, 
shall be non-religious. The various mission schools of 
practically all denominations are now competing for such 
Government patronage— to compensate for the falling off 
of missionary donations. As a consequence these mission 
schools are non-religious— purely secular— with merely a 
Christian influence attaching, and, as already noted, this 
Christian influence is of late vitiated and neutralized by 
an unbelief in the Bible, the fruitage of "Higher-Criticism-Evolutionary" 
theories. 

The critics of the Christian religion are, of course, 
mainly from the upper castes. Those of the lower castes 
wonder much, understand little, and seem to be in expectation 
of harsh language and ill treatment, both from the 
whites and the higher castes of Indians. In all of our 
journeyings we were impressed with the gentleness of the 
people as a whole, and the evident affection of parents 
for their children. Only amongst those who have been 



closely associated with the whites did we find the quarreling 
and wrangling disposition. 

In Calcutta two meetings were held, addressed by Pastor 
Russell. Although the attendance was not large, the 
interest was considerable, as evidenced by the fact that 
170 handed in their names and addresses for literature. 

We were informed that the advertising implied that 
only the whites were invited, and if the natives had known 
that they would have been welcome, crowds would have 
been turned away. 

BENARES-'THE HOLY CITY" 

Benares was our next stopping point. It is the Mecca 
of India. As a city it is said to be sacred to more people 
of different religions than any other city on earth. No 
attempt was made to hold a meeting there. The people 
seem more ignorant and superstitious than at any other 
point visited. The principal interest here, aside from the 
temples, which we did not visit, were the bathing ghats 
along the shore of the Ganges river. To these pilgrimages 
are made from various parts of India. They go down the 
steps into the water, which to them is sacred; they bathe, 
pray the while, and finally, before leaving, many of them 
fill little vessels with the "sacred" water, which they carry 
home with them. It was particularly saddening and discouraging 
to be told by a native Christian that many who 
go thither to bathe have had contact with Christianity and 
modern education. It reminded us of the saying of a 
Missionary in Japan, namely, that one of the most discouraging 
features of his work was that some of the 
members of his congregation who had professed Christianity 
for years, nevertheless went annually to the Shinto 
temple to worship their ancestors. 

LUCKNOW--CAWNPORE--AGRA, ETC. 

These places were interesting, each in its way, but 
less so than places already described, with nothing specially 
worthy of noting. 

BOMBAY, THE BEAUTIFUL 

Our experiences at Bombay closed this most interesting 
tour through India. Here Pastor Russell addressed two 
very intelligent audiences, composed partially of whites, 
the remainder being of high caste natives. Some stood and 
many, desirous of hearing, were unable to gain admission. 
Here again many requests for literature were handed in. 

The next day on the pier, as we were departing for 
Egypt, an educated native of the Parsee caste, who had 
accepted Christianity, came to bid us good by, bringing 
with him a long garland of flowers of sweet odor, which 
he hung about Pastor Russell's shoulders, and presenting 
him at the same time with a very handsome bouquet in 
the form of a scepter. He declared himself under lasting 



obligations for the assistance in the understanding of 
God's Word afforded by the meeting of the night previous. 
He also handed in his address for literature. 

CONCLUDING THOUGHTS ON INDIA 

From the foregoing it will be noted that in the Committee's 
estimation the true Christianity has made more 
advancement in the Province of Travancore than in any 
other. We believe the readers of this report will feel a 
special interest in the people of that Province. We tried 
to think of some little souvenir of that Province, and 
found one which, we believe, will be generally interesting. 
It is the smallest coin used in Travancore, and probably 
one of the smallest in value in the world, about one-tenth 

R5014:page 136 

of a cent each. Yet in one sense of the word it is the basis 
of all monetary value, for it is called "cash." 

We have brought with us several thousand of these 
from the Travancore mint— new. They are for the International 
Bible Students Association classes. Each 
class desiring these souvenirs should, through its secretary, 
send to the Brooklyn office a list of names of its 
members desiring one coin each; thus each class may be 
served at one sending— saving trouble and expense. 
These souvenirs will be sent free, postpaid. 

With deep gratitude to God for the privileges and 
lessons connected with this world-tour of Mission Investigation, 
we conclude our Report with a Categorical Summary, 
which notes the questions given us for our guidance, 
and our answers thereto following each. 

THE CATEGORICAL SUMMARY 

I.— "Are Foreign Missions conducted along Christian 
business lines?" 

Ans.— As these terms are generally understood, Yes. 

II.— "To what extent are the methods used successful 
in reaching the heathen peoples, and in bringing them to 
Christianity?" 

Ans.— The success attained by Missionaries is small. 
We found Oriental Christians about as sincere, intelligent 
and earnest as the average of 
church attendants in America and Europe; 
and, as there, a very few who gave evidence 
of being consecrated to God and 
His service. 

But, viewing the question from the 
standpoint of the present and future, 
rather than the past, our Report is different. 
The present methods cannot be 
called successful, because Christianizing 
endeavors seem pretty generally to have 
ceased! Present missionary endeavors 



are almost exclusively along the lines of 
secular education. Although this is not 
Christianizing work, it is, of course, a 
good work, for the poor Orientals surely 
need education. 

R5015 :page 136 

In your Committee's opinion, however, 
there is less need for Academic and 
Collegiate education, such as the Missionaries 
forward, than for Common 

Schooling. The Oriental, after obtaining higher education, 
is spoiled for the common affairs of life about him, 
and aspires only to teaching, clerkship and office holding, 
which are over-supplied. Unable to get such employment, 
he is in trouble. He will not dig, and to beg he is ashamed. 
But the general Common School education, your Committee 
believes, could best be done by the Government, 
and along unsectarian lines, after the method followed 
by the United States of America in its supervision of the 
Philippine Islands. Christians, of course, would be the 
best for teachers. 

III.— "What are the teachings, and what are the inducements 
to accept Christianity, and how enduring are 
the results?" 

Answer.— There are evidences of positive teachings in 
the past, but there is very little religious teaching now being 
done, because the people would resent it, and keep 
their children from the schools. We heard of instances 
where a small coin per day was given to each child attending 
school; but, aside from the schooling, the inducements 
offered by the Missionaries are chiefly social and 
medical. 

Of late the natives are more and more averse to a 
public avowal of Christianity, because with increasing 
intelligence come doubts. The tendency of the times in 
the Orient, as in the Occident, is toward unbelief in any 
religion. If a Missionary falls from faith in the Bible 
into "Higher-Criticism-Infidelity," he may continue his 
office and profession. But the Orientals have no such inducements 
to outwardly profess what they no longer believe 
(except native teachers). Besides, these Orientals 
are very honest in respect to their religious professions, 
except where spoiled by contact with the hypocrisy of the 
whites. 

IV.— "What is the attitude of heathendom toward the 
Missionaries, and toward Christianity, and what is the 
prospect of Foreign Missions becoming self-supporting?" 

Answer.— The Orientals are remarkably tolerant of all 
religions, but are often perplexed at the Missionary competition 
and opposition of Christian denominations. The 
higher castes consider the medley of Christian doctrines 
presented to them less philosophical than their own. Their 
own, however, is not satisfactory, they confess. But before 
exchanging for another they want to know that the 



change will be for the better. The common conception, 

that all the peoples of India, China and Japan are heathen 

savages, is very erroneous. Their upper classes, or castes, 

include some splendid characters of truly noble manhood, 

the moral and intellectual peers of Europeans and Americans. 

Indeed, the masses of these people are less vicious, 

less rude, more kind and considerate than are the masses 

of Europe and America. Drunkenness and outward immodesty 

are almost entirely unknown amongst the 

Orientals. 

Many of the congregations of Christians in Japan, 
China and India are self-sustaining. And in such cases 
the Orientals prefer to take over the full control of all 
services, rather than to have the Missionaries take any 
part. The native ministers come closer to the people than 
it is possible for the whites to do. Habits and customs of 
life make it almost impossible for Missionaries to live in 
the very simple style of the Orientals, and it would not be 
reasonable to require it. 

V.— "What, if any, change should be made in the 
teachings and financial administration to make the Foreign 
Mission work more successful?" 

Answer.— The great change necessary to make Missionary 
work more successful is for the Missionaries to 
have and to impart to the people a more logical Gospel. 
To preach to the millions of the Orient that God foreordained 
them to ignorance of the true religion, and condemned 
all the generations of their forefathers, on account 

R5015 :page 137 

of that ignorance, to an eternity of torture is not 
logical, not loving, not just— not Gospel at all, when we 
remember that the word Gospel means "good-tidings of 
great joy which shall be to all people." The Missions 
would be much more successful in reaching the hearts of 
those they would serve if they presented the Gospel of 
God's loving provision of Messiah's coming Kingdom. 

Although the doctrine of the Trinity corresponds considerably 
with the teachings of the Hindu religion, it is, 
nevertheless, difficult for those of other religions to fully 
accept it. They cannot understand the matter of three 
Gods in one person, as some put it; or three persons in one 
God, as others put it. There is a simplicity and honesty 
about these people that is commendable, and which refuses 
to confess that which they do not understand. The 
message of Messiah's coming Kingdom, in which God's 
will shall be done on earth, even as it is done in heaven, 
would, we believe, appeal to large and increasing numbers 
of Orientals. 

VI.— "What hope is there for the conversion of the 
world during the present generation, through the Laymen's 
Foreign Missionary Movement, with their proposed 
thirty million dollars?" 

Answer.— No one who knows anything of Oriental 
conditions would have the least expectation of the world's 



conversion during this present generation through the use 
of the thirty million dollars proposed. Nor, indeed, if 
the sum were a thousand times that. We would not, however, 
discourage the giving of money for Missions. Those 
who give will be benefited by so doing, and undoubtedly 
every million spent benevolently in Oriental lands will 
help to bring in the more extravagant civilization of the 
West. It will increase the wants of the natives, and thus 
promote commerce. As for promoting vital Christianity, 
we all know that this is not a purchasable commodity. 

As to whether the Western civilization will really 
advantage the East is a question. The Orientals, economical 
and industrious, are also contented, which is more 
than can be said of their more favored brethren of the 
West. Nor can we claim that our Western civilization 
would make them more honest and more truthful. 

The very suggestion of the conversion of the world 
is ridiculous to the peoples of the East— including the 
Missionaries. One Methodist minister frankly said, "I 
had to come here and see for myself, before I dropped the 
idea of the world's conversion, and the twin idea that all 
the unconverted would suffer endless torture." 

VII.— "To what extent do the monies donated benefit 
the heathen, and could any improvement along this line 
be suggested?" 

Answer.— Our judgment is that that portion of money 
contributed to Foreign Missions, which reaches heathen 
lands, is wisely enough used for its intended purposes. 
Whatever waste there is would seem rather to be in the 
machinery of collections. One collector for such benevolent 
institutions told us that he was allowed, as his salary, 
one-half of all that he collected. We know not to what 
extent this principle obtains with other Societies. Each 
Society owes to itself to institute a very thorough investigation 
into its own affairs, and to ascertain what proportion 
of the funds received is ever forwarded to the 
Missionaries. 

Nothing in these remarks applies in any degree to the 
Association under whose auspices this Committee went 
forth. It is well known by us all that the International 
Bible Students Assn. is conducted along most economical 
lines, and that all services in the home office are gratuitous. 

We know nothing to suggest, except that the true 
Gospel of salvation be preached— the Gospel of the Kingdom 
of Messiah. Wherever Pastor Russell preached the 
soon coming of Messiah's Kingdom to "Bless all the families 
of the earth," all classes heard with keen interest. 
He quotes Scriptures relating to the coming "Golden 
Age," the lifting of the veil of ignorance and manifesting 
God's love to all men, including those now sleeping in 
death. It seemed good to Mohammedans, Hindus, Buddhists, 
Confucians— all. Many desired him to stay longer, 
but his time was limited; instead he promised them literature, 
for which they eagerly handed in their addresses. 

Your Committee found no time in which to visit Burmah, 
Africa and Australasia, and suggest that it might be 



wise to send another Committee to investigate those fields. 

In harmony with your suggestions, Pastor Russell arranged 
for the publication of free literature in the six 
principal languages of India, viz.: Hindustani, Guiarati, 
Malayami, Tulugu, Marotti and Tamil. This work is 
already under way, as is also a similar work of the Chinese 
and Japanese. The entire cost of producing three 
million copies, and circulating them through willing natives, 
will, he believes, be kept within the seven thousand 
dollars authorized by the Association. 

In conclusion, your Committee assure you that they 
have done their very best to accomplish the purpose of 
their appointment. They thank the Lord, and also the 
Association, for the great privileges enjoyed in connection 
with the service.

THE COMMITTEE HOMEWARD BOUND 

Leaving India the Committee journeyed via Suez, 
stopping two days at Cairo. A visit was made to the Great 
Pyramid, whose wonderful Passages tell by their construction 
so much of the Divine Plan that it has been called 
the Stone Bible. We need not here give space to an explanation 
of the meaning of the passages and their wonderful 
lessons, so in harmony with the prophecies of the Bible, 
because the majority of our readers already have this as 
one of the Chapters in the Third Volume of the STUDIES 
IN THE SCRIPTURES. We do, however, urge all to a fresh 
reading of this testimony, so helpful to faith. 

On the second day an excursion was made to the ruins 
of Memphis, the ancient Capital of Egypt in Joseph's time, 
when he was next to Pharaoh in authority. Many of 
the scenes brought freshly to mind the Scripture narrative 
respecting Joseph, and later on respecting the finding of 
Moses in the rushes of the Nile. The land of Goshen, 
where the Israelites spent two centuries, and from which 
they were miraculously delivered, the place of their possible 
crossing the Red Sea, the wells of Moses, and the 
bitter waters of Marah on the opposite shore, were noticed. 

ATHENS AND MARS HILL 

Next we visited Athens, made famous through the 
visit of St. Paul eighteen centuries ago. There we visited 
the Stadium, where Socrates and other orators of ancient 
Greece held large audiences by their eloquence. We 
thought, too, of the fickleness of public applause, as we 
viewed the ancient prison in which he died. Other items 



of interest at Athens were the wonderful Temple and the 
great Amphitheatre, with a seating capacity of forty thousand, 
recently remodeled after its original style, in marble. 

R5016 :page 138 

But the ruins of the greatness of ancient Greece, grand 
as they were, led our minds still more particularly to the 
great Apostle St. Paul. We considered that his monuments 
in the New Testament writings are more eloquent 
a thousand times than all the achievements of all the 
philosophers, poets and artists of the whole period of 
Greece's fame. We climbed to Mars Hill, traversing quite 
probably the same steps, cut in the natural rocks, by which 
the Apostle ascended and descended. We went to a platform 
in the rocks above, and near to the old market house 
mentioned in the Scriptures, and surmised that St. Paul 
spoke to the people from that very spot. Our little company 
while on Mars Hill engaged in a short service of 
praise and prayer, and Pastor Russell gave a little sermonette 
re the Gospel which St. Paul preached— Jesus 
and the Resurrection— Jesus, the Redeemer and Savior; 
the Resurrection, the method by which a Divine blessing 
will come through Jesus to all the families of the earth. 

We noted that as the doctrine of the Resurrection was 
scoffed at by the ancient Greeks, so the worldly-wise of 
today are still inclined to stumble over it and to mock and 
say, "We will hear thee again of this matter— enough for 
the present." 

Two public meetings were held in one of the principal 
auditoriums of Athens, addressed by Pastor Russell. On 
both occasions many were turned away, while others were 
obliged to stand. Many heard the Gospel of the Two 
Salvations for the first time:— 

(1) The present call and development of the "elect," 
the consummation of whose hope will be in the glorious 
change of the First Resurrection. 

(2) The Restitution blessing then to be brought to 

the world in general with full opportunity for all the willing 
and obedient to return to human perfection and a 
world-wide Eden and everlasting life— rejectors being destroyed 
in the Second Death. 

Our experiences at Corinth were interesting. We were 
shown the ruins of ancient Corinth, which have recently 
been uncovered. We walked about some of the very market 
places and fountains visited by St. Paul, and probably 
upon the very stones. St. Paul's Cathedral, a fine, modern 
structure, is the City's memorial to the great Apostle. The 
Cathedral is Greek Catholic— or rather Greek Christian, 
for so the natives prefer to speak of themselves. 

Here, at the request of the Mayor and the Ecclesiastics, 
Pastor Russell gave two addresses of about an hour and 
a half each. They were well received. The reasonableness 
of the presentations and deductions and the harmony 
of the same with the Bible seemed to be the general comment 
of the people, many of whom seemed hungry for a 



clearer knowledge of God's Word and a surer foundation 
for their faith. Here as well as at Athens many addresses 
were handed in with requests for reading matter. 
Brief stops were made at two places in France, 
where several semi-private conferences were held with 
Bible Students. The following Sunday brought us to 
London, where a most interesting and profitable week was 
spent. Pastor Russell delivered eight addresses in London 
and nearby— four of these were in the London Tabernacle. 



R5016 :page 138 

NEW YORK HIPPODROME MASS MEETING 
TO HEAR I.B.S.A. COMMITTEE'S REPORT ON MISSIONS 

Less than a week brought us safely across the Atlantic 
on the Cunarder "Mauretania." Here we received a most 
hearty welcome, which culminated on Sunday in a mass 
meeting of Christian people at the New York Hippodrome. 

The Hippodrome, with a seating capacity of fifty-two 
hundred, had been secured for the Committee's report on 
March 31,3 p.m. Crowds were at the entrances waiting 
for admission at 1:30 o'clock. Before 3 o'clock every seat 
was taken, and subsequently hundreds were turned away 
disappointed. No better evidence than this of the interest 
of the public and of Bible Students of all denominations 
could be asked. 

The crowds entering beheld with bated breath the entire 
platform, or stage, over a hundred feet wide, banked 
with beautiful floral evergreen plants, etc., etc. We 
learned afterwards that it required eighteen men to unwrap 
and place these floral tributes— from 4 a.m. until 
noon. The decoration was a master-work, both as respects 
the materials and their arrangement. It was declared 
the most beautiful floral display of the kind ever 
seen in the American Metropolis. The Chairman, referring 
to the flowers, remarked that they had come from 
Bible Students of twenty-one different States of the Union 
addressed to the Pastor and with greetings to himself 
and to the Committee. The central feature of the display 
was a large Cross of red carnations circled by a crown of 
yellow daffodils and surrounded by a circular wreath-work 
of dark green leaves in which were scattered beautiful 
white lilies. 

The Hon. J. F. Rutherford of the New York Bar 
served as Chairman. He introduced Prof. F. H. Robison, 
who read to the audience the categorical Summary which 
constitutes the conclusion of their Report, explaining that 
the full Report would be printed, as we here have it. 

Pastor Russell followed with a discourse from the text, 
"Ask of Me and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine 
inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy 
possession." (Psa. 2:8.) It will be unnecessary for us 



to give a synopsis of this, as Bible Students in all parts 
of England and America have already had opportunity to 
read it in the more than one thousand newspapers which 
publish the Pastor's sermons every week.

1912-GENERAL CONVENTIONS- 19 12 

It is proposed that the INTERNATIONAL BIBLE STUDENTS 
ASSOCIATION shall this year hold two General Conventions. 
One of these will be in the West, the other in the East. This 
arrangement seemed wise in order to permit many who would 
like to attend Conventions to do so at a moderate expenditure 
of railway fare. 

The first of these will be held in the Chautauqua grounds 
at Pertle Springs, near Warrensburg, Mo., June 1-8. It will 
be followed by a public meeting addressed by Brother Russell 
at Kansas City, Mo., sixty-five miles northwest from Warrensburg, 
on Sunday, June 9. 

Board and lodging accommodations, we are assured, will 
be quite satisfactory and will range in cost from $1.10 to 
$1.50 each person per day. These prices, of course, will not 
secure separate rooms for each person. We are assured of 
ample, comfortable accommodations for from fifteen hundred 
to two thousand people. All expecting to attend should notify 
us at once. Give full name of each person, which prefer to 
room together, and at what rate. 

Warrensburg (Pertle Springs) is on the Missouri Pacific 
Railroad. We will have the usual summer rates prevailing 
to this point. Inquire of your local railroad ticket agent. 

The second Convention will be held in the suburbs of 
Washington City, D.C., at the Glen Echo Chautauqua 
grounds— July 7-14. Arrangements for board and lodging 
will be made by our Committee on request at such prices as 
you may authorize from $1.10 per day upward. No pains will 
be spared to make you comfortable as possible. 

The Committee of investigation say, "The location is ideal. 
The average Park temperature is ten degrees lower than that 
of Washington City. The Auditorium is still cooler by reason 
of its peculiar location and the fact that it is built over running 
water." 

Washington City commands reasonable railway rates from 
all quarters. We do not expect any special concessions, therefore, 
although we will apply for them. 

We will endeavor to have a good list of speakers at both 
Conventions, including Brother Russell. 

We hoped to have been able to make the announcements 
re Conventions in January, but have been unavoidably delayed 



until now. We trust that both of these Conventions will 
prove convenient and profitable to considerable numbers of 
Bible Students.

WE ALL NEED "POEMS OF DAWN" 

This book of 286 pages contains nearly three hundred beautiful poems 
of consecration and encouragement for Christians. It is now in stock, 
and all orders have been filled to date. Cloth edition, corresponding in 
style to the new edition of STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES, will be supplied 
at 25c. each, postpaid; leatherette, red burnished edges, same size as 
Keratol STUDIES, 25c. postpaid; leatherette, gold edges, 35c. postpaid; 
full seal-grained leather, gold edges, corresponding in size and style 
with the India edition of SCRIPTURE STUDIES, 50 cents each postpaid. 
"Poems of Dawn" would make an excellent gift for any friend or 
relative not in the Truth, although most fully appreciated by the saintly. 
It is topically arranged, but you cannot open at random and read without 
being refreshed, comforted, drawn nearer to God.

"WE CANNOT DO AS WE WOULD" 

These words of St. Paul recur to us, not only as applicable in the 
way he used them, as signifying our inability to do the Divine will 
perfectly because of weaknesses of heredity, but in other ways the words 
are applicable— for instance, as we now use them: the Editor has recently 
been made the recipient of so many kind messages of love- 
letters, cards, telegrams and floral expressions— that he has been simply 
overwhelmed. Additionally he has had great pleasure in receiving many 
callers. Nothing could please him better than to write personal acknowledgments 
of all these kind expressions of Christian love, fellowship, 
sympathy; but to respond to each and all separately would mean a 
hindrance of the general work, which he is sure would be far from the 
wish of his many friends. He therefore takes this opportunity of 
acknowledging the many kindnesses of the Brethren and of assuring 
each of his loving appreciation of their many tokens and of his good 
wishes and prayers on behalf of them all and on behalf of all who are 
truly the Lord's in every place— known and unknown. The Editor hopes 
that all will accept the articles of THE WATCH TOWER instead of his 
personal letters. 



R5016 :page 143 

WHY CHRIST AROSE FROM THE DEAD 

"If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain and your 
faith also vain; yea, and we are found false witnesses of God. 



...Then they also which are fallen asleep 
in Christ are perished."— 1. Cor. 15:14,15,18. 

THE FAITH ONCE delivered to the saints by 
Jesus and the Apostles in respect to the 
resurrection of the dead has been very generally 
lost. Christian people profess a belief 
in the resurrection, because they find it 
stated in the Bible, yet they are continually 
in difficulty in their endeavor to make the 
Scriptural teaching on the subject square 
with some of the unscriptural theories received 
into the Church, and incorporated 
into many of the creeds during the "Dark Ages." 

St. Paul warned the Church against these human 
philosophies, and called them "science, falsely so-called," 
which makes void the Word of God. These errors have 
been instrumental in dividing the faith of God's people 
into six hundred denominations, with six hundred different 
professions. If God's people could all come back to 
the simplicity of the Bible's teaching in respect to the 
resurrection of the dead, all of these differences would 
speedily disappear. God's Word would be seen to be

beautiful and harmonious, satisfactory to the consecrated 
intellect, as none of our sectarian creeds are. 

Really the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead has 
been repudiated by all denominations, not willingly, not 
intentionally, but perforce, as it were. An opposite theory 
received and intrenched in the minds gives no place for 
the doctrine of the resurrection, as the Bible presents it. 
Consequently we have twisted the doctrine of the resurrection 
and recite, "I believe in the resurrection of the 
body." 

Yet even this perverted view of the resurrection is 
not satisfactory to those who hold it. They wish many a 
time that the doctrine of the resurrection were not in the 
Bible, so much difference does it cause. For instance, 
how inconsistent it seems that they should say, "I believe 
in the resurrection of the body," and then say, as 
many do, Dying is but going home, getting rid of the mortal 
flesh, and being freed from its limitations. If it is a 
blessing to die and get free from the limitations of the 
body, how could it be a blessing to be reincarcerated in 
the body, and be obliged to keep it through all eternity? 
Such is the inconsistency of the resurrection, however, 
from the viewpoint of the creeds of men. 

THE BIBLE RESURRECTION REASONABLE 

There is nothing inconsistent in the Bible presentation 
of the resurrection. Not from the Bible, but from men, 
comes the suggestion of the resurrection of the body. The 
Bible invariably refers to the resurrection of the soul. It 



is the soul that dies; as we read, "The soul that sinneth, 
it shall die." Adam was created a living soul, but his living 
soul came under the death sentence because he disobeyed 
God. It was his soul that was redeemed from 
death, not his body. "I will redeem thy life from 
destruction."— Psalm 103:4. 

To accomplish this redemption, we read that Christ 
Jesus "poured out His soul unto death"; "He made His 
soul an offering for sin." Moreover, we are particularly 
told that it was the soul of Jesus that was raised from 
the dead: "Thou wilt not leave My soul in sheol. St. 
Peter quotes this statement as prophetical of the resurrection 
of Jesus, that His soul was not left in hades; God 
raised Jesus from the dead on the third day. With what 
body do the dead come? is a totally different question. 
Some dead souls, in the resurrection, will come forth 
with spirit bodies, and others with human bodies, according 
to the Bible. But the important part is, that it is the 
soul, the being, that comes forth, that is resurrected— 
not the body. If the soul dies, as the Bible declares, then 
manifestly the soul should be resurrected. 

The difficulty with us has been that we "have made 
void the Word of God" by our "traditions." We received 
from the Grecian philosophers a tradition which Socrates 
and Plato both advocated, namely, that when a human 
being dies he does not really die. The soul, it is claimed, 
cannot die, but, whenever the soul gets out of the body, 
the body dies. How strange it seems that we all, as intelligent, 
thoughtful beings, have accepted this heathen 
philosophy, without a word of Scripture for its support, 
and with hundreds of Scriptures to condemn it! 

We can see how the heathen philosophers might be led 
to conjure up such a theory, because of their desire to believe 
in a future life, and because they had no revelation 
from God respecting a future life. They therefore tried 
their best to convince themselves that man really does 
not die— that no man can die. The Bible theory is the 
very reverse of this, namely, that a man does die; that 
he is a soul, a thinking, sentient being. Neither is he 
a bodiless being, and indeed he cannot be a being at 
all without a body. His body may change, as science declares 
it does gradually, hour by hour, until a complete 
change is effected in seven years. 

R5017 :page 144 

Thus a man, a soul, a sentient being, may in a life of 
fifty years have sloughed off gradually sufficient matter to 
have composed seven bodies. But the moment the sloughing 
off of this dying matter and the substitution of living 
matter ceases, we have death; and as soon as the body 
dies the soul dies— that is, the intelligent being ceases. 
There can be no thinking without a brain, no breathing 
without lungs, no maintenance of life in any sense of the 
word without a body. 

This would have been a total destruction of the soul 



had not God specially provided, as the Prophet declares, 
that He would redeem man's life from destruction, 
through the redemptive work accomplished by Jesus in 
giving His soul an offering for man's sin, and thus making 
possible man's resurrection from the dead. 

It is in consequence of this Divine provision through 
Christ for a resurrection of humanity that the Scriptures 
speak of death as merely a falling asleep for a time, to 
wait for the new body in the resurrection, rather than to 
speak of us as dying as the brute beasts. The word sleep 
implies that in the Divine purpose a future life is intended, 
and will eventually be given. 

"BUT NOW IS CHRIST RISEN" 

St. Paul does not leave the matter of Christ's resurrection 
undecided. He positively affirms that, "Christ is risen 
from the dead," and that, thus risen, "He is the First-fruits 
of those that slept," which implies that when He 
was raised the others still slept. Jesus slept during a 
part of three days, from the time He died until the Father 
raised Him from the dead, from hades, from sheol, from 
the tomb, on the third day. He, as the First-fruits of the 
sleeping ones, is an example and a guarantee of the fulfilment 
of the Divine promise, that "there shall be a resurrection 
of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust." 

It behooves us to take a decided stand, either with the 
Grecian philosophers and their theories, or with the Bible. 
The two are in conflict and whoever attempts to hold 
both is in confusion. If the dead are not dead, then no 
human being is dead. And if no one is dead, how could 
there be a resurrection of the dead? 

The inconsistency of the theory held respecting the 
resurrection of the body has invited a very reasonable and 
just criticism. The skeptic asks, "How could the body be 
resurrected, after it has gone to dust and after the dust 
has been scattered to the four winds?" They tell us of a 
grave that was opened near an apple tree, and it was 
found that a root from the tree had entered the coffin and 
practically absorbed the corpse, from which it had produced 
thousands of apples, which in turn had been shipped 
to various parts of the world, some of the poorer grades 
being fed to hogs, whose hams were cured and sent abroad 
and thus passed into other human beings, to become parts 
of still other human bodies. The question is a proper one, 
but it is an unanswerable one from the standpoint of our 
former misbelief and our poor attempt to combine human 
philosophy and Divine Revelation. 

But such a question brings no consternation to the 
Bible student who follows the Scriptures alone. The 
Scriptures never speak of the resurrection of our bodies. 
They do tell of the resurrection of the soul, and that in 
the resurrection God giveth it (the soul) a body as it 
pleaseth Him. 

How reasonable it will be for the world to be awakened 
in practically the condition in which they went down 



into death! And these will experience, if willing and 
obedient, a gradual resurrection or raising up to the image 
and likeness of Father Adam in his perfection. But 
some in the resurrection will receive spirit bodies like unto 
the angels, and some like unto the body of Christ in His 
resurrection, which Saul of Tarsus beheld— "shining above 
the brightness of the sun at noonday." 

The class that is promised a resurrection in spirit 
bodies is the Church— the saintly few who walk in the 
footsteps of Jesus. The begetting of the Holy Spirit which 
comes to these changes their nature from earthly to spiritual. 
If they are faithful to their covenant their resurrection 
will be to glory, honor and immortality, as explained 
by St. Paul in the context, saying, "It is sown in 
weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown in dishonor, it 
is raised in glory; it is sown an animal body, it is raised a 
spirit body." 

This is a description of the resurrection which God 
has promised to all the members of the Body of Christ, 
which is the Church. St. Paul declares that the members 
of this Body fall asleep to awaken in the glorious morning 
of the New Dispensation. But he adds, "We shall not 
all sleep"— some will be alive and remain till the second 
coming of Jesus. These, however, will not take precedence 
over the sleeping ones, for "The dead in Christ 
shall rise first; then we which are alive and remain" "shall 
be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye," 
...because "flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom 
of God." As the death of Jesus was absolutely necessary 
as the atoning price for human sin, so the resurrection 
of Jesus was absolutely necessary, that He might not 
remain dead through all eternity, but be glorified, and in 
due time come again to effect the resurrection of His 
Church and, subsequently, the awakening and uplifting 
of all the families of the earth. 

Hearken to the special promise made to the Church: 
"Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection; 
on such the Second Death hath no power, but 
they shall be priests of God, and of Christ, and shall 
reign with Him a thousand years." (Rev. 20:6.) Also 
note the promise of the world's resurrection: "There 
shall be a resurrection, both of the just and the unjust." 
(Acts 24:15.) Again, "They that have done evil" shall 
come forth, that they may enjoy a resurrection effected 
by "judgments," disciplines, chastisements, which will develop 
in them character; and the glory which will be attained 
will be perfection— a raising up to all at first possessed 
by Father Adam, lost through disobedience, and 
redeemed by the precious blood of Christ.— John 5:28,29, 
R.V.

"A KIND OF FIRST-FRUITS" 

Every Sunday is a memorial of the resurrection of 



our Lord from the dead, and if a proper conception of the 

Master's resurrection were kept in mind we would not 

think of quarreling with the expression "Easter Sunday." 

But alas, this name Easter is associated with heathen 

philosophies and idolatries, which did so much to make 

the Word of God of none effect; and the fact should be 

noted that it is the name of a Greek goddess. The compromising 

spirit induced some of the early Church to admit 

the heathen philosophies and to commingle with these 

the inspired teachings of the Bible; but now there is the 

loud call to true Christians to rid themselves of science 

and philosophy "falsely so-called," and to return to the 

Biblical simplicity of the Divine Revelation. 

Of this Revelation alone St. Peter declares, "It is able 
to make you wise unto salvation," and to "give you an 
inheritance among all them which are sanctified." And 
again, "The Word of God is sufficient, that the man of 
God may be thoroughly furnished unto every good work." 
Let us today, then, rejoice in Him who died for our sins 
and who rose on the third day for our justification. 

R5018 :page 145 

Let us rid our minds of the foolish thought that He 
did not really die, that He only seemed to die— that when 
the Roman soldiers crucified Him, He simply got out of 
His body, laughed at them, and said, "I have not died at 
all; I could not die; you could not kill Me." Let us remember 
rather the Divine Word on the subject: "Christ 
died for our sins"; "He poured out His soul unto death"; 
"He made His soul an offering for sin." Let us remember 
the assurance of the Bible that eventually "He shall 
see the fruits of the travail of His soul and shall be satisfied." 
Let us rejoice also in the assurance of the Apostle 
that His soul was not left in hades, sheol, death, but that 
God raised Him from the dead on the third day. 

NOTE AN ADDITIONAL PROOF 

If Christ did not die, then the death penalty upon 
Adam and his race has not been met. Those who claim 
that He did not die, that merely His body died, are illogical. 
They profess to believe that Jesus accomplished for 
us a redemptive work, that He died, "The Just for the 
unjust." If Christ, the Redeemer, "poured out His soul 
unto death," and if His resurrection meant the recovery 
of His soul or being out of death, wherein is the logic in 
the declaration of some that it is not thus with the Church 
nor with the world? If Jesus did not go to Heaven 
when He died— if He went into hades, into the grave, into 
sheol, into death, who has the temerity to say that others 
go direct to Heaven or Hell or Purgatory? Let us be 
consistent. The wages of sin is not Purgatory, nor a 
Hell of torture, in some far-off place. On the contrary, 
"The wages of sin is death." The Redeemer died and 
rose; and this is the assurance, that He who raised up 



Jesus from the dead will raise us up also, by Jesus, 
through His spirit and power; and not only so, but also 
the world of mankind, all who were involved in the death 
sentence upon the first man. 

Therefore, the entire world is included in the death 
payment made by the Great Redeemer, that "As by man 
came death, by a man also shall come the resurrection of 
the dead; for as all in Adam die, even so all in Christ 
shall be made alive." But, says the Apostle, while every 
man who will come into Christ shall be made alive, each 
will come forth "in his own order." The Christ company 
shall come forth first— "the Church of the First-born, 
whose names are written in heaven." Afterwards will 
come those who will become His at, or during, His presence 
—during the thousand years of His Kingdom glory. 
The opportunity of that thousand years will mean to 
every man the privilege of coming into fellowship with 
the Redeemer and King, Emmanuel. Whoever will accept 
the opportunity will receive the blessing of an admission 
to Messiah's family. As the Apostle says, they 
will become His. Under His heavenly guidance and 
blessing and regenerating influence, all such may attain 
again to a full image and likeness of God, lost in Eden, 
redeemed at Calvary.

"THE HARVEST IS THE END OF THE AGE" 

"The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few; pray 
ye, therefore, the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth 
laborers into His harvest."— Matt. 9:37,38. 

FOR LONG YEARS many of us thought of 

the Bible references to the Harvest, our text 

included, as applicable to every time. We 

had not then learned that in order to be understood 

the Bible must be studied Dispensationally. 

Now we perceive that the time 

of our Lord's first advent was the Harvest 

of the Jewish Age; and that as a Harvest 

this text applied to that nation only. For 

more than sixteen hundred years the Law 

Covenant had been in operation between God and Israel. 

Under it they had been disciplined and schooled, instructed 

through the Law and by the Prophets. 

Jesus came, not only to be the Redeemer of mankind in 
general, but also to offer Himself as King to the Jews, 
and to make them His joint-heirs in His Kingdom. Had 
there been a sufficient number of Jews in heart-readiness 
to receive the Gospel Message, according to Divine agreement, 
the entire Bride class would have been elected, or 
chosen, from that one nation and not a Gentile would have 
been invited to participate in the honors of these spirit-begotten 



ones, called in the Scriptures, the spiritual "Seed of 
Abraham." (Gal. 3:29.) Nevertheless, the Lord knew 
that Israel would not be ready to receive Him, and He 
provided for their rejection and the opening of the door 
to membership in the Bride class to worthy Gentiles. 

At the close of the Jewish Age, at the time, therefore, 
that people should have and did have their greatest 
degree of ripeness and preparation, our Lord presented 
Himself and began to do the reaping work. He sent forth 
His disciples as His representatives, two and two; and 
later, He sent "seventy also." When these returned, our 
Lord declared to them, "I sent you to reap that whereon 
ye bestowed no labor; other men labored, and ye are 
entered into their labors."— John 4:38. 

The Great Teacher tells us distinctly that while His 
work was that of reaping, He blended with it a sowing. 
Seeing that the Jews were not ready for the Kingdom, 
seeing that eighteen centuries would be required for the 
calling and developing of the saintly, spiritual ones, the 
Father started the work of seed-sowing for the New Dispensation. 
Then, according to our Lord's parable, He left 
the work in the hands of His servants and went "into a 
far country"— even Heaven itself. Since then He has 
been supervising His work and been represented through 
the faithful members of His Church, His Bride. He and 
the Apostles sowed the "good seed" of the Kingdom, meanwhile 
gathering the ripe wheat of the Jewish nation into 
the Kingdom Class, through the begetting of the Holy 
Spirit. By and by the harvesting of the Jewish Age ended 
completely, when all the wheat of the nation were gathered 
into the Gospel Church of spirit-begotten ones, and 
then came the "burning of the chaff"— the great time of 
trouble with which the Jewish Age ended, in A.D. 70. 

Since then the work of seed-sowing, evangelism, etc., 
amongst the Gentiles has gone on, not without difficulty, 
however. As our Lord's parable shows, Satan, the Adversary, 
came "while men slept"— in the night, the "Dark 
Ages"— and over-sowed the wheat field with tare seed. As 
a result, the field looked very prosperous, although, in reality, 
the "tares" had a choking and disastrous effect on the 
"wheat." Nevertheless, the Lord would not allow the 
separating of wheat from tares until the full end of the 
Age, the Harvest. The Bible intimates that the tares 
were so numerous and so intertwined with the wheat in 
their various interests that to have plucked them all up 
would have brought the disastrous "time of trouble" too 
soon. Hence, the decree that both should grow together 
until the Harvest. "The Harvest is the end of the Age." 
-Matt. 13:39. 

R5018 :page 146 

"THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL SHINE FORTH AS THE SUN" 

Our studies together have led the majority of us to 
conclude that we are now living in the Harvest time— 



in the end of this Age. Oh, how glad we shall be if this 
is true! How glad we are to believe it true! And, we 
think, on good evidence. If it is true, as we believe, that 
the forty years "harvest" of this Age began in 1 874, the 
implication is that the trials of the Church are nearly at 
an end; that the faithful will soon be gathered to the 
heavenly garner. By the glorious "change" He will cause 
them to "shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom of their 
Father," for the scattering of the world's dark night and 
the ushering in of the New Day. Messiah's Day is to 
bring glorious opportunities for earthly blessings to Israel, 
and to all the families of the earth through Israel. 
If our hopes be true, then they mean a blessing, not for 
the Church alone, but for the entire groaning creation, 
which, if willing and obedient under Messiah's reign, 
will be released from the bondage of corruption into the 
glorious liberty appropriate to the children of God.— 
Rom. 8:21. 

As Bible students we have already seen that the Jewish 
nation as a people were prototypes of spiritual Israel in 
many particulars— that the period from the death of Jacob 
to the fall of Jerusalem, in A.D. 70, is the exact parallel 
to the period of the Gospel Church from the death of 
Jesus to 1915, A.D. 

Surely it is not by accident that these two Ages correspond, 
nor by accident that Israel as a people typified 
spiritual Israel! Neither will it be by accident if the 
events of 1915 correspond to the events of A.D. 70. In 
other words, as the Harvest of the Jewish Age ended with 
a time of trouble, so our Lord's words assure us that this 

R5019 :page 146 

Gospel Age and its harvest will end with "a time of 
trouble such as never was since there was a nation." 
(Dan. 12:1; Matt. 24:21.) That a crisis is nearing everybody 
admits. That socialists and anarchists are threatening 
the very fabric of society, nobody will deny. The 
Bible alone explains the situation and shows us that the 
work of the present Age is about completed; that the 
elect members of the Bride of Christ have nearly all been 
found and made ready. The blessings for the world will 
be along material lines and will be ushered in by the "time 
of trouble," which will eventuate in anarchy, according to 
the Scriptures— a general leveling of the human family 
as the initial step of the reign of the glorious Messiah, 
whom men will shortly see and recognize with the eyes 
of their understanding. 



R5019 :page 146 

LOYALTY TO GOD NECESSARY TO LIFE EVERLASTING 
THE FIRST ESTATE of the angels who fell 



was the angelic estate or condition. The 

design of the Creator was not that they 

should be men, but angels. Any power 

granted them for materializing would be 

for some proper work amongst men which 

would be facilitated by materialization. 

Therefore, they were privileged to appear 

as men and, having accomplished the purpose 

for which they materialized, to disappear. 

But these angels, becoming enamored of the conditions 

in the world at that time, preferred to live as 

men and not as angels. In this, however, they did not 

abrogate their powers as spirit beings, but maintained 

these; but materializing and living as men, they ignored 

their former condition. On account of thus violating 

their nature they were punished, and not on account of 

merely using the Divinely granted power of materialization. 

They abused the power which it was proper enough 

for them to use. 

We know that Satan's first misdemeanor was the deception 
of our first parents; but we do not know that he 
was the cause of the disobedience of the other angels. 
Probably he was; and, therefore, he was restrained in 
darkness. If it were not so, he might have been able to 
materialize all down through the six thousand years. 
Some people claim that they have seen materialized spirits. 
Martin Luther claimed that he had seen Satan. In 
the old Luther homestead they show visitors the mark of 
the ink on the door, where Luther threw the ink bottle 
at Satan's head. We do not know, however, whether 
there was a materialization, or whether Satan merely appeared 
to him as a man. And so, not being well informed 
on the subject, it is best not to take too positive 
a position, but simply to say that we do not know. The 
Scriptures state that these fallen angels were restrained in 
chains of darkness until the great Day. This would seem 
to imply that Satan will have no part in the Judgment of 
the Great Day, but would not, of necessity, prove it. 
Practically, we are left without any definite information. 

When Satan beheld Adam and Eve placed under 
Divine favor in the Garden of Eden, and saw that they 
were the parents of an unborn race, the temptation came 
to him that, if he could get them on his side, then he 
would become a mighty one, a ruler. Why did this temptation 
come to him? He knew well that the thought was 
disloyal to his Creator. Why did he entertain it? Did 
it come to his mind in so powerful a manner as to make 
it irresistible? No. The Scriptures tell us that all of 
God's work is perfect. He made both man and angels 
perfect. Satan's deflection was through his own mind. 
While he knew that the thoughts in which he was indulging 
were unjust and unrighteous, he probably did not 
intend to do evil. No one intends to do wrong, but 
merely to see how the thing will "work out." So Satan 
thought how possible it would be and how pleasurable. 
Thus he allowed his mind to run on. And the things 



that he subsequently did he would not have allowed himself 
to do at the beginning. 

So far as we know, this is the process of every mind. 
The fact that sin develops does not prove that there was 
a germ of sin. But an active mind always plans. God's 
mind is perfect and active; and so are the minds of the 
angels. As New Creatures it would be possible for us 
to cultivate or to allow to germinate in our minds certain 
thoughts, certain ambitions, certain imaginations, 
which would eventually lead us astray. It is the duty of 
every New Creature to repudiate every thought that is 
disloyal to God or to His Laws. The loyalty of the 
mind should be so great that anything contrary to God's 
will would be considered treason. This is the only safe 
position for the New Creature. Everything known to be 
disloyal should be discountenanced, fought against. For, 
as surely as evil things come in, progress is made toward 
destruction of the loyalty of the mind. 

We see an illustration of this principle in a very 
marked degree in Christian Science. Very few people 
would say that sickness is health and that black is white. 
When first being instructed, the patient thinks that it is 
funny to have some one tell him not to think that he is 
sick. At first this seems absurd; but when people have 
practiced this deception awhile, they become imbued with 

R5019 :page 147 

a kind of self-hypnotism. They seem to be carried away 
with that wrong process of reasoning. With Christian 
Science, nearly everything is unnoticed and unreasonable 
—everything except money and the good things of 
this life. Everything is distorted. They make two and 
two equal nine— according to some things that come from 
Christian Science quarters. To our mind, two and two 
would never make nine. 

Some people are given to exaggeration; for instance, 
to say of sickness, "That is awful!" We should learn 
neither to appreciate things too highly nor to underestimate 
them. With a great many people nearly everything 
they say contains a great measure of exaggeration. This 
should not be the case with the Church of Christ. They 
should by all means strive to speak the truth. "Let your 
yea be yea." If something is six inches long, let it be 
just six inches for six inches. Let your yea be yea, and 
your nay be nay. 

There is no means of knowing whether or not any 
of the angels who, before the flood, had indulged in sin 
ever repented and reformed, coming back to the Lord. 
It would be unwise, therefore, to speculate. Even though 
God is plenteous in mercy, it seems to be a principle of 
His Government that when anyone sins, Justice will have 
some reckoning with the individual. This is not because 
of Divine desire to see the creature suffer, but because 
this is a healthful principle for the Divine Government— 
that whosoever sins shall suffer. Even though the 



obliquity of the sin be forgiven, the sin must receive punishment. 

This principle, we think, holds with the angels. 

Even though they should be restored to Divine favor, it 

would not be until there was some kind of correction to 

show that sin is wrong and unprofitable. 

Neither are we informed as to whether or not any of 
these angels have repented since their sentence and delivery 
"into chains of darkness." But we should not be surprised 
if it were true that some of them have repented. 
Our thought is that this repentance would not 
change their sentence, but that they would remain in 
Divine disfavor until their allotted period of punishment 
had ended; and then they would be tested and tried. 
Supposing this to be so, we think that none of these well-disposed 
angels would be inclined to violate the Divine 
command on the subject of materialization. Our understanding 
is that there are some good angels and some evil 
angels; that any who would communicate with mankind 
are not good angels— that those who are in harmony 
with God would not allow themselves to communicate 
with mankind; and that during these thousands of years 
since their condemnation the fallen angels have divided 
into two classes, one being sympathetic with Satan, and 
the other having reformed; that probably the latter 
have suffered from the others; that they would have 
the opprobrium and opposition of the evil ones; and that 
they would rather suffer for righteousness than indulge 
in retort and give evil for evil. From this standpoint 
we might suppose that they have been suffering all these 
thousands of years since they took their stand for the 
right. This, however, is merely speculation, and should 
not be held to dogmatically. 



R5020 : page 147 

"VAIN REPETITION" IN PRAYER 

QUESTION.-In Matt. 6:7, our Lord tells us, 
"When ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as 
the heathen do; for they think that they 
shall be heard for their much speaking." 
The Apostle Paul, writing to the Church 
(Col. 4:2), exhorts that they "continue in 
prayer"; again we read of the widow who 
was heard for her importunity. (Luke 18:2-5.) 
Is this a suggestion that we should 
importune? How could we importune without 
repetition? 

Answer.— We are to recognize a distinct difference between 
the "vain repetitions" of the heathen, which our 
Lord condemned, and the "continuing instant in prayer," 
"in everything giving thanks," in "praying and not fainting," 
acts which our Lord and the Apostles enjoined. 
(Rom. 12:12; Luke 18:1, etc.) This difference the Lord 



illustrated in the case of the woman who came to a judge 
repeatedly, asking that he avenge her of her enemy. 
Although the judge was not a man who would act justly, 
yet he did her justice on account of her persistence. In 
commenting upon her course, our Lord said that if an 
unjust judge be moved on account of importunity to do 
justice, how much more a just judge! 

The thought illustrated in the parable is that of a person 
who cries to the Lord that injustice is being done— as 
with the Church at the present time. We all realize that 
we are suffering injustice. We cry, "O Lord, deliver us! 
deliver us from the Adversary!" Will God never deliver 
the Church? For eighteen hundred years the Church has 
been praying thus; and God has not answered this prayer. 
Will He never answer? Our Lord intimates that we 
should not lose faith. We are to have full confidence in 
His promises. Injustice will not forever obtain. The time 
will come, we are told, when Satan shall be bound and 
deceive the people no more.— Rev. 20:2,3. 

Therefore we do right to pray, "Thy Kingdom come," 
week after week, year after year, century after century. 
To grow faint or grow weary in prayer would not be 
right. The proper course is to believe that God will 
fulfil what He has promised; and that all will come out 
in harmony with His will. 

On another occasion our Lord gave a parable wherein 
one asked his neighbor for food and was refused. (Luke 1 1:5-8.) 
He asked again. Finally the neighbor gave it 
to him on account of his importunity, on account of his 
patiently persisting. This parable, also, emphasizes the 
thought of importunate prayer. God has the blessing, 
and not only is able to give it, but has promised to do so. 
The delay in granting the request is because His due time 
has not come. Hence we are not to give up nor to become 
weary, but to be constant in our prayers. 

This is all very different, however, from the "vain 
repetitions" which our Lord condemned. But we do not 
think that our Lord desires us to use repetition in our 
prayers. Some people use the words, "Our Father," or 
"Our God," or "Heavenly Father" more frequently than 
would seem to be good form— even using them in every 
fourth or fifth sentence. Their prayer would sound better 
on earth if they did not use these repetitions; though, no 
doubt, the repetitions would be understood in Heaven; 
for these people seem to be as earnest as others. 

Sometimes, after we have had morning worship and 
prayer, the one called upon to ask the blessing at table 
practically repeats the morning prayer. This course would 
imply that the person had forgotten that the general blessings 
had been asked in that prayer, and that he should be 
asking a blessing on the morning meal. To ask a blessing 
on the meal is not to pray in the ordinary sense of the 
word. Whoever "asks the blessing" should ask something 
in connection with the food and not attempt to pray for 
neighbors, relatives, etc. 



R5020 : page 148 

But the repetitions which our Lord had in mind and 
which are specially reprehensible in the Lord's sight are 
formal prayers merely. To illustrate: the Chinese are 
said to have a praying wheel, which enables them to make 
many "vain repetitions" without the trouble of speaking a 
word. 

It would seem that our Catholic friends also are 
given to a great deal of repetition in prayer. They repeat, 
"Hail, Mary!" and believe that God will save them from 
suffering in purgatory for their repetitions. Some of the 
poor creatures say, "Hail, Mary!" as often and as fast as 
they can. 

So with the Mohammedans. They say, "Great is 
Allah! Mohammed is His Prophet! Great is Allah! 
Mohammed is His Prophet!" again and again. We do 
not know what good they are doing, for they are surely 
wasting a great deal of valuable time to no purpose. We 
do not wish to make light of these people nor of their conduct. 
But we are bound to think that with those who are 
intelligent such prayers are only form. With those who 
are not intelligent it is different. We believe that they are 
sincere; and so our course is to think sympathetically of 
them, but not to do as they do, not to pray as they pray. 
Prayer in private, in our own room, may be as long as 
we please; but prayer in public should be short and to the 
point.

TRUTHFUL WORDS-POLITE SPEECH 

-MAY 26.-MATT. 5:33-37; JAS. 3:1-12; 5:12.- 

"Putting away falsehood, speak every man truth with his neighbor: 
for we are members one of another."— Eph. 4:25. 

IN OUR LAST study we contrasted the teachings 

of Jesus with those of the Pharisees 

respecting obligations to the Law. Our 

decision was that "never man spake like 

this man." In today's study we note the 

contrast between His teachings and those 

of the religionists of His day. Others attempted 

to limit the habit of swearing, but 

the Great Teacher said, "Swear not at all." 

How foolish is swearing of every kind! 

We are not, of course, objecting to solemn affirmations or 

legal oaths as required by law. 

Truly Saint Paul declares that those who receive the 
Spirit of the Lord possess the "Spirit of a sound mind." 
They soon begin to realize the senselessness and vulgarity 
of swearing or of supposing it necessary to substantiate 



their word. Quite to the contrary, the fact that one boisterously 

swears that what he says is true implies that he 

does not expect his hearer to believe his simple word, 

and this in turn presupposes that his word ordinarily is 

not worthy of belief. 

Note the injunction of the Master, "Let your speech 
be yea, yea, nay, nay"— anything further implies evil. 
The Master's meaning evidently is, When you say yes, 
let it be yes; when you say no, let it be no! Tell the 
truth! Your friends and neighbors by and by will learn 
how to value your speech. In other words, be so truthful 
in all that you say that it will be unnecessary to swear 
to its truthfulness, or to use any kind of specially forceful 
language to prove your sincerity— that you are neither 
overstating nor understating the truth. 

MINISTERS SHOULD BE TRUTHFUL 

In the second portion of our study St. James exhorts, 
"Be not many teachers, my brethren, knowing 
that we shall receive severer testing. For in many things 
we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same 
is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body." 
St. James seems to say that, while all Christians need 
to bridle their tongues, those in the more exalted positions 
are all the more liable to error in this respect. 
They have a special gift of speech and another special 
gift of opportunity to use this speech, and so, exerting a 
wide influence, their responsibility evidently is 
proportionate. 

It is not for us to judge ministers or others; there is 
One that judgeth, the Lord. We greatly fear, however, 
that many ministers, as well as Christians in humbler stations, 
fail to fully appreciate their responsibilities for 
every word they utter or have the opportunity of uttering. 
Many tell us that for years they preached what they 
did not believe. How terrible! How stultifying to their 
manhood! How serious a reflection upon their brand of 
Christianity! However, we should rejoice that finally 
their consciences triumphed. 

A LITTLE MATCH STARTS A BIG FIRE 

St. James gives some forceful illustrations. Christians 
should put a bridle of restraint into their own 
mouths, even as they put bits into the mouths of their 
horses. They should have a rudder whereby to steer their 
own course in life, even as they put a rudder upon a 
ship. They should remember that the tongue, although 
one of the least members of the body, is the most influential 
of all. A blow struck by the fist might injure 
one person near enough, but a bitter word, like a poisoned 
arrow, may strike afar off; yea, like a shell from a great 
gun, it may explode and do much damage. Yea, more! 
Its influence may pass through telephones, telegraph 
wires, cables and wireless apparatus to every nook and 



corner of the earth, and be reproduced in newspapers all 
over the world. What a tremendous power! what a 
sacred trust! what a talent for use or misuse! 

Not all of us have such wide opportunities for good 
or evil, but in our own homes, in our own offices, shops, 
markets, we may send forth either good or evil influences, 
far reaching for either happiness or misery, either up-building 
or down-tearing character, either of helpfulness 
or of discouragement. Surely no Christian could be indifferent 
to this his most powerful member. St. James 
suggests that as a match will kindle a great fire, so the 
tongue might start a great flame, a great commotion and 
do much injury. He suggests boasting as being one of 
the most dangerous uses of the tongue. Our experience 
corroborates this. Boasting often leads us into error 
and fastens us there because we are not humble enough 
to acknowledge the fault. It often leads into untruth 
from which we may have difficulty in escaping. It is an 
evidence of pride, and therefore un-Christlike, improper. 

Angry words, bitter words, sarcastic words, taunting 
words, may set ablaze the course of a whole life and 
impel it with angry force toward the Second Death, 
Gehenna. Hence St. James suggests that such evil-breeding 
words are like sparks from Gehenna, tending toward 
destruction. 

NO MAN CAN TAME IT 

The Apostle reminds us that beasts and birds and 
fishes are all subject to a taming power under man's direction, 
but that no man can tame another man's tongue. 

R5021 : page 149 

Yea, is it not safe to say that no fallen man can tame his 
own tongue? The only way by which to have our tongues 
brought into subjection to the Divine will and made 
useful as servants of truth and righteousness and love is 
by having them converted. And since the tongue is but 
the agent speaking for the sentiments of the heart, it follows 
that it is the heart that needs to be converted. The 
power of true conversion, true transformation of character, 
so that "all things become new," is of God. 

The child of God, begotten of the Holy Spirit, has 
an assistance in the mastering and taming of his tongue 
that the unregenerate have not. How important then the 
message, "My son, give Me thine heart" ! Out of the 
heart are the issues of life. Out of the abundance of 
the heart, of the heart's meditations, the mouth speaketh. 

St. James declares that the tongue of the natural 
man is full of deadly poison. His illustration seems to 
be that of a serpent. Alas, that in our fallen condition 
it should be so true that "the poison of asps is under 
their lips!" It is when we become new creatures, with a 
new motive power and incentive of love instead of selfishness, 
that the poison fangs are drawn. The new mind, 



the new creature, can then use the lips to show forth 
the praises of God and to bless his fellowmen. 

PRAISING GOD -INJURING MEN 

But note that the Apostle calls our attention to the 
fact that some who have become people of God, some 
who do Him reverence, fail to take note of the fact that 
the same tongue with which they sing Divine praises 
and tell Divine mercy they use to backbite, slander, 
defame, crush, mortify, scathe, flay their fellowmen! 
Alas, we realize the truth of the charge! And to realize 
means to correct on the part of those who are seeking to 
do the Divine will and to be true disciples of the Redeemer. 
A fountain cannot send forth at the same opening 
pure water and brackish. Hence we may know that 
if with our tongues we are doing injury to our fellowmen 
we are deceiving ourselves with respect to our real 
attitude toward God. We may know that God will reject 
the prayers and worship coming from a heart full of bitterness, 
anger, malice, hatred, envy, strife, and manifesting 
itself in acrimonious speech. 

It was Carlyle who described sarcasm as being "the 
natural language of the Devil." It was Faber who 
wrote, "No one was ever corrected by sarcasm; crushed, 
perhaps, if the sarcasm was clever enough, but drawn 
nearer to God, never." Robertson wrote, "Love is the 
remedy for slander." Surely the Golden Rule needs to be 
applied to our speech as well as to our actions. Truly 
Bishop Jackson wrote: "From being the messenger of 
peace and love, the tongue has become the fomenter of 
jealousy and ill-will, the lash of uncharitableness and the 
weapon of hatred." 



R5021 : page 149 

PRAYER A GREAT PRIVILEGE 

-JUNE 2.-MATTHEW 6:1-18.- 

"Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men to be 
seen of them: else ye have no reward with your Father which 
is in heaven. "-Matt. 6:1. (R.V.) 

THE MASTER in today's lesson tells of proper 
and improper giving of charity. He extends 
the subject and explains proper and 
improper prayers and finally proper and improper 
fasting. In all these He denounces 
hypocrisy, theatrical display. His followers 
are to be actuated solely by a desire to 
please the Heavenly Father and have His 
approval. There may be times and places 
where the giving of charity in the presence 



of others would be perfectly proper, or praying in the 
presence of others would be entirely right, and where 
fasting might come to the knowledge of others without 
reproach. 

The point which the Great Teacher makes is the 
motive actuating us. If we are actuated by a selfish 
motive, if we are seeking show and applause or earthly 
gain, the procedure cannot bring Divine approval or blessing 
—"Blessed are the pure in heart." We may be seen 
to do good or to pray or to fast, but we are not to do our 
charities, our praying and our fasting to be seen. Of 
such the Lord says, "They have received their reward"— 
nothing more is coming to them; they get the publicity 
sought. 

THE PRIVILEGE OF PRAYER 

Prayer is a privilege. Jesus did not command His disciples 
to pray, nor did He even give them a form of 
prayer until they requested it. "Prayer is the soul's 
sincere desire, uttered or unexpressed." The Lord's people 
must feel their need of Divine grace and help in order to 
appreciate the privilege of approaching the throne of 
heavenly grace. The trials and difficulties, the sorrows and 
temptations of life frequently impel God's children to 
prayer. It marks a better, a higher Christian development 
when they love to come to the Throne of grace, not only 
in their sorrows, but also in their joys, to give thanks, to 
praise, to worship, to adore. 

It will be noticed that our Lord did not tell about how 
the world should pray, but merely taught His disciples: 
"when ye pray." As a matter of fact, the Gentiles, the 
world of mankind in general, have no access to the Throne 
of grace. Only those in covenant relationship with God 
(Jews and Christians) ever had any Divine assurance 
that their petitions would be accepted by Him. This may 
cause surprise to some, so general is the custom of encouraging 
and exhorting everybody to pray. A brief 
glance at the situation, however, shows us the fixed principle 
underlying the matter. Let us note it. The world 
in general, the race of Adam, was alienated from God 
through wicked works. Adam was under a covenant 
with God by which he enjoyed the privileges of a son of 
God. This included fellowship, communion, prayer and 
Divine supervision and care even to the extent of everlasting 
life. But Adam's disobedience broke that covenant, 
abolished that covenant-relationship and all its 
privileges. (Hos. 6:7, R.V.) The only ones who now 
enjoy the privilege of prayer are those who have been 
accepted of God back into covenant-relationship. The 
natural Israelite was so accepted under the Law Covenant; 
hence the Temple at Jerusalem was called the House 
of Prayer. It was specifically for the Jewish nation, but 
all nationalities had the privilege of becoming Jewish 
Proselytes and thus of being received into all the privileges 
of Jews, which included the privilege of prayer. 



Our Lord, on the basis of His better sacrifice for sins, 
made holy and acceptable to still higher privileges of 
prayer such as became His disciples, His footstep followers. 
These, from Pentecost onward, were called sons of 
God and enjoyed the begetting of the Holy Spirit. At 
first these were only Jewish believers, but in due time 

R5021 : page 150 

the middle wall of partition between Jews and Gentiles 
was broken down, and all Gentile believers, from the time 
of Cornelius onward, were accepted as spirit begotten sons 
and granted all the privileges of prayer.— Acts 10. 

These Gentiles did not come into relationship with God 
through the Mosaic Law Covenant, but through the Covenant 
of sacrifice, under which they were called and accepted 
as joint-sacrificers with Christ: "Gather together 
My saints unto Me, those who have made a covenant 
with Me by sacrifice." (Psa. 50:5.) Only such Gentiles 
as accept Christ and enter with Him into this covenant of 
sacrifice can, during this Age, become sons of God and enjoy 
the privileges of sonship, of which prayer is one. The 
habit of inviting people out of covenant-relationship with 
God to pray is both unscriptural and unreasonable. God 
heareth not sinners (John 9:31); those who come to Him 
through Christ are acceptable only because Jesus is their 
Advocate. It is plain to be seen, then, that those who 
approach God in their own names— without having accepted 
the Advocate and His terms of discipleship— such 
can have no standing with the Father and their prayers 
are unacceptable. 

Instead of exhorting our friends and neighbors to pray 
to God and to trust for the fulfilment of their prayers, we 
should give them the Scriptural counsel, to repent of sin 
and by faith to accept the forgiveness of their sins, according 
to the testimony of God's Word, by making a 
full consecration of themselves to be the footstep followers 
of Jesus. Then, as sons of God, they would have all 
the privileges of sonship in this present time as well as 
the glorious prospects hereafter. 

VAIN REPETITIONS OF THE HEATHEN 

All are heathens or Gentiles— all of the world who 
have not left the world and come into covenant-relationship 
with God through Christ. Such outsiders, not understanding 
the Only Way, the Only Door of God's favor, 
vainly suppose that they will be heard for their much 
speaking, and therefore repeat their prayers. Some use 

R5022 : page 150 

praying wheels; others use beads; and still others repeat 
hundreds of times certain ejaculations. 

None are heard except those of Jesus' followers, and 
Jesus counsels these not to think that the length of their 



prayers would make them acceptable with the Father. 
They have no need to offer long prayers, because, as Jesus 
said, "Your Father knoweth what things ye have need 
of before ye ask Him." Why then should we ask at all? 
Because this is the Divine arrangement, and evidently 
with the purpose of stimulating our faith and of giving 
us the greater and the more frequent blessings. God 
thus deals with us as with dear children whom He loves 
and whom He would educate into the practices of life 
most helpful to themselves. When Jesus had long prayers 
to offer they were never uttered in public; He went apart 
into the mountain. So with His followers; they are to 
go aside and have their communion with the Father chiefly 
in private, although fellowship in public prayer in gatherings 
of the Lord's people is distinctly approved. 

A FORM OF SOUND WORDS 

Responding to the request of His disciples Jesus gave 
a sample of a proper prayer. We note its brevity, its simplicity, 
its directness, its orderliness. 

(1) It opens with an ascription of praise and a plea 
that we are coming as children to a father: "Our Father, 
which art in Heaven, hallowed [adored, honored] be 
Thy name." God's Name represents His character, His 
Kingdom, His personality. First of all, then, we ascribe 
honor, reverence, majesty, glory to our great Creator, 
who through His appointed way we delight to call our 
Father in Heaven. 

(2) Next in order we acknowledge the Divine rule, 
authority. This means that our hearts are submissive to 
the will of God, for joy or sorrow, for pleasure or pain, 
for life or death, and we are continuing to express our 
confidence in the Divine power and promise that ultimately 
the Divine will shall be as fully and completely done in the 
earth as it is now done in Heaven: "Thy Kingdom come, 
Thy will be done on earth as it is done in Heaven." In 

this we recognize the coming of Messiah's Kingdom and 
indirectly our own hopes connected with that Kingdom— 
that we, if faithful, shall be associated with the Lord in 
His glorious Throne, in dispensing the blessings of Divine 
power and mercy to mankind, so as to effect the regeneration 
of all the willing and obedient of mankind. 

(3) Our daily needs, our daily bread, is next the 
subject of request: "Give us this day our daily bread." 
How simple! God has promised that our bread and our 
water shall be sure in the sense that He will not forget 

us and our needs. In our petitions we merely suggest that 
we are waiting confidently upon the Lord, nothing doubting 
His willingness and ability to perform His promises. 
He has not promised, nor are we to ask for an abundance, 
wealth, riches, nor are we to specify fine food or luxuries. 
The thought is, Father, grant us daily such provisions for 
life's necessities as seemeth to Thee best for us. And 
should Divine Providence ever fail to make the provision, 
the believing soul is to recognize that it is neither from 



oversight nor from lack of power, but because Divine 
Wisdom sees best thus to deal with us. 

(4) "Forgive us our debts as we have forgiven our 
debtors." Here is emphasized the Master's teaching that 
only the merciful shall obtain mercy, that only the forgiving 
shall be forgiven. This has no reference whatever 

to the forgiveness of their original sins— they are past 
and gone forever to those who remain under the blood; 
they were covered when we accepted Christ and entered 
into covenant-relationship with Him. But we have daily 
shortcomings, weaknesses, imperfections, frailties, trespasses 
against the Divine Law. These we are to acknowledge, 
and Divine arrangement has been made for their 
forgiveness in harmony with our prayers, with but the 
one proviso, viz., that we appreciate the matter so deeply 
that we ourselves are acting upon the same principle in 
our dealings with others. 

(5) "Lead us not into temptation [to abandon us 
there]." We feel our own weakness, imperfection; hence, 
while knowing that we must be brought in Divine providence 
into positions of trial and testing, we may well pray 

not to be abandoned there, not to be left to our own 
strength, but that in harmony with the Lord's agreement 
His grace may be sufficient for us. 

(6) The Bible assures us that there is an Evil One, 
and that he has great power and influence amongst men, 
that he is "the Prince of the power of the air," and "the 
god of this Age." How appropriate that we should request 
the Lord not to abandon us to the Devil's wiles! 

The words, "For Thine is the Kingdom and the power 
and the glory forever, Amen," are not found in the oldest 
Greek manuscripts, and are therefore properly omitted in 
the Revised Version as being no part of the Scriptures. 
The kingdom or rule of the present time are not of God. 
His Kingdom and power and glory are not in evidence. 
We await the establishment of Messiah's Kingdom for the 
overthrow of Satan's Empire, and the binding of the Adversary 
for a thousand years, and the ushering in then of 
the Divine Kingdom and power and glory, forever.

REQUEST FOR VISITS OF TRAVELING BRETHREN 

FOR YEAR-MAY, 1912, TO MAY, 1913. 

WITH THIS ISSUE of THE TOWER the annual 
requests for visits by the Traveling 
Brethren are due. All who are desirous 
of securing the service of these brethren 
during the ensuing year— May, 1912, to 
May, 1913— are requested to carefully consider 
the following suggestions and then to 
promptly notify us:— 



The brethren chosen for this service 
are not sent forth as perfect, though the 
Society considers them worthy brethren in every way— 
ensamples to the flock in doctrine and practice. They 
travel continuously, as per announcement on last page of 
TOWER, all their expenses being met by the Society. 
They do not solicit money nor anything else, neither for 
themselves nor for the Society. The service is free, the 
expenses being borne by the contributors to the Tract 
Fund. We seek Divine guidance as to who shall be engaged 
in this service and where it shall be rendered. 

The increased attendance and manifest interest of the 
general public at the well-advertised meetings in good 
auditoriums claim special consideration. The Society 
will co-operate by making Sunday appointments for the 
Traveling Brethren at places where the friends desire to 
arrange for Special Public Meetings. By "Special Public 
Meetings" we mean a Public Lecture in a good auditorium 
and well advertised by a thorough house-to-house 
distribution of "Everybody's Paper," Window Cards, etc. 

This does not mean that the service to the friends at 
other places should be curtailed, or that such service is 
less important, or that we desire to urge large public 
meetings, or that the public should not be welcomed at the 
less public meetings when a Pilgrim serves. Our 
thought is that meetings in cities and larger towns should 
not be specially advertised for any day excepting Sunday, 
and then only if a proper auditorium has been secured. 

As new conditions arise we find it necessary to alter 
slightly the questions in order that we may be properly 
advised as far as possible as to the condition of each 
locality. You need not repeat the questions, but merely 
indicate them thus: (a), (b), etc. Please attend to this 
matter at once, in order that there may be no disappointment 
should a Pilgrim be coming your way. All letters 
referring to Pilgrim work should be marked "Pilgrim 
Department." 

(a) How many Bible Students in your vicinity use the 
STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES? 

(b) Are weekly meetings held? 

(c) How many are usually in attendance? 

(d) Where do you now meet on Sundays? (Give full 
street address.) 

(e) At what hours are the Sunday meetings held? 

(f) Was a vote taken on the Pilgrim invitation? 

(g) How many voted for the invitation to be sent? 
(h) Do you desire Sunday appointments for Special 
Public Lectures? 

(i) How frequently do you desire such Special appointments? 

(j) What is the seating capacity of Auditorium you 

could secure? 

(k) What attendance do you think could be secured for 

well-advertised public sessions in good Auditorium? 

(1) Would a suitable place be found for meetings not 

specially advertised? 

(m) Have the members of your class chosen leaders in 



accordance with suggestions of SCRIPTURE STUDIES, 

Volume VI., chapters 5 and 6? 

If so, give name and full address of each. 

(n) Give full names and full addresses of the two (2) 

to whom notices of Pilgrim visits should be 

sent. (Please notify us as to any change or removal.) 

(o) If your town is not on a railroad give the name of 

proper railroad station at which to stop. 

(p) How many miles from station is meeting place, and 

which direction from station? 

(q) Would Pilgrim be met at station? 

(r) If not, how should Pilgrim get from said station? 

(s) Give writer's full name and address. 

(t) Any additional remarks.

SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS 
IT IS AN INDIVIDUAL MATTER 

Question.— "If any man be in Christ, he is a New 
Creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things 
are become new." (2 Cor. 5:17.) Are we to understand 
from this Scripture that The Christ, Head and Body, is 
the New Creature, or should we understand that this term, 
New Creature, applies to the individual members of the 
Church? 

Answer.— Undoubtedly this is an individual matter. 
Individually we make consecration of our human nature 
in likeness to our Lord's consecration of His flesh. Individually 
we are begotten of the Holy Spirit. Individually 
we are on trial for everlasting life or everlasting 
death. Individually we must make our calling and election 
sure, or fail. Individually we must be changed in a 
moment, in the twinkling of an eye. Individually, as we 
have borne the image of the earthy one, we shall bear the 
image of the heavenly. 

Moreover, this New Creation includes not only our 
Lord, its Head, and the Church, His Bride, but also the 
"great company," the virgin companions of the Bride, 
equally spirit-begotten. They, too, will belong to this New 
Creation because they will no longer be members of the 
human family. This New Creation embraces all who 
belong to "the Church of the First-borns, whose names 
are written in heaven." (Heb. 12:23.) The chiefest in 
this glorious Church will be the Royal Priesthood. The 
lesser brethren on the spirit plane will be the antitypical 
Levites, the Great Company class. 



WE DIE DAILY BY LAYING DOWN OUR LIVES 



Question.— What is the Apostle's thought in the statement, 
"So, then, death worketh in us, but life in you"?— 
2 Cor. 4:12. 

Answer.— We understand St. Paul to refer to the tribulations 
which he and his companions were experiencing 
as they journeyed about in the interests of the Truth. 
These persecutions, difficulties, trials by the way, were 
evidences that God was accepting their sacrifice. Thus 
their death was going on, as elsewhere he says, "We die 
daily." In this statement he expressed the object, or 
motive, that prompted him and his companions to act. 
What they did was done, not in a perfunctory manner, 
because they had a general mission, but from a heart 
motive and in harmony with the Divine will, that they 
might bring spiritual blessings to the Church. 

R5022 : page 152 

The early Church perceived that the Apostles were 
very active in the service of the Truth; and St. Paul explained 
that their motive was an unselfish one. He exhorted 
the Church not to please themselves, but to lay 
down their lives for one another, as he and his companions 
were doing, as ensamples to the flock. All who are members 
of the Royal Priesthood are laying down their lives 
in the service. We are thus "building one another up in 
the most holy faith," until we are come to the New Jerusalem! 
—the glorious Kingdom of the great Anointed One, 
the great Prophet, Priest and King, of whose profession 
Jesus is the great High Priest! 

Our Lord declared, "I come to do Thy will, O God"; "I 
delight to do Thy will." (Heb. 10:9; Psa. 40:8.) This was 
a part of the Divine will, that He should lay down His 
life, finish His sacrifice, that He might ultimately give 
it on behalf of Adam and all of his race. 



HE WILL HAVE COMPLETED HIS WORK 

Question.— In I Cor. 15:28 we read that when Christ 
shall have accomplished the work appointed for Him— the 
work of His Millennial Kingdom and reign— and shall 
have put down all enemies (the last enemy to be destroyed 
being death), the Son also will be subject unto the 
Father, who put all things under Him. In what sense 
will He be "subject" then more than during the 
Millennium? 

Answer.— The special thought very evidently is that 
during Messiah's reign the Lord Jesus will be given full 
power and authority to control the world. That is the 
particular business appointed to Him. You will remember 
that the Father, speaking of that time, says, "Ask of Me, 
and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance"; 
and He declares that they shall be ruled with a rod of 
iron.— Psa. 2:8,9. 



This thousand-year period, known as the Millennium, 
is set apart for this work. Suppose that you were given 
a position by the Government, or the State, with commission 
to do a certain thing for a certain period of time, 

R5023 : page 152 

with the understanding that when it is accomplished you 
will be given a reward for doing it. You are instructed: 
"Everything is in your hands. Do the work, and you may 
have all of 1912 in which to do it. Attend to the matter." 
Then what? After having completed the work, 
you resign this special commission, this special office conferred 
upon you for the year. You will no longer hold it. 

So at the end of the Millennium our Lord Jesus will 
no longer hold office as Mediator between God and 
men, as He will have done for the one thousand years. 
Why not? There will be nothing more to be accomplished. 
During the thousand years He will have done 
His work as Mediator so thoroughly that there will be 
nothing more to do. That special work will have been 
fully accomplished. 



THEIRS WILL BE A HEAVENLY INHERITANCE 

Question.— If the antitypical Levites have no inheritance 
in the land, as shown in the type, what will be their 
reward? 

Answer.— The typical Levites were the whole tribe of 
Levi, a part of which was selected for a little company 
of priests. In the wilderness of Sinai, the Lord set the 
Levites apart for His service. (Num. 3:11-16.) 
Thenceforth, that one tribe represented the first-borns of 
Israel, who, the Apostle says, were typical of the Church 
of the First-born (Heb. 12:23)— typical of the spiritual 
class. 

In the type, the entire tribe of Levi was cut off from 
having any possession in the land. No title to land was 
given them; no field was given them. The land was 
divided amongst the other tribes, but not amongst the 
Levites. God thus typified the fact that the antitypical 
Levites would not have an earthly inheritance, but rather 
the spiritual or heavenly inheritance. All the Gospel 
Church are called to heavenly conditions; and therefore 
they are cut off from their earthly rights as men, that 
they may have the heavenly rights as New Creatures. 
The Apostle says God has "called us with a holy calling," 
a "heavenly calling," a "high calling."— 2 Tim. 1:9; Heb. 3:1; 
Phil. 3:14. 

The tribe of Levi was divided into two classes, a priestly 
class and a Levitical or servant class. In the antitype 
are two classes on the spirit plane— the Royal Priesthood, 
composed of Christ and the Church, His Bride; and also 
the servant class, "the virgins, her companions, who follow 



her," and who are to enter into the King's Palace with 
rejoicing. As these do not come up to the high standard 
required for admission into the Bride class, they are not 
counted worthy of being in this class who are presented 
unto the King "in raiment of needlework." Nevertheless, 
they must all be grand characters, worthy to receive palm 
branches, indicating their victory over sin and all evil.— 
Psa. 45:13-15; Rev. 7:9-17. 



JUSTIFICATION COMPLETED AT CONSECRATION 

Question.— Are we grafted into the olive tree when 
justified or when consecrated? 

Answer.— Both. That is to say, the completion of 
justification is at consecration. No one has his justification 
complete, or full, unless he has consecrated himself. 
Our justification begins when we turn toward that which 
is just or right, and away from that which is unjust; and 
we get more justification, more nearly right (for justification 
means being right, as we proceed toward consecration. 
When our justification has progressed to the 
point of full consecration, only then are we recognized 
as begotten of the Spirit, and as branches in the Vine, 
pictured by the Lord in the 15th chapter of John. In 
the picture of the olive tree the same is true. Only 
spiritual branches are grafted into this "olive tree." 

The question is doubtless based upon Romans 11:17, 
where the Apostle tells us that the Jewish nation represented 
the olive tree which had the good root. The root 
of the olive tree was the definite promise made to Abraham 
—"In thy Seed shall all the families of the earth be 
blessed." (Gen. 12:3.) The promise then began to produce 
branches. Every individual Jew claimed to be connected 
with this Abrahamic Covenant. The Apostle 
tells us that because of unfaithfulness many of these 
branches were broken off. The time that they were 
broken off was during that forty-year period which began 
with our Lord's ministry and ended with the destruction 
of Jerusalem. 

During that time all the branches that were not fit 
to be kept in were broken off, and those that were fit to 
stay in were "cleansed by the washing of water through 
the Word," and transferred from Moses into Christ, and 
begotten of the Holy Spirit. The Apostle proceeds to say 
that ever since the Jewish branches were broken off 
God has been gathering branches out of the Gentiles, and 
that we are being grafted in instead of those broken off 
branches. Thus you and I may get into the olive tree. 
We who were by nature children of wrath, aliens, are 
now grafted into the real tree through which the blessing 
is to come. 

R5023 : page 153 



If we can get into that olive tree, into that Vine, into 
Christ, the next thing to do is to abide in Him. There are 
certain tests applied; and those who do not conform to 
those tests will not be permitted to abide, but will be cut 
off. Respecting the Vine the Great Teacher said, "Every 
branch in Me that beareth not fruit He [the Father] 
taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit, He 
purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit." (John 15:2.) 
So, if we have the trimmings and prunings that 
He gives to the fruit-bearing branches, let us rejoice that 
we are in the good Husbandman's care and are in good 
condition. If we abide in the true Vine the time is not 
very far distant when we, with the remainder of the 
Church, will be glorified and constitute the Kingdom of 
Messiah, which in turn shall bless natural Israel and, 
through natural Israel, all the nations of the earth. 



IT IS NOT SCRIPTURAL 

Question.— Is it scriptural to say that the glorified 
members of the Church have reigned at any time up to 
the present? 

Answer.— No! They have not reigned at any time. At 
least, if they have reigned, we have not found it out, 
and they have made a poor reign of it so far. All 
the reigning we have seen in the world thus far has been 
a rather poor kind. We would say, however, that the 
kings of the earth are doing the best they can do; they 
are doing just as wisely as they know how to do under 
the circumstances and conditions. We are not specially 
faulting them. 

Take the Czar of Russia, for instance: the poor man 
does not know how to do better than he is doing. Probably 
the same is true of the Emperor of Austria, the 
President of France, King George of Great Britain, Emperor 
William of Germany, etc. These would all rather 
see their people happy; but they are imperfect men with 
imperfect subjects and are surrounded by such conditions 
as are almost impossible to overcome. Therefore we are 
not to fault them that their reign is not perfect. If they 
had perfect subjects, doubtless the world's condition 
would be very much better. 

The reign of Christ did not in any sense begin in the 
past. Our Catholic friends claim that Christ began His 
reign some time ago; and that for over a thousand years 
the Pope has been the representative of Christ as King 
of Earth; that it is not Christ Himself who is to reign, but 
His vicegerent, a title which they give to the Pope, meaning 
the one who rules instead of Christ. 

CHRIST'S KINGDOM STILL FUTURE 

We think that our Catholic friends are laboring under 
a misapprehension. They do not get the proper thought. 



You remember the Apostle says of some, Ye have reigned 
as kings in the earth; you are getting along very prosperously; 
you have had no trouble or persecution at all. 
Then, after making fun of them a little, he says, I would 
to God that ye did reign; for if you did, we would reign 
with you.— I Cor. 4:8. 

We hold that this is still true. When the reign of 
Christ begins, you will find it such a thorough reign that 
all the members of His Body will have some part in it. 
So we assume that when our Lord's Kingdom shall begin 
its reign conditions for the whole world will be very 
much changed. If the reign of Christ should begin today, 
the saints would be with Him; for He is to be the great 
Judge, the saints the under -judges; He is to be the great 
King, the saints the under-kings; He is to be the great 
Priest, the saints the under-priests— "A Royal Priesthood," 
"Kings and priests unto God," who "shall reign 
with Christ a thousand years." 

With His reign will begin the reign of righteousness, 
for the Scriptures intimate that sin will be suppressed 
promptly. Nothing shall hurt, or offend, or destroy, in all 
God's holy Kingdom. (Isa. 11:9.) Nothing will be allowed 
to do so. The Great Judge will know how to inflict 
such punishments and so promptly as to prevent the 
reign of evil; and then the inhabitants of the world will 
learn righteousness; for instance, if some one wished 
to speak evil of his neighbor and a punishment, such as 
paralysis of the tongue, should come upon him merely for 
the intention, before he spoke the evil, do you not suppose 
that he would learn the lesson that he must not 
think evil? He would not speak the evil, for his tongue 
would be paralyzed before he even spoke the word. The 
Bible says that he will learn the lesson. "When the 
judgments of the Lord are in the earth the inhabitants 
of the world will learn righteousness." (Isa. 26:9.) It 
will not take them long to learn. They will not need to 
have calamity overtake them many times before they will 
learn that it would be better for them not to do wrong. 

This will not, of course, affect the heart; but it will 
enable them to learn to do right, to see the effect of 
righteousness in the world. Thus they will have the opportunity 
of either loving or hating that condition. If 
they learn to love that condition they will get into the 
right attitude of heart, pleasing and acceptable to God; 
and so at the end of Christ's Millennial reign they will 
be ready to have the full blessing of eternal life; but, 
even though not permitted to do the wrong thing, if at 
heart they still love iniquity, with all the knowledge before 
them and experience behind them, if they will not 
learn to love righteousness and hate iniquity, they will be 
of those worthy of cutting off in the Second Death, from 
which there will be no recovery.

INTERESTING LETTERS 
TRAVELING NOW IN THE MORE EXCELLENT WAY 

TO THE WATCH TOWER SOCIETY: -- 

DEAR BRETHREN— Tardy though it may be, it is nevertheless 
with the greatest pleasure that I am writing you an expression 
of my appreciation of your thoughtful courtesy to 
me during my visit to New York City early in 1910. 

I was a stranger and you took me in, and to your kindness 
to me (not only then a stranger, but a sceptic as regards 
Present Truth) is, under God and His grace to me, due the 
glorious fact that I am now in the Truth. 

Last January, while prospecting in the Yukon delta country, 
I made my consecration, and while in Nome this summer 
I received from Brother Bayne a copy of The Vow, and 
after consecration and prayer I made "My Vow to the Lord." 

And, bless His name, He has been very gracious to me, 
as I have stumbled dreadfully time and again; but still He 
gives me assurance that I may yet be worthy to serve Him 
in some humble way. And I will earnestly pray daily that I 
may have the strength and the grace to renewedly endeavor to 
keep my Vow to the letter, to the end that "His rule may 
come into my heart more and more" until the glorious day 
when I can keep the old man under all the time and do God's 
will and His alone. 

From Brother Bayne I also received a few copies of 
"STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES" and other of our literature. I believe 
it has pleased God to give me opportunities to place 
some of these in the hands of those who "hunger and thirst 
after righteousness." 

Many times it has been a source of much pleasure to me 
to tell my friends and acquaintances of my visit to the 
Tabernacle and Bethel and what "manner of men" you 
all are. You may have forgotten that your kindness to me 
included the privilege of having tea with the Brothers and 
Sisters, with our dearly beloved Pastor Russell at the head 
of the table. The atmosphere there— of clean simplicity, 
earnest humility, old-fashioned virtue, quiet strength, brotherly 
love and true reverence— is one of my most fragrant 
memories. 

And I want you to know, too, that each day brings home to 
me more and more what a special privilege it was, after tea, 
to meet Pastor Russell personally, and feel the magnetism and 
loveableness, and (though then not in the Truth) to sense the 
Spirit of God in this man who has labored so long and steadfastly 
and to such wonderful purpose in the vineyard. 

No one who has read of the Man Christ Jesus, and His 
marvelous life, could, I believe, meet or hear Brother Russell 
speak without feeling that in him, at least, the world has 
one man of God, who, like the Savior, is "touched with a 
feeling of our infirmities." 



I remember one dear Brother there telling me (in answer 
to a remark of mine that the sacrifice of himself and family 
of the good things of this world to be colaborers at the Brooklyn 
Bethel was at least worthy of surprise and perhaps commendation) 
that he had gained joys and pleasures of life far 
beyond what he had experienced in work-a-day business and 
conventional home. 

I could not see it then, but now I know it. Just to serve 
Him is life itself. What joy it must be to feel and to know that 
"They that be 'teachers' (margin) shall shine as the brightness 
of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness 
as the stars forever and ever." 

Dear Brethren, it would please me very much if at some 
suitable time you would recall to Pastor Russell the fact of 
our having met, and tell him that I am now striving to travel 
in the "more excellent way." 

God's blessing on our dear Pastor and on all the dear 
colaborers at Brooklyn Bethel and in the Harvest Work everywhere, 
is the earnest, daily prayer of, 

Yours in His service, 

FRANK H. WASKEY.-Alaska.

THE TRUTH INCREASINGLY PRECIOUS 

MY VERY DEAR BROTHER AND PASTOR:- 

I have prayed for you daily grace for your every need, 
and that peace and joy and love be your portion. But I want 
to express to you, my dear brother, my very deep love for 
you. I have followed you through THE TOWER and the 
public press as you have gone from one nation to another 
with the "good tidings" which delights your dear heart and 
ours. God bless your every effort to glorify His name. 

God has greatly used you this last year in helping us to 
have our faith increased and our holiness stimulated. Now 
that another anniversary of your natal day has come, we 
pray that the Lord will continue to use you as that "Faithful 
Servant," and that His blessings upon you, dear brother, may 
also reach us. 

We are assured that neither men nor demons can rob 
you of your body until your work, entrusted to you, is finished. 

The Truth is increasingly precious to us and is helping 
us to be prepared for the fiery ordeal into which God's little 
ones will pass. 

We wish to assure you that every opposition to you is 
considered by us as opposition to the message which you 
present, and, therefore, opposition to us also. 

We are glad to be your companion in tribulation, as well 
as to rejoice with you in this Present Truth, and in the 
future joys which it so clearly portrays. 

Again, accept of my deep love and my gratitude for your 
sacrificing efforts to serve the dear Lord, and thus to serve 
us. 



Your brother in the patient waiting unto Obedience and its 
reward, A. M. SAPHORE.-Pilgrim.

ALMOST LED ASTRAY BY SATAN'S DEVICES 

MY BELOVED BRETHREN IN THE ANOINTED:- 

I wish to thank you for sending me THE TOWER. A year 
ago I requested that you send it on credit, promising to pay 
for same later. I found it impossible to fulfil my promise, 
but will again promise to meet my obligations as soon as I 
secure a position. I am at present unemployed. Please continue 
sending THE TOWER, for to me it is worth its weight 
in gold. 

I could not have said this awhile ago. I must confess 
that during the past couple of years I have been very unfaithful. 
I was anything but a humble, faithful follower of the 
dear Lord. I was serving sin and self. I had no desire for 
"Present Truth," still I had enough respect for it to not combat 
it. I did not meet with the dear brethren. In short, I was 
very nearly trapped beyond hope of regaining freedom, in 
one of Satan's most successful devices, viz., Spiritism. I was 
induced to purchase a "ouija" board, "just for amusement"; 
but I dare say that that "amusement" almost cost me my 
"crown." 

I spent all my spare time in operating the "board," 
and became so skilled in its manipulation that it would perform 
rather difficult feats with the least solicitation. A 
neighbor, having become fascinated upon seeing what the 
"little thing would do and say," purchased one for his own 
use. After trying to operate it (without success, however), 
he came to me, requesting that I "try my hand." Strange 
as it may appear, it did all I asked of it, and told me that it 
was a cousin to my board, and would "do anything" for me. 

I can easily see that Satan, the chief operator of all "ouija" 
and planchette boards, was only trying with all his might to 
get me more firmly into his clutches. My good morals were 
not entirely destroyed, however, and the Adversary, knowing 
this, advised me not to neglect my brethren or my Bible. I 
then asked whether the DAWNS are a correct interpretation 
of God's Word. To this the reply came, "Yes; the DAWNS 
are correct, not only in doctrine, but in chronology as well." 
I then asked by what power the board was operated. It answered, 
"By evil, spirit power." It further confessed to me 
that the spirits who operate the board have no other mission 
than to hinder all of the Lord's people. It further stated that 
they took "special delight in buffeting, hindering and endeavoring 
to ensnare Brother Russell and his colaborers at 
the Bethel Home." 

After thus confessing, I concluded to destroy the board, 
which I finally did. Before the destruction it pleaded for 
mercy and tried every way to work on my sympathy. It told 
me that it would much rather be given away or sold. 



Before closing, I wish to add that, shortly after I bought 
the "ouija," I asked it if there was any possibility of my ever 
becoming as accomplished as "Hermann the Great." The answer 
came, "No." This answer rather surprised me, and 
I wanted to know why it answered me thus. I used untold 
persuasion before I received the reason for the "No." And 
when I did get the answer, I got it a word at a time. The 
answer in substance follows: "Because God will not permit 
it." In order that I might not be mistaken I inquired as to 
what "God" was meant. I was informed that it meant "the 
Almighty." 

I need not explain that such a reply shocked me. It bewildered 
me to think that Satan had to confess thus. If 
Satan, or any of his force, ever told the truth it was then. 
Yes, dear, beloved brethren, I am a miracle of the dear 
Father's grace, through the wonderful merit of our blessed 
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Oh, how my yearning heart 

R5024 : page 155 

goes out to Him for His love to me!— I, the least of the 
least! 

Dear ones, pray for me that I may stand all the tests that 
will come upon me to try me from now on. And if this letter 
should reach the remainder of the Lord's fold, I solicit all 
their prayers. I feel I need them. I feel my nothingness. 
I feel my need of a Savior now more than ever. And while 
I begrudge all the time I wasted in foolishness, I thank the 
dear Father for the lessons learned. I tried to write you 
several times during the past wasted years, but it seems as 
though it was not the proper time to do so. The battle was 
not yet completed. I feel that I have at last broken away 
from the Adversary, and, trusting to God's grace, I expect 
it to be final. I am sorry I consumed so much of your needed 
time by writing so lengthy a letter, but I could not keep 
quiet any longer. 

In closing, I will request that you continue THE TOWER, 
for I need it, I want it, and I will pay both years' subscription 
as soon as possible. Thanking you for all past favors, 
and always making mention of you all in prayer since I have 
taken the blessed "Vow," I remain, 

Yours in the only Hope, 

HARRY W. DAVIDGE.-NJ.

DELIVERED FROM DARKNESS INTO MARVELOUS LIGHT 

DEAR FRIENDS :- 

In reply to the postal received today, I am so happy to 
say that just three years ago today— after much prayer and 
thought— I took the Vow, and wrote Pastor Russell that I 
had done so. I had not, however, withdrawn from the 
nominal Church at that time, so considered myself merely as 



one of the Household of Faith, although I had read and was 

studying the SCRIPTURE STUDIES, and had ceased to attend 

Church. I went to every meeting of the friends and was earnestly 

praying for and seeking the light. The particular 

Church of which I was a member was feebly struggling along 

and I hesitated about withdrawing, knowing it would be a 

still further weakening, and thinking it best to wait till circumstances 

would take us away from Bangor, where I then 

resided. 

On coming to Worcester, as soon as a new pastor 
was installed at Bangor, I sent the letters provided by your 
Society for that purpose, with a few words of explanation 
to the pastor and deacons and various members with whom 
I was acquainted. No notice was taken of them except by 
a few personal friends, who regretted my action, but declined 
to discuss the matter with me. Since then the Church building 
(First Baptist of Bangor, Me.) was burned in the great 
fire which swept clean a large section of the city. 

I am unable to express the joy and thankfulness I feel 
that I have been delivered from "darkness into this marvelous 
light." I am glad to have the opportunity to say how great 
a blessing the Vow has proved. As I awake each morning 
it is my first thought, and it becomes more significant and 
precious as various testings and trials show me how weak I 
am, and force me to lay hold upon the "precious promises" 
more and more firmly, as the way proves steeper and more 
dangerous, nearing the end. I have much help in the thought 
that everywhere the "very elect" are praying for each other, 
whether they have met in the flesh or not, and that our Great 
Head is with us in all our joys and sorrows in a closer, more 
personal way than at any time before since He walked among 
men in the flesh. Our dear Pastor celebrated his birthday 
among strange people in a foreign land, testifying as he is "to 
many peoples and nations and tongues"— giving them the message 
which has made so many call him "blessed of the Lord," 
and has excited the bitter animosity of such as are too occupied 
with the cares of this world to "rightly divide the Word 
of Truth." 

May God bless him and daily strengthen him till his great 
task is done. "Now are we the sons of God, and it hath not 
yet been seen what we shall be" when we gather at the 
"Great Convention," the "General Assembly of the First-borns." 
We know, however, that when "He shall appear we 
shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is." How we 
will praise Him! And as we gaze in rapture and wonder 
perhaps He'll say, "O, ye of little faith, wherefore did ye 
doubt?" 

The Dove bookmark was very thankfully received. Yours 
in the love and service of the King, 

EVELYN T. WEBB.-Mass.

1912-VOLUNTEER MATTER PLENTIFUL- 19 12 

Our financial deficiency noted in our Society's Report for 
191 1 has been much more than made up! We are prepared 
to supply I.B.S.A. Classes everywhere with this year's 
free literature in unlimited quantities. There is no need for 
any to be idle. The harvest is plenteous, the laborers are 
comparatively few. Let us extend our efforts and increase 
our own joy and usefulness. We desire earnestly our Master's 
"Well done, good and faithful servant." We have this 
year's special issue of PEOPLES PULPIT ready now for 



shipment, and its message, "The Handwriting on the Wall," 
is timely. Everybody can have a hand in this branch of harvest 
work. "He that reapeth receiveth wages." 



LOANING MONEY TO PROFESSED BRETHREN 

Caution along this line is rarely needed by the majority 
of people; but our readers are very sympathetic whenever 
Christian brethren make an appeal. We are glad 
that this sympathetic feeling exists and would not destroy 
it for a great deal. Frequently, however, we receive letters 
from brethren telling how they were deceived and 
asking us to warn others to be on guard against deceivers. 

This is a matter in which we can do nothing. Each 
individual must use his common sense and strive to do the 
Lord's will with whatever money talent he possesses. 
One good thought to have in mind is the Bible instruction 
that nothing be loaned which we could not afford to lose. 



WHEN WILL SATAN BE DESTROYED? 

The above words are found on the first line of the second 
column, page 45, of our issue of February 1. They are 
wrong and give an entirely erroneous coloring to the statements 
following. About two thousand copies of THE WATCH 
TOWER were printed with this mistake. All the remainder, 
however, had the sentence properly, as written by the Editor, 
namely, "When and how will this be done?" Please look 
up your copy of that issue and make it correct, as it might 
be misleading to a stranger, although the error is so glaring 
that anyone familiar with the Truth should recognize it at 
once.

JESUS NO LONGER FLESH--NOW "THAT SPIRIT" 



"With what body do they come?"— 1 Cor. 15:35. 

IN THE MAY 1 issue of THE WATCH TOWER 

we discussed the fact of the resurrection and 

showed from St. Paul's words that without 

God's purpose of a resurrection those who 

have fallen asleep in death would have 

perished as brutes. We followed with the 

Apostle the assurances that Christ did rise 

from the dead and did become the First-fruits 

of all those who have gone into the 

sleep of death. Others, indeed, were 

awakened temporarily— as, for instance, Jairus' daughter, 

Lazarus the friend of Jesus, and the son of the widow 

of Nain. 

Yet none of those instances is counted as a resurrection, 
for it is said that Christ is the First-fruits of those 
who slept. Their awakening was merely of a temporary 
nature, and they soon relapsed into the sleep of death. 
They did not have a full resurrection— anastasis— a raising 
up to perfection of life, such as the redemptive work 
of Jesus guarantees to Adam and to all his race willing 
to accept the same under the terms of the New Covenant. 

You will recall that in our last issue we demonstrated 
from the Scriptures that it is not the body, but the soul, 
that is promised a resurrection— that it was our Lord's 
soul that went to sheol, to hades, to the death state, and 
that God raised Him up from death on the third day. We 
noted a difficulty into which all Christendom was plunged 
by the unscriptural theory that it is the body that is to be 
resurrected. We now continue to search and note well 
further difficulties into which this error plunged us as 
believers in the words of Christ, particularly in connection 
with our Redeemer's resurrection. 

WHAT WENT TO HEAVEN? 

The ordinary thought in Christian minds in respect 
to Jesus' death and resurrection is that when He seemed 
to die He did not die; that He, the being, the soul, could 
not die; that, instead, He went to Heaven, and then, on 
the third day, came back to get the body which had been 
crucified; and that He took it to heaven forty days later; 
that He has had that body ever since; and that He will 
have it to all eternity, marred with the print of the nails 
in His hands and feet, the thorns upon His brow, and 
the spear mark in His side. What a ghastly thought! 
How strange that we should ever have been misled into 
so unscriptural and unreasonable a theory! Some endeavor 
to gloss the matter by suggesting that our Lord's 
flesh is glorified— that it shines— the shining presumably 
making the wounds all the more conspicuous. 

ABSURDITY OF THEORIES RECEIVED FROM DARK AGES 

Our Methodist friends have not yet changed their 



statement of the matter, namely, "He ascended up on 
high, taking His fleshly body with Him, and all that appertained 
thereto, and sat down on the right hand of God." 
This medieval statement correctly admits that the fleshly 
body was not the Lord's, but that He, the soul, took it 
with Him as luggage. The statement, "and all that appertained 
thereto," presumably would refer to our Lord's 
sandals, walking stick and such clothing as the soldiers 
did not divide amongst them at the time of His crucifixion 
—if indeed He had any others! But our dear Methodist 
friends want to be sure that nothing was left behind. 
All this is of a piece with the theory that the saints 
when they die go to heaven, and then, later, come back 
and get their bodies, "and all things appertaining thereto" 
—the inconveniences that they have been rid of for centuries ! 
How many trunkloads of "things appertaining 
thereto" may be taken by some, and how mixed an assortment 
by others is not stated. Neither are particulars given 
respecting those whose clothing, etc., have meantime worn 
out. But we have had enough of this, if it has helped 
us to see the absurdity of our theories received from the 
"Dark Ages"— if it has awakened us to thought and to 
Bible investigation on this important and interesting 
subject. 

WHAT SAY THE SCRIPTURES? 

The Bible presentation of this subject is every way 
reasonable, consistent and harmonious. St. Paul points 
out that "there is a natural body and there is a spirit 
body." He does not mean and he does not say that the 
spirit body is a human body glorified. Quite to the contrary. 
He declares that "Flesh and blood cannot inherit 
the Kingdom of God"— no matter how glorified it might 
be. A human being is so totally different from a 
spirit being that, as St. Paul says, "It doth not yet appear 
what we shall be," in our resurrection change; and the 
Scriptures do not even attempt to give us an explanation. 

The Bible merely declares that as we now bear the 
image of the earthy, Adam, we shall, by the glorious 
resurrection change, be given a share in the nature and 
likeness of the Second Adam, our glorious Lord. We 
shall be like Him and see Him as He is; and, be it noted, 
we must change from flesh and blood conditions to spirit 

R5025 : page 160 

conditions by resurrection power, in order that we may 
see Him as He is. Surely this proves that our Lord Jesus 
is no longer flesh, as He once was— "in the days of His 
flesh."— Hebrews 5:7. 

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HEAVENLY AND EARTHLY 
BODIES 

Our text calls attention to the difference between 



celestial bodies and terrestrial, or earthly bodies, and declares 
that they have different glories. It tells us that the 
first Adam was made a living soul, a human being, but 
that our Redeemer, who humbled Himself and took the 
earthly nature, "for the suffering of death," thereby became 
the Second Adam— the Heavenly Lord. The wide 
distinction between the Second Adam and the first Adam 
is clearly set forth. One was earthy and the other 
heavenly. As we now bear the image of the earthy, we 
shall, if faithful, bear the heavenly image of our Lord, 
the Second Adam, after our resurrection change. 

St. Paul illustrates by saying that we know of many 
kinds of organisms on the earthy or fleshly plane— one 
flesh of man, another of beasts, another of birds and another 
of fish. But however different the organisms they 
are all earthy. So, on the heavenly plane, the spirit plane, 
there are varieties of organisms, but all are spirit. 

Our heavenly Father is the Head or Chief— "God is 
a Spirit." Cherubim, seraphim, and the still lower order 
of angels are all spirit beings; and Christ Jesus, our Redeemer, 
after finishing the work of sacrificing appointed 
to Him, was resurrected to the spirit plane— far above 
angels, principalities and powers— next to the Father; 
and thus we read, "Now the Lord is that Spirit." And 
again that "He was put to death in the flesh, but quickened 
(or made alive) in the spirit."— I Pet. 3:18. 

The more we examine the subject the more foolish and 
unscriptural the views handed to us from the Dark Ages 
appear. For instance, the Scriptures clearly set forth that 
our Redeemer, prior to becoming a Man, was a spirit being 
—"the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and 
truth." His leaving the spirit plane to become a Man is 
Scripturally described as a great stoop or humiliation. Is 
it reasonable to suppose that the heavenly Father would 
perpetuate to all eternity that humiliation, after it had 
served its intended purpose? Surely He would do nothing 
of the kind! 

The Bible tells us why Jesus humbled Himself to the 
human nature— "a little lower than the angels." It was 
because a man had sinned, and the Redeemer must, under 
the Law, be on the same plane of being as the one whom 
He would redeem. Thus Jehovah particularly specified, 
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life." 
Hence the death of an angel, or of our Lord in His pre-human 
condition, could not have effected the payment of 
man's penalty and the consequent release of the condemned 
race. Thus again we read, "A body hast Thou 
prepared Me," "for the suffering of death."— 
Heb. 10:5; 2:9. 

GOD HIGHLY EXALTED HIM 

No one questions that this applies exclusively to our 
Lord's experiences during the years in which "He who 
was rich for our sakes became poor, that we through His 
poverty might be made rich." Surely it is unsupposable 



that the Father would arrange a Plan by which our Redeemer's 

faithfulness in accomplishing man's redemption 

would cost Him an eternity of poverty, humiliation, degradation 

to a plane "a little lower than the angels," while 

the Church would be made rich, and would attain a spirit 

state "far above angels"— be made "partakers of the divine 

nature."— 2 Peter 1:4. 

On the contrary, the very same Apostle who tells us 
of our Lord's humiliation carries the matter to the climax, 
telling us of His faithfulness, as the Man Christ Jesus, 
unto death, even the death of the cross; and then he adds 
an assurance of the heavenly Father's faithfulness in not 
leaving His Son on a lower plane: "Wherefore," says 
the Apostle, "God also highly exalted Him, and hath given 
Him a name above every name." This, too, is in harmony 
with our Lord's words in His prayer to the Father. A 
joy had been set before Him by the Father— a joy of 
pleasing the Father, of bringing a blessing to mankind, 
and the joy also of exaltation, as a special reward for 
obedience. 

But the Redeemer, ignoring all the promises of a 
higher glory as a reward for His faithfulness, merely 
prayed to the Father in these words, "Father, glorify 
Thou Me with the glory which I had with Thee before 
the world was." In humility He asked no reward. He 
did not pray, Remember that you promised a still greater 

R5026 : page 160 

exaltation in glory! No, He would be quite content to 
have served the Father's purpose and plans and then to 
return to the glorious state in which He was before He 
left the glory, and for our sakes became poor and took 
upon Himself the human nature. And what said the 
heavenly Father in response to that prayer? Oh, we remember 
the words of Jehovah were, "I have glorified 
Thee, and I will glorify Thee again," or further— the 
implication is that of a still higher glory than the one 
which He enjoyed before He was made flesh. 

HE APPEARED AND DISAPPEARED 

Two lines of difficulties present themselves, one of 
which can be answered and the other cannot. The unanswerable 
difficulty is where a natural-minded man undertakes 
to reason the subject out. He finds it impossible 
of comprehension as he finds other items of Divine revelation. 
St. Paul explains this, saying, "The natural man 
receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, neither can 
he know them, because they are spiritually discerned." 
The Apostle proceeds to tell us that all men are natural 
men, except such as have been begotten by the Holy 
Spirit. All natural men will, in their resurrection, receive 
earthly, or human bodies, while all spiritual ones, 
New Creatures in Christ, will receive spirit bodies, as 
St. Paul explains in our context, verses 36-50. 



Those of our readers, therefore, who have never accepted 
Christ, and made a full consecration of their all 
to be His disciples, following in His footsteps, may know 
that they have not been begotten of the Holy Spirit (because 
only upon these terms are any begotten of the 
spirit). These, therefore, we will ask to consider what we 
say, and hold it, if they please, tentatively, until such 
time as, in God's providence, they may be begotten of the 
Holy Spirit, and thus be enabled to understand spiritual 
matters such as this. 

Another class who have difficulty on this subject are 
the spirit-begotten ones who have been entangled in their 
reasoning by the declaration of the creeds respecting the 
resurrection of the body. It is difficult to unlearn error. 
When visiting various lands and learning of the hold of 
superstition upon the heathens, we said to ourself, we 
believe that we Christians experience just as much difficulty 
in unlearning our errors as these heathens do in 
getting free from theirs. 

THE UNCONSECRATED CANNOT UNDERSTAND SPIRITUAL 
PROBLEMS 

Coming to the point of what is to be resurrected, we 
note the fact that our Lord appeared in a body of flesh, 

R5026 :page 161 

and showed the disciples the print of the nails and the 
hole made by the spear. But we, perhaps, failed to note 
that only twice did He thus appear, and but for a few 
moments each time. His other six or seven appearances 
during that forty days were also very brief, and in various 
bodies— once as a gardener, another time as a traveler— 
His third time as a stranger on the shore, and to Saul of 
Tarsus, as a spirit being of more than angelic brightness, 
"shining above the brightness of the sun at noonday." 
We overlooked the fact that these appearances, if all put 
together, would probably not have exceeded four hours 
out of the entire forty days in which our Lord tarried 
with His disciples after His resurrection and before His 
ascension. We were not critical students when we overlooked 
these things, and forgot to ask ourselves why these 
things were so. 

Now we see more distinctly why our Lord did as He 
did. His disciples were natural men and therefore could 
not appreciate spiritual things. Furthermore, they could 
not receive the guiding of the Holy Spirit until the Lord's 
ascension and appearance in the presence of the Father 
on behalf of His Church, to make satisfaction for their 
sins, and to make them acceptable joint-sacrificers with 
Him. Meantime, had Jesus not tarried those forty days 
—had He ascended immediately after His resurrection— 
the disciples, stunned and bewildered, would have had no 
assurance of His resurrection. They would have found 
it impossible to go out and tell the people that He had 



risen from the dead when they had no proof to this effect. 

And even if Jesus had appeared to them as He did to 
Saul of Tarsus, above the bright shining of the sun, this 
would not have been convincing and satisfactory. They 
might have said, Here is a phenomenon, but how can we 
positively associate it with the life and death of Jesus? 
Matters were different with Saul of Tarsus. He needed 
something to thoroughly arouse him and to teach him for 
all time, and others through him, that the Lord is not a 
Man, but "that Spirit." Besides, some of the disciples 
who already believed were able to give Saul of Tarsus 
assurances of what they knew respecting the resurrection 
of Jesus and His ascension. 

NO FOOLISH SUGGESTIONS IN BIBLE ABOUT THE RESURRECTION 

The Lord adopted the only reasonable way of helping 
His disciples to understand that He was no longer dead— 
that He had risen from the dead— and that He was no 
longer human, but had been glorified, and had become a 
spirit being. The two things were necessary and they 
were done at the same time. 

Even on the occasions when our Lord appeared in a 
body like to the one crucified, He took care that the manifestation 
should be under such conditions as would positively 
prove that He had become a spirit being. He came 
into the room where they were while the door was shut, 
and after a few words with them He vanished from their 
sight, as no human being could have done and as He never 
did during His earthly career. That the Apostles caught 
the thought is well evidenced by St. Paul's argument on 
the subject in the context. There is no foolish suggestion 
in the Bible about Jesus having a fleshly body in heaven— 
that is all in our creeds and hymn books, prepared for us 
by our well-meaning but mistaken forefathers, who used 
to burn one another at the stake if they failed to promptly 
agree together on such propositions. 

We mourn the dead, but they shall wake; 

The lost, but they shall be restored! 
O! well our human hearts might break 

Without that sacred word! 
Dim eyes, look up! sad hearts, rejoice! 

Seeing God's bow of promise through, 
At sound of that prophetic voice: 

"I will make all things new." 



R5026 :page 161 

THE SABBATH DAY 

SEVEN IS a very prominent number in the 
Bible— in everything relating to the Divine 
Program. In the first chapter of Genesis 



the Sabbath Day is referred to in a figurative 

way in speaking of the Seventh Epoch 

of God's creation on our earth— bringing 

order out of chaos. Not until Mt. Sinai, 

however, when the Law was given to Israel 

on two tables of stone, was the Day Sabbath 

made obligatory on anybody. And since that 

Law Covenant was made with the one nation (Israel) and 

none other, the Sabbath requirements of that Law apply 

to that nation only. This does not signify that the setting 

apart of a certain time for rest would be of advantage 

only to the Jew, nor that a special Seventh Day devoted 

to God would be disadvantageous to all people. It merely 

means that God entered into Covenant relationship with 

the one nation only, and hence to them only He told His 

Will, His Law— obedience to which He made the foundation 

of the blessing He promised to that people. There 

is no room to question the import of the Fourth Commandment 

of the Jewish Law. It distinctly commanded that 

the Seventh Day of the week should be to the Jews a rest 

day, in which no work of any kind should be done, either 

by parent or child, employer or servant, male or female, 

ox or ass or any creature owned by a Jew. It was a rest 

day pure and simple. Divine worship was not commanded 

to be done on that day— not because God would be displeased 

to have Divine worship upon that day or upon 

any day, but because there is a reason connected with the 

matter which related, not to worship, but to rest, as we 

shall see. The strictness of this Law upon the Jews is 

fully attested by the fact that upon one occasion, by Divine 

command, a man was stoned to death for merely picking 

up sticks on the Sabbath Day. It is plain, therefore, to be 

seen that the Law given to Israel on this subject meant 

what it said to the very letter. 

In the New Testament Jesus is supposed by some to 
have taught a laxity in the matter of Sabbath observance, 
but this is quite a misunderstanding. Jesus, born a Jew, 
"born under the Law," was as much obligated to keep that 
Law in its very letter as was any other Jew. And He did 
not, of course, violate the obligation in the slightest 
degree. The Scribes and Pharisees had strayed away 
from the real spirit of the Law in many particulars. Their 
tradition, represented at the present time by their Talmud, 
attempted to explain the Law, but really, as Jesus said 
frequently, made it void, meaningless, absurd. For instance, 
according to the traditions of their Elders, it was 
breaking the Sabbath, if one were hungry, to rub the 
kernels of wheat in their hands and blow away the chaff 
and eat the grain, as the disciples did one Sabbath Day 
in passing through the wheat field. The Pharisees called 
attention to this and wanted Jesus to reprove the disciples, 
because, according to their thought, this simple process 
was labor— work— reaping and thrashing and winnowing. 
Jesus resisted this absurd misinterpretation of the Law 
and by His arguments proved to anyone willing to be 



R5027 : page 162 

taught that they had mistaken the Divine intention— had 
mistranslated the Law of the Sabbath. On several occasions 
He healed the sick on the Sabbath Day. Indeed, 
the majority of His healings were done on that day, 
greatly to the disgust of the Pharisees, who claimed that 
He was a law-breaker in so doing. We cannot suppose 
that Jesus performed these miracles to aggravate the 
Pharisees; rather we are to understand that their Sabbath 
Day typified the great Sabbath of blessing and healing 
—the antitypical Sabbath which is in the future— the 
period of the Messianic reign and the healing of all 
earth's sorrows. 

Jesus clearly pointed out to the Scribes and Pharisees 
that they were misinterpreting the meaning of the 
Divine arrangement, that God did not make man merely 
to keep a Sabbath, but that He had made the Sabbath 
for, in the interest of, mankind. Hence everything 
necessary for man's assistance would be lawful on the 
Sabbath Day, however laborious it might be. Indeed, 
Jesus carried the thought still farther and pointed out to 
His hearers the absurdity of their position— for, he said, 
if any of you should have an ox or an ass fall into the pit 
on a Sabbath Day, would you leave him to die and thus 
suffer loss, as well as allow the animal to be in pain? 
Assuredly they would not, and assuredly they would be 
justified in helping any creature out of trouble on that 
day. Then said Jesus, If so much might be done for a 
dumb creature, might not a good work of mercy and help 
for mankind be properly enough done on the Sabbath 
Day? 

THE SEVENTH DAY STILL A SABBATH 

A mistake made by many Christians is the supposition 
that the Law Covenant which God made with Israel 
ceased, passed away. On the contrary, as the Apostle 
declares, "The Law hath dominion over a man so long 
as he liveth." The Jewish Law is as obligatory upon the 
Jew today as it was upon his fathers in the days of Moses. 
Only death could set the Jew free from that Law Covenant 
until, in God's due time, it shall be enlarged and 
made what God, through the Prophet, styles a New Covenant 
—a New Law Covenant. That will take place just 
as soon as the Mediator of the New Covenant shall have 
been raised up from amongst the people. That Prophet 
will be like unto Moses, but greater— the antitype. That 
Prophet will be the glorified Christ— Jesus the Head and 
the completed Church, who are frequently spoken of as 
members of His Body, and sometimes styled the Bride, 
the Lamb's Wife. This antitypical Mediator (Acts 3:22,23), 
under the New Law Covenant which He will 
then establish, will assist the Jews (and all who come 
into harmony with God through Him) back to that human 
perfection in which they will be able to keep the Divine 



Law perfectly in every particular. This great Mediator, 
Messiah, will for a thousand years carry on this great 
work. 

This Mediator is not yet completed. The Head has 
passed into glory centuries ago, but the Body, the Church, 
awaits a completeness of membership and resurrection 
change— to be made "like Him and see Him as He is" 
and share His glory and His work. 

Meantime the Law Covenant is still in force upon 
every Jew; but it is not in force upon any but Jews, as 
it never has been in force upon any other people. During 
these eighteen centuries, between the death of Christ and 
the inauguration of the New Covenant, Jesus, as the great 
High Priest, is offering the "better sacrifices" mentioned 
by St. Paul (Hebrews 9:23) and described in type in 
Leviticus 16. The first part of the great High Priest's 
sacrifice was the offering of the human body which He 
took for the purpose when He was made flesh— "a body 
hast thou prepared Me" "for the suffering of death." 
(Heb. 9:5; 2:9.) The second part of His "better sacrifices" 
is the offering of His Mystical Body— the Church. 
This work has been in progress since Pentecost. To the 
consecrated ones who approach the Father through Him 
He becomes the Advocate. He accepts them as His members 
on the earth; and their sufferings thenceforth are His 
sufferings so fully that He could say of them to Saul of 
Tarsus, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?" "I am 
Jesus whom thou persecutest." These, accepted as His 
representatives in the flesh, their blemishes covered by 
their Advocate's merit, are begotten, by the Heavenly 
Father, of the Holy Spirit to be members of the New 
Creation— the spiritual Body of Christ, of which He is 
the Head. 

We remarked that the Sabbath Day, still in full force 
and its observance obligatory upon the Jew, is not upon 
other nationalities. We should modify this statement by 
the remark that there are some who mistakenly endeavor 
to be Jews and try to get under the Law Covenant provisions 
as Sabbath-keepers, etc. St. Paul recognized this 
tendency in his day. Note his words to the Christians of 
Galatia, who were not by nature Jews but Gentiles. He 
says, "Ye that desire to be under the Law, do ye not hear 
the Law?" "Oh, foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched 
you?" He proceeds to show them that the Jews are in 
bondage to their Law and can never get eternal life under 
it until the Mosaic Law Covenant shall ultimately be 
merged into the Messianic New Law Covenant. His 
argument then is that if the Jew cannot get life in keeping 
the Law, it would be foolish for Gentiles to think that 
they could secure Divine favor and everlasting life by 
keeping that Law. He declares, "By the deeds of the 
Law shall no flesh be justified in God's sight." The only 
way to obtain justification in God's sight is by the acceptance 
of Christ and by a full consecration to be His disciples 
and to join with Him in His Covenant of sacrifice 
—as it is written, "Gather together My saints unto Me, 



saith the Lord, those who have made a Covenant with 
Me by sacrifice" (Psa. 50:5); and again, "I beseech you, 
brethren, present your bodies living sacrifices, holy and 
acceptable to God, your reasonable service."— 
Romans 12:1. 

CHRISTIANS AND THE LAW SABBATH 

St. Paul did not mean that Christians should not strive 
to keep the Divine Law, but that they should not put 
themselves under it as a Covenant, nor think that by 
striving to oppose the Law Covenant they would get or 
maintain harmony with God and gain the reward of everlasting 
life. On the contrary, he declares in so many 
words, "The righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in us 
who are walking, not after (or according to) the flesh, 
but after (or according to) the spirit." (Romans 8:4.) 
His meaning is clear. The Decalogue was never given to 
Christians, but it is quite appropriate that Christians 
should look back to that Decalogue and note the spirit of 
its teachings and strive to conform their lives thereto 
in every particular. 

But what is the spirit of the Decalogue? Our Lord 
Jesus clearly set it forth to be— "Thou shalt love the Lord 
thy God with all thy heart, with all thy mind, with all 
thy being, with all thy strength, and thou shalt love thy 
neighbor as thyself." St. Paul says that our Lord not 
only kept that Law, but that He magnified it, or showed 
it to have greater proportions than the Jews ever supposed 
it had— length and breadth, height and depth beyond the 
ability of fallen humanity to perform; moreover, the 
Apostle declares that our Lord Jesus made that Law 

R5027 : page 163 

honorable. The Jews having tried to keep the Divine 
Law for more than sixteen centuries had reason to 
doubt if anyone could keep it in a way satisfactory to 
God. But the fact that Jesus did keep the Law perfectly, 
and that God was satisfied with His keeping of it, made 
the Law honorable— proved that it was not an unreasonable 
requirement— not beyond the ability of a perfect man. 

Jesus showed the spirit or deeper meaning of several 
of the commandments; for instance, the command, Thou 
shalt do no murder, He indicated would be violated by anyone's 
becoming angry and manifesting in any degree 
an injurious or murderous spirit. (See also I John 3:15.) 
The commandment respecting adultery our Lord declares 
could be violated by the mind without any overt act— the 
simple desire to commit adultery if an opportunity offered 
would be a violation of the spirit of that command. It is 
this magnified conception of the Ten Commandments that 
the Apostle says Christians are better able to appreciate 
than were the Jews, because of having received the begetting 
of the Holy Spirit. And it is this highest conception 
of the Divine Law which is fulfilled in us (Christians 



—footstep followers of Jesus) who are walking through 
life, not according to the flesh and its desires and promptings, 
but according to the spirit— the spirit of the Divine 
Law, the spirit which the Father hath sent forth into our 
hearts— the desire to be like Him who is the Fountain of 
Love and Purity. 

THE SPIRIT OF THE SABBATH 

And there is another or deeper meaning to the other 
commandments than was understood by the Jews; so it is 
also with the Fourth, which enjoins the keeping of the 
Seventh Day as a day of rest or Sabbath. The word Sabbath 
signifies rest, and its deeper or antitypical meaning 
to the Christian is the rest of faith. The Jew, unable to 
keep the Mosaic Law and unable, therefore, to get everlasting 
life under the Law Covenant, was exhorted to flee 
to Christ; and, by becoming dead to the Law Covenant, 
by utterly renouncing it, he was privileged to come into 
membership in Christ— become sharer in the Covenant of 
sacrifice. So doing, he was promised rest from the Law 
and its condemnation, because "to them that are in Christ 
there is no condemnation"— the merit of Christ covers the 
shortcomings of all those who are striving to walk in His 
steps, and the Divine Spirit and Word give them the assurances 
of Divine favor, which ushers them into peace 
with God through our Lord Jesus Christ— ushers them 
into rest. Thus the Apostle declares, "We which believe 
do enter into (Sabbath) rest."— Hebrews 4:3. 

Moreover, the Apostle indicates that although we enter 
into a rest of faith now, through faith and obedience to 

R5028 : page 163 

Christ, Christians have a still greater rest awaiting them 
beyond their resurrection, when they shall enter into the 
rest which is in reservation for those that love the Lord- 
trie rest, the perfection, on the spirit plane, attained, as 
the Apostle describes, by resurrection— "sown in weakness, 
raised in power; sown in dishonor, raised in glory; 
sown an animal body, raised a spirit body." 

FIFTIETH DAY AND FIFTIETH YEAR 

Here we are reminded that Israel had two systems of 
Sabbaths— one of Sabbath Days and the other of Sabbath 
Years. The Sabbath Days began to count in the Spring. 
It was a multiple of seven. Seven times seven days 
(forty-nine days) brought them to the Jubilee day, the 
fiftieth day, which was styled Pentecost. It is scarcely 
necessary to call attention to the fulfilment of the antitype 
of this. Pentecost never had its true meaning until the 
Lord, as "the First-fruits of them that slept," arose from 
the dead. Then immediately the seven times seven, plus 
one, began to count, and on the fiftieth day the Holy 
Spirit was shed abroad upon all those "Israelites indeed" 



who, already consecrated, were waiting in the upper room 

for the antitypical High Priest to make satisfaction for 

their sins and to shed forth upon them the Holy Spirit, 

as the evidence of their restoration to Divine favor. Immediately 

they had peace with God. Immediately they 

entered into rest. Immediately they realized that they 

were children of God, begotten of the Holy Spirit, that 

they might in due time become joint-heirs with Jesus 

Christ their Lord. And is it not true that all down 

throughout this Gospel Age all who follow in the footsteps 

of Jesus and the disciples, all who renounce sin, 

trust in Jesus and fully consecrate their lives to Him, become 

recipients of the Holy Spirit and similarly enter into 

His rest? Only those who have entered into this rest and 

joy of the Holy Spirit can fully appreciate the matter. 

Now let us glance at the year Sabbath. Every seventh 
year the land had its rest. And seven times seven (forty-nine) 
brought them up to the fiftieth year or the Year of 
Jubilee, in which year all debts were cancelled and each 
Israelite returned to his own inheritance. It was a Year 
of rest, peace, joy. That Jubilee pictures the glorious 
Restitution Times of Messiah's Kingdom, which, we 
believe, are nigh, even at the door. When these times 
shall be ushered in, all the faithful followers of Jesus will 
have reached the heavenly condition, to be forever with 
the Lord. Their rest (Sabbath keeping) will have reached 
its completion, its perfection, and throughout that antitypical 
Jubilee the blessings of Divine favor will be gradually 
extended to the whole world, that every creature 
desirous of coming into harmony with God may enter into 
the rest which God has provided for the poor, groaning 
creation through the great Redeemer. 

THE CHRISTIAN'S SUNDAY SABBATH 

From what we have already seen it is manifest that 
God has put no Sabbath obligations upon the Christian— 
neither for the seventh day nor for any other day of the 
week. He has, however, provided for him a rest in the 
Lord, which is typified by the Jewish Sabbath Day. Do 
we ask upon which day we should celebrate this rest? 
We answer that we should be in this heart attitude of joy, 
rest, peace in the Lord and in His finished work, every 
day. So, then, the Christian, instead of having a Sabbath 
rest day, as the Jew, has rest perpetual— every day. And 
instead of its being merely a rest for his body, it is better 
—a rest for his soul, a rest for his entire being. It can be 
enjoyed wherever he may be, "at home or abroad, on the 
land or the sea," for "as his days may demand, shall his 
rest ever be." This is the spiritual antitype to the spiritual 
Israelite, of the Law Sabbath given to the natural 
Israelites. Whoever quibbles for the day Sabbath of the 
Jew shows clearly that he has not understood nor appreciated 
as yet, to the full at least, the antitypical Sabbath 
which God has provided for the spiritual Israel through 
Christ. 



But is there not a compulsion to the Christian to observe 
one day in the week sacred to the Lord? Yes, we 
answer; there is an obligation upon him such as there is 
upon no one else in the world. He is obligated by his 
Covenant to the Lord to keep every day sacred to the 
Lord. Every day he is to love the Lord his God with all 
his heart, with all his mind, with all his being, with all 
his strength; every day he is to love his neighbor as himself. 
And while striving to the best of his ability to conform 
to this spirit of the Divine Law, and while realizing 
that the blood of Jesus Christ our Redeemer cleanses us 

R5028 : page 164 

from all the imperfections contrary to our intentions— 
these may rest in the peace and joy of the Lord continually. 
"We which believe do enter into rest." 

There is no day of the week commanded to the spiritual 
Israelite as respects physical or mental rest— the latter 
they may have always, and the former may be ordered by 
human regulations for one day or for another. The 
Christian is commanded to be subject to the laws that be, 
in all such matters as are non-essential, not matters of 
conscience. 

THE RIGHT USE OF LIBERTY 

Let us remember, however, that our liberty in Christ 
is the liberty from the weight and condemnation of sin 
and death. Let us not think specially of a liberty from the 
Jewish restraints of the Seventh Day nor think especially 
of the fact that no day above another has been commanded 
upon Christians in the Bible. Let us rather consider this 
liberty as of minor consequence and importance as compared 
with our liberation from the power of sin and death. 

If one day or another be set apart by human lawgivers, 
let us observe their commands. Let us be subject 
to every ordinance of men. In Christian lands generally 
the first day of the week is set apart by law. Shall we 
ignore this law and claim that God has put no such law 
upon us and that we should have our liberty to do business, 
etc.? Nay, verily; rather, on the other hand, let us 
rejoice that there is a law which sets apart one day in 
seven for rest from business, etc. Let us use that day 
as wisely and as well as we are able for our spiritual upbuilding 
and for assistance to others. What a blessing we 
have in this provision! How convenient it makes it for 
us to assemble ourselves together for worship, praise, the 
study of the Divine Word! And if earthly laws provided 
more than one Sabbath (rest) day in the week we might 
well rejoice in that also, for it would afford us that much 
more opportunity for spiritual refreshment and 
fellowship. 

Nor should our knowledge of the liberty we enjoy in 
Christ ever be used in such a manner that it might stumble 
others. Our observance of the Sabbath enjoined by the 



law of the land should be most complete— to the very 
letter— that our good be not evil spoken of— that our 
liberty in Christ and freedom from the Mosaic Law be 
not misunderstood to be a business or pleasure license, but 
a privilege and opportunity for the worship and service 
of the Lord, and the building up of the brethren in the 
most holy faith, "once delivered to the saints." 

WHO CHANGED THE SABBATH DAY? 

Often the question is asked, Who changed the Sabbath 
Day to Sunday? The proper answer is that nobody 
changed it. The seventh day (Saturday) is still as obligatory 
upon the Jew as it ever was. 

The early Christians observed the seventh day for a 
long time because it was the law of the land, which gave 
them a favorable opportunity for meeting for praise, 
prayer and the study of God's word. In addition, the 
fact that Jesus arose from the dead on the first day of 
the week, and that He met with them on that day, led 
them to meet again and again on the first day, in hope 
that He would again appear; thus gradually it became 
a custom for them to meet on that day for Christian fellowship. 
In this way, so far as we know, both the first 
day and the seventh day of the week were observed by 
Christians for quite a time, but neither was understood 
to be obligatory— a bondage. Both days were privileges. 
And as many other days of the week as circumstances 
would permit were used in praising God and building one 
another up in the most holy faith, just as God's people 
are doing, or should be doing, in this, our day. 

Are we told that a pope once designated that the first 
day of the week should be observed by Christians as the 
Christian Sabbath? We answer that this may be so, but 
that neither popes nor any beings, not even the Apostles, 
could have right to add to or to take from the Word of 
God. St. Paul particularly warned the Church against 
coming into bondage to the Jewish customs of observing 
new moons and Sabbaths as though these were obligations 
upon Christians. The Son of God has made us free- 
free indeed. But our freedom from the Law Covenant 
of Israel enables us the more and the better to observe the 
very spirit of the Divine Law daily, hourly, and to present 
our bodies living sacrifices, holy and acceptable to God 
through the merit of our Redeemer.

A FAITH FOUNDATION NECESSARY 

-JUNE 9. -LUKE 6:39-49.- 

"Be ye doers of the Word and not hearers 
only, deceiving your own selves."— Jas. 1:22. 



THE GREAT TEACHER in today's lesson 

emphasizes the necessity of knowledge and 

of a faith built thereupon. The blind 

leading the blind represent the ignorant 

leading the ignorant into difficulties, into 

the ditch. In the mental blindness of the 

past many Christians assumed that the 

Master here taught that the blind leaders 

and the blind followers of our day would 

all fall into the pit of eternal torment, but 

not so. The thought is that they will stumble and experience 

injury instead of reaching the desired destination. 

The destination sought by the Jews was fellowship 
with and relationship to God— His highest favor, mentioned 
to Abraham, saying, "In thy Seed shall all the 
families of the earth be blessed." St. Paul says of that 
promise, "Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh, 
but the election hath obtained it and the rest were 
blinded." (Rom. 1 1:7.) The entire Jewish race was 
blinded and turned aside and fell into the pit— into confusion, 
darkness, separation from God. This was the 
very matter against which Jesus forewarned them. They 
were following the lead of the Scribes and Pharisees and 
Doctors of the Law, all of whom were blind leaders who 
misled their too trusting followers. The disciple or follower 
will not fare better than his master or leader or 
teacher; he cannot hope for better results than his 
leader. 

How important, then, that God's people recognize the 
true Leader, Jesus, that they hear His voice, and heed 
not the voice of others. In the present, in the ending of 
this Gospel Age, we have a condition of things very similar 
to that which obtained in the end of the Jewish Age. 
We have many great, learned and wise men in all the 
denominations of Christendom, as the Jews had in Jesus' 
day in all their different sects. It is equally important 
that we take heed that we do not follow blind leaders 
today— in fact, it is much more important. Why should 
we follow any of the creeds when now we have the Word 
of God in such convenient form and when all are able to 

R5029 : page 165 

read it? Who cannot rejoice that recently the 
Pope issued instructions that the Roman Catholic bishops 
should encourage Catholics to study the Bible? How it 
would rejoice us to find the Protestant leaders similarly 
urging the Word of God upon their peoples! 

Alas! on the contrary, we find that many of the great 
and wise of the principal pulpits of the world are undermining 
the faith of the people by telling them that the 
Bible is not Divinely inspired, that Moses and the 
Prophets did not write the books ascribed to them, and 
hence indirectly saying that Jesus and the Apostles were 
deceived when they made quotations from the Old Testament 



and ascribed them to Isaiah, Jeremiah, Moses, 

Habakkuk, etc. These great men style themselves 

Higher Critics and endorse the theory of Evolution, that 

humanity is undergoing a process of evolution from 

monkey-likeness up to God-likeness. They are thus indirectly 

telling their people that there was no fall from 

God's image and likeness, that there was no sin committed, 

no sentence for sin, no Redeemer from sin and its 

sentence and that restitution is not to be hoped for nor 

to be desired.-Acts 3:19-21. 

Surely the Great Teacher's advice not to follow blind 
leaders was never more needed than in our day. Blessed 
will they be who heed the warning, and by it will be 
guided back to a more thorough study of the words of 
the Great Teacher, His Apostles and the Prophets. 

HUMILITY A CHARACTER FOUNDATION 

The parable of a man with a beam in his own eye 
trying to pick a mote out of his brother's eye was a 
forceful method whereby the Master inculcated the necessity 
of humility on the part of those who would be 
taught of God. Humility is here as elsewhere put as a 
foundation virtue. The Latin word for humility is 
humus, ground. This implies that it is the soil out of 
which other virtues are produced. Those who think 
they know everything can learn nothing. As Chalmers 
has said: "The more a man does examine, the more does 
he discover the infirmities of his own character." As 
Wheatley remarked, "Ten thousand of the greatest faults 
in our neighbors are of less consequence to us than one 
of the smallest in ourselves." A knowledge of our sins 
and imperfections should make and keep all humanity 
humble; but how beautiful it is to realize that the perfect 
Jesus was humble and that all the holy angels are so! 

GRAPES OFF A BRAMBLE BUSH 

While the Scriptures forbid God's people to judge one 
another, they do commend to us another kind of judging. 
We are not to judge in the sense of condemning, 
sentencing, etc., those who claim to be honest, sincere, 
reverential, merely because they differ from what we 
would expect; God knows their hearts and to his own 
Master each servant must stand or fall eventually. 

But while not condemning the heart we are to judge 
of the outward conduct. The parable which our Lord in 
this lesson gives respecting the gathering of grapes from 
bramble bushes illustrates this point. God's people are 
likened to the grape-vine, which produces no thorns but 
luscious clusters of fruit. Mankind in general are likened 
to bramble bushes, ready to scratch, tear, injure, on the 
slightest provocation, and are merely self-sustaining, not 
bringing forth fruitage that would be a blessing to others. 
We are to distinguish between such characters and God's 
people: "By their fruits shall ye know them." 



It is said that at times a bramble bush will be entirely 
covered by a vine, so that the grapes would appear 
to be coming from the bush. We are not to be mistaken. 
A good tree cannot bring forth an evil fruitage, neither 
can an injurious tree bring forth a good fruitage. The 
lesson, applied to humanity, is that those who are really 
God's people cannot live injurious lives or fruitless lives; 
they must be fruit-bearing else they are none of His. 
And should we find some of the fruits of the spirit commingling 
with a thorniness of life, an evil, injurious disposition, 
we are to assume that in some sense of the word 
the fruitage is merely put on and does not belong to the 
bramble-bush character. 

It is therefore useless for any man to tell us that he 
has given his heart to the Lord in fulness of consecration 
and that he has received the sanctifying influences 
of the Holy Spirit and yet find him rejoicing in sin, taking 
pleasure in iniquity, injustice, selfishness and a 
course of life injurious to his neighbors. If his heart be 
changed the results will be manifest in his daily life, because 
"out of the abundance of the heart the mouth 
speaketh." 

THE HOUSE ON THE ROCK 

The closing parable of this lesson is in full tune with 
its opening verse. In the first parable the blind who 
trust to the leadership of the blind fall into the ditch. 
In the parable now before us the picture is that of a 
householder. If he be wise he will not build upon the 
shifting sands, which either a wind storm or a rain storm 
may undermine, and cause a wreck, but he will seek a 
solid, rock foundation which will endure the storm. 

This parable illustrates two classes of believers. Both 
hear the Great Teacher's instructions and both believe 
and both rear faith structures and entertain heavenly 
hopes. But the one is more prudent, more careful than 
the other. One seeks for the doctrines and principles of 
the Divine Word, and builds his faith structure upon 
that true foundation which the Divine Revelation affords. 
His faith cannot fail whatever storms may assail; 
it is surely founded on the Divine promises. 

The unwise believer takes too much for granted and 
builds upon the traditions of the elders, the creeds of the 
Dark Ages, etc. He fails to appreciate the necessity for 
having a proper foundation for his faith and his works. 
In the time of stress and storm with which this Age will 
end all such will find the foundation swept from under 
their faith structure. There will be a general fall of 
Babylon, as the Scriptures declare— everything not well 
founded upon the sure Word of God will give way; "That 
day shall declare it." St. Paul mentions the same class 
and applies the lesson specially to our day in his letter 
to the Corinthians. Those whose faith structure will fail 
will thereby suffer great loss, though they themselves may 
be saved as by fire— through great tribulation.— 



I Cor. 3:13-15. 
R5028 : page 165 

DEEDS, NOT WORDS 

"They do the least 
Who talk the most, 

Whose good designs, 
Are all their boast; 
Let words be few. 

"They do the most 
Whose lives possess 

The sterling stamp 
Of righteousness; 
For deeds are true." 



R5030 : page 166 

"LEAST IN THE KINGDOM" 

--MATTHEW 11:2-19.-JUNE 16.- 

"Amongst them that are born of women there is none greater 
than John; yet the least in the Kingdom of God is 
greater than he."— Luke 7:28. 

IT WOULD BE difficult to express in words 

a higher tribute to John the Baptist than 

Jesus paid him in our text. Again He said, 

"There hath not risen a greater Prophet 

than John the Baptist." If then John was 

so holy a man, so great a man from the 

Divine standpoint, why did our Lord in this 

text declare that the least in the Kingdom 

of Heaven would be greater than John? 

This text has puzzled Bible exponents for 

many a day. It has seemed to many to be contradictory. 

But just as soon as we turn on the light contained in 
that word "Kingdom," the entire subject becomes clear. 
God had promised a Messianic Kingdom, and Jesus had 
come that He might be the Head of that Kingdom. The 
steps leading to the Kingdom honors and glories were 
steps of obedience to God, even unto death, and these 
steps Jesus had begun to take. On the cross He declared, 
"It is finished." He had finished the work of proving 
Himself loyal to God and to the Truth even unto death 
on the cross. 

Jesus thus became the Great Conqueror, the great High 
Priest, the great King of Glory, being exalted to the 
Heavenly state in His resurrection. But, as the Great 
King, He was to have associated with Him in His Throne, 
His Bride class. As the Great Priest, He was to have an 



under-priesthood, a "Royal Priesthood." As the Great 
Judge of the world, He was to have associates; as St. Paul 
declares, "Know ye not that the saints shall judge the 
world?"-I Cor. 6:2. 

In the Divine Plan this company of associates with 
Jesus in His glorious Kingdom were as much foreknown 
and foreordained as was He and His share in the Kingdom. 
As it was necessary for Him to undergo trials and 
testings of loyalty unto death, so it must be with the class 
called to be His associates— "He was tempted in all points 
like as we are." Thus His Message is, "To him that overcometh 
will I grant to sit with Me in My Throne, even as 
I overcame and am set down with My Father in His 
Throne." These would be followers in His footsteps, 
none could precede Him. His work was necessary first, 
to open up for His followers a new and living way, 
through the veil— that is to say, through His flesh- 
through His sacrifice. 

"SOME BETTER THING FOR US" 

While about five hundred brethren became Jesus' 
consecrated followers during His earthly ministry, they 
were not then accepted of the Father as sons, and not 
begotten of the Holy Spirit until Pentecost. God would 
not recognize any as sons until Jesus had finished His 
sacrifice, and, as the great Advocate, "Appeared in the 
presence of God for us"— as our Advocate with the 
Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous. John did not belong 
to this class, just as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and all the 
Prophets did not belong to it. In God's providence their 
reward will be different from that of the Church— theirs 
will be an earthly reward. They will be resurrected to 
human perfection. They will have to do with the human 
phase of the Kingdom, which amongst men will represent 
Messiah and the Church, who will be spirit beings, but 
invisible to men, and whose dealings with mankind will 
be through those noble characters, the Ancient Worthies. 

We are not to infer that those glorious characters mentioned 
in the Scriptures who lived before Christ's time 
were ignoble or less faithful than the Gospel Church, but 
merely that God promised them the earthly perfection, 
while He has promised the Bride of Christ the heavenly 
perfection. They will not, like the remainder of mankind, 
come forth to imperfection, to attain perfection gradually 
during the thousand years of Messiah's reign; the record 
is that they will come forth as perfect human beings. 
That will be the reward of their faithfulness. St. Paul 
explains the entire matter in Hebrews, the 1 1th chapter. 
He tells of the faith and heroism of those Ancient 
Worthies and that "they had this testimony, that they 
pleased God." There will be no necessity for testing them 
in the future. Their acceptance with God is already 
proven and declared. 

Nevertheless, in God's order the earthly Kingdom and 
restitution blessings for the world cannot begin until the 



Kingdom class, Christ and the Church, shall first be completed. 

Thus the Apostle declares, "All these died in faith, 

not having received the (earthly) things promised to 

them, God having provided some better thing for us (the 

Church), that they, without us, should not be made perfect." 

The glorification of the Church, her resurrection 

to perfection, must first be accomplished before the blessings 

through them can proceed to the natural seed of 

Abraham, and then through Israel to all nations.— 

Heb. 11:38-40. 

NOT THE BRIDE BUT THE FRIEND 

John the Baptist seemed to either comprehend the 
situation, or else he spoke the truth by prophecy when he 
declared, "He that hath the Bride is the Bridegroom, but 
the friend of the Bridegroom, hearing His voice, rejoiceth 
greatly. This my joy therefore is fulfilled." He perceived 
that in God's providence he had a very honorable 
and blessed station and work to accomplish, but he was 
to be neither the Bridegroom nor a member of the Bride 
class. 

This does not imply that John was disappointed at the 
time, nor that he and the other Ancient Worthies will be 
disappointed when they come forth in the resurrection 
to find a Bride class selected to a higher place than theirs. 
On the contrary, their cup of blessing being full, and 
never having been begotten of the Holy Spirit to a spirit 
nature, they will not be able to comprehend or appreciate 
any blessings higher than their own. Just, for instance, 
as a fish in the water, seeing a bird flying in the air, would 
not be jealous of the bird and its greater freedom, but, 
on the contrary, would be better satisfied in the water, 
its natural element, so all natural men, not begotten of 
the Holy Spirit, will appreciate more the earthly blessings 
which Divine providence has provided for them. 

In this very lesson Jesus intimates all the above, saying, 
"The Law and the Prophets were until John." He 
was the last of the Prophets. He introduced Jesus, the 
Head of the Kingdom class. Jesus further declared, "If 
ye are willing to receive it, this is Elias which was to 
come." That is to say, Those of you who are able to 
appreciate the matter may understand that John the 
Baptist did a work which was in full accord with the 
prophecy which declared that Elijah must first come and 
do a reformatory work before Messiah would come. 

CURIOSITY IS NOT RELIGION 

Addressing the multitudes the Great Teacher inquired, 
Why did you go out to the wilderness to see John? Was 

R5031 :page 167 

it to hear his message? Was it because God spoke 
through him as a Prophet as the wind makes music 



through the reeds? Or did you go out to see a man in 
fine clothing and of kingly state? 

What really drew to the wilderness to John's teaching 
was that he was God's Prophet; as it is written, "Behold, 
I send My messenger before Thy face, who shall 
prepare the way before Thee." This preparation for 
Jesus John made with the Jewish nation. His message 
was that the Kingdom of Heaven was about to be offered 
to them, and that only the holy would be ready to receive 
it. 

But neither John nor his hearers fully realized in what 
way the Kingdom would be offered to the people, namely, 
that it would be an offer, first, of a place or share in the 
Kingdom, and that the terms would be full consecration 
to the Lord, to walk "the narrow way." Jesus again 
testified, "If ye had received John ye would have received 
Me." 

In other words, all who received John's message were 
such as were in heart condition to receive Jesus; and 
the same spirit of indifference which permitted Herod to 
imprison John and to finally behead him marked the Jewish 
leaders and their unbelief. John as a Prophet was 
abstemious to the extreme, and they said, "He hath a 
devil." Jesus presented Himself less peculiarly, eating 
and drinking and being clothed as other people, and of 
Him they said, "Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, 
a friend of publicans and sinners." Thus was it 
demonstrated that the fault was not in the manifestation 
of God's providence, but in the hearts of the majority 
of the Jews.

AND SHE WAS A SINNER 

--LUKE 7:36-50. -JUNE 23.- 

"Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, 
that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners." 
-1 Timothy 1:15. 

THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST is the Message 

of Divine compassion toward sinners. All 

religions recognize sin and propose reconciliation 

with God— by works of charity, by 

voluntary self-torture, or by future torments. 

None of the heathen gods have 

any touch of sympathy for humanity; they 

are cold, cruel, vindictive. The Bible, of 

all the religious books we know of, alone 

tells of a God touched with the feeling of 

human infirmities and with sympathy toward sinners. 

"God commendeth His love toward us in that while we 

were yet sinners Christ died for the ungodly."— Rom. 5:8 



Note the expressions of the Scriptures indicating 
Divine compassion: "God looked down from His Holy 
Habitation to behold and to hear the groaning of the 
prisoners"— the suffering of humanity under the death 
penalty, and the incidental aches and pains of our fallen 
condition. He did more than look, He did more than pity; 
His right Arm of divine power in due time began to bring 
deliverance for the captives of sin and death. Already 
He has sent His Son and thus provided a Ransom price 
for the sins of the whole world. Already His Son has 
been glorified, and merely awaits the time for the establishment 
of His Kingdom. 

Meantime Divine grace has been still further manifested 
in the invitation granted to a "little flock," to be 
justified by faith and to be sanctified by the High Priest's 
offering of them, and thus to become New Creatures, 
joint-heirs in His Kingdom. Still the Scriptures tell us 
of God's pursuing Love and Mercy. He is unwilling that 
any should perish, but wills, on the contrary, that all shall 
have an opportunity to turn to Him that they may have 
everlasting life. It is for this very purpose that Messiah's 
Kingdom will be established in great glory and with full 
power. God's right Arm is not shortened. In due time 
it will bring the salvation for which the poor groaning 
creation has so long waited. It will come with the manifestation 
of the Sons of God in Kingdom power.— 
Rom. 8:19. 

Eventually the Redeemer "shall see of the travail of 
His soul and be satisfied." Eventually the Heavenly 
Father's Plan will be so outworked that every creature in 
heaven and earth and under the earth shall be heard 
saying, "Praise and glory and honor, dominion and might 
be unto Him that sitteth upon the Throne, and unto the 
Lamb, forever." Eventually God, through the Messianic 
Kingdom, "shall wipe away all tears from off all faces," 
and cause the reproach of being His people to disappear 
from the earth. (Rev. 21:4; Isa. 25:8.) So superior is 
this God of the Bible and of Christianity to all the misconceptions 
of heathendom and Christendom that, when 
the glorious Day of Messiah's Kingdom shall have been 
fully ushered in, the glory of our God will be revealed, and 
all flesh shall see it together.— Isa. 40:5. 

A WOMAN WHO WAS A SINNER 

Our Redeemer possessed and exemplified the Heavenly 
Father's love and mercy. He declared that He was 
merely the exponent of the Father's will, and hence of the 
Father's love and sympathy. Our Lord's sympathy is presented 
not only in this lesson but also in many others, and 
all of His followers do well to cultivate the same spirit. 
Jesus was not sympathetic with the sins of the people, but 
with the people themselves. He realized as few do the 
real difficulty with the majority of sinners. "Behold, I 
was shapen in iniquity, in sin did my mother conceive me!" 
exclaimed the Prophet. We are sinners by heredity. We 



have inherited partially depraved minds, partially unbalanced 
brains and morals. 

St. Paul, speaking of the very noblest class, declares, 
"We cannot do the things which we would"— any of us; 
hence all humanity are sinners. "There is none righteous, 
no, not one." Therefore it is merely a question of the 
degree of sinfulness, and the degree is often measured by 
the degree of inherited weakness, or the degree of surrounding 
temptations. The really reprehensible and 
blameworthy sinners are those who sin wilfully, deliberately, 
knowingly, intentionally, without either will or effort 
to resist sin. But it is not ours to judge which these are. 
Indeed, we are incompetent to judge, we cannot read the 
heart, we cannot fully appreciate the degree of the temptation 
and the weakness of the tempted. Hence the Master 
said, "Judge nothing before the time." In due time the 
saints will judge the world, but not now. 

Now we must follow the Master's example; and we 
may well do this because, although He knew what was in 
man, as we could not know, He was very charitable, which 
leads us to suppose that if we were perfect we would be 
all the more charitable towards sinners, though not at all 
sympathetic with sin. 

Who can read the New Testament Gospel narratives 

R5032 : page 168 

without realizing that Jesus was indeed a "Friend of 
sinners," as was charged against Him by the Pharisees? 
And is not this the feature of the Bible which specially 
commends it to humanity? With the exception of the 
wilful sinners, whom we must hope are few, there comes 
a time when sin is seen in its true color and is detested. 
Then is the time when the gospel Message from the 
Friend of sinners specially appeals to such. All seem to 
know instinctively that Jesus stands ready to be the 
Friend and Helper of all who come to the Father through 
Him. 

Jesus had accepted an invitation to dine at a Pharisee's 
house. The dinner had begun. Resting upon one arm 
they used the other for handling the food. After the 
custom of the times, they reclined upon low tables or 
couches, their heads toward the center where the food 
was placed. A curtain separated the dining room from 
the outer court. 

While the dinner was progressing, a woman "who 
was a sinner," a harlot, deeply penitent, entered. She 
had in her hand some precious perfume, with which she 
intended to anoint the Savior's feet, as was sometimes 
done with dignitaries of that time. Her heart was full, 
and tears gushed from her eyes while she sought to open 
the bottle; they fell like rain upon Jesus' feet, evidently 
quite contrary to the woman's intention. She was dishonoring 
the very feet she intended to honor. Loosening 
her hair, she used it as a towel, entirely regardless of the 
fact that for a woman at that time it was considered dishonorable 



to let down her hair in public; but intent upon 
her errand she dried the feet and poured the precious 
perfume upon them, presumably as an honor to the One 
from whom she had heard "wonderful words of life"— 
words of Divine compassion and pity for sinners, words 
of hope for herself. 

TWO DEBTORS AND THEIR LOVE 

The host of the occasion watched Jesus to see how He 
would receive this manifestation of loving devotion, saying 
in his heart, If this Man were a prophet, He would 
know that the woman offering Him this honor is disreputable. 
He would denounce her and bid her, "Begone," and 
not to touch Him. Jesus knew his thoughts and answered 
him in parabolic form, saying, "A certain creditor 
had two debtors, one owed five hundred pence and the 
other fifty. Neither could pay and he forgave them both. 
Which of them will love him most?" The Pharisee replied, 
"I suppose he to whom most was forgiven." Jesus 
agreed with him. 

Then Jesus made application of the matter; turning to 
the woman, He said to His host, Seest thou this woman, 
who washed My feet with her tears and wiped them with 
her hair? You are the host of the occasion, yet you did 
not offer Me water for the washing of My feet, as is 
customary in our land to do to those whom we desire to 
honor. You gave Me no kiss, as is customary amongst 
friends, but this woman has repeatedly kissed My feet. 
"You did not anoint My head with oil, but she hath 
anointed My feet with ointment. Therefore, her sins, 
which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much; but to 
whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little." And He 
said to the woman, "Thy sins are forgiven." 

Is not this to some extent an illustration and an explanation 
of the fact that the majority of those who 
love the Lord most are such as realize their own sinful 
and fallen condition most and who appreciate most the 
forgiving love of God manifested in Jesus? Is it not true 
today also that those who are most moral, and therefore 
might be said to have less to be forgiven, have correspondingly 
less love? 

This should not be the case, however. The less 
degraded ought naturally to be the more able to love and 
to appreciate Divine goodness and love and the more willing 
to present their little all in Divine service. 

R5033 : page 168 

Those present not improperly began to inquire, Who 
is this that even forgives sins? The only satisfactory 
answer is that He is the one He professes to be, the Son 
of God, the Redeemer of the world. He was then in 
process of rendering up His sacrifice according to His 
covenant, and on the strength of that covenant and 
sacrifice He had authority to tell the woman that her sins 



were forgiven, because He was making the Atonement 
which would be applicable to her.

GENERAL CONVENTION JUNE 1-9 
PERTLE SPRINGS, MO. (CHAUTAUQUA GROUNDS). 

THIS CONVENTION has been specially arranged 
for the convenience of Bible students 
within a radius of a thousand miles from 
Kansas City. We have no doubt, however, 
that many will be in attendance from still 
greater distances. The place itself is ideal 
and strictly first-class in every particular. 
It borders a beautiful lake and has free 
access to the health-giving Spring from 
which it takes its name. 

Many will be able to attend this Convention who could 
not conveniently come to one in the East by reason of the 
cost in money and time. Our expectation is that this will 
be one of our most enjoyable Conventions. We never had 

R5030 : page 168 

a better situation as respects conditions surrounding, 
quiet, etc. 

The proprietors of the Chautauqua are also the owners 
of a large hotel there and of rooming flats in Warrensburg. 
They guarantee comfortable accommodations for a 
thousand persons at $1.50 per day. Aside from this we 
are arranging with private householders in Warrensburg 
for as many more at $1.00 each, two in a room. The 
round-trip fare to Pertle Springs daily will make the 
amount $1.10. However, none would best reckon on less 
than $1.25 per day. 

Excursion rates are already in operation, but these are 
being extended so that a fare of not more than four cents 
per mile for the round-trip may be expected to be in operation 
by the time you receive this notice. 

The speakers for the Convention will include some of 
the very best. Brother Rutherford will be Chairman, and 
Brother Russell will be in attendance also. The sessions 
will begin Sunday, June 2, at the Springs, continue there 
throughout the week and adjourn to conclude at Kansas 
City June 9. 

Decide as quickly as possible whether or not you will 
attend this Convention. If you decide to attend, write 
immediately to the Society's representative, N. Engle, 
Warrensburg, Mo., stating what priced accommodations 
you desire and, if you will not be staying the entire time, 
which days you will be in attendance. 

We hope for a grand reunion at Pertle Springs and for 



a season of spiritual refreshment. To this end we exhort 
all who attend to come praying that the Lord will bless 
them, not only in receiving a blessing, but also in dispensing 
one to others. We are sure, as on other occasions, 

R5030 : page 169 

not to go away empty, but to carry with us spiritual blessings 
for the refreshment of those at home not permitted 
to attend. 

HARVESTERS' DAY AT THE CONVENTION 

The program for the Convention includes a "Harvest 
Workers' Day." Noting this, one dear friend who has 
received great spiritual profit through the Colporteur 
service has proffered assistance to all the Colporteurs of 
the Society in attendance to the extent of $5— to all who 
shall have been in the regular Colporteur work for at least 
three months prior to the Convention. We have no doubt 
that this proposal will be helpful to some who might not 
otherwise be able to bear the expense. The money is 
deposited with the Colporteur Department and will be 
credited on the accounts or handed over in money, as may 
best suit the convenience of the receivers.

SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS 
MESSIAH'S KINGDOM WILL BE SPIRITUAL. 

Question.— What is meant by Messiah's Kingdom? 

Answer.— Our understanding is that Messiah's Kingdom 
will be a spiritual one, invisible to mortals, yet all-powerful 
for the accomplishment of the great things promised 
in the Law and the Prophets. The Empire which 
He will establish, invisible to men, will take the place 
of the Empire of Satan, likewise invisible. The King 
of Glory will replace the Prince of Darkness. Principal 
amongst Messiah's earthly agents and representatives will 
be Abraham, Isaac and all the Prophets, raised to full, 
human perfection. Instead of their being, as heretofore, 
the fathers, they shall be the children of Messiah, whom 
He will make "Princes in all the earth." (Psa. 45:16.) 
To this Kingdom the nation of Israel will speedily unite. 
Eventually every nation will come into harmony with 
Messiah, and all people will be privileged to come in under 
Israel's New Covenant, then established by the great 
"Messenger of the Covenant, whom ye delight in."— Jer. 31:31-34; 
Mai. 3:1-3. 

The glorious Messiah, whom the Jews identify with 
"Michael, the great Prince, which standeth for thy people" 
(Dan. 12:1), the Mohammedans also expect, and 



identify Him with Mohammed of the past. The Free 
Masons also expect the same glorious personage and, in 
their traditions, identify Him with Hiram Abiff, the great 
Master Mason. This same great Messiah, Michael, the 
Archangel, the antitypical Melchizedek, Priest as well as 
King, we identify as "the Man Jesus Christ, who gave 
Himself a Ransom-Price for all, to be testified in due 
time."— I Tim. 2:6. 

But when the Great King shall appear in His Glory 
and establish His Kingdom with Israel, He will be, as 
promised by the Prophets, "The desire of all nations." 
(Hag. 2:7.) Then all the blinded eyes shall be opened 
and all the deaf ears shall be unstopped. (Isa. 35:5.) 
Then, who He is, and how He should be identified with 
Abraham's Seed and David's line, will be clearly known 
to all in Heaven and all on earth. Not now, but when 
the King shall reign in righteousness, all shall fully understand 
the significance of Zechariah's prophecy (12:7-10) 
and of Psa. 22: 16. Content that Messiah shall show 
the Truth in His Day of revealment, we are glad to point 
Jews, Mohammedans, Christians, all, to the glorious 
Messiah, and the great work of blessing for all the 
nations, which God will accomplish, through the Seed of 
Abraham, according to His Covenant and His Oath. 



PERFECTION WILL INSURE PROTECTION AGAINST ACCIDENTS. 

Question.— Will there be accidents and death during 
the Millennium aside from those of sinners going into 
the Second Death? 

Answer.— While the reign of Christ will be a reign of 
righteousness unto life, we are not to understand that 
Adamic death will be at an end as soon as Messiah has 
begun His reign, for it is stated that He must reign until 
He has put down all enemies. (I Cor. 15:25,26.) It is 
understood that people will be more or less in the Adamic 
death during the thousand years and will rise gradually 
out of Adamic imperfection and death to the perfection 
of the human nature. We should remember that the Kingdom 
as it will be established in the beginning of the 
Millennial Age will consist of the New Jerusalem— that 
is, the glorified Church, of which Christ is the Head. 
(Rev. 21:1-8.) During the thousand years the world will 
be coming into accord with this arrangement. For all 
such as will come into harmony there will be a blessed 
arrangement by which they will be protected from any 
penalty for imperfections. We may reasonably suppose 
that after perfection is reached there will be no more 
accidents, just as we have reason to suppose that in heaven 
there is no necessity for surgeons, doctors, ambulances, 
etc. "Nothing shall hurt or destroy in all God's holy 
mountain [Kingdom]." (Isa. 11:9.) God's will shall 
be done on earth as it is done in heaven. We read that 
there shall be no more sighing and no more crying and no 



more dying. 



THE FINAL TESTING WILL DETERMINE IT. 

Question.— Will restitution include the right to everlasting 
life, or will the right to everlasting life be determined 
by the final testing that will come at the end of 
the Millennial Age? 

Answer.— Perfection was given to Adam originally; 
and by virtue of his perfection he had a right to continue 
to live, if he were obedient. But as God saw fit to test 
Father Adam, so He will test the human family. And the 
final test, after the Kingdom shall have been turned over 
to the Father, will be by way of testing their worthiness 
to attain these life-rights and to keep them everlastingly. 
The thousand years of Christ's reign will be for bringing 
mankind to perfection. At the end of that reign those who 
have reached perfection will be delivered over to the 
Father. The New Covenant will have accomplished for 
them all that it was intended to accomplish. But before 
God determines them worthy of the fulness of His everlasting 
life, He will see that all are tried individually and 
without any Mediator between. We may be sure that the 
test will be a crucial and a just one. 



APPLICABLE TO TWO CLASSES. 

Question.— To whom is the Apostle speaking when he 
says, "I beseech you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to 
present your bodies living sacrifices"?— Rom. 12:1. 

Answer.— These words are properly applicable to two 
classes. First, they apply to a class termed "brethren," in 
the sense that they are no longer opponents, but sympathetically 
in harmony with the consecrated. The Apostle was 
urging these to complete the work of grace which they 
had already begun. Secondly, the text applies to those 
who have made the consecration, and urges them to complete 
the work. I urge you, brethren, that day by day you 
attend to this matter of presenting your bodies living sacrifices 

R5031 :page 170 

until the work be accomplished. This, he says, is a 
reasonable service, acceptable to God. 

Although St. Paul does not say how the great Advocate 
will make the sacrifice acceptable, yet this is to be 
understood by Christians, who know that they are accepted 
in the Beloved. After that class have given up their lives, 
after they have put all in the Lord's hands, they understand 
that they, themselves, as members of the Body of 
Christ, are to die daily. Hence it is that daily an opportunity 
comes to us to lay down life in the Lord's service. 



While this is a daily dying, yet, in another sense of the 
word, it is a sacrifice to the end of life. Our Lord Jesus 
said, "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I 
straitened until it be accomplished!" (Luke 12:50.) In 
one sense, His sacrifice was accepted at Jordan. In another 
sense it was day by day until that baptism was completed 
on the cross and He cried, "It is finished!" 



MAY HAVE TWO APPLICATIONS. 

Question.— "For, behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, 
doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the 
stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole 
stay of water." (Isaiah 3:1.) What does this mean? 

Answer.— There was a famine which came upon Judea. 
The people did not have enough to eat or to drink. They 
are still in very much the condition of Ishmael at the 
time when Hagar laid him down to die. During the 
Gospel Age the poor Jews have been famishing. They 
have been without any communication whatever with God. 

The same Prophet, from whose inspired writings the 
above text is taken, tells us of another class whose "bread 
shall be given them, whose water shall be sure." (Isa. 33:16.) 
They will be well cared for, well protected, and 
will have both bread and water. This text may have 
applied to the Jews at the time of the destruction of 
Jerusalem and may apply to any Jews and others who, 
since that time, have put their trust in the Lord and to 

R5032 : page 170 

whom He has supplied what was needed for the 
strengthening of their lives. As we look about us today 
we find many of nominal Israel hungry, thirsty. They 
endeavor to make themselves think that they are well fed; 
and the majority of them do not realize that they are poor 
and naked and unfed and blind. In the meantime the 
Church of Christ is in the protected place. Everything is 
working together for good to them. Their bread and 
water is sure. "No good thing will He withhold from 
them that walk uprightly"; "the meek will He guide in 
judgment; the meek will He teach His way."

SOME INTERESTING LETTERS 

DEAR FRIENDS :- 

Your recent favor came duly to hand and I lack words 
to express my appreciation. I can only say that I sincerely 
thank you and think the bookmark both beautiful and helpful. 

A sense of my own unworthiness, my semi-invalid, 



"shut-in" condition and other adverse circumstances have 
caused my hesitation in taking the Vow; but I have finally 
decided to take it, trusting the grace of Christ to enable me 
to keep it faithfully. 

As I read these wonderful STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES 
my heart is filled with praise to our Heavenly Father and 
our Lord Jesus that such loving-kindness has been shown 
me in the gift of these marvelous treasures of the Divine 
Revelation, so enlightening my mind by the Spirit of Truth 
that I am able to understand and appreciate the Scriptures. 

To believe the wonderful truths unfolded to us through 
STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES separates one from kindred, 
friends and even "Christian" companions; they think one 
more dangerous than an infidel. To believe MILLENNIAL 
DAWN teachings is to be ostracized by the nominal church. 
But Christ welcomes those who are cast out for His Truth's 
sake! 

I have been prayerfully re-reading the STUDIES and have 
just taken up Vol. V., in which I find so much to study out. 
I find, now and then, little ways in which I can give my 
testimony to those being ensnared by Evolution, etc.; it is my 
greatest joy and comfort to be able to offer this small service. 

Earnestly praying for all the brethren and sisters who are 
laboring for the Master. 

Yours in The Faith, 

(MRS.) MARY CHAFFEE.-R.I. 



DEAR FRIENDS :- 

For the benefit of any whom you might know to be afflicted 
with cancer, I have much pleasure in informing you that recently 
a dear friend of mine was cured of cancer. The agency 
in this case was radium; and the process was painless. I also 
know of another instance of a very much worse case being 
entirely cured. 

Is not this another instance of the bringing to us of restitution 
blessings by the Lord? 

Your sister in Christ, 

MRS. J. P. ALLGOOD (M.D.).-Ala. 



DEAR BRETHREN:- 

I recently received Vols. IV. and VI., STUDIES IN THE 
SCRIPTURES, and am reading them with great joy. I now 
have five volumes, and am highly pleased with all. 

For some time I have been looking for God's people on 
earth, according to the Scriptures, but until now have failed 
to find them. Though a member of the Methodist Church, I 
could not find them there, as I understand their description in 
the Bible, and my own desire for their companionship. 

I extend my hand to you in joyous welcome, and greet 
you with love. I shall offer as much support, financially and 
otherwise, as lieth in me, and desire to secure further literature 
from you as soon as money matters permit. 



There is great joy in the prayer of our Lord: "Thy 
Kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as in heaven!" 

I ask your prayers for me and my household, assuring you 
of mine. 

I remain your friend and brother, CHRIS. ACHERSOLD.-Ark. 



BELOVED PASTOR AND BROTHER:- 

When the Vow came, I was new in the Truth, and it was 
not received by me as "meat in due season." 

In asking advice of the brethren older in the Truth, I 
was cautioned to wait, and to weigh all these things, which 
I foolishly did, instead of taking the matter seriously to the 
Lord and asking guidance of Him. 

But I did tell the Father that I would not let it interfere 
with my study of His wonderful Plan, nor with my fellowship 
with His earnest workers, and that I would wait upon 
Him till He should show me the way. 

He surely took me at my word, for it was nearly two 
years later that the eyes of my understanding were opened 
so that I realized how much I had lost in not taking this 
precious Vow sooner! 

Then it was that I and my two dear younger brothers, who 
with me symbolized their consecration, and have grown up 
with me in the Truth, and whose letters accompany this, took 
the matter up seriously and called upon our dear Brother 
Sherman. He so clearly showed us the way that at that time 
we made the Vow our own before the Lord, and have since 
been wonderfully blessed. 

We did not, until now, realize that we had not done our 
part by you in acknowledging its acceptance; but we do so 
at this time, hoping that sending our names may bring the 
greater encouragement to you. 

Our earnest prayer is that you may be kept most precious 
in the Father's sight! May God bless you, dear brother! 

Yours in the one Hope, W. D. CHAPIN-Calif. 



BELOVED BROTHER IN CHRIST:- 

I have been negligent of my duty and privilege of sending 
in my name as one who has taken the Vow. 

Since taking it I have received so many rich blessings that 
my appreciation and love of it are greatly increased. It helps 
me each day in the Christian warfare, reminding me of my 

page 171 

consecration and of my weakness and dependence upon the 
Lord for the promised grace to help in every time of need. 
It has brought very near to me the remembrance that all 
the Lord's dear Harvest laborers are praying for me because 
of our common membership in the Body of Christ! It forcibly 
brings to mind the need to watch and pray lest I "become 
a castaway," and thus helped I have been enabled to overcome, 



but know that I fall far short of my high aim. 

Being quite young and in contact with the world, this 
precious Vow has helped me to keep myself pure— "unspotted 
from the world." Sometimes heart-sick and discouraged, 
then come the sweet words: 

"As thy days so shall thy strength be"; "I will never forsake 
thee"— the promised grace to help! "Praise ye the Lord 
for all His benefits ! " 

Praying for your highest spiritual welfare, I remain 

Your brother and fellow-servant in the Lord, 
K. E. THOMPSON.-Calif. 



OUR DEAR BROTHER:- 

Your kind letter of Christmas and New Year greeting 
with enclosures, just received and much appreciated. We join 
in most hearty reciprocation of these good wishes. May the 
dear Lord abundantly bless and continue to use you in His 
glorious work. We will prize very highly the book-mark with 
your picture and the beautiful poem and Vow-cards. We 
also thank you for the book of poems. 

Indeed, our hearts fill to overflowing with gratitude to our 
dear Heavenly Father as we learn more and more of His 
wonderful "Truth" and each day realize more fully what 
blessed privileges we are enjoying at the present time. We 
greatly appreciate, too, your kind assurances that you have 
our interest at heart. However, we already felt this to be 
the case. 

We note your remarks in your letter that 1912 will doubtless 
be the most momentous year of the harvest in many respects. 
This awakens in us fresh zeal and more earnest prayer 
that we may all be able to stand in the evil hour and prove 
faithful unto the end. 

Praying the Lord's richest blessings upon you in your 
tour, and that He may "keep you under the shadow of His 
wings," we are, with Christian love, 

Your sisters in His name, M. B. CLEVELAND, 

P. B. CLEVELAND.

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

I have just finished reading your sermon in the Manila 
Times, and it has given me much peace and happiness. I want 
to learn more of the Bible, but find it obscure so much of 
the time. In the past I can truthfully say it has been a sealed 
book to me. But from now on I am going to diligently search 
the Scriptures for Truth and spiritual guidance. 

Any reading matter you can send me to help me toward 
enlightenment will be most gratefully received. If you will 
tell me where to secure all of your writings on the Bible I 
shall gladly send the required amount to get them. 

We will leave here in June for San Francisco, Cal., where 



we expect to remain nine or ten months. While there I desire 
greatly to take up the systematic study of the Bible. Could 
you recommend to me some school (or person) there under 
which I could place myself as a Bible student? 

May God bless abundantly your great work is my prayer. 

Faithfully yours, MRS. J. DUCKWORTH-FORD. --Philippines. 



DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

You will be interested to know a little circumstance which 
illustrates how the HEAVENLY MANNA can be used of the 
Lord to draw attention to the Truth. 

A brother and sister staying at a strange house left their 
MANNA on the dresser during the day, so that it might be 
seen. The help looked at it and liked it very much. This 
led to the sale of several first volumes and the arousing of 
considerable interest in the Truth. 

Lovingly your brother, WALTER H. BUNDY. 



DEAR BROTHER:- 

If you will pardon me for taking a little of your valuable 
time I would be pleased if you will answer the following 
question:— 

In DAWN, Vol. 1, page 232, par. 1, we read as follows: "Our 
sins He consented to have imputed to Him, that He might bear 
our penalty for us, and He died on our behalf, as though He 
were the sinner." In Vol. 5, page 109, line 23, we also read: 
"Not imputed to them, but imputed to Him, who bore our 
sins in His body on the tree." In Vol. 5, page 444, par. 2, we also 
read: "That God was in Christ reconciling the world unto 
Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, but imputing 
them unto Him." 

Please be kind enough to inform me at your earliest convenience 
if you have changed your mind as to these teachings, 
or do you still hold the same views? With earnest prayers 
that God will be with you and keep you unto the end, I am, 

Yours in His dear name, P. L. DERRING.— Va. 

IN REPLY 

Your favor of March 25 is before me. I am pleased to 
answer its question as follows: 

The work of Christ is presented from a variety of standpoints, 
some showing modifications of one kind and some of 
another; some stating the matter from the human standpoint 
and some from the Divine. What we need in all Scriptural 
matters is to get at the real import. 

From God's standpoint human sin is imputed to Jesus; 
that is to say, He was provided to be the sinner's Representative 
—to pay the price for the release of man from the death 
sentence; thus God pictures Christ as the serpent raised upon 
the pole. Thus the Apostle says He was made sin for us, 
although He knew no sin— He was a sin-offering. 



Viewing the matter from the other standpoint, from the 
human standpoint, we see our own weaknesses and shortcomings, 
realizing the necessity of our Master's imputing to 
us the merit of His sacrifice to make up for our deficiency. 
Thus the facts agree, whether we state them from one standpoint 
or another. Our sins were reckoned against Jesus when 
He died for sin. The righteousness of Christ is imputed to 
us when we offer ourselves to God and our Great Redeemer 
and High Priest makes good our deficiency. 

With much Christian love, 

YOUR BROTHER AND SERVANT IN THE LORD. 



"ARE YE ABLE?" 

Are ye able to walk in the narrow, strait way, 
With no friend by your side, and no arm for your stay? 
Can ye bravely go on through the darkening night? 
Can ye patiently wait till the Lord sends the Light? 

Are ye able to crush your soul's longing for Love, 
Will ye seek for no friendship save that from above? 
Can ye pass through this world, lone, unnoticed, unknown, 
While your faith faintly whispers, "He knoweth His own?" 

Where the feet of the Blessed One stood, can ye stand? 
Can ye follow His steps to a wilderness land? 
Are ye able to cast aside pleasure and fame? 
Can ye live but to glorify His precious name? 

Can ye smile as His dear voice says tenderly, "No," 
When "the field is so white," and your heart yearns to go? 
Can ye rest then in silence, contented and still, 
Till your Lord, the Chief Reaper, revealeth His will? 

Are ye able to lay on the Altar's pure flame 

That most treasured possession, your priceless good name? 

Can ye ask of your Father a blessing for those, 

Who see naught in your life but to scorn and oppose? 

When the conflict twixt Error and Truth fiercer grows, 
Can ye wield the strong "Sword" against unnumbered foes? 
Can ye lift up the "Standard" e'en higher and higher, 
While His praises ye sing in the midst of the fire? 

When ye see the Lord's cause going down to defeat, 

Will your courage endure in the seven-fold heat? 

Will your faith keep you steadfast, though heart and flesh fail, 

As the New Creature passes beneath the last "Veil"? 

Ah, if thus ye can drink of the Cup He shall pour, 
And if never the Banner of Truth ye would lower, 
His Beloved ye are, and His crown ye shall wear, 
In His throne ye shall sit, and His glory shall share! 
GERTRUDE W. SEIBERT.

SCRIPTURE MEMORY CARDS 

Brother L. W. Jones, M.D., when studying medicine found 
great help from the use of memory-cards. Applying the principle 
to the study of God's Word, he has gotten out Scripture 
memory-cards. On the one side of the card is printed a text 
of Scripture. On the other side is the reference. Different 
colors of card classify different Bible topics. The pack consists 
of fifty cards. They can be used individually or in a 
company. The text can be cited and the quotation called for; 
or, the quotation can be read and the citation called for. Thus 
the most prominent texts of the Scriptures can be memorized 
and, at the same time, the memory will be generally strengthened 
along these lines. It is particularly convenient to have 
the desired Scripture at your tongue's end and very convenient 
to be able to turn to it in the Bible. 

Brother Jones sold a considerable number of these sets, 
but now has turned over to the Society his entire stock. The 
fifty cards, neatly boxed, postpaid, sell for twenty-five cents. 
There are two series of them. Some who have learned the 
first series desire more and the second series was prepared 
for them. 

These cards in good quantity are now in stock and subject 



to your order. Have a look at them at the Convention book 
stall, where your orders can be placed, if you desire.

BEREAN LESSON QUESTION BOOKS 

For TABERNACLE SHADOWS and for SCRIPTURE STUDIES, Vols. 
I., II. and V., are now in stock. Price five cents each- 
fifty cents per dozen, postpaid. 

Many of the Classes find these questions very helpful. The 
difficulty with many Classes in the past has been that not every 
one has the teaching ability of drawing the information of 
the lessons from the Class. The successful class leader has 
little to say except as he sums up the answer to each question 
after it has been discussed by the Class; or, if the question be 
not understood by the Class, he may often render assistance 
by paraphrasing it and, if possible, simplifying it. 

Excellent as public preaching is we believe that the Lord's 
people learn more in Berean Classes than by listening to any 
sermon. Thought is stimulated, quickened.

SAUL OF TARSUS AND WHAT HE SAW 

Last of all He was seen of me also, as of 
one born before the due time.— 1 Cor. 15:8. 

ST. PAUL WAS discussing the resurrection 
of the dead. He realized that on that great 
fact rested the weight of the Gospel Message. 
It was easy enough to prove that 



Jesus had died, but to an incredulous world 
it was difficult to prove that He had risen 
from the dead; and whoever could not believe 
that great fact could not believe the 
other great facts which stand or fall with it. 

For instance, the Apostle presented that 
Jesus had left the heavenly glory and had become a Man 
for the purpose of meeting the demands of the Divine 
Law against Adam and his race, involved by him. He 
could show the reasonableness of this logic. He has 
proven that as the whole world was condemned to death 
through Father Adam's disobedience it was absolutely 
necessary for an untainted life to be sacrificed in order 
to meet the penalty and to secure the release of the condemned 
race. 

GOD WOULD NOT LEAVE HIS SON IN DEATH 

The Apostle had declared that Jesus had been faithful 
in His ministry in fully laying down His life and that the 
entire matter was pleasing and acceptable to the Heavenly 
Father. If so, surely God would not leave His Son in 
death, but would raise Him from the dead. This fact the 
Apostle had repeatedly enunciated, showing that our Lord 
entered into His glory and reward and ascended up where 
He was before— to perfection on the spirit plane. 

But all these claims fell lightly upon some of his hearers, 

R5034 : page 175 

who claimed that it was much more easy to believe 

that Jesus never died at all, but merely transmuted, than 

to believe that He died for our sins and rose again for 

our justification; hence the Apostle's frequent reference 

to Christ's resurrection and his insistence upon it as absolutely 

necessary to Christian faith, for not only would 

the Heavenly Father's favor toward the Lord Jesus thus 

be shown, but the bulk of all the holy prophecies would 

remain unfulfilled unless Jesus arose from the dead. 

In other words, a dead Redeemer would be of no advantage; 
matters would be just as unfavorable for the 
sinners as though Jesus had never come at all. Additionally, 
if the resurrection of Jesus was a questionable 
matter, how could those who disputed that great fact acknowledge 
the resurrection of the Church and of the 
world? St. Paul emphasizes this also, declaring that 
"there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just 
and of the unjust," as a result of the redemptive work of 
Jesus— His dying for man's sins and His resurrection to 
glory to carry out the blessings secured by His death. 

"LAST OF ALL HE WAS SEEN BY ME" 

Prosecuting his argument, the Apostle marshaled the 
whole chain of witnesses except the women who first saw 
the Lord on the morning of His resurrection. He says, 



"He was seen of Cephas (Peter); then by the remainder 
of the twelve; then of above five hundred brethren at 
once; later, He was seen of James; then of all the Apostles," 
when He ascended. Then comes the text: "Last of 
all He was seen of me also." 

There is something pathetic in this reference to his 
own glimpse of Jesus. It called up the period of his own 
bigoted persecution of the Church. It reminded him of 
his own responsibility in connection with the death of St. 
Stephen, and of the blind hatred which led him to persecute 
inoffensive fellow-creatures, simply because they believed 
that Jesus died and rose again, the very thing 
which he was now trying to testify to all having the hearing 
ear. 

His memory went back to the madness which he had 
manifested in pursuing Christians even to Damascus, 
haling them to prison. Again he saw the great, blinding 
light from heaven, above the brightness of the noonday 
sun, his fall to the earth, and heard the voice speaking to 
him, saying, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?" 
(Acts 9:1-9; 26:12-19.) Again he remembered his astonishment 
at learning that those whom he had persecuted 
were not renegade and deceived Jews, but highly esteemed 
and acknowledged by this Great One, a glimpse of whom 
felled him to the earth. Ah, that was a wonderful sight! 
If Messiah was so great, so glorious, so powerful, he 
could believe in Him, he could reverence Him. 

The objection which all Jews had to Jesus, and what 
they considered absolute proof that He was not the Messiah, 
was His apparent weakness, His apparent inability 
to accomplish the things foretold by the Prophets. They 
said, It is foolish to think of a man without an army and 
without wealth claiming to be a king. It is still more 
foolish for Him to claim that He is the Messianic King, 
who is to be above all kings, and before whom every knee 
shall bow and every tongue confess. They said, therefore, 
that Jesus must either be beside Himself, crazy, or else 
He was seeking to deceive the people and temporarily 
create a little commotion of popularity. 

To them it seemed that when He was crucified a demonstration 
had been given that He was not the Messiah. 

R5034 : page 176 

Was not the Messiah to live forever, and was He not to 
reign successfully as King of kings and Lord of lords? 
Was it not, therefore, proven that any man whom the 
Jews or the Romans could crucify, could put to death, 
must have been an imposter? They considered the matter 
proven to a demonstration. The persecution of the followers 
of Jesus was merely with a view to stamping out 
a new religion, which, it was feared, would do harm to 
Israel in that it would call in question the hopes of Israel 
respecting a coming King and His Kingdom. Thus Saul 
of Tarsus had felt himself fully justified in persecuting all 
of that way of thinking— for "the good of the cause," as 



so many persecutors have said. 

A NEW VIEW OF MATTERS 

The honesty of Saul of Tarsus led him to be just as 
honest after he got his eyes of understanding open as he 
had previously been with them closed. It took him a little 
while to get the proper focus; then he saw and could explain 
to others the necessity for the death of Jesus and 
how it was typified in the sacrifices of the Law and how 
the Divinely arranged Plan had made this great sacrifice 
in order thereby to more fully show forth the Divine Justice, 
Wisdom, Love and Power. 

Now he saw, not only the need for Jesus to come in 
the flesh and to give Himself a ransom-price for all, but 
he saw equally the necessity for His resurrection, not in 
the flesh, but in the spirit, that He might be a fully qualified 
Ruler and Savior— not only to save His people from 
the Romans, the Assyrians, and from all other human 
enemies, but also to save them from Satan, from sin, from 
sickness, from sorrow, from death. Ah, now he saw how 
great Messiah must be in order to meet the necessities of 
the case! 

The matter changed immediately in his mind; instead 
of a human Savior and Messiah and an earthly King, God 
had prepared a Heavenly One, partaker of the divine nature, 
glorious, far above angels, principalities and powers 
and every name that is named. Now he saw that the 
sufferings of Jesus had a twofold value. First, they were 
necessary for man's release from the death sentence, and, 
secondly, they were necessary as a demonstration of the 
loyalty of Jesus. Now he saw that God, in preparing to 
bring many sons to glory, determined first to prove the 
loyalty of Him whom He had invited to become the Captain 
of our Salvation, and that this was done by the 
arrangement which necessitated Jesus' death. 

The climax of the argument was reached when he 
found that God not only had raised up Jesus from the 
dead, but that additionally he had bestowed upon Him the 
glory, honor and immortality of the divine nature, of 
which Saul had a demonstration or proof in the blinding 
flash of light which felled him to the earth, and in the 
voice which said to him alone, "I am Jesus, whom thou 
persecutest." 

CROWN HIM LORD OF ALL 

We like to think that, as we were once blinded to many 
of the precious truths of God's Word, so it is with many 
others whose eyes of understanding have not yet opened. 
We like to think of St. Paul's experiences, his sincerity, 
even to hatred and persecution, and then his loyalty, even 
to stripes and imprisonment and death. We like to think 
of him as exemplifying possibly a large class of the 
opposers of the Truth. 

We like to hope that all they will need to bring them 



into line with God's arrangements and to make them loyal 
servants of righteousness will be the great light which 
will shine forth resplendently very soon, when the due 
time shall come for Messiah to take to Himself His great 
power and reign— when His elect Bride shall have been 
completed and glorified with Him. We like to remember 
the words of the Lord through the Prophet respecting 
that glorious Epoch: "Then shall the eyes of the blind be 
opened, and the ears of the deaf be unstopped; then shall 
the lame man leap as an hart and the tongue of the dumb 
sing"— in that day. 

Where would Saul of Tarsus have ended his career if 
the great Redeemer had not interposed for his help? And 
how poorly we would have fared and how little of the 
Light Divine would we have seen if Divine providence 
had not helped us in various ways? And so with the 
world. It is beyond our power to give the hearing ear or 
the seeing eye. This is the work of the Great Physician, 
and His day for healing and blessing and uplifting the 
world we perceive to be nigh, even at the door. 

Ah, yes! Now we can see that the little opening of the 
eyes and unstopping of the ears and healing of the lame 
accomplished at our Lord's first advent merely foreshadowed 
His coming glory and much greater work. Now we 
can see a reason why so many of His mighty works were 
done on the Sabbath days— because they were all prophetic, 
as the Sabbath days themselves were prophecies 
of the great Thousand- Year Sabbath of Messiah's glorious 
reign, during which all of humanity who will may enter 
into His rest— rest from sin and from Satan and from 
everything that would hinder them from a full return to 
the Heavenly Father's love and favor and to everlasting 
life. 

Now we see that the great work of that thousand-year 
Sabbath will be the healing of the morally lame and the 
giving of sight and hearing to the minds now blinded and 
deaf under the evil influences of the great Adversary— 
"the god of this world [who] hath blinded the minds of 
them that believe not."— 2 Corinthians 4:4. 

ONE BORN BEFORE THE TIME 

Many have remarked at the peculiarity of St. Paul's 
statement that he saw the Lord as one prematurely born. 
But, if at first the statement was dark and puzzling, now 
it is luminous and enlightening. His thought is this: the 
time for giving ocular demonstrations of the Lord's resurrection 
had gone by; the next manifestation of Him is to 
be to His saints, and after that to the world. Thus we 
read: "We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as 
He is"— made like Him by our resurrection change from 
the human conditions to the spirit conditions; yea, to the 
divine plane. 

Strictly speaking, then, the experiences of Saul of 
Tarsus were out of the ordinary. No one else than he 
alone, not even the saintly, were to see the Lord before 



their resurrection change, in the end of this Age. When, 
therefore, he saw Jesus, he saw Him before the time- 
more than eighteen centuries before the time. Moreover, 
he saw Him as one born before the time— as one resurrected 
before the time. We are to have in mind the Scriptural 
use of this word born— that the Church must all be 
begotten of the Holy Spirit in order to experience the 
resurrection birth. 

Thus, concerning our Redeemer's resurrection, we 
read: "He was the First-born from the dead"; and again, 
"He was the First-born of many brethren." So the hope 
of all of God's people is that the begetting of the Holy 
Spirit in the present time will be followed by the resurrection 
birth, which St. Paul describes in this same chapter, 
saying, "It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it 

R5035 : page 177 

is sown an animal body, it is raised a spirit body." 
-I Cor. 15:43. 

With these things before our mental eye we see the 
meaning of the Apostle in the words: "He was seen of 
me, also, as of one born before the time." He was not 
thus seen by the other Apostles. They saw Him merely 
as He appeared— sometimes in one form of body and with 
appropriate clothing, at other times in another form, and 
with diverse clothing. He appeared and disappeared, but 
they did not see Him, the New Creature; they saw merely 
the various forms in which He appeared. But St. Paul 
saw the Lord more nearly as all the saints shall see Him 
when they shall be born from the dead by the glorious 
resurrection change. 

CHURCH'S GLORY TO BE GREATER THAN THAT OF 
THE ANGELS 

One great difference between the effect of what Saul 
saw and what the entire glorious Church will see in the 
resurrection is that Saul's eyesight was injured by the 
sight; besides, he saw nothing very distinctly— merely a 
blinding light, which the voice explained to be the appearance 
or manifestation of Jesus. Far more precious will 
be the experiences of the Church. Before beholding Him 
who is declared to be "the express image of the Father's 
person," "whom no man hath seen nor can see, dwelling 
in light which no man can approach unto"— before this, we 
shall have been changed, glorified. This will enable us to 
see Him as He is, for the glory of the Church will be like 
to the glory of her Lord, and superior to the glory of the 
angels. 

While heavenly glory does not consist exclusively of 
brightness, nevertheless the Scriptures everywhere seem 
to associate bright-shining with the heavenly ones, and 
would imply that the higher the station and rank the 
brighter will be the sheen, the glory. Thus the glory of 
the Heavenly Father is represented as being so great that 



few could endure it; and angels and seraphim are represented 
as veiling their faces before the Divine glory, 
which so greatly transcends their own. 

It should not, therefore, surprise us that the Scriptures 
everywhere represent that our Lord Jesus and the Church, 
"made partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4), will 
have a great honor and brightness, far above that of angels 
and all others except that of the Heavenly Father. 
As the Lord Jesus was able to veil the glories of His 
person and to appear as a man after His resurrection, so 
undoubtedly He could do as respects the world, during the 
thousand years of His Messianic Reign. 

And, similarly, it would be possible for the Church to 
appear as men with the glory veiled. It might appear at 
first as though this was what was signified through the 
Mosaic type when Moses, representing Messiah in glory, 
came down from the mountain, his face radiant, but veiled 
for the sake of the people. Our thought, however, is that 
Jesus and the Church will never thus appear in the flesh 
as angels have done in the past, but that on the contrary 
the Ancient Worthies, perfected on the human plane, will 
be their agents and representatives in all communications 
with mankind. Thus, "the Law shall go forth from Mount 
Zion (the Spirit Kingdom), and the Word of the Lord 
from Jerusalem" (the earthly Kingdom), to every nation, 
people, kindred and tongue, that all may be blest if they 
will and attain everlasting life. 



R5035 : page 177 

QUICKENING OF THE MORTAL BODY 

"If the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell 
in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also 
quicken your mortal bodies by His 
Spirit that dwelleth in you."— Rom. 8:11. 

EVERY TEXT should be considered in the 
light of its context. In the Epistle to the 
Romans, the Apostle's argument is that by 
nature we are all sinners; and that God's 
proposition is that He will accept us as 
sons on a new plane if our lives be offered 
in consecration: "I beseech you, therefore, 
brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye 
present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, 
acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable 
service."— Rom. 12:1. 

After an individual has made this presentation of his 
body for sacrifice, and he has been begotten of the Holy 
Spirit, the mortal body is counted as being dead, and his 
mind, his will, is reckoned as the New Creature adopted 
into the family of God and seeking to serve Him and to 
grow into His likeness, by being conformed to the likeness 



of His dear Son. Therefore, in all such expressions 
as we find in our text and its context, the Apostle refers 
exclusively to the New Creature, and ignores entirely, 
as dead, the mortal body. It is from this standpoint that 
we can say of the New Creature that he is holy; that the 
righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in him, and that the 
Wicked One toucheth him not.— Rom. 8:4; I John 5:18. 

Those things which he formerly did he is to do no 
more. The Apostle says, moreover, that he would not be 
content merely to be dead in the flesh— in the sense of 
simply abstaining from sin— but that he should seek to 
become energetic in the service of righteousness. If 
we ask how this is to be done, the answer is, "by the 
Spirit of God." If the Spirit of God was powerful 
enough to raise our Lord Jesus from the dead, it will 
quicken, or energize, our mortal bodies. When our bodies 
have been reckoned as alive, quickened, they are 
energized in opposition to sin and in harmony with 
righteousness. This, then, is the Apostle's thought in our 
text. 

It is well that we should have in mind the thought 
that the consecration of our bodies to the Lord may permit 
us to do more in His service than we could have done 
if we had not been begotten of the Holy Spirit. We are 
not to expect that this energizing will work a miracle, 
such as the restoration of a person in the last stage of 
consumption, etc. The Lord does not work in this way. 
But the Lord's people would do well to cultivate the 
thought that if it be the Lord's will they shall be able to 
do something in His service. If we have this confidence, 
every one of us can do much more than if we do not have 
it, for it gives new energy of mind and body. 

A great deal of harm is done in the world by people 
who not only have a wrong opinion themselves, but who 
spread contagion of thought to others. We see to what 
a large extent this is carried on by Christian Scientists, 
who deny that there is either pain or death. 

While we do not advocate this course, yet we should 
not, on the other hand, imagine that our bodies are in 
worse condition than they really are, but in a wise and 
judicious manner should seek to use them in the Lord's 
service. Instead of discouraging others we would do 
well to encourage them to realize that it is largely according 

R5035 : page 178 

to their faith that they shall be able to do anything. 
If we have no strong desire to accomplish something 
we shall become weak, sickly. 

ILLUSTRATION OF THE POWER OF MIND OVER BODY 

To some extent the world recognizes the power of the 
mind over the body. An account in the newspapers recently 
told of two great, strong men who were sick in 
bed as the result of the coddling of their mother, who 



should have encouraged them to get up and take a little 
air and exercise. Another case reported was that of a 
woman who imagined that she was glass. At first she 
used to get up while the attendant put the room in order; 
but later she would not sit up. After she had been in 
bed for a year or two, the doctor told her that there was 
nothing the matter with her body, but with her mind. 
One day her relatives got her up in the middle of the 
room and left her there, telling her that there was nothing 
wrong except her attitude of mind. At first she 
declared that she would go to pieces. She did not, however. 
With proper encouragement she lost her fear of 
breaking and began to improve; in due time she was 
quite well. 

You have heard of the professor upon whom some 
college boys played a trick. They planned to meet the 
professor on his way to school and to test the power of the 
mind over the body. The first boy met him, as they had 
agreed, when he was going out of his house, and told 
him that he was not looking well. He replied, "I am 
feeling quite well." Another met him a block away, then 
another a little further on, telling him that he looked pale 
and sick. Yet another met him and said, "You are a sick 
man." Still another greeted him with, "Professor A, you 
should be in bed." The next one exclaimed, "I must help 

R5036 : page 178 

you home, for you are in no condition to be at school!" 
The professor went home sick. All this occurred within 
fifteen minutes. The story is said to be true. 

All through life we are either helping or hindering 
others. Tell people something good; seek to cheer them, 
and when yourself ailing, follow the good suggestions 
you make to others. If you have a headache, moaning 
will not mend matters. Do not think so much about it; 
and by forgetting it, help nature to get rid of it. Nobody 
knows just how the power of the mind over the body is 
effected. The claim is that certain attitudes of mind 
favor certain microbes in the body. Medical journals 
state that children have died in spasms after having 
been suckled by mothers who have gotten into a rage a 
short time before nursing the children. It is well for 
all to have meek and quiet spirits, for faith, love, hope 
and kindness make for health. 

It is very reasonable and logical that the Lord should 
have given us the most wonderful power in our minds to 
make people feel better, to control muscle and nerve. 
One's conduct in the sick room has an influence upon the 
patient. One should speak kindly and cheerfully. If 
nothing that will be helpful can be said truthfully, it is 
far better to be quiet or to remain outside of the sick 
room. 

A sister supposed to be dying once sent for us. 
Upon entering the room we said, "Well, Sister, you are 
looking better than we had expected to see you. You are 



better!" "I am feeling better," she answered. "When 
did you begin to feel better?" we inquired. "When I 
heard you in the hall," she said. She is living today and 
married, and has a child. Yet we might have helped 
her to die, and might have had a funeral service instead 
of a marriage ceremony. 

"WE HAVE THE MIND OF CHRIST" 

It is well for us to consider the question: If the natural 
mind has such an effect upon the body, how should 
it be with those who can claim, "We have the mind of 
Christ"? What effect should this mind, or disposition, 
which is loving, generous, kind, forgiving toward our fellows, 
and reverential, loyal and obedient toward God, 
have upon the body? Does not the Apostle declare that if 
the spirit, or mind, of God dwell in them their mortal 
bodies shall be quickened? 

He does; but do not misunderstand the Apostle's 
teaching. In the preceding verse (Rom. 8:10) he states, 
"If Christ be in you the body is dead"— not literally dead, 
but reckonedly dead, in that the human will has died and 
that the will of God in Christ has been accepted instead. 
The will is dead to sinful things; it does not love nor 
practise them as once it did. His argument is that such 
a deadness to sin, although desirable, should not stop at 
that point; we should by God's grace seek to get alive 
to righteousness and to be as active in its service as once 
we were alive to sin and active in its service. He proceeds 
to show that this, although a great change, is possible 
to us; and he tells us how it is to be accomplished. 

He says that the mighty Spirit of God, which could 
and did raise our Lord from literal death, is able to 
quicken (make alive) to the service of righteousness 
these very bodies once alive to sin, but now, by God's 
grace, mortified, killed, "dead to sin." He therefore 
urges all who have the spirit, or mind of Christ, not only 
to be dead to sin, but to permit the Spirit of Christ in 
them to make them alive to holiness and to God's service 
in general. He shows them further that the new 
mind of Christ which they have received is a spirit of 
adoption into God's family as sons, and that if they are 
sons they are not only "free" but must bear fruit unto 
holiness, and that their join t-heirship with Christ as 
sons depends upon this quickening of their mortal bodies 
—"if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also 
glorified together."— Rom. 8:17. 

All who catch the real sense of this passage will see 
that it has no reference to physical quickening and immunity 
from pain and sickness, but to a quickening, or 
energizing by the Lord's Spirit so as to be, not only 
willing, but glad, to "suffer with Him." Hence those who 
see their High Calling should not expect exemption from 
sufferings and trials and difficulties; and the usual aches 
and pains which come to the Lord's people, as well as 
to the world, in a natural way, should be treated as the 



world treats them, but borne with greater patience and 
cheerfulness. 

St. Paul clearly marks the distinction between our 
new mind, which, consecrated in Christ, is accepted as 
the New Creature, holy and acceptable to God, and our 
mortal body, which he calls "this dead body"— originally 
dead, under Divine sentence, because of sin, but redeemed 
by the precious blood of Christ, and justified, and then 
included in our sacrifice when we gave our little all in 
consecration to the Lord, as a living sacrifice, to be dead 
with Christ, to suffer with Him even unto death. He 
declares that those who are walking after the Spirit, 
seeking to serve the Lord in Spirit and in truth, from 
the heart, are freed from condemnation, and that they 
do not now walk after the flesh, wishing to fulfil its desires. 
-Rom. 8:1,4. 

And here we are to distinguish closely between walking 
after the Spirit and walking up to the Spirit. We 
should, of course, follow as closely as possible to the 
spirit of Truth and righteousness, and yet we cannot hope 

R5036 : page 179 

to walk up to the spirit of the Divine requirements so 

long as we are in the imperfect flesh, though we may 

strive in this direction continually. One thing is positive, 

however— we must not walk after the flesh. To do so 

would imply that we had lost the new mind, the new disposition, 

the new will; that we had become dead to those 

hopes which had led to our consecration. 

The Apostle urges that all remember that one who is 
"in the flesh," who lives in harmony with the sinful 
propensities of his fallen, fleshly nature, is not pleasing to 
God; and that such yielding to the flesh, of course, if 
persisted in, will end in death. He proceeds to reason 
that if the spirit, or mind, or disposition of God (the 
spirit of holiness) dwells in one, he cannot be in sympathetic 
accord with the fallen human nature, its appetites 
and ambitions. If any man have not the Spirit of Christ 
he is not of the Body of Christ. Christ's Spirit is not a 
Spirit of harmony with sin, but of opposition to sin; He 
laid down His life to vanquish sin and to deliver mankind 
from its power and dominion. Therefore, whoever 
claims to have the Spirit of Christ, but who loves and 
wilfully practises sin, and with his mind serves sin, deceives 
himself; for he has neither part nor lot in Christ. 

THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS POWERFUL 

St. Paul proceeds further along this same line, arguing 
that our adoption into God's family, our begetting to 
newness of heart and mind, and our acceptance thus as 
members of the Body of Christ, while it means, first of 
all, that the body is ignored and reckoned as dead because 
of sin and that only our spirits, or minds, are reckoned 
as righteous and alive— the beginning of our eternal 



existence— nevertheless, this good condition is not to be 
considered the limit of our ambition and attainment in 
Christ-likeness. 

On the contrary, we are to remember that the Spirit 
of God is powerful; that in the case of our Lord Jesus 
it was powerful enough to raise Him from the dead. 
And as we become more imbued with and controlled by 
the Holy Spirit of God in our hearts, in our minds, 
Divine power will come to us gradually through this 
channel of the Holy Spirit, which will permit a figurative 
raising of our mortal bodies from their death-state 
into activities of spiritual life in the service of the 
Lord, for the assurance given us through the Apostle is 
that if God's Spirit dwells in us in sufficient measure- 
abundantly— He will energize our mortal bodies— not our 
immortal, resurrection bodies. 

It is our hope that in due time the Lord by His Spirit 
will give us new bodies in the resurrection; and that 
those bodies will be immortal, perfect in every respect; 
and that then, not only our minds, but our bodies also 
will be in fullest harmony with God and His every Law 
and work of righteousness. That condition will be glorious; 
it is already a glorious prospect. But the Apostle 
holds before us that even our present, mortal bodies, sentenced, 
then justified, reckoned dead because of sin and 
consecrated, may be so quickened or energized that, 
instead of being any longer servants of sin, or even 
merely dead to it, they may, under the careful watchfulness 
of the new mind, be used as servants of righteousness, 
of Truth. 

This means, of course, a High Christian development, 
a large attainment toward "the measure of the stature of 
the fulness of Christ." The measure of the fulness of 
Christ, the maturity and growth necessary to its attainment, 
involves the "putting on of the Lord Jesus Christ," 
and is not the work of a moment, nor of an hour, nor 
of a month, nor of a year. It is the work of a life time. 
But unless it is begun, it will never be completed. And, 
indeed, we may be sure that we can never fully put on 
Christ's characteristics. However, this is the standard 
for which every one of the Lord's people must continually 
strive. 

The Lord will see our endeavor, our strenuous fighting 
to put off the old nature, to put off "the works of the 
flesh" and to be clothed with the garments of righteousness 
suitable to our relationship to Him, and our success 
will be proportionate to our attainment of the mind, 
or disposition of Christ— holy conformity to the will of 
the Father in all things. How comforting in this connection 
is the promise of our Lord, that our "Heavenly 
Father is more willing to give His Holy Spirit (the Spirit 
of holiness, the Spirit of wisdom) to them that ask Him 
than are earthly parents to give good gifts unto their 
children!"— Luke 11:13.

REPROVE WORKS OF DARKNESS 

--JUNE 30.-EPHESIANS 5:11-21.- 

Text:— "Wine is a mocker, strong 
drink is raging."— Prov. 20:1. 

LIGHT AND DARKNESS are used as figures 
and as synonyms for truth and untruth, 
righteousness and sin. Thus, "God is Light 
and in Him is no darkness at all." Thus 
also Jesus said, "I am the Light of the 
world." Thus also He said of His followers 
when He was leaving them, "Ye are the 
light of the world"; "Let your light so 
shine before men that they may see your 
good works and glorify your Father which 
is in heaven." 

On the contrary, Satan is styled the "Prince of Darkness"; 
and his rule of unrighteousness is styled "the 
kingdom of darkness"; and those subject to his influence 
are styled "the children of darkness." Evil works contrary 
to the Lord and righteousness are styled "works of 
darkness." 

When our first parents sinned they forfeited fellowship 
with God, and because of disobedience became children 
of the Adversary; and Jesus said to such in his day, "Ye 
are of your father, the Devil, because his works ye do." 
(John 8:44.) Thus our entire race came under the influence 
of the darkness of sin. A night of sin, sorrow 
and death has followed for now six thousand years. We 
have the promise of a glorious morning when Messiah 
shall reign, when "Satan shall be bound for a thousand 
years," and when "the Sun of Righteousness shall arise 
with healing in His beams." 

But this morning has not yet come; we have it merely 
by faith, by hope. God's promises respecting that glorious 
morning are figuratively called "light," and these constitute 
the Bible. So the Scriptures, after telling us that 
darkness covers the earth and gross darkness the heathen, 
tell us also that the Bible is a light to the path of God's 
people in the midst of this darkness. "Thy Word is a 
lamp to my feet and a lantern to my footsteps." (Psa. 119:105.) 
St. Peter said, "We have a more sure Word of 
prophecy, to which we do well that we take heed, as unto 

R5038 : page 180 

a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn."— 
2 Pet. 1:19. 

LIGHT REPROVES DARKNESS 



In the present time, therefore, the masses of the world 
—deluded, enslaved and intoxicated by ignorance, superstition 
and the wiles of the Adversary— are generally 
sympathetic with the darkness wherein they are. They 
were born in it and are so accustomed to it that if brought 
immediately into the presence of the light they would be 
in distress. There are not many light-bearers in the world 
anyway. True, the census reports four hundred millions 
of Christians, but alas! the vast majority give no sign of 
ever having seen the true light, and many of those who 
did receive the light put it under a bushel, until it was 
extinguished. 

Surely it is as true today as it was in Jesus' day that a 
very small number of humanity, comparatively, have the 
true light of the Gospel of God, the Holy Spirit illuminating 
their minds and hearts, and who set this light upon 
a candlestick that it may give light in the midst of 
darkness. 

But although these are few in number, they are 
very precious to the Lord. He calls them His saints, 
His jewels, and tells us that at His second coming, prior 
to the setting up of His Kingdom to rule the world, these, 
as His jewel class, shall be gathered to Himself beyond 
the veil— changed by the power of the First Resurrection 
from human to the divine nature. These He tells us He 
will gather as His true "wheat," in the Harvest of this 
Age, into His heavenly garner— "changed in a moment, 
in the twinkling of an eye"; "Then shall the righteous 
shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom of their Father."— 
Matt. 13:43. 

It is this latter class that the Apostle addresses in this 
lesson— the same class which the Savior addressed saying, 
"Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure 
to give you the Kingdom." (Luke 12:32.) When the 
Father shall give these the Kingdom, as joint-heirs with 
their Redeemer, everything will be changed. The Prince 
of Darkness will be bound for a thousand years. The 
Prince of Light will shine forth to scatter all the darkness 
and miasma of sin, sorrow, ignorance and 
superstition. 

THE LIGHT-BEARERS' RESPONSIBILITY 

In today's lesson the Apostle is explaining the responsibility 
of these light-bearers. They represent God 
in this dark, benighted world; they represent the Justice, 
Wisdom, Love and Power of God. They are not able to 
let all of this glorious light so shine before men as to 
scatter the gross darkness of the present time, but they 
can do much to glorify their Father and can measurably 
scatter the thick darkness and bring in a sort of twilight 
at least to some. Obligation to do this is laid upon all of 
them. 

These are not expected to convert the world, but 
merely to find a sufficient number of similar characters to 
themselves to complete the foreordained membership in 



the Church, the Bride class, the joint-heirs. Faithfulness 
and zeal in this service will determine whether or not they 
will be worthy of having a place in the Bride class, and, if 
worthy, how high a station of honor they may occupy. 
Let us give heed gladly to the Divine Word respecting our 
obligation. 

We must "have no fellowship with the unfruitful 
works of darkness, but rather reprove them." How 
searching, how positive— absolutely no fellowship with 
them ! More than this, we must not be content with a 
negative opposition, but must reprove them. However 
wisely we may seek to fulfil these requirements, they are 
sure to bring to us the enmity, the disfavor and the disappointment 
of many whom we love, and whose good 
opinion we strongly desire. But as good soldiers of the 
Lord Jesus Christ we must be loyal, we must be faithful. 
He that is ashamed of the Master and His Word and the 
principles of righteousness for which He stands, of him 
will the Savior be ashamed when He comes to establish 
His Kingdom, when He comes to reckon with His 
servants. 

Evidently the Apostle does not mean that we shall 
undertake to reprove everything that is out of accord 
with our high ideals of the Divine Law and the Divine 
will, because he here mentions the things to be reproved, 
saying, "It is a shame even to speak of those things 
which are done of them in secret"— uncleanness, impure 
practices, the Apostle evidently had in mind. We must 
manifest our disapproval when we are in close contact 
with such things. 

This does not mean that we shall leave the preaching 
of the Gospel to go "slumming," to do "muck-raking." 
It may not mean that we shall even publicly denounce the 
evil, but it surely does mean that our lives shall be so 
contrary to all sinful and impure practices that all may 
take knowledge that we have been with Jesus, and have 
learned of Him. This is evidently the Apostle's thought 
in verse 13. It is not necessary for us to suppose that 
the world is in full sympathy with all the darkness and 
sin prevalent. On the contrary, as the Apostle suggests 
(verse 14), some are asleep and do not, therefore, realize 
the distinction between light and darkness. Some of 
these, if thoroughly awake, might be glad to know of 
Christ and the true light. 

WALK YE CIRCUMSPECTLY 

In view of these things, said the Apostle, the followers 
of Jesus should be careful, circumspect in the walk of life, 
not foolish, but wise, not squanderers of time, but redeeming 
the time, purchasing it back from worldly cares 
and pleasures, to have the more to use in the Master's 
service, realizing that the days are evil and that all our 
energies are needful if we would "fight a good fight" for 
the light as against the darkness of sin. To do this will 
require that we study and understand the will of the 



Lord. 

If others are drunk with excessive use of wine, let 
us be filled with a different kind of wine— with the Holy 
Spirit. If others seek to find joy and solace in intoxicants, 
let us find ours in being filled with the mind of 
Christ. This spiritual refreshment will lead us to psalms 
and hymns, and to make merry in our hearts to the Lord, 
and to be thankful for God's favor in Christ. 



R5040 : page 180 

IT IS NOT THE DEED WE DO 

"It is not the deed we do, 

Though the deed be ever so fair, 

But the love that the dear Lord looketh for, 
Hidden with holy care 
In the heart of the deed so fair. 

"The love is the priceless thing, 

The treasure our treasure must hold; 

Or ever the Lord will take the gift, 
Or tell the worth of the gold 
By the love that cannot be told."

SINS NEVER TO BE FORGIVEN 

-JULY 7.-MARK 3:20-35.- 

Text:— "This is the condemnation, that light is come into the 
world and men loved darkness rather than light, because their 
deeds were evil."— John 3:19. 

JOHN THE BAPTIST declared of Jesus, "He 
must increase, but I must decrease"; and 
so it was. After John was put into prison 
Jesus' ministry became more and more public, 
especially through the numerous works 
performed by Him. The multitudes followed 
the Great Teacher, and His friends became 
solicitous for Him, for even they feared and 
said, "He is beside Himself"— so quickly 
had His course changed from one of privacy 
to one of publicity. 

The Scribes and Pharisees considered themselves the 
representatives of the Jewish orthodoxy and qualified to 
pass upon everything theological; and indeed the public 
waited for their message, saying, "Have any of the Scribes 
and Pharisees believed on Him?" Hence Jesus declared 
that these representatives of Divine things were doubly 



responsible, for they would neither enter into discipleship 
themselves, to be members of the Kingdom which Jesus 
preached, nor would they permit the public to become 
His followers if they could help it. 

Jesus was at the time in Galilee, in the vicinity of Capernaum. 
Certain of the Scribes who had come down 
from Jerusalem felt it their duty to warn the public 
against becoming too interested in this Man and His teachings, 
and thus ignoring the long-established theories for 
which they and the Pharisees stood. 

That Jesus did many miracles they could not dispute, 
and that He specially and on many occasions cast out 
demons they could not deny. They explained this, however, 
by saying that Jesus had collusion with Beelzebub 
(Satan), and that by the power of that Prince of Darkness 
He was able to cast out demons. But Jesus answered 
that if it was true that Satan had turned reformer 
and was breaking down his own power and opposing his 
own minions, the demons, then it proved that his kingdom 
would soon fall entirely. 

The fact that today many religious systems practice 
one kind or another of faith-healing is claimed to be a 
mark of Divine approval, on the strength of our Lord's 
words. Yet we have, in opposition to this, to remember 
that those who claim to exercise this power very generally 
deny the very existence of the Gospel of Christ. Some 
of them deny that man is a sinner at all, and declare that 
there is no such thing as sin. Practically all of them 
deny the redemptive value of Christ's death. Practically 
all of them deny that He will come again and establish 
His Kingdom and through it bring to mankind the promised 
blessings of restitution to human perfection and to 
all that was lost in Eden and redeemed at Calvary.— 
Acts 3:19-21. 

There is only one answer to make to the claim that 
these faith-healings prove the truth of these various antagonistic 
doctrines, and that answer is the one which 
Jesus here states. If their faith-healing power be not of 
God it must be of the Adversary; and if it be of the 
Adversary, it proves that he is upholding false and contradictory 
doctrines, and that his house or dominion is 
more or less divided and in straits; and this implies that 
the collapse of the dominion of this Prince of Darkness 
is nigh. This view is more and more impressing itself 
upon Bible students. 

BLASPHEMING THE HOLY SPIRIT 

Addressing the Pharisees, who charged Him with being 
Satan's prime minister and agent, Jesus declared that 
all manner of sin and blasphemy which men commit are 
forgivable, except one kind, and this kind can never be 
forgiven— it is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. The 
Savior did not mean that the Scribes had said something 
against the Holy Spirit of God in an abstract way, but 
apparently they had perceived that our Lord's teachings 



were pure, holy, helpful, elevating to His hearers, honoring 
to God, and that He spake as never man spake; but 
after all these evidences of Jesus' holiness and relationship 
to God they called him a relative and representative 
of Satan. 

Jesus did not say that the Scribes and Pharisees had 
committed the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. 
Some of them may have done so, and others of them may 
have been partially in ignorance of what they did; and 
the sin against the Holy Spirit could not be committed in 
ignorance. It would be a wilful attributing of holy things 
to an unholy power or source. Jesus did not judge or 
condemn the Scribes, for He declared that He had not 
come to judge the world, to condemn it, but quite to the 
contrary, to die for it, to redeem it, to purchase it at the 
cost of His life. 

Our Lord did, however, give the warning reproof that 
those who could thus see the righteousness of His teachings, 
and how He glorified God in His words and actions, 
and who could then impute all of this to Satan, must be 
to a considerable extent perverse in their hearts, and if 
so, they would be in great danger of eternal condemnation, 
the sentence of the Second Death; they would be 
like "natural brute beasts," made to be taken and destroyed. 
(2 Pet. 2:12; Acts 3:23.) Jesus made this 
statement because they said that the spirit that was in 
Him was an unclean spirit— that He was actuated by one 
of the fallen angels and not by the Divine Spirit. 

"HATH NEVER FORGIVENESS" 

The Bible teaches that the penalty of Adam's sin was 
death— cutting off from life— but that under Divine providence 
the work of Jesus is to release all mankind from 
that death sentence, and give to all an opportunity of returning 
to harmony with God by bringing all to a clearer 
knowledge of the Truth. To some this knowledge comes 
now, with the privilege of becoming members of the Bride 
class, joint-heirs with Jesus. To such as accept this privilege 
and receive the begetting of the Holy Spirit, the test 
of life or death everlasting begins. 

But with the world this is not the time of testing respecting 
life or death everlasting. For them the next Age, 
the period of Messiah's Kingdom, will be the testing time, 
and their privilege will be to attain human perfection, 
otherwise to be cut off in the Second Death. Meantime, 
whatever light they may be enjoying will be either helpful 
or injurious, as they shall deal with it. If they allow it 
to have an uplifting influence in their lives they will be 
that much more advantaged when they shall come under 
the Kingdom influences and tests; they will not need to 
have so many stripes. 

On the contrary, those who violate their consciences 
and ignore the light which they enjoy and sin against it, 
will find themselves proportionately degraded when they 
shall come under the Kingdom influences and tests. The 



Scribes of this lesson had so misused their education and 
opportunities as to be in great danger of becoming so degraded 
that even the Kingdom influences would not bring 
them to a condition worthy of everlasting life. 

R5037 : page 182 

BROTHERS, SISTERS AND MOTHER 

Today's study closes with the Master's explanation of 
the class to which He acknowledged relationship. The 
multitudes who flocked to His miracles, and to hear Him 
speak as never man spake, were chiefly the poor and the 
publicans and sinners, and such as were not great nor 
very religious according to the standards of their time. 
Their degradation, their realization that they were sinners, 
made the Master's "wonderful words of life" especially 
attractive to them. No one else offered them hope. 
All others declared that God would not notice them. The 
religionists of that day reproved Jesus because of His 
recognition of the lower classes, but none were so low, 
so degraded, that He would not lend them His helping 
hand if they had a disposition to return to the Father's 
House. He was indeed the Friend of all willing to come 
to the Father by Him. 

An opportunity of showing the multitudes the basis for 
His sympathy came when Jesus' mother and brethren on 
the outside of the throng sent Him word that they desired 
to see Him. How beautiful the lesson of the Great 
Teacher's breadth of spirit, regardless of caste and class, 
when he said, "Who is My mother and My brethren?" 
And then, looking toward His disciples who were sitting 
near Him taking in His teachings, He said, "Behold, My 
mother and My brethren! for whosoever will do the will 
of God, the same is My brother and My sister and My 
mother. "--Matt. 12:46-50.

THE MYSTERY OF THE KINGDOM 

-JULY 14.-MARK 4:1-20.- 

Text:— Receive with meekness the engrafted Word, 
which is able to save your souls."— James 1:21. 

THE SALVATION open at the present time 
has been obtainable only through faith, and 
faith is dependent upon a measure of knowledge, 
or revelation, and this knowledge, or 
revelation, came to us from God, for said 
St. Peter, "Holy men of old spoke and 
wrote as they were moved by the Holy 
Spirit." God in this Age is calling a class 



possessed of ears of appreciation for His 

Message. These are mainly the weary and 

heavy laden and sin-sick, chiefly the poor of this world, 

rich in faith. 

It is not enough that they hear the Message, not 
enough that additionally they accept it, turn from sin and 
consecrate their lives to God and His service and be accepted 
of Him, through the merit of Jesus, and be begotten 
of the Holy Spirit. From that moment they may 
be said to be saved and to have everlasting life, if they 

R5039 : page 182 

follow a certain course. That course includes a continual 
study of the Divine instructions and promises and the 
exercise of faith and prayer, and obedience and trust, even 
unto the end. 

The point of this lesson is to show the importance of 
having the right kind of spiritual food, and of using it and 
not allowing the new nature to become choked by earthly 
hopes, aims or ambitions. Such as thus overcome will 
be inheritors with Jesus of His glorious Messianic Kingdom 
of a thousand years, which is to bless Israel and, 
through Israel, all the families of the earth. 

Jesus gave the parable of the Sower of the "good 
seed," some of which fell by the wayside, and was devoured 
by the fowls; some fell on rocky ground where it 
had no depth of earth, and brought forth no fruitage; 
some amongst thorns, which choked it; some into the 
good ground, which yielded thirty fold, sixty fold and 
one hundred fold. The disciples were perplexed and unable 
to understand it and inquired of the Great Teacher 
its meaning. 

His answer was that He was quite willing that they 
should understand the parable, and that it related to the 
Kingdom of God, but it was not to be understood by outsiders. 
He explained that it was for this reason that He 
always spoke in parables, so that the general public might 
see and hear and not understand, because the masses even 
of the Jews were not in a heart condition to understand 
and be profited by these lessons respecting the Kingdom. 
Only such persons as desired to become members of the 
Kingdom class and were also willing to undertake the 
stringent conditions of the "narrow way"— only such were 
to fully and clearly understand the parables of the Kingdom. 
This is in harmony with all of God's dealings in 
the present time. We read again, "None of the wicked 
shall understand, but the wise (toward God) shall understand." 
And again we read, "The secret of the Lord is 
with them that reverence Him, and He will show them 
His Covenant." 

In Verse 13 the Master indicates that this parable 
would serve as a general key to His followers for their 
interpretation of all His parables. "Seed" does not mean 
literal seed, "birds" do not mean birds, "thorns" do not 
mean thorns, etc. Proceeding, the Great Teacher expounded 



the parable as follows: (1) The seed that was 
sown represents the Word of God. More than this, it 
represents that particular element or feature of God's 
Word which relates to the Kingdom. 

This is shown by St. Matthew's account of the same 
parable (Matt. 13:19): "When anyone heareth the Word 
(Message of the Kingdom), and understandeth it not, 
then cometh the Wicked One and catcheth away that 
which was sown in his heart. This is he that receiveth the 
seed by the wayside." Our lesson says that the Wicked 
One meant is Satan. Satan and his evil agents are therefore 
represented in the parable by "birds," and the lesson 
is that however much of the Gospel of the Kingdom we 
may read or hear preached, we lose the benefit of that 
which we do not understand. 

Evidently, then, much of the Bible study and much of 
the religious reading is lost, because not understood. The 
secondary lesson is that one reason why the "good seed" 
does not enter into the understanding is that the heart is 
not in a receptive attitude. Like the wayside path, it is 
hard. Such hard hearts, selfish hearts, proud hearts, are 
of the kind which the Savior does not wish to have understand 
His parables nor understand the glorious Kingdom 
Plan which they expound. 

(2) The seed sown in the stony place represents those 
who, when they hear the Message of the Kingdom, are 
delighted. They say, How good that sounds! What a 
grand time there will be when Messiah rules in righteousness 
to bless the world and lift up the poor, degraded 
members of Adam's family! And how great is the privilege 
of becoming members of the Bride of Christ, to be 
associated with Him in His glorious Kingdom work! 

But the class represented by the stony ground have little 
depth of character; they are merely emotional. 

The "Seed," or Message of the Kingdom, which these 
heard with such delight at first, never matures in their 
hearts, because they are too shallow, too superficial in 

R5039 : page 183 

their love of righteousness. Below the surface those are 
hard hearts and selfish, and so, when they find that the 
good Seed of the Kingdom is unpopular and that it will 
bring them a certain amount of reproach and contempt 
and perhaps persecution— then all their ardor oozes out, 
their zeal is at an end. The Kingdom Message fails to 
produce in them the fruitage desired. The trouble was 
not with the Seed nor with the Sower, nor with the sun 
of persecution necessary for the ripening— the fault lay 
in the fact that their hearts were not right; they were 
hard, stony. 

(3) The seed sown in the thorny ground represents 
those who have good hearts and have heard the Message 
of the Kingdom and appreciate it and rejoice in it, 

but their hearts are divided. They allow the cares of this 
life and the love of riches to have such a share of their 



heart's affections that the Kingdom Message does not 
have the opportunity to bring forth such fruitage as will 
be pleasing to the Lord. 

Let us note carefully that these thorns do not, as some 
suggest, represent gambling devices, card parties, saloons 
and other places of ill-repute, nor secret sins and vices. 
None of those things should appeal to Christians at all. 
The Master distinctly tells us that the thorns represent 
"the cares of this life and the deceitfulness of riches." 
Thus every Christian man or woman who has received 
the Message of the Kingdom and has allowed the cares 
of this life and the deceitfulness of riches to choke and 
frustrate his prospects as respects the Kingdom is represented 
in this parable. Very nice people, hospitable, educated, 
etc., belong to this class of the parable represented 
by the thorny ground. 

(4) According to the parable there will be three classes 
of believers who will attain the Kingdom— or we may 
say, they will all be one class in the sense that they will 
bring forth the one kind of fruitage and be acceptable to 
the Lord as joint-heirs in His Kingdom, but the differences 
between them will be in the amount of fruitage 
such yield— some thirty fold, some sixty fold and some 
a hundred fold. 

The Lord does not explain the differences between these 
fruitages, but we may well understand that the amount of 
fruitage will be measured by the amount of love and zeal 
in the heart. The fully appreciative and the fully loving 
will be the most energetic to know and to do the Master's 
will, and they will bring forth the largest fruitage— a 
hundred fold— and they, too, will have the chief places 
in the Kingdom. 

St. Paul declares that as star differs from star in 
glory, so it will be with those who attain unto the First 
Resurrection— all will come forth glorious, but some will 
blaze with a more resplendent brilliancy, because of their 
great zeal, and therefore their great likeness to their 
Redeemer and Lord. Jesus likewise mentions the distinctions 
amongst those who will sit with Him in His Throne. 
He assured James and John that, if they were willing to 
drink of His cup and be baptized into His death, they 
should surely sit with Him in His Throne; but as to 
whether or not they would have the chief places of honor 
and distinction was not for Him to say. Those places 
will be given according to the Father's determination; 
that is to say, according to principles of justice, of merit. 

Those will have the places of honor next to the Redeemer, 
who, in this life, will manifest to God the greatest 
harmony with His character, in their zeal, their love for 
God, the Truth and the brethren. 

We are not to understand that those people represented 
by the thorny ground and the wayside will suffer eternal 
torments because of their unfaithfulness in respect to 
the Kingdom, nor are we to understand that others, who 
do not hear about the Kingdom in the present life at all, 
will on this account suffer eternal torment. They will 



all, however, lose the grand privilege and glorious blessing 
of participating in the Kingdom, whatever they may 
obtain under the restitution blessings which that Kingdom 
will inaugurate for the blessing of mankind in general.

BROTHER RUSSELL'S EPISTLE TO PILGRIMS 

In April the letter below was sent to the Pilgrim 
Brethren. Now we publish it for the benefit of all our 
readers, at the suggestion of some of the Pilgrims. One 
of these expresses his reasons for suggesting the publication 
of the letter, as follows:— 

BELOVED BROTHER RUSSELL:-The sweet, Holy Spirit of the 
Master's Love and the tender care for the sacred interests of 
the Lord's flock shines out so beautifully in your letter to the 
Pilgrim Brethren that my heart responds in the same spirit 
to assure you that every item of your counsel is carefully 
noted. 

The spirit of your letter is so overflowing with the love 
of the Master that it would seem to me that its publication 
in THE WATCH TOWER would serve the Cause most effectively. 

(1) It would help all the friends of the Truth to see the 
beautiful relationship that exists between yourself and the 
Pilgrim Brethren and give a true expression of the animus 
prompting the service. Some of the friends quite overlook 

this and fail completely to grasp the loving relationship between 
yourself and the brethren in the field. 

(2) It would enable all the friends to see that the Pilgrims 
are faithfully following the instructions of the Office when 
they call attention to the Colporteur service, the privileges of 
the Extension Work, the blessing of the family Manna at 
breakfast, and the interests of family worship. The endeavor 
thus to look after the interests of the dear "flock" is not a 
desire to make a record, or to show a spirit of officiousness, 
but is the humble love of the Master for His true "sheep," 
manifested unobtrusively in those who in His providence He 
entrusts with this service. 

TO THE PILGRIM BRETHREN OF THE I.B.S.A.:- 

Greetings in the name of our Lord and Redeemer! I 
often wish that I could meet you personally and say a few 
words and hear from you. I will take this opportunity 
of giving you my little message inaudibly and without the 
expense of a regular journey. I want to refresh your 
memories respecting some things which I have already 
said, but which, it appears, will slip from the memories of 
some of your number. My experience in the work and 
knowledge of conditions are the basis for the following 
counsels: 

(1) Avoid as much as possible all unkind references 
to Christian ministers or others who differ from us in 



Bible interpretation. Preach the Gospel! Let its mighty 

power do the work. In referring to others, speak as sympathetically 

as possible, endeavoring to make apologies 

and allowances rather than to condemn, which is not our 

province. Avoid so far as possible all discussion of the 

immortality of the soul, the Trinity and our Lord's presence. 

The time may yet come for wrangling over these things, 

but we believe it has not yet arrived. Take your cue, 

please, from the DAWNS, TOWERS and sermons, and be 

sure to make your statements less rather than more pungent 

and specific. The people are prejudiced along these 

lines. Experience shows that they can be much better 

reached otherwise, and after they come to understand 

other matters of the Truth— when these matters so difficult 

for them become easy. 

(2) By precept, as well as by example, you can help 
all of the dear friends along the lines mentioned and 

R5040 : page 184 

help the Cause much. The Truth has suffered more from 
the unwisdom of its friends than from anything its enemies 
have said. 

(3) Continue to give my love to all the dear Classes 
and individuals in the Truth as you meet them. I love 
to think of you all as in a measure representatives of 
myself as well as of the Lord, and I believe that the 
friends get most good from the Pilgrim visits when they 
view them from this standpoint. Usually, except on Sundays, 
you will have plenty of time aside from the meetings 

to look after the lame, halt, blind and sick of the "sheep"— 
to carry them crumbs of comfort, to help bind up their 
wounds, or to encourage them in the good way. I trust 
that this opportunity for service is not neglected. It is 
one of the most important. Sometimes a dear "sheep" 
will become entangled and cease to attend the meetings. 
It is a part of your shepherding work to look after just 
such cases— to hunt them up and to help them back to 
fellowship if possible, or, failing in this, to encourage 
them to remain loyal to the Lord whatever their outward 
conditions. 

(4) As representatives of the Society, the friends will 
naturally inquire of you respecting the Colporteur work, 
the Volunteer work, etc., or, if they fail to ask and you see 
no activity along these lines, it would be your duty and 
privilege to bring up the question and inquire to what 
extent the service of the Lord is going forward. Make 
inquiries about Classes where they have a surplus of talent 
and encourage the Class Extension work. Keep in memory 
that you are not speaking for yourself merely nor 
especially, but that you are the Society's representative 
and, above all, along this line in your present work, the 
Lord's representative. Be careful, therefore, that your 
counsels shall be encouraging and helpful, being not carelessly 
given. 

(5) As you go to the various homes please give the 



dear friends to understand that I have requested you to 
notice whether or not the HEAVENLY MANNA is used at 
breakfast, dinner, supper, or some time, and whether or 
not an opportunity is sought to have family worship or 
giving of thanks at the table. Assure them that our interest 
is not prompted by any other motive than that of 
their good. So sure do we feel that prayer and consideration 
of spiritual things is essential to spiritual growth 
that we fear that all the dear friends who allow business, 
pleasure, or anything to come between themselves and the 
Lord are separating themselves from the spirit of Divine 
fellowship which the Lord encourages. Remind them also 
at a convenient time of the great blessing that is being 
experienced by some in connection with the continuous 
reading of the Six Volumes of SCRIPTURE STUDIES every 
year— ten to twelve pages a day. We are leaky vessels, 
and the Truth gradually ebbs away unless we replenish. 

(6) It is our supposition that all who are deeply interested 
in the Present Truth and who see it from the 
viewpoint in THE WATCH TOWER are interested in the 
weekly sermons. We assume that they would be interested 
for their own sakes and interested additionally for 
the sake of millions of others who are being thus reached. 
All such will desire to have regularly some paper publishing 
the sermons. Generally we can supply them 
cheaper than they could otherwise obtain them. 

But another matter should be borne in mind, namely, 
that their subscriptions should go to such paper or papers 
as need some encouragement— even though it should cost 
more— even though in some respects it should not be as 
pleasing to them as another. As it is, two or three papers 
have immense lists of our readers— far more than their share 
—while other papers get comparatively small encouragement 
and are always in danger of becoming discouraged 
and dropping the service. The best general rule for 
friends to follow is to send subscriptions to THE WATCH 
TOWER Office and to take the paper published nearest to 
their home, which carries the one or the three-column 
service— whichever they prefer. We make special mention 
of this because some of the dear friends have been 
unintentionally working at cross purposes in this matter, 
seeming not to recognize the wiser course. 

This year we are planning for three General Conventions, 
and I hope that we can arrange that each of you 
shall have a chance to attend one of them. I am expecting 
to be at all, and therefore hope to see all of you. The 
location for the first of these will be near Warrensburg, 
Mo. (Chautauqua), June 1-8; the second at Toronto, Can., 
June 30-July 7, and the third at Washington, D.C., July 
6-14. The object in having the three Conventions this 
year is to accommodate those who cannot travel so far as 
is necessary when there is only one Convention. We shall 
expect about fifteen hundred at each of these Conventions 
—perhaps two thousand. 

With much Christian love, your brother and servant 
in the Lord, C. T. RUSSELL.

SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS 
APPLIES TO THE BEGOTTEN ONES 

Question.— To whom do the words in Heb. 6:4-6 apply 
—"It is impossible for those who were once enlightened, 
and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers 
of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good Word 
of God, and the powers of the world [Age] to come, if 
they shall fall away, to renew them again unto 
repentance"? 

Answer.— The conditions mentioned in the passage 
above quoted are all more or less intertwined. That is to 
say, the one who has been made partaker of the heavenly 
gift of justification is sanctified, begotten of the Holy 
Spirit; for only in that way can he get God's evidence 
respecting his justification. No one is justified by merely 
believing that Jesus lived or that Jesus died. In order to 
come to the point of justification and have the merit of 
Christ imputed, he must previously have presented his 
body a living sacrifice; and faith in the Lord Jesus must 
accompany this presentation. 

Anyone having done all in his power— having turned 
from sin, having believed in Jesus as the Redeemer, and 
having presented his body a living sacrifice— must next 
receive the imputation of Jesus' merit to make up his 
shortcomings, to cover his blemishes, in order that the 
Heavenly Father may be able to accept the sacrifice; for 
no imperfect thing can come upon the altar of the Lord. 
It requires the merit of Christ to make good what is 
lacking in the one who presents himself in sacrifice; and 
only those who thus believe and present their bodies in 
sacrifice are the recipients of Christ's merit by imputation; 
and only such are begotten of the Holy Spirit. 
God's arrangement is that no one can be justified unless 
he has made a full consecration, after having already 
turned from sin. Christ would not impute His merit to 
any except such as make this full consecration; and the 
Father would not accept by begetting with the Holy Spirit 
any others than those who have done so. 

Those who have received justification have at the 

R5041 :page 185 

same time received the begetting of the Holy Spirit, which 
is "the power of the Age to come." The falling away of 
such, the Apostle says, would mean that they could never 
be renewed again. Why? Because they have had their 
share of the blessing of Christ. Christ's death was to 
bring a blessing— and only one— to every member of 
Adam's race— one full blessing, a complete blessing, such 



a blessing as will enable every member of the race— if he 
will, when he understands it— to come fully and completely 
into harmony with God and thus to have eternal 
life. But after he has received his full blessing and 
then has rejected it, there is no hope in his case. He can 
never justify himself. He has had the merit of Christ 
and has repudiated it. There is no hope of renewing 
such a one, says the Apostle. The fate of such would 
not, of course, be eternal torment, but destruction— the 
Second Death. 



THE DICTIONARY DEFINITION 

Question.— Is there any difference between "Death" 
and "Annihilation"? 

Answer.— The Standard Dictionary, our best authority 
on such matters, gives the following definition of Annihilate: 
(1) To put out of existence; destroy absolutely; reduce 
to nothing. (2) To destroy the identity of. Its 
synonym is, Exterminate, i.e., destroy entirely. Words 
are only vehicles for conveying thought, and much depends 
upon the vehicle which best expresses your meaning in 
the question. The spark of animal energy which God 
supplied to Adam and which he, in turn, dispensed to his 
offspring, but which was forfeited for him and for his 
posterity by his act of disobedience, passes at death from 
the individual as absolutely as it does from a brute beast. 
The word "life," however, as used in a large number of 
instances, does not stand merely for the spark of animal 
energy, but is a synonym for soul or being. 

In God's purpose or arrangement this being has not in 
death become extinct, exterminated, annihilated; for he 
has provided for it a future. There is, however, no sentient 
being in the sense of consciousness, or knowledge, 
or appreciation of pain or of joy, or any other experience. 
But the Divine Creator, who first gave being, has declared 
that in the case of Adam and his children it is 
His purpose to provide a Redeemer, through whom all 
may be restored as completely as before they came under 
the death sentence. 

The world, who do not recognize God or His power, 
and who have no knowledge of the promise of resurrection 
through the merit of Christ's redemptive work, might 
properly enough speak of one in death as being extinct, as 
a dead animal. This is the standpoint of the agnostic. 
But by believers, instructed of God respecting His purpose 
in Christ and in the resurrection of the dead eventually, 
and in the opportunity of eternal life to every one, this 
matter is to be viewed from the same standpoint from 
which our Lord viewed it when He said, "He is not a God 
of the dead, but of the living; for all live [or are alive] 
unto Him" (Luke 20:38); or as the Apostle Paul stated 
when he spoke of "God, who quickeneth the dead, and 
calleth those things which be not as though they were" 



(Rom. 4:17); that is, God purposes their awakening, and 
speaks of the present condition of Adamic death as merely 
a suspension of life, and not as annihilation, extermination, 
extinction. 

You probably have already in your library a little volume 
entitled THE DIVINE PLAN OF THE AGES-fourth 
million now on the press. This will give you a much 
fuller answer to your question than our limited space will 
allow in this column. 

IS IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO LIVE WITHOUT SIN? 

Question.— When the Apostle wrote (I John 2:1), 
"These things I write unto you that ye sin not," was it 
his thought that it is possible for us to live without sin? 

Answer.— In reading this text and many other Scriptures 
we need continually to keep in mind the fact that 
those who are accepted of God as His children, as members 
of the Body of Christ, begotten of the Holy Spirit, 
are all classed as New Creatures and not as men. The 
New Creature, therefore, in this text, would be the ye— 
"that ye sin not," as though the Apostle said, "The object 
of my writing is that you might realize the responsibility 
of abstaining from sin and continuing in God's love." 
Then he informs us how this is to be accomplished. In 
this as in other respects he shows that the New Creature 
is responsible for the body. Anyone who would say that 
he was perfect and without flaw, would be deceiving himself. 
Nevertheless, these flaws are not of the New 
Creature, but chargeable to the flesh. If the New Creature 
should sin wilfully it would cease to be a New Creature, 
because the New Creature is begotten of the Spirit, has 
joined in the warfare against sin, and is facing in the 
very opposite direction from sin. 

But if any man sin, let him not cast away his confidence 
in God, but let him remember that the Father, foreknowing 
that the New Creature could not control every 
thought and word and act of the flesh, has made 
provision for these, and has provided for us an Advocate, 
Jesus Christ the Righteous. Our Lord has already become 
our Advocate. He has appeared on our behalf- 
appeared before the Father and made satisfaction for us. 
-Heb. 9:24. 

Remembering this, if we find that through lack of 
faith, or weakness of the flesh, a step has been taken 
which is contrary to the Lord's will and our best 
spiritual interests, no time should be lost in retracing the 
step and in calling upon the Lord. We have an altar 
consecrated with the precious blood of Christ, far superior 
in every way to that altar which Abraham consecrated 
with the blood of typical animals, and the Apostle 
exhorts us, "Let us, therefore, come boldly [courageously 
—full of faith] unto the throne of grace, that we may 
obtain mercy, and find grace to help in every time of 
need. "--Heb. 4:16. 



APPLIES TO THOSE NOT SPIRIT-BEGOTTEN 

Question.— "Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are 
burned, and few men left." (Isa. 24:6.) Who are these 
few men? And how were the others burned? 

Answer.— In the great burning day the "heavens" will 
be on fire, and "the earth and the works therein shall be 
burned up." This time of trouble will involve the whole 
world, practically everybody. The Lord speaks of some 
who will be preserved in the midst of this trouble. Just 
as the three Hebrews were preserved in the fiery furnace, 
so we expect that some will be spared in the time of 
trouble. 

"Seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may be ye shall 
be hid in the day of the Lord's anger." (Zeph. 2:3.) 
This invitation seems to be to others than the spirit-begotten. 
It would not apply to the Church, for her deliverance 
will be over before the culmination of the trouble. 
It would not apply to the "great company" class, for it is 
incidental to their deliverance that they shall suffer in 
this time of trouble the destruction of the flesh, and come 
up to honor out of "great tribulation." This, therefore, 
would seem to apply to a class of the world who are not 
spirit-begotten. 

R5042 : page 186 

PREPARED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS MESSENGERS 

Question.— "For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for 
the king it is prepared. He hath made it deep and large; 
the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the 
Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it." (Isa. 30:33.) 
Who is the king for whom Tophet is prepared? 

Answer.— Tophet was a name given to the Valley of 
Hinnom, which is symbolically a representation of the 
Second Death, and the Lord is intimating that He has 
plenty of fire and fuel to accomplish all this destruction 
and that the Spirit of the Lord will set it afire and cause 
it to burn to the complete destruction. The king for 
whom it is prepared is the Devil, with his messengers. 
He is the instigator of evil, whose destruction is already 
ordained. First, however, in the Divine providence, before 
he shall be destroyed, the glorious reign of Messiah 
is arranged for, during which all of mankind shall be 
brought to a full knowledge of the Truth, and to a full 
opportunity of coming into harmony with God, and of 
demonstrating whether they have the disposition of God 
or the disposition of the Adversary, Satan. When the 
choice of each shall have been fully determined, the Second 
Death shall swallow up all for whom it has been prepared. 
Such as demonstrate their sympathy with evil will 
be counted as the messengers of Satan, and will have a 
share with him in the Second Death. 



NOTHING SPECIFIC ABOUT URIM AND THUMMIM 

Question.— Is there any revelation as to what the Urim 
and Thummim consisted of, or how the priests were 
answered? 

Answer.— There is nothing specific known on this subject. 
In some manner or other, it is supposed, the breastplate 
that was worn by the High Priest was used as the 
Urim and Thummim— that is, to give definite answer, Yes 
or No, to the questions that were propounded. For instance, 
if the question were asked, Shall Israel go out to 
war with this nation? or, Shall Israel enter into alliance 
with that nation? the Lord's answer was indicated by the 
breastplate. How these questions were answered, we are 
not informed. Nothing in the Scriptures tells us, and we 
have no tradition even that gives any very clear answer. 
We know that they had the Urim and Thummim 
and that the answer was indicated in some way with the 
precious stones of the breastplate, but just how, nobody 
knows.

SOME INTERESTING LETTERS 
WORK FOR THE BLIND 

DEAR FRIENDS :- 

Enclosed find report for the year's work in literature for 
the blind. Previous to March 1, 191 1, the work of transcribing 
the SCRIPTURE STUDIES into type for the blind was in its 
inceptive stage and no systematic record was kept. 

However, at this time, having secured financial aid from 
the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and from others 
who had become interested in the work, it becomes expedient 
to adopt a business method. 

Itemized, the work at present is as follows: 

Books in circulation since March 1 103 

Sold, complete copies, Vol. 1, in 7 parts 2 

Sold, parts of Vol. 1 2 

Books on hand 700

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

Christian greetings to you, our dearly beloved Pastor. It 
is with deep gratitude to our Heavenly Father that I am 
sending the enclosed post office order for one hundred dollars, 
to be used in the harvest work according to your best 
judgment. It is a cause for rejoicing that the dear Lord permits 
me to use some of His money in this way, which has 
been my heart's desire so long. 

Present Truth has been a great blessing, and no less 
precious now; rather increasing as the years go by. The 
light grows clearer, and the foundation stronger, thus enduring 
the storms of trials and testings. Well it may, for its 
"Builder and Maker is God." It is with a spirit of thankfulness 
that I find myself in complete harmony with all the 
Lord's arrangements. Oh, wonderful wisdom! What confidence 
it inspires in the humble child of God! 

The Passover Season was full of sacred memories, beautiful 
yet solemn, and not without contrition of heart in view of 
the many failures, when the sacrifice might have been more 
completely bound to the altar, when the Master's example 
might have been more faithfully followed. Favor upon favor 
has been my portion. How little is the sacrifice ! And how 
rich is the reward! Surely, Infinite patience and love have 
been manifested by the Lord in dealing with His weak child. 
I trust it will not be in vain, but in the life to come will all 
redound to His honor and glory, His strength made perfect 
in weakness. 

"Higher than the highest heaven, 

Deeper than the deepest sea, 
Lord, Thy love at last has conquered— 
None of self, and all of Thee." 

THE TOWERS are so helpful. We were especially impressed 
with the articles in the last issue, "Pride in the 
Heart," "The Mortal Body the Servant of the New Mind," 
and "The Palace of Blessedness." While we are glad to hear 
the Lord's representatives on any subject pertaining to our 
Father's Word, nevertheless we listen with deeper interest to 
what will help us to build character and aid in making our 
"calling and election sure." 

We appreciate your labor of love, dear Brother, better 



than we can express, and pray that the Lord's blessing may 
ever attend your way, keeping you faithful unto death. 
Your sister by His grace, 111. 



DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

I wish to tell you of my appreciation of the way the Lord 
has used you in giving out "meat in due season," helping us 
all to know the Lord's will more perfectly. 

I have known something about this wonderful Truth for 
some years, and believed it to a certain extent, too, but just 
about a year ago I really started to study, and now I have 
consecrated, and am pressing down upon the "mark" for "the 
Prize" ahead. I wish to send in my name as one who has 
taken the Vow. I desire to have my name enrolled. 

Yours in the dear Redeemer, 

(Mrs.) EMMA SCOTT.-Ont, Can. 



DEAR PASTOR RUSSELL:- 

We feel that we cannot do less than write you to say that 
under God's guidance you have given us comfort that could 
come from no other source. Our son, a good and noble 
young man, but not a professor of religion, has been suddenly 
taken from us by death. I think our hearts would 
break if we believed, as we once did, that eternal torment 
awaited all but the righteous. 

Thank God that through the light of "present Truth" we 

page 187 

know without a doubt that he is hidden only until the wrath 
be overpast. We thank God and you for the blessed 
knowledge. 
Yours in His name, 
ANDREW R. and ANNIE S. MUSGRAVE.-Cape Breton. 



R5042 : page 187 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

Our three elders are doing good work, and we are all 
striving to grow in grace and knowledge and love. I pray 
constantly that daughter and I may be helps and not hindrances 
to the class. The hardest trial that has come to me 
during the years has been the spirit of disapproval among 
certain classes of Truth-people against any kind of prosperity- 
temporal or spiritual. 

After all the talk we hear, I have often seen the poor 
treat the rich in a much meaner way than I have ever seen 
the rich treat the poor. It seems that many people hate 
everybody who has more of anything than they have. I 
simply cannot comprehend such a spirit, and surely the 



Kingdom class cannot have any such spirit— regardless of 
professions along other lines! 

Just as I desire the Master's patience when I am ignorant 
and out of the way, I pray for patience toward all. I already 
love these— sincerely— but our own children, whom we love 
dearly, sometimes try our patience. "Cast not away your 
confidence, ...for ye have need of patience," is often in my 
mind, with the testimony that Enoch had, that he pleased 
God. 

So long as this peace of pleasing God is mine I can endure 
the contradiction of sinners, remembering how the Lord 
"endured the cross, despising the shame." Ours is a wonderful 
hope— not a floating, but an anchored one. 

Now, a question, please: Is it the part of wisdom for a 
Pilgrim to begin a public lecture by declaring that we do not 
believe in the divinity of Christ, the immortality of the soul, 
eternal torment and the Trinity, and not explain clearly what 
we do believe? 

The impression gathered is that we do not believe in the 
prehuman existence of our Lord, future life for mankind, 
penalty for sin, nor the Holy Spirit! 

The statement in January 15 TOWER satisfies me perfectly; 
but many did not seem to fully grasp it. The humanity of 
Jesus, the Deity of Christ; the personality of the Holy 
Spirit in Father and Son; immortality for Jesus and the 
Church— The Christ; everlasting life for many others, etc.— 
all this is a clear, comprehensible statement. 

After a Pilgrim had made the first-mentioned declaration 
in an Illinois town recently, the men who had attended the 
meeting, on invitation of a merchant-brother, went to him 
next day and said, "You need never talk to us again, for we 
will not listen." I shall be so glad when the "pure language" 
is turned to the poor, bewildered people— for how can they 
understand the now often misstated facts? Some of the 
friends of the Truth have been its greatest enemies! 

Once I heard a Pilgrim (now out of the Truth) say that 
all modern conveniences were of the Devil; all moral reforms 
were of the Devil, and all education was of the Devil— in 
fact, that everything but ignorance (and himself, perhaps) 
was of the Devil! 

I thought he was a child of darkness, fit for the "Dark 
Ages," and I was relieved when he was no longer a Pilgrim, 
and not surprised when he was entirely out of the Truth 
and an opposer of the Truth. 

I have heard testimonials in which friends "rejoiced" because 
ignorant "glorying in their shame"— because "not 
many wise are called"— apparently determined to remain as 
ignorant and unreasonable as possible— counting it a virtue! 
Surely we are "called" to be educated in the school of Christ! 

Often I find it is not so much the Truth that people oppose 
as misapprehensions gathered from misstatements of the 
friends. The real Truth is beautiful and satisfying, and acceptable 
when understood. 

Your Easter sermon was lucid enough to be easily understood 
by any of average intelligence. I rejoiced in this as I 
read it. 



Yours in the Blessed Hope, 



DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

Although it is so far back as the evening of April 4, 1910, 
since we registered before the Lord our Vow unto Him, I 
do not think you have been advised of this, and I therefore 
take this opportunity of informing you. 

The peace and joy, light and blessing which we had before 
taking the Vow (which we look at as being a ratification 
in detail of our consecration vow), have remained with 
us; yea, have increased a hundredfold, and upon our table 
are being laid good things continually, "meat in due Season," 
from the hand of the Lord's Wise Steward, to whom we are 
indebted for so much comfort and consolation. 

Believe me that you have a special interest in our prayers, 
and indeed in the prayers of all the brethren with whom we 
are at present privileged to meet. We ask an interest in 
your own prayers for the Church Universal, that we, with 
you, and with all saints, may be kept "faithful unto death," 
that we may receive "the Crown of Life" in God's due time. 

Yours in the Glorious Hope, 

SIDNEY AND HANNAH SMITH.-Eng.

1912-GENERAL CONVENTIONS- 19 12 



TORONTO, CANADA, JUNE 30-JULY 6, 7 

All sessions to be held in the Horticultural Hall at the 
Canadian National Exhibition Park, West Toronto, June 30-July 6. 
The Park is easily accessible by Grand Trunk Railway 
and by King Street and other trolley car lines. 

Railway Rates: Canadian railways give half fare rates 
for July 1 and the following day, possibly beginning June 30. 
American lines give low rates for a few days before and after 
July 4, available for friends in the border states. There are 
always special rates to Niagara Falls, which is only about two 
hours sail by steamer to Toronto, at a moderate price. There 
may be other excursion rates good for even ten days. Ask 
your local agent a week in advance. 

If no rate as low as l-l/2c. per mile each way is available, 
purchase a single ticket to Toronto, and have the agent fill 
out a certificate and bring it with you. This will entitle you 
to a return ticket at a greatly reduced rate— perhaps free. 

Lodging can be secured through the Committee at from 
50c. each per day (2 to a room) to $1.50 per person; in some 
cases this will include breakfast. All expecting to attend should 
give prompt notice by addressing the Convention Committee, 
c/o W. G. Brown, Sec'y, 51 Tiverton Ave., Toronto, Canada. 
Give full name of each person and indicate which prefer to 
room together, and at what rate. 

Brother Russell will deliver a public address in the Royal 
Alexandra Theatre, King St., West, at 3 p.m., July 7. 

WASHINGTON, D.C., JULY 7-14 

This Convention will be held in the suburbs of Washington 
City, D.C., at the Glen Echo Chautauqua Grounds, July 
6-14. Arrangements for board and lodging will be made by 
our Committee on request at such prices as you may authorize 
from $1.10 per day upward. No pains will be spared to 
make you comfortable as possible. All expecting to attend 
should notify us AT ONCE. Give full name of each person 
and indicate which prefer to room together, and at what rate. 

The Committee of investigation say, "The location is 
ideal. The average Park temperature is ten degrees lower 
than that of Washington City. The Auditorium is still cooler 
by reason of its peculiar location and the fact that it is built 
over running water." 

Washington City commands reasonable railway rates from 



all quarters. The railroads have granted the I.B.S.A. a 
special rate of one and one-half fares for the round trip from 
points East of Pittsburgh, on sale July 5, 6 and 7, return limit 
July 18. A specially cheap excursion is on sale to New York 
City and return with stop-over privileges at Washington. 

We are advised that the Pacific Coast friends are arranging 
for "Special Coach" service from San Francisco. The 
party will start from San Francisco via Southern Pacific, 
Train No. 4, at nine o'clock on the morning of July 2, and 
will go via Ogden, Cheyenne, Omaha, Chicago; leaving Chicago 
at 9:45 on the evening of July 5, arriving Washington 
early the second morning. 

Friends in the territory of this route may find it advantageous 
to join this party and can get all the necessary information 
by addressing C. W. Gerdes, 2552 Hyde St., San 
Francisco. Your railroad agent will be glad to secure definite 
information as to time of train, route, rate, etc., and can do 
so by telegraphing at once the agent of the Southern Pacific 
at San Francisco. 

GLASGOW AND LONDON CONVENTIONS 

The Glasgow General Convention will be held in St. 
Mungo Halls, South York street, July 25-28. Arrangements 
have been made for several prominent Brethren to give addresses. 
The meetings will be continuous, except for intermissions 

(Continued on Page 203.) 

page 203 

GLASGOW AND LONDON CONVENTIONS 

(Continued from Page 190.) 

for rest and refreshment— opening at 9:30 a.m. 

The Sunday meeting, specially arranged for the public, 
will be at St. Andrew's Grand Hall on Sunday, July 28, at 
6:30 p.m., and will constitute the conclusion of the Convention. 
Brother Russell will be the speaker. 

As the arrangements are being made in anticipation of 
considerable numbers of visitors from surrounding cities and 
country-side, all desirous of securing accommodations in advance 
will please address Brother G. MacKenzie, 28 Kilmailing 
road, Cathcart, Glasgow. 

Arrangements will be made for the accommodation of any 
of the friends desiring to symbolize their consecration by 
water immersion. A large attendance is expected and all who 
trust in the precious blood of Jesus as the basis for their 
acceptance with the Father are cordially invited. Come asking 
a blessing and seeking to impart one by "showing forth 
the praises of Him who has called us out of darkness into His 
marvelous light." 

The London Convention this year will be held in the 
London Tabernacle, Lancaster Gate W., August 1-4. An 
interesting list of speakers has been arranged for and a cordial 



invitation is extended to all who love the Lord in sincerity 
and truth and who are trusting in the merit of His blood and 
are fully consecrated to His service. Others who are seeking 
such a fellowship Divine are also invited. 

Those desirous of accommodations will please address the 
Society, the London Tabernacle. An opportunity for symbolizing 
consecration unto death by water immersion will be 
afforded. Robes and everything else necessary will be 
provided. 

A large attendance is confidently expected. It is to be hoped 
that all present will receive a heavenly benediction and be 
enabled to carry home with them refreshment to those not 
privileged to attend. 

To those who cannot attend this convention we suggest a 
fellowship of spirit during the days of the convention— that 
their thoughts be with the convention and their prayers also; 
that thus bearing up the interests of the brethren at the throne 
of grace they may have a share also in the refreshments of 
these seasons. 



BETHEL HYMNS FOR JULY

HOW JESUS PREACHED TO SPIRITS IN PRISON 

"Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the Just for the unjust, 
that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the 
flesh, but quickened in the spirit, by which [two 
experiences— death and resurrection] He preached 
unto the spirits in prison."— 1 Peter 3:18,19. 

THIS TEXT has been made the basis for some 
peculiar presentations. From it some have 
deduced an intermediate state lasting between 
death and the resurrection. Others 
have claimed it as an authority for the 
doctrine of Purgatory. The difficulty in 
every case seems to be the failure to remember 
that the Bible always and everywhere 
teaches that the dead are really dead, that 
they know nothing, and that, therefore, it 



would be impossible to do any preaching to the dead 
humans. Undoubtedly the theory that people are more 
alive after they die than when they were alive is responsible 
for nearly all of the foolish things which we have 
all at some time professed to believe. 

Before dismissing the thought that these "spirits in 
prison" are human spirits, let us note the fact that to say, 
"human spirits," is an absurdity of itself, because human 
beings are not spirits and spirit beings are not humans. 
"Who maketh His angels spirits," is the Scriptural proposition. 
True, we do sometimes speak of humans as 
possessing a spirit of life, but by this we merely mean 
that they possess the power or energy of life, and the 
same would be equally true of the lower orders of creation, 
beasts, fish, fowl, etc. 

Again, we sometimes speak of the Church as spirit 
beings— begotten of the Holy Spirit. Thus the Apostle 
speaks of the natural man in contrast with the New 
Creature, a spirit being. To appreciate this statement we 
must remember that the Church class receive the begetting 
of the Holy Spirit to the end that, if faithful, they 
may attain unto a spirit resurrection and become spirit 
beings, like unto the angels and like to the Redeemer. 
But we are not spirits yet, except by faith— by hope. However, 
the context shows the Apostle had no reference 
to the Church, either: we were not in prison; we received 
the message of salvation through the Apostles. 

SPIRITS ONCE DISOBEDIENT 

The spirits to whom the message was given had proven 
themselves disobedient, says St. Peter. He even tells us 
the time of their disobedience, namely, that it was "in the 
days of Noah, while the ark was preparing." Surely, if 
noticing these particulars mentioned in the context, no 
one would be excusable for misunderstanding this Scripture 
and considering it in any way applicable to humanity 
of our day or to humanity in general. However, it is 
helpful to us to learn the full particulars of the matter. 
What was their disobedience, and when and how were 
they imprisoned? 

Turning to Genesis 6:1-5, we find there the cause of 
the disobedience of those angels, who for a time had been 
permitted to see what they could do for the uplift of 
humanity, or, rather, permitted to demonstrate that the 
downward tendency of sin is incurable except in the 
manner which God has already arranged through 
Messiah and His glorious reign of a thousand years. 

Instead of those angels helping mankind out of sin 
they helped themselves into sin, and by so doing they increased 
the depravity amongst humanity until the astounding 
record is that "the wickedness of man was great 
in the earth, and that every imagination of the thought of 
his heart was only evil continually." The particular sin 
of those angels was that when they were granted the 
privilege of materializing— of taking human bodies for 



the sake of helping and instructing mankind— they misused 
this power and took to themselves the daughters of 
men for wives. 

Thus these angels came gradually to prefer to live as 
men amongst men and to rear earthly families rather than 
to abide in the condition in which they were created— 
spirit beings, higher than humans. Not only was this 
wrong in the sense that it was taking a course in opposition 
to the Divine arrangement, but it was wrong also 
because the thing was done for the cultivation and gratification 
of lust, and it led to their own moral defilement 
as well as having a baneful influence upon humanity; for 
we can readily see that for the angels, of superior powers 
and intelligence, to become leaders in lustful practices 
would mean a great influence upon mankind toward sin 
and defilement of mind and body. 

We are particularly told that the offspring of this 
improper union between the angels and the daughters of 
men were giants, both physically and mentally superior 
to the fallen human family— "men of renown." And this 
statement, that they were "men of renown," was at a 
time when manhood's estate was reached at a hundred 
years, and implies that God did not interfere to hinder or 
stop the progress of sin for perhaps several centuries. 
In the meantime the race had become so corrupt that 
apparently only Noah and his family were uncontaminated 
—all others had more or less come under the influence, 

R5043 : page 192 

directly or indirectly, of these fallen angels or their 
giant sons. Hence, of Noah it was written (not that he 
was a perfect man, but), "Now Noah was perfect in his 
generation" (uncontaminated) and his family apparently 
the same. Hence these alone were saved in the ark, while 
all the remainder, more or less contaminated, were destroyed 
by the flood. 

"IN CHAINS OF DARKNESS" 

It was then and there that God imprisoned those 
spirits, angels, who kept not their first estate, and are 
therefore called fallen angels, devils, demons. They were 
not imprisoned in some far-off world called hell, nor are 
they engaged there in stoking fires for the torture of poor 
humanity. Following the leading of the Scriptures we 
find that when the flood came they were not destroyed 
because, while their fleshly bodies which they assumed 
might indeed perish, yet they would merely dematerialize, 
or assume their spirit conditions again. 

The record is that God cast them down, that He condemned 
them to an overthrow— that they might not any 
longer associate with the holy angels, but must be reserved 
in tartarus— our earth's atmosphere. Here they were 
imprisoned, not in a special place, but in the sense of 
having their liberties restrained, "in chains of darkness." 



They were no longer permitted to materialize and thus 
to associate with humanity. These things are distinctly 
told us by St. Jude and St. Peter (Jude 6; 2 Peter 2:4,5) 
—an explanation in full harmony with the Genesis account 
of their fall. 

ONCE DISOBEDIENT-STILL DISOBEDIENT 

We, of course, cannot know that all of those fallen 
angels are still in a disloyal condition of heart. On the 
contrary, in harmony with our text, we may suppose that 
some of these fallen angels have since repented of their 
wrong course and it would be none too strong a way to 
state the matter— that any such repentant ones would 
surely have terrible experiences as a result. To be obliged 
to be in close touch and relationship with the more evil 
and malignant ones and to have knowledge of all their 
evil designs and efforts would be a terrible experience 
and, besides this, we may be sure that the rebellious would 
not hesitate to persecute the repentant ones in every conceivable 
manner, as they would be lawless, regardless of 
the Divine will. 

On the other hand, the repentant ones would be obliged 
to restrain themselves and to not render evil for evil, 
knowing that this would be contrary to the Divine will. 
In other words, repentant ones amongst those fallen 
spirits, influenced by the preaching of Jesus or otherwise, 
would have a kind of purgatorial experience, and the very 
thought calls forth our sympathy. 

When imprisoned or cut off from the privilege of 
materialization, many of the fallen spirits, we know not 
what proportion, continued their active opposition to 
God, after the manner of Satan. Hence they are spoken 
of as his angels, his messengers, his servants and he is 
spoken of as Beelzebub, the Prince of Demons. Satan, 
who sinned much earlier than the others, and in a different 
way, the Scriptures tell us was an angel of a higher 
rank, or a higher nature, and this superiority of his has 
made him the Prince or ruler over the hosts of fallen 
spirits. 

FIGHTING AGAINST GOD 

The fight of Satan and his fallen angels is against 
God, against all who are in harmony with Him, against 
all the regulations of righteousness, and against all the 
channels and servants whom the Lord may use. St. Paul's 
words along this line are forceful; he remarks that God's 
people contend not merely "with flesh and blood," but 
also "with wicked spirits in high positions," and the question 
arises, "Who is sufficient for these things?" The 
reply is that none is sufficient; without the aid of the 
Redeemer His church would be quite overcome and vanquished 
by evil. 

Likewise, without the Redeemer's aid through His 
Kingdom, without the binding of Satan, without our 



Lord's releasing of the world from the bondage of sin 
and death, there would be no hope of the world's recovery 
from its present bondage. But with the Apostle we exclaim, 
"If God be for us, who can be against us?"— 
Romans 8:31. 

R5044 : page 192 

THROUGH MEDIUMS AND OBSESSIONS 

Satan's original plan of attack was to bring our race 
under his influence by misrepresentation— by putting 
darkness for light and light for darkness— for instance, 
the temptation under which Mother Eve fell. Satan there 
represented himself as Eve's friend, giving her sound 
advice. He represented God as having a selfish motive 
behind His command that our first parents should not 
eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Satan 
declared that God had told an untruth when He said that 
the penalty for sin would be death. Satan declared that 
man cannot die. 

And has he not since kept up the same line of falsification? 
And has he not deceived the whole world upon this 
very subject? Do not all peoples in every land believe 
that when a man dies he does not die, but gets more alive 
—exactly Satan's lie of the first instance? How few 
have believed God, even amongst His people who truly 
love Him, and who truly desire to believe the teachings 
of His Word! We have all been under a kind of 
"hoodoo." "The god of this world [Satan] has blinded" 
our minds on this subject. We are now coming to see 
that death is the penalty for sin and that the resurrection 
is the salvation which God has promised and will provide. 

Satan has had powerful allies and servants in the fallen 
angels, and it is through their persistence that his lie has 
seemingly triumphed over the Divine Word— "Dying, thou 
shalt die." These fallen spirits have made various manifestations 
in every land for centuries, and thereby have 
apparently substantiated the theory that a dead man is 
more alive than when he was alive. Knowing that mankind 
would have nothing to do with them if their real 
personality were known they hide their personality and 
represent themselves as our dead friends who desire to 
speak with us, either directly or through mediums. 

A further desire of these angels is to obsess or to get 
possession of a human being. Being chained or restrained 
from the privilege of materialization, the next most 
desirable thing in their estimation is to gain control over 
a human being and to use his body instead of their own. 
This is styled obsession, and persons so afflicted today are 
sent to an insane asylum where, it is estimated, they constitute 
at least one half of the entire number. In the days 
of our Lord these were not mistakenly supposed to be 
insane, but rightly declared to be obsessed. All remember 
the New Testament account that our Savior and His 
Apostles cast out legions of fallen spirits from humanity. 



"KNOW YE NOT THAT THE SAINTS SHALL JUDGE 
ANGELS?" 

We need not discuss this question with Bible Students, 
for it is too well recognized to be disputed. We suggest 
a topical study of this subject by all of our readers. See 

R5044 : page 193 

how many times Jesus and the Apostles cast out demons, 
and note the particulars. Although we still have with us 
spirit mediums and many obsessed, we cannot know 
whether the proportionate number is greater or less 
than in our Lord's day. Since the world's population today 
is so much larger, the same number of evil spirits 
(which do not increase) would show proportionately less. 

But, however that may be, we may assume that some 
fruitage resulted from the great sermons preached to these 
in connection with the death and resurrection of our Lord, 
respecting which St. Peter tells us in our text. Additionally, 
St. Paul remarks, "Know ye not that the saints shall 
judge angels?" (I Corinthians 6:3.) We do know that 
the holy angels need no judging, no trial, hence the 
Apostle must in some way refer to a trial or judgment or 
testing of these spirits in prison who were once disobedient, 
in the days of Noah. And if the judgment or testing is a 
part of the Divine plan, it implies a hope for them, and 
in conjunction with St. Peter's statement in our text it 
gives the reasonable inference that the preaching which 
Jesus did to them was not wholly in vain. 

HOW JESUS PREACHED IN DEATH 

Here arises another question: If Jesus was really 
dead, as the Scriptures declare, if "He poured out His 
soul unto death," and "made His soul an offering for sin," 
and His soul was not raised from the dead until the third 
day after His crucifixion, how could He in the meantime 
preach to spirits in prison, or to anybody else? We reply 
that He could preach in the same way that the Apostle 
refers to in respect to Abel, saying, "He, being dead, yet 
speaketh" (Hebrews 11:4); and again, in the same way 
that the blood of Abel is said to have cried to God- 
figuratively. Of one thing we are sure, namely, that 
Jesus gave no oral address while He was dead. He 
preached in the way we sometimes refer to when we say, 
"Actions speak louder than words." 

It was the great object lesson which the fallen angels 
saw that constituted to them the great sermon that gave 
them a ground for hope. On several occasions the fallen 
spirits, when commanded to come out of human beings, 
declared that they knew Jesus. In the long ago they had 
known Him, when, as the Only Begotten of the Father 
and His Representative, He had created them and all 
things that are made, and was also the mouthpiece for all 



Divine orders and regulations. 

The fallen angels realized that He had come into the 
world to be its Redeemer; they perceived the great stoop 
that He had made from His lofty position on the heavenly 
plane to the servant position on the human plane. They 
admired His loyalty and faithfulness to God, but doubtless 
believed Him to be foolish; they never expected Him to 
arise from the dead. But when they perceived His resurrection 
on the third day to glory, honor and immortality, 
"far above angels, principalities and powers and every 
name that is named," His sermon to them was complete, 
namely, that "the wages of sin is death," but that "the 
gift of God is eternal life." (Romans 6:23.) And as 
they realized thus the Power of God and the Love of 
God for His human creatures, the Apostle's words imply 
that this constituted to them a message of hope. Perhaps 
if they would show full contrition God eventually would 
have mercy upon them, even as He had had mercy and 
had provided for humanity. 

The lesson is one for all. God's power is Infinite, so 
is His love, His mercy, His goodness. Nevertheless, every 
wilful sin will have its punishment, a just recompense of 
reward, and only the willing and obedient shall have the 
Divine favor and everlasting life. Let each apply the 
lesson to himself.

"THIS ONE THING I DO" 

"I determined not to know anything among you, save 
Jesus Christ and Him crucified."— 1 Cor. 2:2. 

THE TALENTED APOSTLE PAUL gives in 

another place his testimony as to the wisdom 

of shaking off some of our plans and arrangements 

and of relaxing our efforts in 

various directions in order to concentrate 

our energies upon those things which we 

can best bring to perfection, saying, "This 

one thing I do." (Phil. 3:13.) The 

Apostle's one business in life was to be, so 

far as he was able, acceptable to the Lord, 

personally, and to do with his might what he could to 

assist others into the same condition. 

In harmony with this, the thought of our text seems 
to be that whatever the Apostle knew respecting other 
matters prominent in his day— customs of the Age, 
scientific questions, etc.— he would ignore. He would 
be a specialist. He would confine his thoughts, words and 
teachings along this one line; for he thought it was 
worthy. He had been at Corinth as an ambassador of 
Christ. He was not there to air his knowledge, but to 
tell the message of the Kingdom. He would make preaching 



the Gospel his one business, to accomplish which he 
felt that all of his knowledge and energy were too little. 

The Apostle did not determine to ignore all of his 
knowledge without having a good reason, or purpose 
therefor. It was because he wished to concentrate all of 
his attention and influence upon one great subject. That 
subject was Jesus Christ, Jesus the Anointed; Jesus the 
Messiah was the main thought of all his preaching. He 
realized that the great Messiah was a part of the Divine 
Program which had been promised— the "Seed" which 
was to bless all the families of the earth; that Jesus was 
that great Messiah, and that all men should recognize 
Him, should flock to His standard. 

But St. Paul would preach, not only that Jesus was 
the Messiah, but that He was the crucified Messiah, for 
he would not be ashamed of the Divine teaching. He 
would preach that God sent forth His Son; and that the 
Son had left the glory He had with the Father, had 
lived on the earth, and had "died, the Just for the unjust," 
for this very purpose— that He might manifest His obedience 
to the Divine arrangement. In thus preaching 
Christ and His crucifixion, the Apostle was not ignoring 
the fact that there was to be a Church; Jesus was the 
Anointed Head over His Body, the Church. Hence, in 
preaching Jesus the Anointed One, St. Paul was showing 
how the Divine Plan was being outworked under Divine 
supervision, and what the glorious results would be. To 
these things he had determined that all his time and 
attention should go. 

How evident it is that today many ministers have lost 
something possessed by the Apostle, who thus recognized 
the importance of the Gospel of Christ! This loss very 
largely accounts for the various peculiar topics advertised 
for religious meetings; sometimes the topic is politics; 
sometimes temperance; sometimes woman-suffrage. The 
reason for this change from the old-time style of preaching 
is that during the Dark Ages the Gospel became perverted, 
misrepresented; and that now people are ashamed 
of what was formerly preached— "Be good and go to 

R5045 : page 194 

heaven; be bad and go to hell!" It is not a great message. 
We cannot wonder that an astute mind grasps the whole 
thing in a few minutes. We are rather glad, indeed, that 
ministers are ashamed to preach what their creeds profess, 
and that, therefore, their creeds must be kept in the 
background. 

"NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST" 

For us, however, who see the importance of the 
Gospel, the case is different. We know that this 
Gospel of the Kingdom, of which the Apostle was not 
ashamed, teaches that the elect Church is to be the Bride 
of Christ; that Messiah is to bless the whole world; that 



Jesus is the Messiah; that He was crucified, dead, 
buried, raised from the dead by His Father; that His 
crucifixion was a part of the great Divine Plan, and that 
without this very arrangement no salvation could be 
effected, either for the Church, or for the world in the 
future. Therefore, as the Apostle did, we are preaching 
Jesus, the Crucified One, who died for our sins, who 
rose again for our justification, and who, coming in glory 
with His Church, is the great Messiah, to bless the world 
through natural Israel. 

Because we have found the Truth we, like St. Paul, 
feel constrained to preach nothing but this Message. The 
same truth that influenced Him should influence us. If, 
therefore, any of the brethren feel disposed to go out 
after the manner of Babylon and preach something else, 
here is the reproof— "Not.. .anything save Jesus Christ 
and Him crucified." This is the only subject. St. Paul 
would be as though he knew nothing else. This subject 
would be the one thing to which he would give his time 
and attention. Let it be so with us! 

Beloved, as you value the glorious hope set before you, 
we beseech you that you give no heed to seducing spirits 
and doctrines of devils, as the Apostle terms them (I Tim. 4:1); 
but that with fixedness of purpose you apply yourselves 
to the one thing to which you are called, and which 
as prospective heirs of Messiah's Kingdom you are privileged 
to do. Let us not forget that we are a "peculiar people," 
separate from the great body of nominal Christians, 
as well as from the world, having higher hopes, aims and 
ambitions, and favored with a clearer insight into the deep 
things of God, having been called out of our former 
darkness into His marvelous light. Thus separate from 
the world and from Christians who partake largely of the 
spirit of the world, what wonder if we find them all out 
of harmony with us, and either ignoring or opposing us! 

We expect such opposition; and we know that it will 
continue until our course has been finished in death. If 
we endure hardness as good soldiers for the Truth's sake, 
no matter how that hardness may come, in our efforts to 
do the Lord's will and to advance the interests of His 
Kingdom, then we are presenting our bodies as living 
sacrifices in the Divine service. To be really in His 
service includes both the careful and continual study of 
God's Plan, and the imbibing of its spirit, leading to an 
enthusiastic zeal for its accomplishment, and to activity 
to the extent of ability in its service, whatever the cost 
or sacrifice it may require. 

If faithful in this service we have neither time nor 
disposition to give heed to other themes having no bearing 
on the one thing to which we have solemnly dedicated our 
lives. If we have consecrated all to God our time is not 
our own; and consequently we have none to spare for the 
investigation of theories built upon any other foundation 
than that laid down in the Bible. Nor have we time to 
devote to the ideas and pursuits which engross the 
world's attention, many of which are harmless or even 



elevating in themselves, but which would be harmful and 
degrading to us if we allow them to occupy consecrated 
time and to divert our attention from the one thing we 
ought to be doing. 

The Apostle warns us to "Shun profane and vain 
babblings; for they will increase unto more ungodliness"; 
but counsels, "Study to show thyself approved unto God, 
a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing 
the Word of Truth"; "Teach no other doctrine, 
neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which 
minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in 
faith."-2 Tim. 2:16,15; I Tim. 1:3,4. 

HOW NARROW THIS WAY! 

Is not this a very narrow way? Yes, so narrow that 
our Lord foretold respecting it, "Strait [difficult] is the 
gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto [the] 
life, and few there be that find it!" (Matt. 7:14.) It is 
so narrow that it is wide enough to admit only the Lord's 
Plan and those who are willing to discard all other plans, 
projects and questionings, and to devote themselves fully 
to its service; and who are quite willing to bear any reproach 
it may bring. 

Are you endeavoring from day to day to vindicate the 
Divine character and to make known God's righteous 
ways? Are you diligently studying to make yourself 
thoroughly familiar with the Truth, so that you may 
indeed be a living epistle known and read of all men 
within the circle of your influence? Are you indeed a 
workman that need not be ashamed (2 Tim. 2:15)? 
Are you of those who have really given themselves to 
the Lord, saying truthfully to Him: 
"Take myself— I will to be 
Ever, only, all for Thee"? 

If so, you are just narrow minded enough to say, 
"This one thing I do; and I make everything else bend 
to this one thing of showing forth God's praises and of 
helping others into His marvelous light; and to this end 
I cultivate and use what talents I possess as a wise steward 
of my Heavenly Father." 

Dearly beloved, we impose neither vows nor bondage 
upon each other, but the call has its own limitations; the 
Master has directed us to teach all nations (for the Gospel 
is no longer confined to the Jewish nation), not astronomy 
nor geology nor any of the vain philosophies about which 
the world speculate, but— "Observe all things whatsoever 
I have commanded you."— Matt. 28:20. 

This is what the Apostle Paul did. Hear him in his 
zeal for this one thing to which he had devoted his life: 
"And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not 
with the excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring 
unto you the mystery of God; for I determined 
not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and 
Him crucified. [I riveted your attention on this one 
thing! I kept this one thing continually before you.]... 



And my speech and my preaching were not with enticing 
words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the 
Spirit and power [of the Truth], that your faith should 
not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of 
God."-I Cor. 2:1-5. 

St. Paul was an outspoken, uncompromising teacher. 
When he knew that he had the Truth, he spoke it with 
confidence, and boldly declared that everything contrary 
to it is false doctrine. He also taught believers that 
it was not only their privilege, but their duty to be established 
in the faith, to know on the evidence of God's 
Word, why they believed, and to be able to give to every 
man that inquired a reason for the hope that was in them. 

Let it be so with us also. Each consecrated believer 

R5045 : page 195 

should ask himself, "How carefully have I studied that 

which I recognize as Divine Truth? How fully capable 

am I of handling the Sword of the Spirit?" Few indeed 

are those who can say they have fully digested and assimilated 

all they have received; and that they have let 

none of these things slip from memory; that they have so 

treasured it up in their hearts that it is their meditation 

by day and by night; that they have a ready answer— a 

"Thus saith the Lord"— for every man that asks them a 

reason for the hope that is in them, concerning any point 

of doctrine; that they can clearly and intelligently portray 

the Divine Plan, quote the Divine authority for each successive 

step of it, and, if need be, point out its place in 

the Divine system of types. To gain such proficiency in 

the Word is the work of a lifetime; but every day should 

see a closer approximation to that proficiency, and will if 

we are faithful students and faithful servants of the 

Truth. 

If all the consecrated were thus busily engaged in 
putting on the armor of God, and in proving it by actual 
use in zealous endeavor to herald the Truth and to help 
others to stand, there would be no time left for even 
good temperance reform work, nor for work among the 
slums of the great cities, nor for the doctrine of 
healing, nor any such things. We have no consecrated 
time for these matters, which are only side issues and not 
harmful in themselves, except as they divert attention 
and consume time which has been consecrated to another 
and higher use. All these works will be effectually 
accomplished in the "Times of Restitution" (Acts 3:19-22), 
now in the near future. Besides, there are 
others engaged in these works; we recognize and 
seek to accomplish the work set before us in the Divine 
Plan. 

In all the history of the Church there has never been 
a time in which the great Adversary has been so active in 
diverting attention from the Truth by introducing unprofitable 
and irrelevant questions as at present. Just now, 
when the exaltation and glory of the Church are soon to 



be accomplished, and when the faithful are about to be 
received into the joy of their Lord, Satan is resorting to 
every device in order to beguile them of their reward and 
to frustrate this feature of the Divine Plan. 

But really to frustrate any part of the Divine Plan is 
impossible. God has purposed to take out from among 
men a "little flock," "a people for His name"; and such 
a company is assuredly being gathered. Yet whether all 
those now in the race for the prize will surely be of that 
company, is still an open question. Take heed, beloved, 
that no man take thy crown. (Rev. 3:11.) If any come 
short of their privileges and prove unworthy of the rich 

R5046 : page 195 

inheritance, there are others who will quickly fill their 
places. 

Our observation of those consecrated ones who have 
permitted other themes than this "Gospel of the Kingdom" 
to engross time and attention, leads us to advise such to 
be very jealous in husbanding time and talent for the 
ministry of the Gospel, leaving all subjects outside of this, 
however interesting they may be, to those who prefer to 
devote time to them now; and to the future life for ourselves, 
when all knowledge shall be ours. We have invariably 
observed that those who, for any avoidable cause, 
have turned aside from the true and only Gospel, are 
quickly turned out of the way or greatly hindered in their 
course toward the "prize" of our "high calling." 

May we, dear brethren, be able truthfully to express 
our position in the words of the Apostle: "This one thing 
I do; forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching 
forth unto those things which are before, I press toward 
the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in 
Christ Jesus"; "I determined not to know anything among 
you, save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified."— Phil. 3:13,14; 
I Cor. 2:2. 



R5046 : page 195 

CHRIST MADE A CURSE FOR ISRAEL 

IT HAS ESCAPED the attention of many 
Bible Students that, while the Israelites had 
many advantages every way under their 
Law Covenant (Rom. 3:1,2), yet each one 
who failed to meet all the requirements of 
that Law Covenant came under a curse, or 
sentence, not upon individuals of other 
nations. Thus it is written, "Cursed is every 
one [every Israelite] that continueth not in 
all the words of the Law [Covenant] to 
do them."-Gal. 3:10. 
The Apostle shows that this curse was upon only 



those who were under that Covenant, saying, "What 
things soever the Law [Covenant] saith, it saith unto them 
who are under the Law [Covenant.]" (Rom. 3:19.) Moses 
also made the same statement— "The Lord our God made 
a Covenant with us in Horeb. The Lord made not this 
Covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us who are 
all of us here alive this day." (Deut. 5:2,3.) Indeed, 
no other arrangement would have been just, for the 
blessings of that Covenant and its promises of life were 
to the one nation. (Rom. 9:4.) How, then, could its 
curse extend beyond the nation which enjoyed its favors 
and privileges? 

The blessings of that Law Covenant were earthly, and 
so also were its curses; with one exception, noted further 
along, neither blessings nor curses related to the everlasting 
future. The future had already been determined 
for them and for all the race of Adam, in the death 
sentence pronounced in Eden. Nothing short of the 
ransom price— the corresponding price— which our Lord 
gave long afterwards, could set aside that original 
sentence, and secure for mankind a complete release from 
the sentence of death. The sin-offerings of Israel's Day 
of Atonement were not of permanent value, but only for 
a year in advance, and were, therefore, repeated yearly. 

THE LAW COVENANT GUARANTEED LIFE TO ONLY 

ONE MAN 

The blessings and curses of the Law Covenant were 
very particularly explained to Israel. (See Deut. 28, 
entire chapter.) This Covenant included every member 
of the nation of Israel, so that they shared in common the 
blessings or the curses. There was one provision, however, 
for an individual, namely, that the man who would 
fully obey all the requirements of the Law should live— 
be guaranteed lasting life. (Lev. 18:5.) Even if Israel 
may have imagined it possible for all or for many of the 
nation to thus gain life everlasting, we can see that God 
never had any such expectation concerning them. He 
knew from the beginning what He has taught us by 
experience, as well as by the inspired words of the 
Apostles, that "By the deeds of the Law shall no flesh 
[i.e., none of the fallen race, needing justification] be 
justified in God's sight."— Rom. 3:20. 

The Man Christ Jesus, who obeyed the Law absolutely, 
was the One in the Divine purpose for whom the provision 
was made, that "He that doeth these things shall live." 

R5046 : page 196 

Consequently, He had a right to life everlasting, and 
therefore might have asked for more than twelve legions 
of angels to defend Him from those who sought His life. 
Had He done so, He would have received them. (Matt. 26:53.) 
But He laid down His life. The one death, 
begun at Jordan and "finished" three and a half years 



later at Calvary, accomplished two things: one for Israel 
only, the other for the whole world. 

Since the children of Israel, as well as the other nations, 
were Adam's posterity, they in common with others 
shared his sentence of death, and were redeemed by our 
Lord's offering of Himself a sin-offering and corresponding 
price for Adam and those who lost life in Adam. 
(Rom. 5:12,18.) But since Israel alone, and no other 
nation or family or people of earth, had been brought 
under the terms of the Law Covenant made with them at 
Mt. Sinai, therefore only Israelites needed to be "redeemed 
from the curse of the Law [Covenant]."— 
Gal. 3:13. 

That the one Man, Christ Jesus, could justly redeem 
our race is stated by the Apostle, and is clearly evident 
when we see that all men were sentenced in the one man 
Adam; but how could one man redeem the multitudinous 
nation of Israel from the curse of their Law Covenant? 

MOSES THE TYPICAL FATHER OF ISRAEL 

We answer that in connection with Israel's Covenant 
there is a point that few have noticed. It is that God 
dealt with only one man in connection with the making 
of that Law Covenant; and that man was Moses, who 
stood in the position of a father to the whole nation, the 
nation being regarded and treated as children under age. 

See Moses' own words regarding the matter: "And 
Moses said unto the Lord, Wherefore hast Thou afflicted 
Thy servant? And wherefore have I not found favor 
in Thy sight that Thou layest the burden of all this 
people upon me? Have I conceived all this people? 
Have I begotten them, that Thou shouldest say unto me, 
Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father bearing the 
sucking child, unto the land which Thou swearest unto 
their fathers? Whence should I have flesh to give unto all 
this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us 
flesh that we may eat. I am not able to bear all this 
people alone, because it is too heavy for me. And if Thou 
deal thus with me, kill me, I pray Thee, out of hand, if I 
have found favor in Thy sight; and let me not see my 
wretchedness."— Num. 11:11-15. 

The Lord talked with Moses in the Mount. The Lord 
gave the tables of the Law to Moses. And Moses spoke 
to the people, gave them the Law and bound them by the 
terms of the Law Covenant. 

"Moses alone shall come near the Lord."— Exod. 24:2. 

"As the Lord spoke unto Moses, so did the children of 
Israel."— Num. 5:4. 

"The people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto 
the Lord. "-Num. 11:2. 

God "sent Moses His servant."— Psa. 105:26. 

"They envied Moses also in the camp."— Psa. 106:16. 

"He [God] said that He would destroy them, had not 
Moses, His chosen, stood before Him in the breach."— 
Psa. 106:23. 



"Remember ye the Law of Moses My servant."— 
Mai. 4:4. 

"Moses. ..hath in every city them that preach him." 
-Acts 15:21. 

"Did not Moses give you the Law?"— John 7:19. 

"What did Moses command you?"— Mark 10:3. 

"One accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust."— 
John 5:45. 

All Israel were "baptized unto [into] Moses, in the 
cloud and in the sea."— I Cor. 10:2. 

"He that despised Moses' Law died without mercy."— 
Heb. 10:28. 

"The Law was given by Moses, but grace and Truth 
came by Jesus Christ."— John 1:17. 

So thoroughly was the one man Moses the representative 
and typical father of the nation of Israel that God 
could and did propose its destruction and the fulfilment 
of all His engagements with Moses' family instead. 
(Exod. 32:10,31,32.) It was thus, as God's representative 
on the one hand, and as Israel's representative on 
the other, that Moses could be and was the mediator of 
the Law Covenant between God and that nation. 

CHRIST THE "EVERLASTING FATHER" 

When the Man Christ Jesus, by full obedience to the 
Law Covenant, became entitled to life everlasting under 
its provisions, He had attained the right to "Moses' seat," 
the right to supersede Moses as the Lawgiver and representative 
of the nation. Of Him Moses bore witness 
saying, "A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto 
you of your brethren, like unto me; Him shall ye hear in 
all things. "-Acts 3:22; Deut. 18:18,19. 

By fulfilling the requirements of the Law Covenant 
and by His obedience even unto death, Christ became the 
heir of its promise of life, and the prospective Mediator 
of the prospective New Covenant, based upon that better 
and everlasting sacrifice for sins, which, therefore, needed 
not to be repeated yearly, and was effective, not for 
Israel only, but for all the families of the earth, for "this 
Man," "the Man Christ Jesus, gave Himself a Ransom 
for all." (I Tim. 2:6.) Hence this Gospel of the New 
Covenant was for the Jew first and also for the Greek 
(or Gentile). Thus the one sacrifice, finished at Calvary, 
did not only a special work for Israel, but also a general 
work of redemption for the world, including Israel, which 
suretied the New Covenant and in due time will make it 

R5047 : page 196 

operative for all mankind. 

Thus seen, the expression, "Christ is the end [fulfilment] 
of the Law [Covenant] for righteousness [justification] 
to every one that believeth" (Rom. 10:4), can 
apply only to Jews who have by faith accepted Christ. It 
cannot apply to others— either to those who never were 



Jews and who consequently were never under that Covenant, 
or to those who still trust in Moses' Covenant and 
who are still vainly seeking life by obedience to its 
provisions, law, etc. 

ISRAEL NOW UNDER THE CURSES OF THE LAW 

It is a common mistake to suppose the Scriptures to 
teach that the Law Covenant died, or was destroyed by 
our Lord. It became dead in the sense that its proffer of 
life ceased when our Lord Jesus fulfilled the requirements 
of the Law Covenant, and inherited all of its blessings 
and life-rights; but it lives in the sense that its blessings 
and curses still cling to Israel, as so many assets and 
liabilities. Hence all the children of Jacob are still bound 
by this Law Covenant, unless they have died to it. 

Only those who realize that they cannot gain everlasting 
life through their union with Moses (the Law 
Covenant) are ready to abandon all hope of saving their 
life by that union with Moses and to become dead to all 
such expectations, and to accept the death of Christ, the 
Ransom price for Adam and all his race, as the basis of 
a new hope of a new life. Hence, only those Israelites 
who by faith reckoned themselves as hopelessly dead 
under the Law Covenant, and as risen with Christ to a 
new life secured by His sacrifice, and who in will are 

R5047 : page 197 

dead to sin— only such could be united to Christ as members 
of the "Seed" of the Abrahamic Covenant. 

Thus, according to the Apostle's reasoning, the idea 
of so blending the two Covenants that Christians are 
united to both Moses and Christ, is wholly out of the 
question. Gentiles, who never were under the Law 
Covenant, could not, of course, be released from it; and 
in order for a Jew to be released from that Covenant he 
must by faith recognize that Jesus Christ fulfilled the 
terms of the Law Covenant, and then must consecrate 
his flesh to death with Christ as reckonedly a member 
of Christ's flesh, that so doing he might be reckoned as a 
"New Creature," united to the Lord as a member of His 
spiritual Body. 

The text, "Christ is the end [or fulfilment] of the 
Law [Covenant] for righteousness to every one [under it] 
that believeth" (Rom. 10:4), does not conflict with the 
above; for only believers are specified. Eph. 2:15, "Having 
abolished in His flesh the enmity of the Law of commandments 
contained in ordinances," and Col. 2:14, refer 
to Jewish believers, for whom the handwriting of ordinances 
is blotted out, while Col. 2:20 refers to the Gentile 
converts who must become dead to the "rudiments of the 
world," before entering upon the Covenant of sacrifice, 
even as the Jews must become dead to the rudiments of 
their Law Covenant. 



ISRAEL'S PRESENT EXPERIENCE A PART OF THEIR 
COVENANT 

That the Law Covenant with Israel is still binding 
upon that nation is further evident from the fact that 
upon their national rejection of Christ they were nationally 
blinded until the end of the Gospel Age (Rom. 1 1 :7,25), 
and that God declares that He has not cast away His 
people of that Covenant, but that under the New Covenant 
He will open their eyes to see Christ as the only 
Door of hope, that of a new life purchased with His own 
blood. -Rom. 11:27,29; compare Deut. 30:1-9. 

Meanwhile, we have the evidence that their Covenant 
continues in force in the fact that, as a nation, they have 
for centuries been receiving the very "curses" specified 
under their Covenant. (See Deut. 28:15-67.) Verses 49-53 
describe the Roman siege, etc.; verses 64-67 describe 
the condition of Israel since. As shown in previous writings 
the Lord (Lev. 26:18-45) declared the symbolical 
"seven times," 2,520 years, of Israel's subjection to the 
Gentiles, and their deliverance— A. D. 1914. Thus their 
present experience was foretold as a part of their 
Covenant. 

Israel as a nation is still bound by that Covenant which 
they at first supposed would bring life, but which experience 
proved could bring them only death, because of 
the weakness of their flesh and their inability to fulfil its 
requirements expressed in its Law of Ten Commandments. 
There is only one door of escape from it, viz., 
Christ, and the New [Law] Covenant which is soon to 
be made with Israel. God shut them up to this one and 
only hope (Gal. 3:23), and He promises that by and by, 
when the Gospel Church, the Body of Christ, has been 
selected, He will open their blind eyes and cause them to 
see Christ in His true character— as their Redeemer 
from sin and their Deliverer from death and their Covenant 
of death.-Rom. 11:25-29. 

CHRIST MADE A CURSE FOR ISRAEL ONLY 

As to the significance of the statement, "Christ hath 
redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a 
curse for us, for it is written, Cursed is every one that 
hangeth on a tree" (Gal. 3:13), the Apostle in this text 
is speaking, not to Christians in general, but to those 
Christians who had passed from Moses into Christ— out 
of the Law Covenant into the Covenant of sacrifice with 
Christ, as members of His Body. It would not be true to 
say that Christ redeemed us Gentiles from the curse of 
the Law, for we were never under the Law. Those, 
therefore, who were under the curse of the Law were 
Jews. The Apostle classifies himself with Israel, some 
of whom were in Galatia, some in Palestine, etc. "Christ 
hath been made a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed 
is every one that hangeth on a tree." 

The particular sense in which Christ redeemed the 



Jews was as a nation and not as individuals. The whole 

nation was involved in the contract made at Sinai. Consequently, 

in order to meet all the requirements of the 

people as a whole, the One who would redeem Israel 

from the baneful effects of the Law Covenant must suffer 

the extreme penalty imposed by that Covenant. Therefore 

to redeem Israel from that condemnation our Lord 

had to be crucified. 

As for the remainder of mankind, they suffer from 
the sentence of death that came upon Adam, but no particular 
form of death was implied. The Jews alone needed 
this particular form of death for their release. The whole 
nation was under this Law Covenant because the contract 
was made with them as a nation and through one 
mediator, Moses. Our Lord will redeem the whole nation 
from their failure to keep that Law, from the condemnation 
of that Law, by instituting the New Covenant, by 
taking over into the New Covenant all those who were 
under the old Law Covenant. 

That New Covenant will go into operation in due time. 
Christ has already redeemed the Jews and all mankind in 
the sense that He has laid down the Ransom price; but 
He has not yet redeemed them in the sense of recovering 
them nor even in the sense of applying that price. At 
the end of this Age He will apply the price for Israel 
and the world; and then the New Covenant arrangements 
will go into effect for the blessing of all who come under 
its regulations.

BEYOND THE VEIL 

These stammering lips, that now 
So vainly strive to speak Thy praise- 
Beyond the veil 
Shall make the heaven of heavens resound 
Through endless days. 

These yearning eyes, that strain 

To catch by faith a glimpse of Thee— 

Beyond the veil 
Shall see Thee as Thou art through all 

Eternity. 

These trembling hands, these feet, 
That seek to serve so earnestly— 

Beyond the veil 
Shall for Thy Kingdom's glorious work 

Empowered be. 

And this poor, throbbing heart, 
That cannot now unfold its love- 
Beyond the veil 



Shall bloom and shower its fragrance through 
The heaven above. 

My soul, that neither seeks 

Nor findeth here its perfect rest- 
Beyond the veil 

Shall in Thy likeness wake and be 
Forever blest!

EMBRYO KINGDOM PARABLES 

-MARK 4:26-32; MATTHEW 13:33 -JULY 21.- 

Text: "Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on 
earth as it is done in heaven."— Matt. 6:10. 

MANY OF US in the past have overlooked the 
fact that nearly all of the teachings of the 
Redeemer appertain to the Kingdom— His 
Messianic Kingdom. Some of us indeed had 
gotten the unscriptural thought that Messiah's 
Kingdom would consist merely of a 
sovereignty in the hearts of His followers 
and in the present life. 

Now we see the real import and connection 
of the Great Teacher's numerous utterances 
on this subject. As He taught us to pray, "Thy 
Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth, even as it is 
done in heaven," He meant that we should have in mind 
God's glorious promise that eventually, through Messiah's 
Kingdom, ignorance, sin and death will all be overthrown, 
and the willing and obedient of mankind will be released 
from these until "every knee shall bow and every tongue 
confess" to the glory of God. 

Our Lord meant that we should connect this Kingdom 
with the great promise made to Abraham, "In thy Seed 
shall all the families of the earth be blessed." The Master's 
teachings and the Message which He commissioned 
us to give in His name is the Gospel of the Kingdom— 
the Message of coming glory, and the Message that now 
God is selecting a "little flock" to be the spiritual Seed of 
Abraham, joint-heirs with Jesus in the Throne of that 
Kingdom. Paul refers to this in Galatians 3:29: "And if 
ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's Seed, and heirs 
according to the promise." 

Today's study sets before us a number of Jesus' 
parables respecting the Kingdom. The majority of these 
refer to the Kingdom class of the present time rather 
than to the Kingdom in its fully developed state during 
the thousand years of His glory. All of God's consecrated 
people, begotten of the Holy Spirit during this Age— since 



Pentecost— constitute together the Kingdom class, the 
Kingdom in embryo— unfinished, undeveloped, incomplete. 
Some of these embryo members of the Kingdom may yet 
fail to make their calling and election sure, and they may 
become "castaways" as respects the glory and honor to 
which they have been called. 

THE KINGDOM DEVELOPMENT SLOW 

The first illustration of our lesson is that God's Kingdom 
in its present embryotic condition is of slow, gradual, 
methodical development, covering the entire period of this 
Gospel Age. It is like seed cast into the ground, which 
brings its maturity after many days and varied experiences 
—when it is finally harvested. Jesus and the Apostles 
did the seed sowing, not only for their own day but for 
the whole wheat class developed throughout this Age. 
And as Jesus explained in another parable, "The Harvest 
is the end of the Age." The gathering for the heavenly 
garner will be accomplished by the First Resurrection. 

LIKE A MUSTARD SEED 

The different parables do not view the embryo Kingdom 
from the same standpoint. It is because it may be 
viewed from such a variety of angles that so many 
parables are given us. Just so we might take various 
photographs of a building. One might show the eastern 
side, another the western, another the front elevation, 
another the floor-plan, and another show it with its scaffolding 
Or, if a concrete building, the frame work might 
be pictured, inside of which the concrete is cast. 

The parable of the mustard seed appears to represent 
the Kingdom from the viewpoint of the world— as the 
nominal church, developed from the original little seed 
of the true Gospel. From that little seed we have a great 
institution today with many denominational branches. 
But alas! its thrifty development has invited into its 
branches the fowls of the air, which the Lord elsewhere 
describes as representing the Wicked One and his angels 
—Satan and his representatives— who of course should 
have no place in the Church; and they would have no 

R5050 : page 198 

place in it if the Church were loyal and zealous enough 
to proclaim only the true Gospel and the narrow way of 
self-denial. 

Indeed, it is the neglect to preach this Gospel of the 
"narrow way" that has brought such prosperity to nominal 
Christianity and made it a desirable place for the fowls 
of the air— Satan and his deluded ones— to lodge in its 
branches, to be the real life of Ecclesiasticism. This seems 
to be the same picture which the same Great Teacher 
gives us in Revelation 18:2. There we read that the 
nominal systems are represented symbolically as Babylon; 



and there we read, "She hath become the hold of every 
foul spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird." 
The word "cage" would seem to imply that these unclean 
birds are considered very desirable, and are held 
on to by nominal Christianity— probably because regarded 
as being amongst their best paying members and because 
of having the most attractions. 

PARABLE OF THE LEAVEN 

Throughout the Scriptures leaven is used as the symbol 
of sin. Thus when Jesus in His purity was to be 
symbolized as the "bread from heaven," the Jews were 
directed to use unleavened bread. Again, at their annual 
Passover season, the Jews were directed to cleanse their 
houses of leaven, to burn it up, to destroy it. Here again 
leaven was a symbol of sin, corruption. St. Paul, commenting 
on this, writes to the Church, "Purge out, therefore, 
the old leaven [sin, malice, hatred, strife, etc.], that 
you may be a new lump"— that you may be, with Christ, 
the one unleavened loaf. It is of this Loaf that he declares, 
"For we, being many, are One Loaf, and one Body; 
for we are all partakers of that One Loaf."— I Cor. 10:17. 

It is true that in one of the official sacrifices bread was 
to be baked with leaven; but this, we believe, was for the 
very purpose of symbolizing or representing us, the 
Church, and the fact that we were by nature sinners, children 
of wrath, even as others, and that the baking would 
arrest the corrupting influences of the leaven; and this 
baking represented symbolically the experiences through 
which the Church must pass in order that sinful and corrupting 
tendencies might be completely destroyed in us. 

In this parable our Lord represents a woman mixing 
leaven with a family baking of meal, with the result that 
the whole mass was leavened. Consequently, if any of 
the family desired pure, unleavened bread, it would be 
unobtainable, because the leaven pervaded the entire baking. 
What does this represent? We reply that in Scriptural 
symbolism a woman represents an ecclesiastical system. 
The woman in the parable represents a system organized 
and in power at an early date, and possessed of 
the pure meal— the pure food provided by the Lord for the 
household of faith. 

The woman mixed leaven, error, false doctrine, with 
all the meal, with all the food supplied. Not a particle 
of it was left uncontaminated. The result has been indigestion. 
The Word of God, originally pure, is no longer 
accepted. The leaven, or fermentation, has spread so that 

R5050 : page 199 

today the entire mass of theological doctrine is putrid and 
offensive to all Christian people of all denominations. 

The parable was a prophecy of what has occurred. It 
is time all true Christians were hearkening back from the 
creeds of the Dark Ages to the Words of Jesus, the Apostles 



and the Prophets. We are glad to note that "His 
Holiness, the Pope," is prominent amongst those who are 
pointing back again to the teachings of the Bible, as being 
the unadulterated Word of God, which alone "is able to 
make us wise unto salvation," and by which alone "the 
man of God may be thoroughly furnished unto every good 
work."— 2 Tim. 3:15-17.

GOD'S WHEAT FIELD 

-MATTHEW 13:24-30,36-43. -JULY 28.- 

Text: "Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in 
bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into My Garner.' 
Verse 30. 

OUR International Sunday School Lessons are 

specially helpful this year. We are glad 

that the selection contains so many lessons 

on the Kingdom. This topic heretofore has 

not had sufficient consideration, considering 

its prominence in the Bible— from the promise 

made to Abraham, recorded in Genesis, 

to the records of Revelation, representing 

the full establishment of the Kingdom, its 

binding of Satan, and its thousand years of 

prosperity, resulting in the bringing of "every creature in 

heaven and in earth" to worship and praise the Almighty, 

and in the abolishment of sin, tears and death.— Gen. 22:18; 

Rev. 20:2; 21:4; 5:13. 

Today's study is another of the Kingdom parables, and 
one of the few which the Master particularly explained, 
and in harmony with which all the other parables are to 
be interpreted. Again it is the embryo Kingdom that is 
pictured, and not the Kingdom in glory; in other words, 
this parable also relates to this Gospel Age, and the work 
of selecting the Church. It therefore pictures the entire 
Age from start to finish. 

"THE FIELD IS THE WORLD" 

Our Lord's personal ministry was to the Jews only, 
and likewise His disciples labored only with the Jews for 
the fixed period of time— until the end of "the seventy 
weeks" of the promise of Divine favor to that nation. 
Those symbolic weeks ended three and a half years after 
Jesus' crucifixion. Then the door was thrown open to 
the Gentiles also, Cornelius being the first Convert. ~ 
Acts 10. 

This parable also shows us the very commencement of 
the Lord's call for His Bride from amongst all nations, 
and not from the Jews alone, although in the Divine Plan 



it was necessary that they should have the first opportunity. 
So St. Paul declares, saying to the Jews, "It was 
necessary that the Gospel should be preached first unto 
you, but seeing ye reject it,...lo, we turn to the 
Gentiles." (Acts 13:46.) The entire world constituted the 
"field" for the sowing of the "good seed," and the "good 
seed" is not any and every kind of a message, but is 
strictly defined, "the Gospel of the Kingdom." 

Jesus and the Apostles sowed this "good seed," and all 
His true followers since have been authorized to continue 
the work in His name, and have more or less done so. 
But the Adversary, Satan, as pointed out here in the 
parable, brought in false doctrines, false teachings, a 
different kind of seed from the Kingdom "seed," and 
sowed this everywhere over the wheat field. The result 
is that today the "tares" are so plentiful, and so conspicuous 
that they think they are the "wheat," and the 
world in general so considers them. 

The wheat class are considered "a peculiar people." 
Their hopes and ambitions in life are toward bearing good 

R5049 : page 199 

fruit, and "showing forth the praises of Him who called 
them out of darkness." Of their good fruits the Apostle 
mentions meekness and humility, and these tend to bow 
their heads, while the "tares" stand proudly up, erect, in 
the display of their "form of godliness," which, however, 
lacks the power. 

"LET BOTH GROW TOGETHER" 

The Lord knew all the time what Satan would do in 
the way of perverting the Truth through false doctrines, 
which would tend to make void and belittle the Gospel 
of the Kingdom and the children of the Kingdom; but He 
allowed the matter to go on, fully assured that He would 
have in the end the crop which He desired, and very content 
to allow a great lesson to be taught by the presence 
of the "tares" and the ultimate treatment accorded the 
"wheat." 

The Lord could have hindered the Adversary from 
bringing in the false doctrines in the early centuries, or 
He could have separated centuries ago between the wheat 
and tare classes, but this was not according to His intention, 
as the parable shows. He purposed to "let both grow 
together until the Harvest." So it has been true that 
Christians and imitation Christians have lived side by side 
in the same city, in the same house, and oftentimes in the 
same family— the one the result of the true Gospel Message 
of the Kingdom, leading to a full consecration and 
begetting of the Holy Spirit, and to the entrance upon a 
new life; the other with merely "a form of godliness," 
intermixed with worldly wisdom, earthly ambitions and 
selfish desires. 

But the tares are not to grow on forever. Just as 



surely as there was a beginning of this Age, there will be 
an ending. As surely as there was a sowing time for the 
good seed, there will be a reaping time, a Harvest time. 
In the Common Version the Words, "The Harvest is the 
end of the world," have been seriously misunderstood. It 
does not mean the end of time, nor the end of the earth- 
its destruction— nor the end of Divine favor. It merely 
means the end of the present Age— the close of the present 
dispensation. This Age will close when it has accomplished 
its intended work— when the full number of God's 
elect shall have been found faithful and ready for the 
"garner." 

"IN THE TIME OF THE HARVEST" 

This expression signifies that the Harvest of this Age 
will not be an instantaneous work, but a gradual one, 
requiring time. There is good reason for believing that 
the Harvest of this Age is a period of forty years, as the 
Harvest of the Jewish Age was of that length. In this 
time of the Harvest two things will be accomplished: (1) 
The tares will be gathered into bundles, ready for the 
burning— destruction. (2) The wheat, at the same time, 
will be gathered into the garner— the heavenly garner. 
This gathering into the heavenly garner is elsewhere represented 
as being the change from earthly to heavenly 
conditions, which will be accomplished for the Bride class 
in the end of the harvest, by the first resurrection. These 

R5049 : page 200 

will "all die like men." At the appointed time their resurrection 
change will take place and be invisible to men— 
"sown in weakness, raised in power; sown in dishonor, 
raised in glory; sown an animal body, raised a spirit 
body"; "They shall be priests of God and of Christ, and 
shall reign with Him a thousand years."— I Cor. 15:42-44; 
Rev. 20:6. 

BURNING OF THE TARES. 

"They shall gather out of His Kingdom all things 
which offend, and them which do iniquity;. ..there 
shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth." Let us remember 
that these tares are not all of the world of mankind, but 
merely that portion of them associated with the Kingdom 
class— that portion which now verily believe that they are 
God's people, as the Pharisees considered themselves in 
the Harvest of the Jewish Age. There will be two classes 
amongst these tares: one class, "doers of iniquity (inequity, 
unrighteousness), the other class, those that have 
caused others to stumble. Doubtless this will include 
many teachers and preachers, and many doers of wonderful 
works. 

But we must not forget that we are considering a 
parable, and that the "tares" are symbolical, and likewise 



the "furnace" and the "fire." The interpretation is that, 
in the end of this Age, the Harvest time, there will be a 
great "time of trouble" for all nations, society, governments, 
financial institutions, etc. The wheat class will 
be saved from that "time of trouble" by the resurrection 
change. But the tares will not be saved from it; they 
will be cast into the trouble and have their portion with 
the hypocrites. 

That trouble will not last forever. Many Scriptures 
seem to show that it will be terrific but of very short 
duration. It will be on the earth, and not in some far-off 
place. When the fire of that great day of anarchy and 
trouble shall cease to burn, there will be no more tares, 
there will be no more people having mere forms of godliness 
and pretensions for the Kingdom, begotten of error. 
All humanity will be greatly humbled, and, according to 
the Scriptures, ready and anxious for Messiah's Kingdom, 
which will then be established. It will be "the desire of 
all nations." (Hag. 2:7). Those formerly tares, as well as 
the remainder of the groaning creation, will welcome it 
and its blessings. In that Kingdom the righteous, the 
garnered, glorified wheat class "shall shine forth as the 
sun" for the blessing of all the families of the earth.— 
Matt. 13:43; Gal. 3:29.

THE KINGDOM A PRIZE 

-MATTHEW 13:44-53.-AUGUST 4.- 

Text:— "Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, 
and all these things shall be added unto you."— Matt. 6:33. 

TODAY WE HAVE further precious lessons 

from the Great Teacher respecting His 

Kingdom. The parable of the "Treasure 

hid in the Field," and the parable of the 

"Pearl of Great Price," both picture to us 

the great value of the Kingdom of Glory 

which is ultimately to be established 

amongst men for the blessing of the world. 

These parables also furnish lessons of what 

it will cost to secure a share, a place in that 

Kingdom. A third parable of the lesson treats of the embryo 

Kingdom; that is to say, the Parable of the "Net 

Cast into the Sea," pictures the condition of this present 

Age, during which the Elect, or Kingdom class, the Bride, 

is being found and gathered by the Lord's providences. 

"TREASURE HID IN THE FIELD" 

This is not one of the parables which Jesus expounded. 
His people, therefore, are left to exercise their judgment 



of its meaning, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit and 
the light shed upon it by other Scriptures. Indeed, there 
might be more than one application of it correct. For 
instance, we might apply the parable to our Lord Jesus 
and say that He bought the whole world at the cost of all 
He had, and that He purchased the world because of the 
"treasure" which it contained. And that treasure might 
consist of a variety of treasures of different values— for 
instance, the Church, the Bride class, the Lord's special 
"treasure," and such of the world as will ultimately receive 
and be blessed by the Messianic Kingdom. 

But our preference of thought is that the Great 
Teacher referred, not to Himself at all, but to those whom 
He instructed. By virtue of His own covenant of sacrifice, 
the Kingdom was already promised to Him, and He, 
in turn, in the Father's name, was inviting those who had 
the ears to hear, and heart to appreciate, to become members 
of His Bride class— members of His Kingdom class. 

He recommends that these should view the Kingdom 
after the illustration of this parable. Suppose in their 
journeying they saw a field for sale at a certain price, and 
suppose, upon examination of it, they found it to contain 
a great treasure. The treasure might consist of very 
excellent soil, especially suited to their purpose, or it might 

R5048 : page 200 

consist of a valuable vein of precious metal, or it might 
consist of money buried long centuries ago and forgotten, 
and not belonging to the owner of the field more than to 
others who might find it. In such a case, the parable suggests, 
any one of ordinary intelligence would be willing to 
invest everything that he possessed to acquire the title. 

So the Master declared to those who heard Him then, 
and to us who receive His words now, that He has information 
to give respecting a Great Treasure, a Priceless 
Treasure, which can be obtained, but only by the expenditure 
of great energy and the investment of everything of 
value. The Great Treasure is the share in the Messianic 
Kingdom— that by accepting the terms of discipleship we 
may become not only sons of God, but, if children, then 
heirs of God and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ our Lord 
to His heavenly inheritance. This inheritance was the 
same as was promised to the Seed of Abraham, and we 
acquired an interest or share in it, not by being the actual 
seed of Abraham and the actual heirs to the Kingdom, 
but by becoming Messiah's Bride and Joint-heir. 

When we think how much time and energy are put 
forth, and how much money and influence are expended 
to obtain some little, petty earthly honor of worldly renown 
and glory, and when we reflect that these at most 
will last but a few years and be unsatisfactory at best, 
then we can appreciate the better the glory, honor and 
immortality which God has in reservation for the "called 
and chosen and faithful," the Bride, the Lamb's Wife. 



A PEARL OF GREAT VALUE 

In the days of our Saviour pearls were represented 
amongst the most precious and most desirable of jewels, 
and the larger and more nearly perfect the pearl the 
greater its value. The Great Teacher used this familiar 
matter as the basis for a lesson on the value of the Kingdom. 

R5048 : page 201 

The Merchant of the Parable found a Pearl so 

superior in every respect to all other pearls that he considered 

it cheap to give everything that he possessed to 

become the owner of that Pearl. 

This, said the Master, illustrates the value of the Kingdom, 
with its glory, honor and immortality, which I am 
inviting an elect, saintly little flock to share with Me. 
Those who prize it properly will show their appreciation 
by the amount they will be willing and glad to pay for it. 
Whether a man be wealthy or poor, learned or ignorant, 
influential or otherwise, the cost of this Kingdom Pearl of 
great value will be— his all. It cannot be had for less. 

The wealthiest or most talented person in the world 
could not obtain a share in that Kingdom if he kept back 
one single atom of his possessions; the price of the Kingdom 
is self-sacrifice, even unto death, and nothing less 
will secure it. Nor would any sacrifice that we could 
make secure a share in this Kingdom for us, except as our 
sacrifice would first be made acceptable in God's sight 
through the precious merit of our Redeemer's sacrifice, 
which He finished at Calvary. 

THE PARABLE OF A FISH NET 

We are not to think of the Kingdom as like a net, but 
to understand that the embryo Kingdom resembles a fishing 
experience with a net, in which were gathered all 
kinds of fish, which were brought to shore and sorted. 
This is a parable of the embryo Kingdom because it relates 
to a work done in this Age, in connection with the 
finding of the "little flock" who will constitute the Kingdom 
in glory. The Lord during this Age has not been 
fishing for all kinds of fish; He has not been seeking for 
all kinds of people. He has been calling, drawing especially, 
and dealing with, only the elect, only the saintly. 

But, incidentally, a variety of other kinds of fish have 
gotten into the Gospel Net, some from worldly ambitions, 
some because religious systems are a good matrimonial 
field, others because of social privileges and standing, 
others because they desire to breathe a moral atmosphere, 
others because they would use religion as a cloak for business 
enterprises, etc. But the suitable fish, which the Lord 
is seeking, and who alone will constitute the Kingdom 
class, are those who hear His Message with joy and count 
the cost and appreciate the situation and desire to be 
"bond servants of the Lord Jesus Christ." They are willing 



to suffer with Him now that they may be glorified 
together with Him in His Kingdom. 

The parable tells us that "when the net was full it was 
drawn ashore" and the fish sorted. This evidently signifies 
that there will come a time in the end of this Age when 
the Lord will have gathered a sufficient number of saintly 
ones to serve His purpose— to complete the number foreordained 
by the Father to be members of the elect Church 
in glory. Then the fishing will cease. Who can say that 
the opportunity for entering the "net" as one of the true 
"fish" of the kind the Lord is seeking may not be almost 
at an end? Who can say that the Gospel Net, with its 
full assortment of churchianity of every style, will not 
soon be drawn ashore that the suitable, the elect, may be 
gathered into the Kingdom? 

The unsuitable "fish" of this parable correspond with 
the "tares" of the parable considered a week ago. The 
"furnace of fire" will be the same "time of trouble" which 
will come upon the whole world of mankind very shortly. 
The unsuitable fish in the net are all church members— 
the unprofessing world are not represented in the parable 
at all. 

Jesus asked His disciples if they understood the parable. 
They answered, Yes, and He told them to consider 
His parables as a householder would consider his reserve 
of food supplies, from which from time to time truths 
"both new and old" would be brought. 

Our text emphasizes this study. If the Kingdom is the 
Pearl, and the Treasure, which the Master indicated— if 
we believe His testimony, then by all means let us show 
our faith, not merely by professions, but in every act and 
word. Let us seek the Kingdom as the pre-eminent matter 
of our lives, in comparison with which all other things are 
inferior, and, as St. Paul declared, "not worthy to be compared." 
If seeking the Kingdom seems to hinder some of 
our earthly prospects, so much the better. The Master 
said it must cost us our all. Our earthly considerations we 
have left in His hands. Let Him apportion our earthly 
blessings according to His wisdom of what will be most 
helpful to us in making our "calling and election sure" to 
a place in the Kingdom.

SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS 
RELATIVE TO ANSWERING A FOOL 

Question.— Please explain: "Answer not a fool according 
to his folly, lest thou be like unto him. Answer 
a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own 
conceit."— Prov. 26:4,5. 

Answer.— When talking to any one who speaks foolishly, 
do not talk foolishly in return. You dishonor yourself. 



In the second case: "Answer a fool according to his 
folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit," would signify 
that you do him a service if you show him the folly of his 
position, thereby kindly helping him to a proper attitude 
of mind. 



ARCHANGEL SIGNIFIES HIGHEST ANGEL 

Question.— Is there, or will there be more than one 
Archangel? 

Answer.— To speak of Archangels (plural) would be 
contrary to the Scriptures. The word archangel signifies 
highest angel, the prefix arch meaning the same as 
chief; for instance, the chief of the fire department. In 
the twelfth chapter of Daniel we read (vs. 1), "And at 
that time shall Michael [the Archangel] stand up, the 
great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people." 
In the Hebrew the name Michael signifies One who 
as God, or like God. That One who is "like God," we 
understand to be the great Messiah, the Lord Jesus Himself. 
"Michael will stand up"— that is, Messiah will stand 
up, "Who standeth for the children of thy people"— that 
is, He will stand up for Israel. But He will also stand up 
for the Church, which is His Body, and for all who are 
in harmony with God, and all who will be in harmony 
with God. This will include all mankind during the Millennial 
Age. "In due time" they may be released from 
the bondage of corruption and death, and brought into 
full harmony with God. 



RANSOM AND SIN-OFFERING 

Question.— May we have a concise statement in which 
you differentiate between "Ransom" and "Sin-Offering"? 

Answer.— The word "Ransom" signifies "corresponding 
price," and indicates one feature of the Divine arrangement 
for man's recovery. As by a man sin entered 
into the world, so the recovery would be by a man's redemptive 
work. -I Cor. 15:21,22. 

The term "Sin-Offering" is used to represent the 
modus operandi by which this Ransom price will be used 

R5050 : page 202 

for the recovery of mankind. It shows the actual application 

of the Ransom price on behalf of mankind in 

securing their release from condemnation and in permitting 

the glorious New Covenant arrangement to go into 

effect. 

The Ransom price has nothing whatever to do 
with the method by which that price will be applied. 
When our Lord Jesus died, He laid down a sufficient 



price, but the application of that price is not yet completed. 
The grand outcome of the redemptive work will be seen 
in the end of the Millennial Age, when as a result of 
the application of the Ransom price there will be Christ 
and the Bride on the divine plane, the "Great Company" 
on the spirit plane, the "Ancient Worthies" in their perfected 
condition and the whole world of mankind restored 
to the perfection lost in Eden. 



RE TERM "NEW CREATION" 

Question.— Why is the term "New Creation" applied 
to the Church? 

Answer.— The Scriptures tell us that our Lord was 
the Beginning of the Divine creation, the First-born of 
every creature, the First and the Last; that the Heavenly 
Father never created any other being; and that by our 
Lord all things else were made. In other words, the 
Father's power was exercised through His Only Begotten 
Son. According to the Scriptures, man was the last of 

R5051 : page 202 

the creations in God's image. But the Heavenly Father 
has purposed the creation of an order of beings higher 
than any that has been made, and has arranged that His 
Only Begotten Son shall be the One to occupy the highest 
position in that New Creation. 

"For the joy that was set before Him" our Lord endured 
the cross, despised the shame, and then sat down 
at the right hand of the Majesty on high. Originally, He 
was the first creation. Now He was the second creation 
—the new creation, in contradistinction. And the entire 
Church has been invited to come up to this highest place, 
to be associated with Christ, to be partakers of the 
divine nature. But in order to attain to this high position, 
to be with Him, they must become dead to the earthly 
nature and its interests, its aims and its projects, and 
alive with Him beyond the veil. Jesus is the Head of 
this New Creation, of which the Church is the Body. We 
do not understand that the "Great Company" will be a 
part of the New Creation. Only the "Little Flock" will 
have the honor of being members of Christ's Body. 

Eventually, when the Divine Plan shall have reached 
its consummation, there will be Jehovah, the Head over 
all things and the Head over Christ; next will come our 
Lord and the Church which is His Body; then will come 
the various orders of angels, and lastly mankind. As the 
Apostle in his letter to the Ephesians tells us, "In the 
dispensation of the fulness of times, God will gather together 
in one all things in Christ, both which are in 
Heaven, and which are on earth, even in Him."— 
Eph. 1:9,10. 



SIN-OFFERING AND SIN-ATONEMENT 

Question.— What is the difference between Sin-Offering 
and Sin-Atonement? 

Answer.— The term "Sin-Offering" relates to the 
presentation of something sacrificially, as an offering or 
sacrifice, on account of sin and on behalf of the sinner. 
It thus relates, not only to the work of the Lord Jesus in 
His own person during the work of His ministry of three 
and a half years, when He offered up Himself, but also 
to Him as the High Priest when He offers up the members 
of His Body, during this Gospel Age. The entire 
work is sacrificial; and since this offering is on account 
of sin, it is, therefore, a sin-offering. The sin-offering 
must be complete before the result can be applied. 

When our Lord ascended up on high, He completed 
His own personal work; and on account of the merit 
which He possessed He was enabled to become the Advocate 
of the Church— those who become the members of 
His prospective Body. Since He intends to make application 
of that merit for the sins of the whole world, 
after He has offered in sacrifice the members of the 
Church, He therefore delays the matter of the presentation 
of the Sin-offering merit until the entire offering has been 
completed— until the Church shall be with Him in glory; 
for "if we suffer [with Him] we shall also reign with 
Him."— 2 Tim. 2:12. 

The expression "Sin- Atonement" may be used in 
respect to any part of the work of making satisfaction on 
account of sin. Strictly speaking, however, the term 
Sin-Atonement applies to the satisfaction of Justice on 
behalf of mankind. Man has been condemned; Justice 
executed a sentence, and in order that man may be released, 
Justice must be satisfied. 

Let us not in any sense of the word confound 
Sin-Atonement with Sin. After sin has been atoned for, 
then the sinner will be given an opportunity to return to 
the original perfection in which Adam was created and 
from which he fell. The Sin-Atonement, therefore, will 
be completed when Christ shall have presented His merit 
on account of the entire world. But the results of sin 
will not be fully removed until the end of the thousand 
years of the reign of Messiah.

SOME INTERESTING LETTERS 

DEARLY BELOVED BROTHER:- 

I am impressed to see how our dear Lord is now leading 
His people along! 
About the time of your recent return from abroad I wrote 



you a letter regarding some matters, with questions, etc. 
Thinking this too long, I did not send it, but wrote another 
letter, only to be dissatisfied with it also, and finally discarded 
the idea of writing, knowing how entirely your time is 
occupied. 

But when, in the last TOWER, I found a complete answer 
to all my questions, I thought I would tell you about it. 

I have of late been appreciating these things as I had not 
done before; I can see that if many truths we now have had 
been presented before, we would not have been able to see 
them so clearly. 

We are glad that the Lord of the Harvest knows and is 
able to give "Meat in due season"— when we are able to receive 
and use it to His glory and our good! 

"The Mortal Body the Servant of the New Mind"; "The 
Palace of Blessedness"; "Ye Were Bought with a Price"; 
"Beware of Pride in the Heart"; "Moses as a Mediator," etc., 
are certainly good for me! I try to feel that the dear Lord 
sent all such to me just as though there were not another 
person in the world. In this way I seem to get more out of 
it and am kept from thinking where it might fit others! 

I want the Lord's arrangements to fit me for the Kingdom, 
and since this is true of all of His "little ones," we may be a 
help to one another in the Narrow Way. 

The sermons, too, seem more impressive, as we should 
expect, since the dear Lord says "The path of the just shall 
shine more and more unto the perfect day." 

I ask that you pray that I may be more and more illuminated 
with this blessed Truth until I shall become one of 
the "rays" of the same great Fountain of Light and Truth 
with our dear Lord and all the faithful in Him ! 

Praying God ever to bless and keep you to the end of the 

page 203 

way, and to grant you "an abundant entrance into the Kingdom" 
for which our hearts long, by His grace I beg to remain 
Your brother in hope, 

EMORY WILLIAMS. -Texas.

"THE JOY OF THE LORD OUR STRENGTH" 

DEAR PASTOR AND BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

Please accept my hearty "Welcome Home." If I can guess 
by my own experience, I would think you are very happy 
to be home again, but O! so glad to have had the opportunity 
to take the glorious Gospel around the world. How happy 
and blessed must be your heart in the great work you have 
been chosen to accomplish in this grand Harvest Time! May 
our dear Heavenly Father give you strength and continual 
grace to finish it. 
Dear Brother Russell, my own experiences on my trip to 



Europe were at times very interesting and brought great blessings 
to me. I can say in truth that I am glad I was able to 
go out there; but how happy I was when the time came to 
come back! I was away just three months. 

I intended to send some little report to you on your trip, 
but thought you will get so much mail all the time that so 
many letters might bother you. I myself did not get any. 
Even though the children wrote, the letters never came. 

I found very many hungry Christians in Germany who 
were glad to hear the good news. I spent many half nights 
telling the glad story. It was very strange to my relatives. 
Seven years ago I sent them each the three volumes, but not 
one of them had read, but had loaned them all. Some 
of the books traveled a long distance, to Munich, and were 
read by a Catholic priest, a Protestant minister and others. 
Some of them went to Colmar, and others were loaned and 
not returned. Strange to say, my friends were consecrated 
Christians and praying for more light all the time. When 
they heard that I was coming they hoped I would bring them 
some Truth, and when they heard the glad tidings they accepted 
it. They seemed to me to be quite able to grasp the 
Truth. My dear brother, who knew nothing but Catholicism, 
cried for joy. Five of my relatives have now accepted the 
Truth. 

And now, praying that grace and peace may be multiplied 
unto you, I remain, 

Your sister in Christ, F. MUNTZER. 



BELOVED BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

After our enjoyable visit to Brooklyn, Sister Thorn and I 
returned home more than ever encouraged to take up the 
cross daily and follow our Master faithfully, unto death. 

We especially enjoyed being at "Bethel" and the privilege 
of sitting at your table, listening to the helpful discussions 
and table-talks. Our interview with you in your study was 
also very helpful and drew us nearer to you. It was truly a 
"holy week" to us. 

Last Sunday, at the close of the afternoon service at Lynn, 
I told the friends of our intention to re-unite with the Boston 
Class, I. B. S. A. At the conclusion of my remarks prayer 
was offered and we sang, "Blest be the tie," etc. We believe 
we left with the good will of the entire Class. 

We then proceeded to Boston, arriving there in time for 
the evening meeting. After a few testimonies had been given 
I gave mine, reminding the friends that if we had any differences 
to settle with one another— not hereafter, but right here, 
these things must be adjusted. 

I then confessed having made some unintentional mistakes 
which I feared had caused them unnecessary pain, and that I 
was truly repentant and asked their forgiveness, also requesting 
that we might have closer fellowship with the dear Boston 
Class. 

We were assured of their forgiveness, and after several 
had expressed their joy in hearing our words (for I assured 



them that I spoke for Sister Thorn as well as for myself), 
the whole Class by a rising vote expressed their love and a 
hearty welcome. 

Both at Lynn and at Boston it was a heart-mellowing 
time— a most blessed day to us all. Many tears of joy were 
shed as the dear friends shook hands with us. We feel sure 
that you, too, will rejoice with us. Kindly remember us both 
in your prayers. 

With much Christian love from Sister Thorn and myself, 
I am as ever, 

Your brother and fellow-servant in Christ, 

WALTER J. THORN.-Mass.

1912-GENERAL CONVENTIONS- 19 12 



TORONTO, CANADA, JUNE 30-JULY 6, 7 

The second General Convention of the year will be most favorably 
located for the Canadian friends, although no doubt there will also 
be a goodly number in attendance from the United States. On the 
program there will be fourteen public speakers, including Brother 
Russell. 

All sessions to be held in the Horticultural Hall at the Canadian 
National Exhibition Park, West Toronto, June 30-July 6. The Park is 
easily accessible by Grand Trunk Railway and by King Street and other 
trolley car lines. 

Railway rates: Canadian railways give half fare rates for July 1 
and the following day, possibly beginning June 30. American lines 
give low rates for a few days before and after July 4, available for 
friends in the border States. There are always special rates to Niagara 
Falls, which is only about two hours' sail by steamer to Toronto, at a 
moderate price. There may be other excursion rates good for even 
ten days. Ask your local agent a week in advance. 

If no rate as low as l-l/2c. per mile each way is available, purchase 
a single ticket to Toronto, and have the agent fill out a certificate and 



bring it with you. This will entitle you to a return ticket at a greatly 
reduced rate— perhaps free— to many Canadian points. The American 
railroads in the Eastern States have quoted a fare and three-fifths on 
the round trip certificate plan. Be sure to secure a Certificate Receipt 
when purchasing one way railroad tickets through to Toronto. 

Lodging can be secured through the Committee at from 50c. each 
per day up. All expecting to attend should give prompt notice by addressing 
the Convention Committee, c/o W. G. Brown, Sec'y, 51 Tiverton 
Ave., Toronto, Canada. Give full name of each person and indicate 
which prefer to room together, and at what rate. Do NOT send in 
any money for rooms. 

Brother Russell will deliver a public address in the Royal Alexandra 
Theatre, King St., West, at 3 p.m., July 7. 

WASHINGTON, D.C., JULY 7-14 

This Convention will be held in the suburbs of Washington City, 
D.C., at the Glen Echo Chautauqua Grounds, July 7-14. Accommodations, 
including meals, will be secured at Washington City at $1.25, 
$1.50, $2 and upward per day per person. Also for lodging only, two 
or more in a room, at 50c. upward per person. No pains will be spared 
to make you comfortable as possible. All expecting to attend should 
WITHOUT DELAY notify I.B.S.A. Committee, 17 Hicks St., Brooklyn, 
N.Y. Do NOT send in any money for rooms. 

Washington City commands reasonable railway rates from all quarters 
at all times. Special I.B.S.A. rates of one and one-half fares 
for the round trip from points East of Pittsburgh, Parkersburg and 
Buffalo will be on sale July 5, 6 and 7; same rates and dates of sale 
from all points in the New England States. Return limit July 18. 

From points in the Central States as far west as St. Louis a rate 
of 2c. a mile in each direction to Pittsburgh, Parkersburg, Wheeling, 
Buffalo, etc., added to rate of one and one-half fares therefrom, will 
be in effect July 4, 5 and 6, except that from stations in the States 
of Pennsylvania, New York and West Virginia, and from Bellaire, 
Bridgeport, East Liverpool, Martins Ferry, Steubenville and Wellsville, 
Ohio, tickets will be sold on July 5, 6 and 7. These tickets will have 
final return limit to reach original starting point not later than midnight 
July 18, and tickets will not be good for return passage unless 
presented for validation to the city or depot agent of the line at Washington, 
D.C., over which ticket reads. You may secure further information 
from your local ticket agent. 

SPECIAL COACHES AND TRAINS 

Arrangements are being made for "Special Coaches" and in some 
instances "Special Trains" to accommodate the friends who enjoy traveling 
together in numbers. Thus far we have received information as 
follows: 

"Special Coach" service from San Francisco for benefit of Pacific 
Coast friends who will start from San Francisco via Southern Pacific 
train No. 4, July 2, 9 a.m., via Ogden, Cheyenne, Omaha and Chicago; 
leave Chicago July 5, 9:45 p.m., arriving in Washington, D.C., morning 
of July 7. Address C. W. Gerdes, 2552 Hyde St., San Francisco. 

Chicago friends will have "Special Train" over Baltimore & Ohio 
R. R., leaving Chicago Grand Central depot, Harrison St. and 5th Ave., 
at 5:45 p.m., Friday, July 5, arriving Washington, D.C., Saturday, 



July 6; rate $30.75 for round trip. For those who prefer to make extra 
trip to New York City the rate will be cheaper— only $27 for the round 
trip Chicago to New York and return, with stop-over for ten days 
at Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia. Those who take this 
rate must go to New York and have the ticket validated by agent 
before it will be good for return. Address Dr. L. W. Jones, 3003 Walnut 
St., Chicago, 111. 

Pittsburgh, Pa., "Special Train" will start Saturday, July 6, 9 a.m., 
arriving in Washington, D.C., at 5 p.m.: round trip rate, $12. If 
eighty or more go and return on the same train a still lower rate can 
be had. Address Dr. W. E. Spill, 2509 Perrysville Ave., N.S., Pittsburgh, 
Pa. 

Cleveland, Ohio, "Special Coach," possibly "Special Train," rate 
$17.30. Address C. B. Telling, 10,325 Empire Ave., N.E., Cleveland, O. 

Special train will leave Boston, Mass., 5.30 p.m., July 5; rate $11.90 
via Providence, Colonial Line steamer and B.& O. Address E. A. 
Leonard, 36 Van Winkle Street, Dorchester, Mass. 

Atlanta, Ga., special party will start 1.15 p.m., July 5, via Seaboard 
Ry.; round trip rate, $19.35. Address W. S. Stevens, Box 169, Atlanta, 
Ga. Correspondingly low rates a/c I.B.S.A. from all points in 
Southeast. Inquire of your local ticket agent. 

From New York City the special I.B.S.A. rate on sale July 5, 
6 and 7, will be $8.50. All those desiring to join "Special Train" may 

(Continued on last page.) 

page 220 

(Continued from second page.) 

get benefit of rate of $6.80 for the round trip. This B.& O. special 

train will leave the Central R.R. of New Jersey depot in Jersey City 

at 10 a.m. Saturday, July 6, arriving in Washington, D.C., at 3 p.m. 

For the accommodation of the Brooklyn friends a special ferry will 

leave from the foot of Fulton St. at 9:30 a.m., which will convey passengers 

direct to the Jersey City depot. Regular Central R.R. of 

N.J. ferry boats from 23d and Liberty streets between 9 and 9:30 

a.m. will also make connection with this train. Returning will leave 

Washington Monday, July 15, at 9 a.m., arrive New York City, 2 p.m. 

In order to get the benefit of this $6.80 rate it will be necessary for the 

entire party of 100 or more to travel together, both going and returning. 

Promptly advise I.B.S.A. Convention Committee, 17 Hicks St., 

Brooklyn, N.Y. 

A very low rate will be granted wherever a party of 100 or more 
can arrange to travel together on one ticket. Remember also that from 
the West in many instances a specially cheap excursion rate is in effect 
to New York City and return with stop-over privileges at Washington, 
D.C. Inquire of your local ticket agent for details. 

HARVESTERS' DAY AT THE CONVENTION 

The programme for each of the Conventions includes a "Harvest 
Workers' Day." Noting this, one dear friend who has received great 
spiritual profit through the Colporteur service has proffered assistance 
—to the extent of $5— to all who shall have been in the regular Colporteur 
work for at least three months prior to the Convention, and who 



have not been in attendance at any other General Convention this year. 
We have no doubt that this proposal will be helpful to some who might 
not otherwise be able to bear the expense. The money is deposited 
with the Colporteur Department and will be credited on the accounts

HOW ST. PETER WAS PUNISHED FOR DENYING HIS LORD 

"Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou 
Me more than these?"— John 21:15-17. 

THE CONTEXT SHOWS that these words 

were addressed by the Redeemer to St. 

Peter on the occasion of His third manifestation 

to His disciples after His resurrection. 

This was presumably three or four 

weeks after the Master's resurrection from 

the dead. His manifestations to the women 

on the morning of His resurrection and His 

later manifestation to the two as they went 

to Emmaus are evidently not counted, but 

the manifestation the same evening in the upper room, 

when all the disciples except Thomas and Judas were 

present, is counted the first. And the manifestation a week 

later, Thomas being present, is counted the second. 

The delay in giving this third manifestation was evidently 
for the purpose of testing the faith of the Apostles 
and of leading them to reach a conclusion respecting their 
future course, which Jesus wished to correct. So far as 
we can understand the record at least two Sundays passed 
without any further manifestation of Jesus to His 
disciples, and then, giving up hope, they decided to return 
to the fishing business and did so. The journey to Galilee 
and the resumption of business presumably took another 
week. 

During all those thirty days the mental attitude of all 
the Apostles and the other disciples can be better imagined 
than described. They were perplexed, they had indeed 
had evidences of the Master's resurrection; they had had 
the Scriptures called to their attention which proved that 
this was necessary and that God had previously so arranged. 
They had hoped for further conferences with 
Jesus and that He would have told them definitely what 
to do. 

Instead, left to themselves, the disciples were thoroughly 
disheartened. They had left all to follow Him, to 
tell the people that He was the Son of God, the long-promised 
Messiah, and that He would soon set up His 
Kingdom, which would bring blessings, primarily to Israel 
and, secondarily, through Israel, to all the families of the 
earth in harmony with the Abrahamic Covenant. Now 



apparently all of these hopes were dashed, frustrated. 
How foolish they thought it would seem for them to try 
to convince the people that a man, crucified as a malefactor, 
as a blasphemer, was indeed the Messiah! How 
foolish it would seem to tell of His resurrection! They 
felt that they could do nothing else than abandon the 
ministry as a lost cause; and the resumption of the fishing 
business was the logical conclusion. 

THEY TOILED ALL THE NIGHT 

Their first night was a discouraging one— they caught 
nothing. It looked indeed as though God was punishing 
them for the course they had taken in becoming disciples 
of Jesus— that everything was going wrong. But not so; 
they were merely being taught needed lessons. 

In the morning they beheld a stranger on the shore 
who beckoned and shouted to know if they had any fish 
for sale. They replied, No, they had made no catch. 
The stranger suggested casting the net on the other side 
of the boat. And, although the suggestion seemed a foolish 
one, having been so unsuccessful, yet they did so, and 
immediately the net was filled with fishes! It did not 
require long for them to learn the lesson. They knew 
instinctively that the unknown stranger upon the shore 
was none other than their Master. They remembered a 
very similar experience at the time they were first called 
to leave their nets and to become fishers of men. 

All interest had just centered in the fishing business, 
but now boats and fish and nets all lost their value in the 
estimation of these fishermen. Here was their risen Lord, 
for whose third appearance they had been waiting now 
nearly three weeks. Fearing that the Master would disappear, 
even before he could get to him, St. Peter plunged 
into the sea and swam ashore. To his surprise the 
stranger already had fish and had them cooked, and all 
were invited to join in the breakfast on the shore of 
Galilee. 

The stranger had not the clothing by which they had 
known their Lord, neither did He have the marks of the 
nails in His hands and feet, that they might thus identify 
Him. This was a different manifestation. They knew 
Him as did those with whom He walked to Emmaus, who 
recognized Him in the blessing of the bread, and not by 
His features or clothing or wounds. They recognized 
that none other than He could have performed such a 
miracle. They did not ask who He was; they felt a 
restraint; as we read, "None of them durst ask who He 
was," but all knew that He was the Lord. 

"LOVEST THOU ME MORE?" 

The stranger addressed St. Peter particularly, saying, 
"Lovest thou Me more than these"— these boats and nets, 
etc., pertaining to the fishing business? St. Peter 
answered, "Lord, Thou knowest that I affectionately love 



Thee." He used a word expressing fondness of love. 
Jesus replied, "Feed My lambs." 
Then came the question a second time, "Simon, son 

R5052 : page 208 

of Jonas, lovest thou Me?" A great pressure was felt by 
St. Peter. Why did the Master so particularly question 
his love? Why should He put this question more to him 
than to the others? Was it because he had been the first 
of the disciples to suggest the resumption of the fishing 
business? Was he to blame for this? But he answered, 
"Lord, Thou knowest that I affectionately love Thee." 
Jesus this time replied, "Tend My sheep." For the third 
time Jesus said to St. Peter, "Simon, son of Jonas, dost 
thou affectionately love Me?" Here Jesus used the same 
word that St. Peter had used, as though He questioned 
the affection and depth of St. Peter's love. Ah! the third 
time must have sent the memory of St. Peter back to the 
scene in Caiaphas' Judgment Hall, when he denied his 
Master the third time, even with cursing. And now Jesus 
for the third time had asked him respecting his love and 
whether it was really a love of affection! St. Peter's 
choking reply was, "Lord, Thou knowest all things! 
Thou knowest that I affectionately love Thee!" The 
Lord's reply was, "Feed My sheep." 

In harmony with these words of the Master to St. 
Peter the chief work of His followers has been to minister 
to the needs of the spirit-begotten sheep. It is in full 
harmony with this that St. Paul, addressing the Elders of 
Ephesus, counseled that they "feed the flock of God, 
which He had purchased with the blood of His own Son." 
There is a point here that perhaps is too frequently overlooked. 
If all of the Lord's followers could realize that 
the message to St. Peter is the same as comes to all of 
us, perhaps it would make a change in most of our 
preaching. 

OUR MISTAKEN METHODS 

Have not Christians in general overlooked this important 
lesson, namely, that the chief work of the ministers 
and under-shepherds of the Lord's flock during this Age 
is to "feed the flock"? Is it not true that comparatively 
little feeding is being done? On the contrary, the 
thought usually received by new converts is, Now you are 
saved; go, evangelize, and bring others to Christ— especially 
bring money, for with plenty of it we can convert 
the world. Work for Jesus by soliciting funds for church 
expenses, extension, etc., etc. 

If the inquirer has thoughts or feelings is it not too 
often the case that his instructors know not how to answer 
them, but merely say, "Stop thinking, and go to work"? 
Alas, that this is so true! The "lambs" should be fed 
until they become "sheep." The sheep should be tended, 
cared for, guided, instructed, and the sheep should also 



be fed with the stronger meat than that which the lambs 
could appropriate. St. Paul gives this thought when on 
one occasion he urges his hearers to desire "the sincere 
milk of the Word that they may grow thereby." 

But few seem to copy the great St. Paul in respect to 
their methods. Few seem to realize and apply to themselves 
the Master's words to St. Peter, "Feed My lambs," 
and "My sheep." As a consequence, the Church of Christ 
is in a languishing condition. Many, sincere at heart, 
know not what they believe. Many would find it impossible 
to follow St. Peter's admonition, "Be ready to 
give a reason for the hope that is within you, with meekness 
and reverence."— I Peter 3:15. 

REASONS FOR THE NEGLECT OF THE DOCTRINES OF 
CHRIST 

There are two reasons which have led up to the neglect 
of "the doctrines of Christ"— the teachings of the Bible. 
These two reasons fully explain why so many are telling 
new believers, Never mind the doctrines of Christ, but 
go out and convert somebody. 

The first of these reasons is the erroneous thought 
which gained ascendency during the Dark Ages, namely, 
that from Pentecost until the second coming of Jesus is 
the time allotted by the Heavenly Father for the world's 
conversion, and that this is the commission which He 
gives to His people, and if the world be not converted the 
responsibility for their eternal torture will fall upon His 
people. 

All of this is a mistake. Not a word of Scripture 
tells that the Church was commissioned to convert the 
world before the second coming of the Lord. Quite to 
the contrary, the Scriptures show that at the Lord's second 
coming the world will be unconverted. The Apocalypse 
particularly tells us that when the Lord at His second 
coming shall establish His Kingdom, the nations will be 

R5053 : page 208 

angry and Divine wrath will come upon them, thereby introducing 
the great "time of trouble" with which this Age 
is to end, according to the prophetic Word. 

These testimonies do not signify that holiness will 
perish, nor that all of the Lord's people will be unfaithful, 
but they do signify that the world in general will not be 
the Lord's people; they will still be enemies, Gentiles, unconverted. 
Nor are we urging that the Church has 

nothing whatever to do with the world. Quite to the contrary; 
while she has not been given the mission of converting 
the world in the present Age— while that work 
remains for her to do in the coming Age in connection 
with the Lord and His Kingdom— nevertheless she was 
commissioned to do a work of witnessing in the present 
Age. 

The Church's witness was to be the telling of the 



Message of God's grace to those having an ear to hear, 
although they be but few. Secondarily, she was to witness 
to the world by her faithfulness to the principles of 
righteousness, and thus to show forth the praises of Him 
who called her "out of darkness into His marvelous 
light." But this witnessing was not in order to the converting 
of the world, but in order to gather out of the 
world the number necessary to complete the Divinely 
foreordained elect Bride of Christ. 

THE SECOND REASON 

As the first error was in respect to the world's conversion 
to the Lord, the second error was in respect to 
what would happen to the world if they were not converted 
to the Lord. When the erroneous idea gained 
credence that everyone who does not accept the invitation 
and become a member of the Bride of Christ is to be 
eternally tormented, can we wonder that it led many good 
people to a frenzy of error respecting what should be 
done to save their families and neighbors and the heathen 
millions from a supposed eternity of torture? 

It was because of this supposed urgency that those 
coming to a belief in Jesus were exhorted not to stop to 
feed and to grow strong in the Lord and to study His 
Word, but to be moved by a frenzy of zeal to bring others 
to the Lord. This frenzy in turn led to most unreasonable 
teachings and practices, which we are only now gradually 
getting rid of as we realize that a great mistake was made. 

How strange that we did not stop to think of the 
absurdity of our position and how it misrepresented the 
Heavenly Father, in a most detestable light! How 
strange that any should ever think that when the Heavenly 
Father sent out the call to those who have the hearing 
ear, to joint-heirship with Jesus Christ their Lord, He 
would consign to eternal torment any who would decline 
to accept the admittedly stringent rules and conditions 
appertaining to this "call"— the "narrow way" of the 
footsteps of Jesus— self-denial, etc.! 

Well do the Scriptures assure us that the saints 

R5053 : page 209 

"wrestle not with flesh and blood merely," but rather 
"with wicked spirits in high positions" of influence. 
(Eph. 6:12.) Well does the Apostle tell us that it is the 
God of this Age who hath blinded the minds of those who 
believe not; that he is preventing the light from shining 
unto them. (2 Cor. 4:4.) Well can we see how he put light 
for darkness and darkness for light during the Dark Ages. 

ANOTHER LESSON WE MAY LEARN 

We must not leave the text without calling to memory 
a most wonderfully instructive lesson concerning the 
proper way to reprove and rebuke our brethren when 



the same is surely necessary. So far as the record shows, 
the three inquiries which our Lord made of St. Peter 
respecting his love for Him were the only rebukes ever 
given him as an offset, or punishment for his shameful 
denial of the Master on the night in which He was 
betrayed. 

Had many of us been in the Master's place we would 
have felt that it was necessary to make St. Peter very 
humbly apologize before we would have anything further 
to do with him. We would have been inclined to speak 
of his weakness, of his ingratitude, of how he knew better, 
etc., etc. Our sense of justice would, in many instances, 
have entirely overshadowed our sense of mercy and sympathy. 
But not so with the Master. He knew the loyalty 
of St. Peter's heart. He knew that he had already gone 
out and wept bitterly over the matter. He knew what a 
sense of shame would be upon him and how much courage 
it would mean for him to think at all of meeting the 
Master whom he had denied. 

Surely it was on account of this sympathy for St. 
Peter and this appreciation of the tendency he would have 
to become entirely discouraged that led our Lord to mention 
St. Peter first amongst the Apostles on the morning 
of His resurrection, saying to Mary, to whom He first 
appeared, "Go and tell My disciples, and Peter"— don't 
let Peter think that he is an outcast. Let him know that 
I think of him and love him and sympathize with him 
and have forgiven him, because I know he did it under 
stress. 

WE SHOULD COPY THE MASTER'S METHODS 

And if our Lord and Master has set us such an example 
of benevolence and forgiveness without request, 
how are we learning this lesson? To what extent do we 
forgive others their trespasses and to what extent do we 
go more than half way to let them know that we harbor 
no resentful feelings toward them? To what extent do 
we send them word that we think of them kindly, generously? 
And when the appropriate time comes and it 
is proper for something to be said can we not take a 
lesson from the Redeemer's loving forbearance and 
gentleness in His merely asking the erring one if he had 
a proper kind of love, and when he confesses special love, 
then to ask him if he is sure that he has the special love? 

No doubt our success as the Master's servants in feeding 
the brethren, the flock, and helping instead of hindering 
them, will be in proportion as we remember and copy 
His style and methods. So, then, while feeding His flock, 
let us have continually before us the great Shepherd's 
example of how the flock should be dealt with. 



R5053 : page 209 



"I COME TO DO THY WILL" 

"Then said He, Lo, I come to do Thy will, O God. He taketh away 
the first that He may establish the second. By the which 
will we are sanctified through the offering of 
the body of Jesus Christ, once for all." "A 
body hast Thou prepared Me."— Heb. 10:9,10,5. 

IN THE CONTEXT from which our text is 
taken the Apostle speaks of the "better 
sacrifices"— plural— and the "one offering" 
—singular. From his statement we feel 
justified in saying that St. Paul is contrasting 
the antitypical Day of Atonement with 
the typical Atonement day, on which was 
made one sin-offering on behalf of all the 
people, but consisting of two sacrifices- 
first, the bullock for the priestly tribe of 
Levi, and then the goat for the other tribes of Israel. 

In those offerings which were made year by year continually, 
God had no pleasure, for they did not satisfy or 
please Him in making satisfaction for sin. They were 
not the Divine expression of what was pleasing to God 
in the fullest sense. "A body hast Thou prepared Me" 
"for the suffering of death." This "body" was the human 
body of Jesus, which, through immaculate conception, was 
holy, innocent, undefiled, separate from sinners and, therefore, 
capable of being the ransom-price for the sins of 
the whole world. But it is also true that God has provided 
a larger Body. 

"JESUS, WHOM THOU PERSECUTEST" 

This larger Body that God has provided is composed 
of human beings, whom He drew and called to be members 
of this Body of Christ, which is the Church. This 
drawing and calling was to the natural man and not to 
the New Creature. When Jesus accepted these members 
of His Body He accepted them as New Creatures. The 
invitation to them was before they became New Creatures. 
When, therefore, He accepted those whom the 
Father drew and called, He accepted them as members, or 
representatives, so that they might be His representatives 
throughout this Age. From this standpoint He spoke 
when upbraiding Saul of Tarsus, saying, "Saul, Saul, why 
persecutest thou Me?" (Acts 9:4.) So Jesus in the flesh 
(represented by His followers) was still in the world long 
after Jesus, as the Head of the Church, had ascended up 
on high. Thus we see that the sufferings of the Church 
all down the Age have, in this sense, been the sufferings 
of Jesus. 

The Apostle speaks of himself as "always bearing 
about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus." (2 Cor. 4:10.) 
All of the followers of the Lord Jesus bear about 
in their body the dying of the Lord Jesus. As Jesus had 
experiences in sufferings, so have all of His disciples 



experience with Him in the suffering of this time, and 
communion with Him in spirit. "Though our outward 
man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day." 
-2 Cor. 4:16. 

OBEDIENCE TO THE EXTENT OF SACRIFICE 

We refer to our text again, "Lo, I come to do Thy 
will, O God"— everything written in the Book. Because 
born under the Law, Jesus was obligated to keep the Law. 
There was no sacrifice in keeping the Law. To do whatever 
is commanded is not sacrifice, but obedience. The 
Law did not say that one should love his neighbor better 
than himself. But Jesus went beyond this Law of Justice 
and laid down His life in behalf of the Church and of the 
world. Because He was thus obedient to the Father to 
the extent of keeping, not only everything in the Law, 
but everything written in the Book, in the Bible— on this 

R5054 : page 210 

account He was a sacrifice, and was afterward raised up 
to the Divine Majesty on High. 

The things written in the Book were written in types 
and shadows, in allegories. To illustrate: Moses lifted up 
the brazen serpent. This is a picture illustrating how our 
Lord Jesus would be lifted up. The lamb slain at the 
Passover season is also a type of Jesus, the slain Lamb. 
The Day of Atonement sacrifices are also pictures. And 
as the Lamb was led to the slaughter, so He did not resist. 

"THE HEAVENS WERE OPENED" 

We are not informed how much our Lord knew, at 
the time of His consecration, respecting the Divine purpose. 
In His boyhood days our Lord knew that He had 
come into the world to do the will of the Father. But 
just what that will was He did not fully know. It was all 
written in the Book, but the Book was sealed; and until 
that will was revealed it could not be comprehended. He 
could not know until after He had received the Holy 
Spirit; and His consecration must be made before He 
could receive that Holy Spirit. Hence at the time He 
offered Himself at baptism He could not understand the 
"deep things." As St. Paul says, no natural man can 
perceive the things of God: "The natural man receiveth 
not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness 
unto him; neither can he know them, because they 
are spiritually discerned." (I Cor. 2:14.) Jesus could 
not know the depths and importance of all the symbols 
which God had written in that very form for the special 
purpose of keeping them secret, until He had been begotten 
of the Spirit. 

We understand that our Lord was the slain Lamb in 
the Divine purpose just as soon as He consecrated His 
life at Jordan and had bestowed upon Him the begetting 



of the Holy Spirit. We read that immediately after He 
had gone up out of the water the heavenly things were 
opened unto Him. Under the influence of that enlightenment 
He went into the wilderness and remained there 
fasting for forty days, that He might understand the will 
of God. But His consecration was to fulfill everything 
written in the Book. He was to be the great Messiah, the 
great Mediator between God and men. He made the full 
consecration of His life to this end. That consecration 
was accepted. It meant the fulfillment of all the details 
of the whole plan. 

CONSECRATION MUST PRECEDE UNDERSTANDING OF 
TYPES 

As before suggested, all these things written in the 
Book concerning our Lord were not understood by Him 
until the due time, which began when the Holy Spirit came 
to Him. Then, while He was in the wilderness, He began 
to see and to apply the various lessons to Himself. He 
had contracted to do everything written in the Book before 
He understood the meaning of these types. Evidently 
this was the Divine intention and there was a 
reason behind it. 

Here was God's will, not written in commands, but in 
types and shadows, that the One who was to fulfill these 
things might see in them, not a Divine command, but the 
Divine will. "Lo, I come to do Thy will!" I am ready 
to do Thy will at any cost! Now the Apostle says that 
when our Lord thus came and presented Himself to God, 
"He taketh away the first (that is, He setteth aside the 
type), that He might establish the second," the antitype. 
The type was the serpent lifted up; the antitype was Himself 
"lifted up." The type was the lamb slain; the antitype 
was Himself slain. The type was the sacrifice of the 
Day of Atonement; Himself and the adopted Body, the 
Church, constitute the "better sacrifices." 

After His return from the wilderness, our Lord began 
the work of taking away the first (the types). Part of 
the work was completed in the three years and a half of 
His earthly ministry. But the work is not yet finished. 
Coming down to our time, the Apostle says, "By the which 
will we are sanctified." (Heb. 10:10.) What will is this? 
The same will that our Lord had. He said, "I come to do 
Thy will"— not merely Thy Law. Now we who are the 
Church say that we are glad to follow Him. We are 
glad to be living sacrifices. God does not command us to 
be sacrifices. 

THE CHURCH SET APART FOR SERVICE 

The Apostle says, "I beseech you, brethren"— I put 
before you the fact that it is well worthy of your attention 
to present yourselves living sacrifices. Thus, by having 
the same will, the same mind, this same disposition 
that is in Christ, we are sanctified, we are set apart. We 



do not set ourselves apart. The Lord Jesus sets us apart. 
He it is who imputes to us His merit in order that the 
Father may accept the sacrifice and beget us to the new 
nature as members of His Body. The Apostle says, "By 
the which will we are sanctified through the offering of 
the body of Jesus Christ once for all" (for all being supplied). 
(Heb. 10:10.) What does this signify? We 
answer that the statement is true. The literal body of 
Jesus was the basis of our acceptance with God. The 
Church is the mystical Body of Jesus: "Why persecutest 
Thou Me?" "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest." 

The offering of this Body of Jesus has progressed 
throughout the eighteen hundred years; and it is only as 
we are offered and only by being offered that we can 
become members and attain to joint-heirship with our 
Lord in the Kingdom— "So many of us as were baptized 
into Christ." (Rom. 6:3.) We are not merely baptized 
into the glorious Body of the future, the Messiah, but we 
are baptized into Jesus that we might share in the death 
of Jesus, the sacrifice, and share in the glory of Jesus, the 
Messiah. 

THE BLOOD OF BULLS AND GOATS CAN NEVER TAKE 
AWAY SINS 

"And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering 
oftentimes the same sacrifice, which can never take 
away sins." (Heb. 10:11.) This refers to the fact that 
the Jewish priest offered the sacrifice continually and yet 
never accomplished anything with it. "But this Man, 
when He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat 
down at the right hand of God." (Heb. 10:12.) "This 
Man" is the glorious High Priest, Jesus, the Head, who, 
after He had offered one sacrifice for sin forever, sat 
down at the right hand of God. 

But His offering was in two parts; the first of which 
was at Jordan, when He offered up Himself; and the 
second was at Pentecost, when He "appeared in the presence 
of God for us"— for us living today, as well as for 
those living then. At that time He accepted the Church 
as joint-sacrificers and offered them; and in offering them 
He offered the one antitypical goat. So His offerings 
were really completed at the time of Pentecost. What is 
He waiting for? The Scriptures say He has sat down 
at the right hand of the Majesty on High, waiting for 
the time to come when His enemies shall be made His 
footstool.-Heb. 10:13. 

Meantime His Bride shall have been perfected and 
joined with Him in glory. When that time shall have 
come, His enemies shall be made His footstool. At the 

R5054: page 211 

time of His death, we remember, He said, "I pray not for 
the world, but for them which Thou hast given Me; for 
they are Thine, and all Mine are Thine." (John 17:9,10.) 



And the promise of the Father to Him is, "Ask of Me, 
and I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, 
and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession." 
-Psa. 2:8. 

The Apostle says that He sat down on the right hand 
of the Majesty on High waiting until God would make 
His enemies His footstool. God is not prepared to give 
Him these things until the Church is completed. In other 
words, the Church is not a supplemental and additional 
part of the Divine Plan. This has been the "Mystery hid 
from ages and generations."— Col. 2:26. 

THE MYSTERY UNFOLDING NOW 

Now, under the revelation of God, we see the unfolding 
of the Mystery, that the Church are to be fellow-heirs 
with our Lord in the glories of the Kingdom. Hence, it 
is the Divine Purpose for Jesus to wait until the time 
shall come when the Church will have been perfected. This 
matter of sacrifice is all to be completed during the Gospel 
Age; and this one great Day of Atonement will also be 
completed. There will be no repetition of the sacrifice. 

We remember that in Revelation 5 it is stated that no 
one was found worthy to open the scroll written within 
and on the back, and sealed with seven seals; not a soul 
was worthy. No; "No man in heaven, nor in earth, 
neither under the earth, was able to open the Book, 
neither to look thereon." Jehovah had already said to 
Abraham that He would bless the world, but had not revealed 
how it was to be done. Then we read that John 
wept, because God had a great Plan, and because no one 
was to be the recipient of that Plan, to reveal it. The 
angel said, "Weep not; behold, the Lion of the Tribe of 
Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the Book, 
and to loose the seven seals thereof." (Rev. 5:1-6.) By 

R5055 : page 211 

this we understand that He was not born with this right, 
but that He acquired it— He "hath prevailed to open the 
Book." Therefore, on account of His obedience, God also 
highly exalted Him, giving Him dignity, power and honor. 

The Lion of the Tribe of Judah was our Lord Jesus, to 
whom the Book was delivered. It is not due for any believers 
to understand any of the deep things written in 
that Book until they have come to the place of consecration. 
But God does not reveal them to us by His Spirit in 
the same manner as He revealed them to the Lord Jesus. 
John said that this is the "Revelation of Jesus Christ, 
which God gave unto Him, to show unto His servants 
things which must shortly come to pass; and He sent and 
signified it by His angel unto His servant John." "All 
things are of the Father, and all things are by the Son, 
and we by Him."— Rev. 1:1; I Cor. 8:6. 

"LIGHT SHINING MORE AND MORE UNTO THE PERFECT 



DAY" 

It would not be becoming on our part to speak with 
positiveness of how much our Lord knew during His 
earthly ministry. For how could we know except as it 
was declared? He said that the times and the seasons 
were not at that time known by any but "the Father only." 
We cannot doubt that He knows all on that subject now. 
And if our surmises are correct, we know more on that 
subject now than our Lord did then. 

Doubtless it would be impossible to understand many 
of the deep things pertaining to the Messianic Age long 
in advance of that period. Daniel tells us that the prophecies 
relating to the Time of the End were closed up, 
sealed until the end. (Dan. 12:4,9.) As these things 
became due to be understood they constituted meat in due 
season for the Household of faith. (Matt. 24:45.) For 
instance, it would be meat in due season in Noah's day to 
know about the flood; but that information would not be 
meat in due season today. 

So then we are to walk in the light and be guided by 
the Lord's Word. "For prophecy came not in old time 
by the will of man; but holy men of God spoke as they 
were moved by the Holy Spirit," St. Peter tells us. Again 
St. Paul says, "These things. ..were written for our 
admonition, upon whom the ends of the world [ages] are 
come." (2 Peter 1:21; I Cor. 10:11; John 16:7,13.) 
And our Lord said of the Holy Spirit which He would 
send, that it would "show us things to come." (John 16:7,13.) 
Thus the pathway of the Church all the way down 
has been one of increasing light. 

Our faith does not consist merely in believing in God's 
personality, God's righteousness. We fully believe in the 
personality of God, in the power of God. Nevertheless 
we need to exercise faith in the Divine providence in 
our own case; faith in the fact that God veils things from 
our mental and spiritual sight at the present time. He 
allowed things to come to Jesus which might have astonished 
our Lord if He had not exercised faith. He 
allowed our Lord to be maligned, slandered— to be 
crucified. It requires knowledge, faith, for everything 
that we are called upon to do and to undergo. We believe 
God; but, are we determined to be loyal to God and to 
His Plan? And are we willing to endure hardship and to 
sacrifice earthly interests in favor of these heavenly 
promises?

"DELIVERED FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FLESH" 

DURING THE GOSPEL AGE there has been 
but one condition upon which any may come 
to the Father. The Lord does not propose 



many ways, but only one way. "Strait is 

the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth 

unto life"— now. But when the Kingdom 

comes there will be a highway, a more 

favorable, an easier way, as the Lord states 

through the Prophet Isaiah. In it there will 

be no stumbling-stones; it will not be narrow 

and difficult, but comparatively easy; and throughout 

Messiah's reign of a thousand years, it will be the way by 

which the Adamic race may return to God. During that 

reign the whole world will be assisted, succored and disciplined, 

that they may be encouraged to go to the very 

end of the way. 

In the present time, the only way is dark, narrow, difficult; 
the light has not yet begun to shine for the world. 
The Scriptures represent the Church of Christ in this 
Gospel Age as saying, "Thy Word is a lamp unto my 
feet." In olden times men had little lanterns which they 
attached to the toes of their sandals, and as they walked 
each step would be in the light. So the Lord has been 
dealing with the Church during the Gospel Age. The 
narrow way has been dark; but we have had the "sure 
word of prophecy," which, as a lamp, shines on the pathway 
and will shine "more and more unto the perfect day." 

When that day comes men will not need the lamp; for 
then there will be sunlight. Then the knowledge of God 
will fill the whole earth. 

SACRIFICE ESSENTIAL TO DISCIPLESHIP 

One of the narrowing features of this way is that at 
the present time no one is accepted of God unless he makes 

R5055 : page 212 

a definite covenant with God. If he does not choose to 
make that covenant he may think he is a Christian, but he 
is not. In the world today four hundred million people 
are counted as Christians. Many have the idea that if 
they join the Church or do some good deed, they thus 
become followers of Christ. But the Bible very plainly 
states: "If any man will come after Me, let him deny 
himself, take up his cross, and follow Me." (Matt. 16:24.) 
This self-denial and cross-bearing is the sacrifice necessary 
to discipleship in Christ at the present time. 

Many people are not Christians because they have not 
entered into a covenant with God. The Lord speaks of 
the class now called to discipleship, saying, "Gather My 
saints together unto Me; those that have made a covenant 
with Me by sacrifice"— by a complete consecration of 
themselves; "Present your bodies living sacrifices, holy 
and acceptable unto God, your reasonable service." (Psa. 50:5; 
Rom. 12:1.) If we have been accepted in Christ, 
if we have been begotten of the Holy Spirit, it is because 
we have entered at this strait gate and upon this 
narrow way, and have made this covenant of sacrifice to 



the Lord, giving our wills and all earthly rights to Him, 
that His will may be done in us. 

After having entered this strait gate and narrow way, 
we should continue therein— not necessarily without 
stumbling, not necessarily without making mistakes; if 
we can go on ever so falteringly, to the best of our 
ability and with hearts loyal to the Lord, we shall be 
granted to sit on His throne— members of His Bride class. 

THE CARES OF THIS WORLD OVERCOME MANY 

As we are all aware the Bible shows that some who 
make this consecration, afterward become involved with 
the world, the cares of this life, and the deceitfulness of 
riches. These fail to carry out their agreement. Thus 
they are holding back the very price necessary to make 
them joint-heirs with our Lord. Whoever rejects the 
cross will not get the crown. How many people are overcharged 
with the cares of this life! How many people 
are being deluded by the deceitfulness of riches ! 

There was a gentleman with whom the writer was 
once very intimate; we were like brothers. One day he 
said, "Brother Russell, I should like very much indeed to 
be out in the Lord's work and to do some kind of service 
for the Truth, but I have a wife, and I understand that 
the Lord holds me responsible for the care of my wife. 
I could not think of going out and leaving her dependent. 
But if the Lord in His providence should ever send me 
money so that I could go without my wife's suffering any 
serious inconvenience, I would be very glad to go out and 
preach the Gospel." The Lord took him at his word. He 
was then a bookkeeper; but the Lord opened the way, by 
the death of a member of the firm, for him to become one 
of the principal partners in that firm. Without any effort 
at all he prospered financially until he was worth at least 
half a million dollars. 

One day we said to him, "Brother, we have a very 
serious matter that weighs on us a great deal." He said, 
"Tell me what it is and I will assist you, whatever it 
costs." You see how gracious he was! He thought that 
we were after his money! Dear friends, we thank God 
that we have never yet found it necessary to ask for 
money; and we do not suppose that we ever shall. We 
said, "Brother, we are in great distress, and no one but 
you can help us." "Tell me what it is," he replied. 
We said, "Dear Brother, we desire to call your attention 
to something which you said several years ago when you 
were poor." Then we recited our previous conversation 
as best we could, and said, "The Lord has given you the 
money; He has done His part; are you ready to do 
yours?" With streaming eyes he answered, "Brother 
Russell, I am so bound to my business— hand and foot- 
that it would be impossible now." The cares of this life, 
the deceitfulness of riches, according to his own words, 
had bound him hand and foot; but his heart was still loyal 



R5056 : page 212 

to God. 

We have no desire to be his judge, but we are inclined 
to think that dear brother did not get into the Kingdom. 
While we do not know, yet we fear that his being bound 
"hand and foot" may have stood in his way, though we 
think that he was truly a child of God. Are we to suppose 
that because he failed to make that sacrifice which 
he had agreed to make, he would go down into the Second 
Death? We hardly think so. We think that the Lord 
loved him and that he had a very loyal character. The 
Lord loves good characters. Our thought is that quite 
probably the dear brother will be in the Great Company; 
and we are very glad that there will be a Great Company 
class. 

OUR HUMANITY MUST DIE 

No one will get into the Little Flock class but those 
who faithfully lay down their lives in sacrifice to the 
end of the journey. God foreknew and predestinated 
that all who are of that class must be copies of His dear 
Son. If one is not a full copy of our Lord Jesus, if one 
has not left all to follow Him, then that one will not be 
of the Bride class. 

The Scriptures mention two classes— the one as a 
Little Flock and the other as a Great Company— both 
parts of the "Church of the First-borns." In the type the 
priests were members of the tribe of Levi; but there were 
others of that tribe who were not priests. The Levites as 
a whole represent, we understand, the Church of the First-born 
ones who will attain the spirit plane of being, but 
who will form two classes, a "Little Flock" or priest class, 
and a "Great Company" or Levite class. 

The voluntary sacrificing of the flesh is for one to 
give himself of his own free will to the Lord and to submit 
himself to the Lord Jesus as the great High Priest to 
carry out for him the work of sacrifice. What of those 
who make this arrangement and then fail to make the 
sacrifice? Their earthly life is consecrated; God has 
given them the Holy Spirit of adoption, and has accepted 
the arrangement whereby they gave up all their earthly 
rights. Such can never get the world's salvation. They 
voluntarily gave up all right to life on the human plane. 
When God gave them the Holy Spirit, He accepted the 
contract, binding on both sides. They will get the heavenly 
nature or nothing. 

"DELIVERED OVER TO SATAN" 

Those who do not go on to give themselves fully in 
sacrifice are delivered over to the Adversary to buffet 
them until their flesh shall be destroyed— until these 
earthly, clinging tendencies which were holding them 
from full loyalty to God are broken down and their minds 



become fully submissive and in harmony with God. That 
which they refused to give voluntarily will be taken away 
from them. 

The only knowledge we have of this matter is from 
the Apostle's words. St. Paul, addressing the Church at 
Corinth, said that they had amongst them a brother who 
was not living according to his covenant, but who was 
living in a measure of sin. The Apostle reprimanded the 
Church for not having done their duty by the brother. 
Then said he, "I verily, as absent in body, but present in 
spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, 
concerning him that hath so done this deed... to deliver 

R5056 : page 213 

such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the 
flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord 
Jesus." (I Cor. 5:3,5.) If the flesh is not destroyed, 
the spirit will not be saved, is the Apostle's argument. 

This statement gives us an inkling of the Lord's will. 
In every case it is necessary that the flesh be destroyed. 
If the will is overcome by the flesh, the result will be the 
death of the will also; that is, the Second Death. But if 
the will desires to be in harmony with the Lord, then, 
although the enforced destruction of the flesh is not 
sacrifice, and such are not counted in with the sacrificers, 
yet they are saved "so as by fire" on the spirit plane, in 
the day of the Lord Jesus.— I Cor. 3:15. 

Regarding the case that we have mentioned earlier in 
this article you might ask, Did that Brother lose the 
knowledge of the Truth? We will tell you; for this is a 
very interesting question. 

In this Brother's case we do not know what were the 
sentiments of his heart, of course, for we are not able 
to judge those. But he left us and joined the Presbyterian 
Church. Then he joined the Christian Alliance 
people and tried to believe in faith-healing and to practice 
it, although he had possessed much knowledge of the 
Truth along these lines. After pressing along the line of 
faith-healing, etc., he had several attacks of sickness and 
had to call in a doctor, notwithstanding faith-cures. 
Finally, after very serious illness lasting a number of 
weeks, he passed away. We do not know enough about 
him to say to what extent his mind was turned toward the 
Lord. We had no opportunity of knowing; for his attitude 
had more or less cut us off from our previous intimate 
fellowship. 

Another case was called to our attention by a brother 
who asked us this very question— "Do you think this to be 
a case of what we might call "the destruction of the 
flesh'?" It seemed to us that it was such a case. We 
cite it: 

A brother living in a certain city received the Truth 
and rejoiced in it greatly. He found another brother, 
with whom he liked to meet and talk about the glad 
message. He seemed to show the right spirit, just ready 



for the Truth, and it was satisfying to his heart. But his 
wife was very indignant. She opposed him saying, 
"Choose between your religion and me; you cannot have 
both." She put the matter very squarely before him; and 
he chose his wife. It was only a little while afterwards, 
as the story came to us, that apparently the Lord put the 
poor brother where he was very sorry for his choice. He 
contracted some kind of loathsome disease, and in the 
midst of his terrible suffering his wife deserted him. 

We hope that the Lord did not desert him and that 
eventually he was forgiven by the Lord; for it looked as 
if the Lord had taken that brother at his own proposition; 
that he was really a child of God, but not of the overcoming 
class. He loved his wife more than the Lord and 
was not worthy to be a member of the Bride class. So 
apparently he suffered such entire destruction of the flesh 
as he probably never expected to know. He must have 
loved his wife a great deal to give the Lord up for 
her. 

Yet she deserted him at a time of great need! Even 
from the standpoint of the world it would seem wrong for 
a wife to leave her husband under those conditions. We 
may readily suppose that the brother came back to the 
Lord at the closing hours, learning his lesson well, and 
perhaps making certain promises to the Lord. If so we 
doubt not that his spirit will be saved in the day of the 
Lord Jesus. 



R5057 : page 213 

THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AND HER MISSION 

THERE CAN be no question that the Church 

of Christ is an Ecclesia, a Body, and that 

Christ Jesus is the Head of the "Church, 

which is His Body." (Eph. 1:22,23.) There 

can be no question that the different members 

of the Church are being called— drawn 

by a selective process— from the world of 

mankind. The testimony of the Scriptures 

as to the object of the call seems also to be 

clear. The Apostle Peter says that the 

Church is a people for a purpose; that is, God has a 

special object or purpose in selecting the Church. They 

are to "show forth the praises of Him who hath called 

them out of darkness into His marvelous light," "that men 

may see their good works and glorify their Father which 

is in heaven. "-I Pet. 2:9; Matt. 5:16. 

We ask respecting the object of this shining of the 
light, and the Scriptures answer that it will have an 
effect upon the world, reproving mankind and setting before 
them an example of better living, better thinking. 
We ask whether this is the ultimate object of the call. 
The Scriptures answer that it is not; that the Church is 



called out to be a privileged people and to become joint-heirs 
with her Lord in His Kingdom. We ask further, 
whether He really is to have a Kingdom. The Scriptures 
answer, Yes; at the end of this Gospel Age He will come, 
not as a Sin-Offering, but as a great King, Prophet, Judge, 
to dispense the blessings secured by His death. We ask 
respecting the share of the Church at the present time. 
The answer comes that those who faithfully follow the 
Lamb through good report and evil report, who take up 
their cross and follow Jesus, will be accounted worthy 
to be His associates in the Kingdom. 

THE MISSION OF THE CHURCH 

We ask whether the Church will be able to combat the 
evil tendencies in the world. The answer is, Yes; Satan 
will be bound for a thousand years, that he shall deceive 
the nations no more till the thousand years shall have 
been fulfilled. During those years the Savior's mission 
will be to bless mankind as the "Sun of Righteousness," 
with "healing" in His beams; and the Church is to have 
a share with Him in the blessing of the world. We ask 
whether this is some new proposition God has made; and 
the answer comes, No; this was God's Plan and purpose 
from before the foundation of the world. This is the 
Gospel, or good tidings, first declared to Abraham: "In 
thy Seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."— 
Gen. 12:3, etc. 

God intended to bless all the members of the human 
race, all nations and kindreds and tongues, and purposed 
that the blessing should come to them through the Seed of 
Abraham. The Jewish nation were merely the typical 
seed; the antitypical Seed is The Christ (Jesus the Head 
and the Church His Body), who will "bless all the 
families of the earth." But the world must wait for its 
blessing until the Church shall have been completed, shall 
have passed the veil, and shall sit with Christ in His 
Throne. 

Asked as to the success of the blessing which will 
attend the work of the Church, the Scriptures answer 
that "Every knee shall bow and every tongue confess"; 

R5057 : page 214 

and that the knowledge of God shall fill the whole earth. 
As to whether this means a universal salvation— that 
everybody will be saved— the answer is that God has 
provided that as all died in Adam, so all are to be revivified, 
brought back to the privilege of attaining everlasting 
life, through the merit of Christ's sacrifice; but 
that the attainment of everlasting life will depend upon 
the manner in which the privilege is used. None will be 
coerced or compelled. 

The majority of mankind have such respect for righteousness 
that if its rewards were as sure and as desirable 
as are those of sin, unquestionably they would prefer to 



do right. Many tell us that they have been almost forced 
to do evil. Only the very few are willing to renounce sin 
and to walk in the narrow way of obedience and self-sacrifice. 
While those who do so in this Age are to have 
a very special reward, others who love righteousness and 
hate iniquity will, under the rule of Christ's Kingdom, 
have every assistance without compulsion. They will have 
co-operation in their endeavors for righteousness. The 
Scriptures, however, with equal force declare that as 
death was the original penalty of sin in Adam's case, so 
it will always be the penalty for sin; and that whoever 
during the future Age sins wilfully shall die the Second 
Death, from which there will be no resurrection, no 
redemption, no hope of recovery. 

THE EARTH IS TO BE MAN'S FUTURE HOME 

Before sin had entered into the world, the Divine 
provision for our first parents was the Garden of Eden. 
As we think of this, let our minds turn to the future, 
guided by the Word of God; and in mental vision we see 
Paradise restored— not a garden merely, but the entire 
earth made beautiful, fruitful, sinless, happy. Then we 
recall the inspired promise so familiar to us— "And God 
shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall 
be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall 
there be any more pain," for the former things of sin and 
death will have passed away, and all things will have been 
made new!— Rev. 21:4,5. 

Recalling St. Peter's words of assurance respecting 
these glorious "Times of Restitution of all things, which 
God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy Prophets 
since the world began," we see that in God's "due time" 
the earth is to be brought to the perfection primarily 
designed for it, and typed in Eden. We believe that time 
to be near at hand. We see the promised blessings coming. 
What are our vast irrigation schemes by artesian 
wells and by aqueducts but fulfilments of the prophecies 
pertaining to the reign of Christ and the blessing of the 
earth! "In the wilderness shall waters break out, and 
streams in the desert. The wilderness and the solitary 
place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice 
and blossom as the rose."— Isa. 35:6,1. 

The Scriptures tell us that after God had created 
various orders of spirit beings He made man, "a little 
lower than the angels." (Psa. 8:5.) The human race 
began with Adam and Eve, who had ability to grasp and 
appreciate the Divine arrangement, as the brute creation 
have not. God made man in His own likeness. The fact 
that sin came in and brought Father Adam under the 
sentence of death does not signify that the Heavenly 
Father had changed His arrangement. The purpose 
which He had "in the beginning" has never changed. 

We can see a reason why the entire world was not 
made an Eden; namely, God intended to give the race a 
trial. According to the record of the Scriptures, if the 



first pair had maintained their righteousness, their holiness, 

R5058 : page 214 

they would have continued to be perfect and would 
have propagated a perfect race; and if sin had not come 
in, God would have been responsible for their maintenance. 
But God, foreseeing that sin would come in, merely 
made Eden perfect, and allowed the remainder of the 
earth to continue in an unfinished condition. Consequently 
God said to Adam, "Cursed is the ground for thy sake; 
in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and 
thou shalt eat the herb of the field; in the sweat of thy 
face shalt thou eat bread."— Gen. 3:17-19. 

EARTH'S IMPERFECTION IS FALLEN MAN'S BLESSING 

God could have made the entire earth perfect as easily 
as He "planted" the little garden in Eden. But He foresaw 
that if the earth were perfected the death-struggle 
would be longer, and the degradation of man greater. 
The poverty of the world has assisted in keeping mankind 
back from greater depths of iniquity. The sentence, 
"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread," was 
evidently intended as a blessing, that man might learn 
lessons of experience by battling with the earth for his 
living. As the Creator said to the man regarding the 
curse of the earth, it was "for thy [man's] sake." So 
man has learned that "The wages of sin is death." The 
Heavenly Father has not, however, changed His Plan. 
When the Kingdom is set up, the earth shall yield her increase; 
and God assures us, "I will make the place of My 
feet glorious."— Isa. 60:13. 

Edison has been the instrument of Providence in giving 
us wonderful electrical devices. Burbank and others 
have, under Divine guidance, worked miracles in horticulture. 
What beautiful fruits and flowers have followed 
as results! It is difficult to imagine anything nearer perfection 
either in Eden of old or the world-wide Eden to 
be established! In referring to the "Times of Restitution" 
the Prophet declares that "the earth shall yield her increase." 
(Psa. 67:6.) We behold preparations for the 
fulfilment of this promise. 

A few years ago a Virginia farmer found an abnormal 
stool of wheat— one hundred and forty-two stalks, each 
bearing a well-developed head— the offspring of a single 
grain of wheat! Under the name of "Miracle Wheat" it 
is now being developed slowly in various parts of the 
country. The average yield appears to be about twelve 
hundred grains from one kernel. This very year the same 
peculiarity in oats has been found, a stool growing wild 
by the roadside. The same Divine Providence is, additionally, 
guiding our chemists in economical methods of 
extracting nitrogen from the atmosphere for feeding the 
soil, and thus to increase earth's blessings, in fulfillment 



of God's promise that He will make His footstool glorious. 

Why has not the earth been already made glorious? 
The answer is that God is allowing the race to propagate 
first. Had mankind been perfect, they might have learned 
the lesson of the sinfulness of sin in the same way that 
the angels have learned. But hastening to commit sin, they 
have learned evil first and have been subject to all the 
vicissitudes of sin and death. The angels have learned 
the other lesson— what righteousness is, what good is— 
not merely in the abstract, but in an appreciative sense. 

MANKIND WILL LEARN A SECOND LESSON 

God is now selecting the Church. As soon as the 
Church shall have been completed, then mankind will have 
opportunity to learn the lesson of righteousness, the 
knowledge of God, and will be raised up out of sin and 
death, out of the weaknesses that have come to them 
through sin. This uplifting time is definitely marked out 
in the Scriptures as "Times of Restitution"— the restoration 

R5058 : page 215 

of that which was lost. Since that which was lost 
was human perfection and Edenic bliss, mankind will not 
get heavenly things, but earthly blessings. God's will 
shall be accomplished. The world will be brought to perfection 
during the thousand years of Messiah's reign. The 
most important piece of Restitution work relates to man. 
The hard, stony selfishness of heart, which is world-wide, 
is neither God-likeness nor to God's glory. 
"Man's inhumanity to man 
Makes countless thousands mourn." 
Nineteen centuries of preaching show that the cure 
for this malady is not in our power; and that only the 
few even desire to seek for the Lord's spirit of gentleness 
and tender-heartedness. But the great King of Glory is 
also the Good Physician. He alone can cure the disease 
of sin and its results. Through Him God's promise to 
Israel will be fulfilled: "I will take away the stony heart 
out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh." 
(Ezek. 36:26.) This work will proceed from Israel to 
all the families of the earth, uplifting all the willing and 
obedient out of sin and death to all that was lost in Eden 
and redeemed at Calvary. Thank God, the unwilling and 
disobedient will not be consigned to endless torture, but to 
the "Second Death"— "everlasting destruction." The perfected 
earth will abide forever for the glorious being, man. 

THE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST 

God has purposed to make a New Creation. Incidentally 
He takes the opportunity to call the Church to be 
associated with her Lord in the divine nature, far above 
principalities and powers and every name that is named. 
Thus eventually, when all wilful sinners shall have been 



blotted out, we find, as the Scriptures state, that "every 
creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and such 
as are in the sea" will be heard saying, "Blessing and 
honor and glory and power be unto Him that sitteth upon 
the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever." (Rev. 5:13.) 
Thus the Lord will gather together all the faithful, 
both in heaven and in earth, under the headship of 
Christ, whose Head is Jehovah.— Eph. 1:10. 



R5056 : page 215 

"CONTEND FOR THE FAITH" 

"Ye should earnestly contend for the faith which 
was once delivered unto the saints."— Jude 3. 

THE CONTENTION which the Scriptures reprobate 

is that of selfishness— contending 

for place, for power, for our friends against 

some one else's friends, for our ideas against 

those of others. And the implication is 

given that those who are thus contentious 

will never enter into the Kingdom; for this 

contentious spirit indicates a wrong attitude 

or condition. 

It is one thing, however, to be inveigled 
into something or to be overtaken in a fault, and quite 
another thing to contend along selfish lines. Amongst the 
Lord's people, even in the Apostles' day, there was a 
tendency at times to fight each other rather than to fight 
the Devil and the spirit of the world and the weaknesses 
within themselves. The organs of destructiveness and 
combativeness, which would serve a Christian soldier in 
good stead if directed against his own weaknesses and 
blemishes, are sadly out of place when, ignoring his own 
weaknesses, he merely becomes contentious with the 
brethren— often over nothing or over questions whose importance 
he exaggerates, because of his contentious spirit. 
Such should remember the Scriptural statement that "he 
that ruleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh a city." 
-Prov. 16:32. 

The Apostle Paul reprehends that misdirection of 
Christian energy which "bites and devours" one another 
and warns against it as tending to the destruction of all 
that is spiritual amongst the Lord's people. Not that the 
Apostle favored slackness as respects the important principles 
of Divine Revelation, for he showed always his 
determination to contend for righteousness; as one instance 
of this we recall his own words regarding his rebuke 
of one of the other Apostles, older in the Christian 
faith than himself— "I withstood him to the face, because 
he was to be blamed." 

COMMENDABLE CONTENTION 



But while all of the Lord's people should be on guard 
against the spirit of contention, watching closely lest anything 
be done in a biting and devouring manner, instead 
of manifesting patience and long suffering, brotherly-kindness, 
love, yet they have enlisted as New Creatures, 
spirit-begotten, to walk after the Spirit, and they must 

R5057 : page 215 

continually recognize this fact and keep watch that they 
are always walking in line with the spirit of the Truth; 
and our text tells us of a contention which is not only 
proper, but necessary for all who are walking in this way. 
They are to "earnestly contend for the faith"— for the 
Word of God, for the promises which God has made, for 
the good things for which God has arranged. 

The necessity for this course lies in the fact that this 
world is no friend to grace; no friend, therefore, to the 
people of God. Selfishness, which is the spirit of the 
world, lies on the side opposite to the Holy Spirit of love; 
and our own selfish interests are in line with the world in 
general. Consequently, no one could properly contend for 
the faith with a selfish motive, for the "faith once delivered 
unto the saints" would forbid such a motive and 
condemn it at once. One reason, undoubtedly, why the 
Lord has permitted His cause to be in disesteem and subject 
to the attacks of the world, and particularly of evil 
spirits in the world, is that He desires to have for His 
people in this "little flock" a tried people, a people of 
character. Character implies such fixity of purpose and 
intention that the individual would fight a "good fight" 
against every influence tending to lead away from the 
Lord's Word and the Lord's brethren. 

The world and its theories are in opposition to the 
saints; therefore, we must contend against the selfish 
human and devilish arrangements which prevail at the 
present time. It is possible for one to be contentious in 
religious matters, and to "earnestly contend," and yet such 
a course be not contending "for the faith once delivered 
to the saints." One might be contentious for some pet 
theory of his own rather than for those principles of 
righteousness which the Bible inculcates. 

Sometimes it might seem like contention for the faith 
once delivered to the saints for one person to argue with 
another on Scriptural subjects, and yet his real motive in 
so doing might be pride. Pride is a part of selfishness; 
therefore in contending for his own ideas one might be 
cultivating pride. The contention which God would 
approve is that earnest desire to have whatever God's Word 
teaches. We must not contend with the tongue improperly, 
nor speak slanderously. In all of our contentions 
we should manifest the fruits of the Holy Spirit- 
gentleness, brotherly-kindness, love. Thus the proper 
contention would not partake of anger, hatred, malice or 
strife.

A LEGION OF DEMONS 

--MARK 4:35; 5:20~AUGUST 11.- 

Text: "God is our Refuge and Strength, a very present help 
in trouble; therefore will we not fear, though the earth be 
changed, and though the mountains be cast 
into the midst of the sea."— Psalm 46:1,2. 

THE FOREPART of today's study is an account 

of a very severe wind storm on the 

Sea of Galilee. Jesus, tired from His 

teaching and healing, in which vitality went 

out of Him for the relief of the people, 

had gotten into one of the boats formerly 

used by some of His disciples in the fishing 

business and still owned by them. The purpose 

was to cross the lake for a season of 

rest and refreshment. The Master in the 

hinder part of the boat on a cushion was soon fast asleep. 

Suddenly a terrific storm set in which appalled even those 

accustomed to such scenes. The winds were blowing and 

the waves were tossing over the gunwales. It was an 

emergency; they could not bale out the water fast enough, 

and they wondered that the Master slept through it all. 

They came to Him and aroused Him saying, "Master, 

carest Thou not that we perish?" and He awakened and 

rebuked the wind saying, "Peace, be still." And immediately 

"there was a great calm." 

The experience was a valuable lesson to the Apostles, 
showing them the wonderful power of God exerted 
through their Master. And the same lesson comes down 
to us today. There are storms of life which sometimes 
sweep over ourselves and the brethren and over the whole 
household and imperil us, and which seem sure to sink 
us in despair. Then is the time for us to exercise faith 
in Him who said, "I will never leave thee nor forsake 
thee." Then is the time to remember the Master's words, 
"My grace is sufficient for you; My strength is made 
perfect in your weakness." Whoever can by the exercise 
of his faith take hold upon the Lord will find a great 
peace, a great calm come into his heart and into all of his 
affairs. Then he can remember the Master's promise 
that "all things shall work together for good to those who 
love God, and who have been called according to His 
Purpose."— Rom. 8:28. 

The text at the head of this study draws to our attention 
another storm. It pictures the great storm of trouble 
which in the close of this Age will suddenly burst upon 
the whole world of mankind and in which "Babylon the 
Great, the Mother of Harlots," "like a great millstone will 



be cast into the midst of the sea." This same "time of 
trouble," in some Scriptures, is spoken of as a "whirlwind," 
the result of letting loose "the four winds of 
heaven," that will be held until that time.— Rev. 17:5; 18:21; 
Jer. 25:32; Rev. 7:1. 

Again, this trouble is symbolized by a "fire" which 
will burn not only the earth (symbolical of organized 
society), but also the heavens (symbolical of ecclesiasticism). 
This symbolical fire, this great anarchistic blaze, will 
leave present institutions in "ashes." Upon the ruins, the 
ashes, of the blasted hopes and ambitions of society, 
political, scientific and religious, will arise the glorious 
Kingdom of Messiah to bless the world; and it will be as 
prophesied: "The desire of all nations shall come." It is 
really what all nations desire, although they do not realize 
how their desires are to be accomplished by Divine interposition 

R5059 : page 216 

through Messiah's Kingdom. 

Our text pictures that coming "time of trouble" as a 
great "storm," which will entirely remove, or change the 
earth, or the present construction of society, and carry the 
"mountains," the kingdoms of this present time, into the 
sea of anarchy. God's people will to some extent be 
associated with all of these troubles; but they are not to 
fear, they are to realize that God is at the helm. "When 
all around their souls give way, He then will be their 
Hope and Stay." Although sharing with others in the 
great disaster, the troubles will not invade their hearts. 
With them will dwell faith in God and in the glorious 
promises of His Word, and they will be kept in peace 
thereby. 

"JESUS GAVE THEM LEAVE" 

In the heading we have connected this study with the 
demons, because the Scriptures intimate that the demons 
will have considerable to do with stirring up the great 
"time of trouble" and discontent with which this Age 
will close and Messiah's Kingdom be established. 

On the other side of the Lake, as they landed, a man 
came running toward them, having seen them afar off. 
He was obsessed— that is to say, demons, the fallen angels 
mentioned by St. Jude (Jude 6) and St. Peter (2 Pet. 2:4) 
had gained access, and were in control of him. It was 
these that recognized Jesus and that spoke through the 
man's lips, saying, "What have I to do with Thee, Jesus, 
Thou Son of the Most High God? I adjure Thee by God 
that Thou torment me not." This was the answer to the 
command of Jesus that the fallen spirits should come out 
of the man. It transpired that not merely one demon 
had gained access, but many of them, a legion. 

The demons realized that they were subject to the commands 
of Jesus and requested that they be allowed to enter 
into the swine— to obsess them. The Bible's explanation 



of how some angels fell from their original perfection and 
harmony with God, and of why they seek to gain control 
of humanity and commune with them through mediums, 
and why they personate the dead, we have not the space 
to present in this study; but as there are many today 
more or less under the influence of demonism— spiritism 
—we will send further information upon postcard 
request. 

Jesus gave the demons the privilege they requested, of 
passing from the man into the swine, of which there were 
about 2,000. The swine, like the man, were crazed by 
the strange outside influence which took possession of 
their brains. They ran violently down a steep place into 
the sea and were drowned. Meantime, the man, released 
from his obsession, was again in his right mind, and 
praised God for his deliverance. He desired to go with 
Jesus to become one of his disciples. He wanted to preach 
to others of the great deliverance which he had experienced 
and to tell them of this further proof that Jesus 
was the Messiah. But this was not in harmony with the 
Lord's judgment of the Father's will, and He refused his 
company, instructing him to go unto his own house and 
to tell his friends what great things the Lord had done 
for him. 

He did so, and the people from all the region around 
who had known him as a crazy and obsessed man, marveled 
at his recovery and took note of the fact that Jesus 
had healed him. Those familiar with such matters claim 
that probably one-half of all the inmates of our insane 
asylums are persons obsessed by evil spirits, demons, 
without any organic disease of the brain. And alas ! we 
see evidences on every hand that these evil spirits are 
paving the way for a great onslaught upon humanity. 

Under the title of Psychic Phenomena spiritism is being 
examined by some of the prominent college professors 
of our day. They, like other spiritists, are deceived in 

R5059 : page 217 

supposing that the manifestations which come to them 
are from their dead human friends. The Bible alone 
makes the matter perfectly clear. It assures us that the 
dead have no power to thus communicate, and that all 
such communications come from the demons, who do not 
dare to tell who they are, for if they did, humanity would 
be on guard against them; and they, desiring to come 
closely in contact with humanity, personate and represent 
variously the dead. 

Hypnotism, mesmerism, clairaudient power and clairvoyant 
power are all part and parcel of the same great 
deception.

JEWESS RESTORED TO LIFE 

--MARK 5:21-24, 35-43. -AUGUST 18.- 

Text: "And He took the damsel by the hand and said unto her, 
Talitha cumi, which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say 
unto thee, arise."— Vs. 41. 

WHEN JESUS and the Apostles returned to 

the vicinity of Capernaum, the people were 

on the lookout for them, especially Jairus, 

one of the rulers of the synagogue. He 

came and fell at Jesus' feet in great distress. 

He besought Him to come and heal 

his little daughter who lay at the point of 

death. As they went to the house of Jairus 

the multitude followed and thronged and 

delayed the procession. Meantime a messenger 

arrived from Jairus' house, telling that the child 

was dead. But Jesus said to the bereaved father, "Be not 

afraid, only believe." 

The multitude was left, and only three of the Apostles, 
Peter, James and John, went on with Jesus and Jairus. 
When they arrived they beheld a great tumult connected 
with the customary weeping and wailing. Jesus astonished 
the mourners by telling them not to weep, that the 
child was not dead, but asleep. What did He mean? Did 
the Great Teacher prevaricate? He spoke in the same 
manner in respect to His friend Lazarus, saying, "Lazarus 
sleepeth," and then later He explained that he was 
dead. How shall we understand these words? What 
were the facts? What was the truth in the case? 

"ALL LIVE UNTO HIM" 

The key to the matter is given us in our Lord's own 
words to the Sadducees, a class who denied that there 
would be any resurrection of the dead or any future life. 
The Sadducees asked Jesus a question about a woman who 
had had seven husbands, and who died after them all. 
They thought to make the teachings of Jesus respecting 
the resurrection of the dead look ridiculous by this question, 
but our Lord answered, "You do err, not understanding 
the Scriptures, nor the power of God." 

Jesus proceeded to give them a proof that the dead are 
not really dead in the sense that the brute beasts are dead, 
because God in His Plan had made an arrangement for the 
resurrection of humanity from the death state, whereas 
He has made no arrangement for the resurrection of the 
brute beasts. The provision for man's resurrection was 
that God would provide a Redeemer to satisfy the claims 
of Divine Justice against Adam and all his race, and who 
thus would become the Great Deliverer, and, establishing 
His Messianic Kingdom, would release all mankind from 
the power of death. 

From this standpoint, God's standpoint, no human being 



is dead in the sense of being extinct like the brute 
beast. Their awakening will be accomplished by Messiah's 
Kingdom, and all will then have fullest opportunity 
of coming to a knowledge of God's character and His will 
respecting them; and all will be assisted back to harmony 
with God, if they so desire, that they may thus reach 
again the perfection of life lost by disobedience. It is in 
view of this Divine intention, the awakening of the dead, 
that Jesus spoke of death as a "sleep," a period of rest, of 
quiet, of unconsciousness. 

Jesus' declaration to the Sadducees evidenced all this 
when He stated that God said to Moses at the burning 
bush, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and 
the God of Jacob." Jesus pointed out that God does not thus 
speak of Himself as being the God of a being absolutely 
extinct, destroyed, as brute beasts. The expression therefore 
signifies, in harmony with all the Scriptures, that 
there will be a resurrection of the dead, and that mankind 
in general are merely sleeping, waiting for Messiah's 
Kingdom and the morning of awakening, the morning of 
a better day, in which righteousness will prevail and in 
which Messiah will be the Great King. 

This same thought respecting the sleep of the dead 
prevails throughout the Bible. We read, for instance, 
that "Abraham slept with his fathers"; "When Stephen, 
stoned to death, fell asleep" (Acts 7:60); St. Paul declared 
that the Church "sleep," but that some of its members, 
alive in the end of the Age, at the second coming of 
Christ, would not need to "sleep," but instead would "be 
changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye." (I Cor. 15:52.) 
Again he mentions all that "sleep in Jesus." 
Figuratively, both good and bad, are thus asleep in Jesus, 
because all of God's provision for their awakening is in 
and through Jesus' work of Redemption and Restitution. 
-Acts 3:19-21. 

We are not to surmise that these sleep in heaven, because 
both good and bad sleep. For instance, in the statement, 
"Abraham slept with his fathers," we see two 
classes— Abraham, the friend of God, and his fathers, 
heathen men. Besides, Heaven is not a sleeping place, 

R5060 : page 217 

but a place of joyful activity and life. Neither could we 
imagine mankind as sleeping in a Catholic purgatory, nor 
in a Protestant hell of eternal torture. 

Looking into the Bible for an answer as to where they 
sleep we hear the inspired words, "They that sleep in the 
dust of the earth shall awake." (Dan. 12:2.) Ah, that 
is it!— "Dust to dust," as God said in the beginning to 
Father Adam, upon whom the sentence fell and through 
whom we inherit our share: "Cursed is the earth for thy 
sake," "thorns and thistles shall it bring forth unto thee 
wast taken." (Gen. 3:17-19.) Thus God has provided for 
Adam and his family a redemption from the power of 
death and a deliverance from the tomb, by the power of 



the resurrection; and it is Jesus who declared, "I am the 
Resurrection and the Life." The Church will be the first 
from humanity to receive eternal life, and they will be 
granted a share with Jesus in His resurrection to glory, 
honor and immortality, as His Bride, His Joint-heir 
under His Headship. Then, as said the Apostle, will come 
the world of mankind, "every man in his own order." 

THEY LAUGHED AT HIM 

Jesus put the statement about the maid's being asleep 
in a forceful way, in order to impress the great lesson that 
death does not end all, even though it appears so to do. The 
awakening which He was about to perform was to be a 

R5060 : page 218 

lesson and illustration of Divine power, which will be exercised 

toward the entire race under the Messianic Kingdom. 

Thus, as He declared, "All that are in their graves 

shall hear the voice of the Son of Man, and come forth." 

This statement applies not merely to the saintly Church, 

who will come forth first, sharers in the First Resurrection, 

and whose trial and testing are already past, and 

whom Divine approval has already sealed. The promise 

of coming forth applies also to the remainder of mankind; 

all except the spirit-begotten will come forth in a 

secondary or general resurrection, which will include 

nearly all mankind, not only the civilized, but also the 

heathen. 

The world will come forth, Jesus said, that they may 
have a resurrection or raising up, up, up to perfection, to 
all that was lost in Eden, to all that was redeemed at Calvary. 
The awakening will be but a preparatory step. It 
will be accomplished instantaneously, but the further raising 
up, to mental, moral and physical perfection, will be a 
gradual work for which a thousand years has been apportioned, 
and in which the individual will be obliged to cooperate 
for his advancement and instruction in righteousness. 
This resurrection of mankind in general Jesus 
styled, "The resurrection by judgment," by disciplines, by 
trials and testings. Only those who wilfully reject the 
Lord and His way will die the Second Death, from which 
there will be no resurrection. Christ died once for all, 
and, according to the Scriptures, He will not die again. 

Let us not forget that our Lord's miracles were merely 
illustrations of the great work which He will do on a 
world-wide, gigantic scale by and by— through the power 
and influence of His Kingdom. He and the Church, as 
spirit beings, will, of course, be invisible to men, but 
through earthly Agents the great burden of sickness and 
sorrow and pain and death will gradually be rolled away, 
so that by the end of Messiah's reign of a thousand years 
all the willing and obedient will have attained full human 
perfection; and the earth, meantime, will have been 
made to "blossom as the rose," and, as the Lord's footstool, 



thenceforth it shall be glorious.

PERTLE SPRINGS CONVENTION 

ABOUT ONE THOUSAND of the "household 

of faith" gathered at Pertle Springs, Mo., 

in harmony with announcements in these 

columns. A most delightful season of 

fellowship was experienced. Some could 

not remain the entire time, but others, 

probably two-thirds, took full benefit from 

start to finish. About twenty speakers participated 

in the services. The location is 

quite favorable for a Convention of that 

size. Any more would have overcrowded our Auditorium 

and the comfortable capacity of the hotels and cottages. 

At the conclusion a vote of thanks was given to the 

various entertainers and the local railway for their attentions 

to the Convention, which helped to make it the 

success it was. We hesitate to say that it was the "Best 

Convention yet," but truth demands the statement. This 

certainly was the testimony of everyone from whom we 

heard. The reason generally given was that the number 

in attendance being small made the opportunity for 

Christian fellowship greater, and that this, in conjunction 

with the fact that we had the place to ourselves without 

annoyance or outside distractions, constituted it the most 

blessed of all our Conventions from the standpoint of 

Christian fellowship and helpfulness. 

The Editor quite agrees with the reasoning, but believes 
that it is safe to conclude that the improvement of 
one Convention over another rests in the fact that the 
Church in general is growing in grace and knowledge 
and love as the days, weeks and years go by. "What 
manner of persons ought ye to be!" continually rings in 
our ears. What manner of Conventions ought we to 
have! what fellowship of spirit! Our hope is the same 
in respect to the other Conventions yet to be held— in 
Toronto, Canada, June 30 to July 6; at Glen Echo, Washington 
City, July 7 to 14; Glasgow, Scotland, July 25 to 
28; London, England, August 2 to 5; Halifax, Nova 
Scotia, September 29 to October 1 .

SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS 
GREAT COMPANY NOT SHOWN IN THE PYRAMID 
QUESTION. -Is there nothing in the Great 



Pyramid to represent the Great Company- 
trie Bride's virgin companions, who will 
follow her? (Psa. 45:14.) We understand 
your interpretation to teach that the Queen's 
Chamber symbolically represents those who 
will attain perfection on the human plane, 
and that the King's Chamber symbolically 
represents those who will attain to the 
divine nature. Is the Great Company not 
shown in the Pyramid, or have you merely neglected to 
call attention to the feature which symbolizes it? 

Answer.— God, during this Gospel Age of nearly nineteen 
centuries, has been calling the Church to glory, honor 
and immortality. During the next Age, under Messiah's 
Kingdom, He will open up a way of Restitution and return 
to earthly perfection for all the willing and obedient 
of mankind. God did not call any to be of the Great Company 
Class. Those who will ultimately be of that class, 
"saved as by fire," will get a reward to which they were 
never called, or invited. There is but one call during this 
Age; as we read, "Ye are called in one hope of your 
calling." (Eph. 4:4.) That call was to self-sacrifice— to 
walk in the footsteps of Jesus. Only by making that 
covenant of sacrifice were any of us accepted or begotten 
of the Holy Spirit or privileged to call ourselves the elect 
of God. 

In view of these things it would seem quite appropriate 
that the Great Pyramid does not show a place for the 
Great Company, as though they had been invited to such 
a place. 

The ante-chamber, as we have already pointed out, 
marks the experiences of the Church in the School of 
Christ, which are necessary before any could pass, by the 
power of the First Resurrection, into the Divine perfection 
symbolized by the King's Chamber. We may, therefore, 
assume that the Great Company class all come into 
this Ante-chamber, or School, but that only the "faithful 
unto death" pass beyond it under the granite leaf into the 
King's Chamber. 



SIGNIFICANCE OF PLANES L AND K ON CHART 

Question.— In describing the Chart you say, Vol. I, 
page 21 1, "These, when born from the dead in the resurrection, 
will have the divine nature and form." Please 
harmonize this statement with another found on page 235, 
which reads thus: "We know not how long it will be 

R5060 : page 219 

after their change, or perfecting, as spirit beings (plane 
L), before they as a full and complete company will be 
glorified (plane K) with the Lord, united with Him in 
power and great glory." 



Answer.— The two quotations are in perfect accord. 
The questioner's difficulty is in respect to what is signified 
by plane "L" and plane "K" on the Chart. Plane "L" 
represents the personal glory of our Lord and the Church 
by the power of the First Resurrection, from human 
nature to divine nature. We understand that all the members 
of the elect Church will experience such a change, 
from mortal to immortal conditions, from human to divine 
nature, from weakness to power, from dishonor to glory, 
from animal to spirit conditions (I Cor. 15:44), before 
being ushered into the glory of power and dominion 
represented by plane "K." In other words, the first quotation 
refers to the personal exaltation of all the spirit-begotten, 
overcoming class in the First Resurrection, to 
plane "L," and the second to their exaltation to plane 
"K," which will come when the Heavenly Bridegroom 
shall present His Bride complete, without fault or blame, 
before the Heavenly Father, as pictured in the 
45th Psalm. 



THE RESURRECTION POWER NOW AT WORK. 

Question.— Does the resurrection power now work in 
the lives of the saints? 

Answer.— The resurrection power is now working in 
the lives of the saints. In Romans 8:11 the Apostle says, 
"If the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead 
dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall 
also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit indwelling." 
This does not refer to future resurrections. It refers to 
the energizing of your mortal body. The Apostle argues 
that we were alive unto sin once, but that when we made 
our full surrender to the Lord we became dead to sin; 
that when we were begotten of the Holy Spirit we became 
New Creatures, in this earthen vessel; and that the 
body is reckoned dead to sin and the New Creature alive 
to God. Now, the Apostle says, the Spirit of God is able 
to so quicken our mortal body that instead of being a 
servant of sin, as it once was, it will be a servant of 
righteousness. 

There is a great difference between the immortal body 
which we shall have by and by, and the quickening of the 
mortal body. The new body will not be a flesh body at 
all. "It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; 
it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in 
weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body, 
it is raised a spirit body." (I Cor. 15:42-44.) This 
animal body is to be quickened by the Spirit of God that 
dwells in us; and by degrees this resurrection process in 
which the New Creature is engaged becomes stronger and 
stronger. If this continues, our resurrection progresses; 
and the time will come, at the end of our course, when 
the Lord will count us worthy of the glorious change, to 
be like Him and share His glory on the high, spirit plane. 



THE DIVINE PLAN NOT FINISHED 

Question.— When on Calvary our Lord said, "It is 
finished!" to what did He refer as being completed? 
Answer.— This did not mean that our Lord had finished 

R5061 : page 219 

all the work of the Divine Plan, for both the work 
of calling out the Bride and presenting her blameless, and 
the work of the Millennial Age were yet future. Our 
Lord had come into the world to do a work of personal 
sacrifice. When He was thirty years of age, He presented 
Himself in consecration at Jordan. During the three and 
a half years of His ministry He continued to offer Himself; 
and this course, figuratively, became a sweet incense 
ascending before God beyond the veil. This work was 
one which could not be accomplished in a day. It required 
three and a half years. To this He referred when He 
said, "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am 
I straitened till it be accomplished!" (Luke 12:50.) He 
was anxiously awaiting its completion, which was reached 
at Calvary. 



GOD IS MAKING THE WRATH OF MAN TO PRAISE HIM 

Question.— If the Kingdom of Christ is not yet set up 
on earth, how may we explain the various reforms, charities, 
etc., of our time? 

Answer.— Apparently, the Adversary is trying to run 
things in his own direction, but the light itself which we 
are enjoying today is the promised light of Divine Providence. 
We read that "many shall run to and fro, and 
knowledge shall be increased," and that "there shall be a 
time of trouble such as never was."— Dan. 12:1,4. 

But God has supervised the matter of inventions, such 
as the printing press, the power of steam, and the effects 
and influences of these in the world. It seems, too, that 
the movements in the way of better government, etc., are 
influences based upon the general enlightenment and the 
efforts of mankind to do as well as they can by each 
other— specially in ways that selfishness does not hinder. 
But selfishness has, no doubt, much to do with all manner 
of reform. 

In speaking of the present time, our Lord said that 
the secrets should be proclaimed on the housetops. Today 
we see that many real exhibitions of vice, immorality 
and wrong-doing are brought to light— proclaimed from 
the housetops. While we do not say that the Adversary 
brings these things to light, yet we can see how the Adversary 
may have had to do with the movement toward 



communism that once had sway, as well as the movement 
toward socialism and toward anarchism. These are the 
things which will tend to bring on the time of trouble. 
So the wrath of man is made to turn to the praise of God. 
He is able to make the wrath of man praise Him. 
"Surely the wrath of man shall praise Thee; the remainder 
of wrath shalt Thou restrain."— Psa. 76:10.

PASTOR RUSSELL'S SERMONS IN GERMAN 

Six newspapers in Ohio are now publishing the sermons 
weekly in the German text— two columns; also one in N.S. 
Pittsburgh, Pa., one in Aberdeen, S.D., and one in Waco, 
Texas. We are sure that many of our readers will be glad 
to know of this for their own convenience and for the sake 
of their German friends. Lorain, Chillicothe, Fremont, Zanesville, 
Sandusky and Port Clinton are the cities of Ohio 
favored in this respect. Do not forget to encourage these 
publishers with subscriptions and with occasional letters, letting 
them know that you appreciate the sermon feature. 



TABERNACLE SHADOWS IN FRENCH 

For our French readers we now have a supply of the TABERNACLE 
SHADOWS in the French language in paper binding, 
similar to the English edition, and at the same prices— 5c. per 
copy, 50c. per dozen. 



BROTHER RUSSELL'S SERMONS IN SWEDISH 

The Newspaper Syndicate handling Brother Russell's 
sermons have selected a Swedish journal in the Central 
West for a Swedish translation of the sermons, namely, 
"The Kansas City (Swedish) Tribune," Kansas City, Mo. 
The paper is a weekly, and one dollar will secure it for a 
year. We hope our Swedish friends will patronize the 
Tribune and occasionally give its Editor an encouraging 
word and an address for a sample copy or a neighbor's 
order.

THE WATCH TOWER BIBLE 

Those of the friends who are using the Bibles containing 
our special Berean Helps write that they are in love with 
them more and more as the days go by and they learn their 
usefulness. Some, however, forget what a valuable assistance 
to Bible study they have close at hand, with comments or 
other information on the major portion of God's Word and 
references to SCRIPTURE-STUDIES, THE WATCH TOWER, and 
our other publications. 

We have these WATCH TOWER BIBLES in two different 
styles and five different grades— the cheapest as low as $1.65, 
the very best and most complete at $3.65.

VIEWS FROM THE WATCH TOWER 

SOCIAL UNREST GROWS APACE 

OUR READERS know better than do the 
majority of people the meaning of the 
present social unrest. Many of them have 
been studying this subject with us from the 
standpoint of the Divine Plan of the Ages 
for more than thirty years. Steadily the 
unrest which the Bible predicted for the 
present time— the Harvest of this Age- 
is culminating. Many know our expectations 
respecting October, 1914— that thereabouts 
the Time of Trouble will gain full headway and 
sweep the social structure as a besom of destruction. 



While pointing out these things from the Word of 
God our journal has done all in its power to counsel peace, 
contentment, faithfulness of heart, appreciation of our 
multiplied mercies and blessings, the like of which 
humanity never before enjoyed. More than this, THE 
WATCH TOWER has striven faithfully in all these thirty-five 
years past to establish the foundation for true peace 
amongst the Lord's people— an exact knowledge of God, 
a correct understanding of the Divine Word and an appreciation 
of the Divine attributes. 

To some extent the Divine blessing has attended our 
labors. Thousands of Christian people have been 
awakened, enlightened and brought back to the firm 
foundation of faith in God and in the Bible. Tens of 
thousands who have not come to a full consecration of 
their hearts to the Lord have, nevertheless (according to 
their letters), taken their stand for righteousness and 
truth, against sin and error. In these and through these 
to their families, friends and neighbors a testimony has 
gone out respecting "Love Divine, all love excelling," 
which has brought many into closer relationship with God, 
to a greater reverence of His Word and to a considerable 
faith in respect to the Divine Plan of the Ages. Hundreds 
of thousands no longer believe that God used His wisdom 
and power in human creation to bring into being thousands 
of millions doomed to eternal torture. 

The glorious character of God is shining more resplendently 
in the world than ever before. The light is 
going forth in about twenty different languages and to 
practically every nation. We have not succeeded in effecting 
great things for the world. We did not so convince 
the nations that they turned from selfishness and 
sin to righteousness and love. We have not gotten them 
to "beat their swords into plowshares, nor their spears 
into pruning-hooks" (Isa. 2:4), nor have we reason to 
expect that kind of success to follow our labors. From 
the very beginning we announced the Scriptural Program 
to be that only the wise should understand and that "none 
of the wicked should understand" (Dan. 12:10) and that 
during this Age only the Elect class will be brought into 
full harmony with God. 

We pointed out from the beginning that the world, 
full of selfishness, would wreck the present civilization 
and that God, according to the Bible, will use that great 
Time of Trouble— anarchy, confusion— as a means to an 
end, and upon the ruins of the highest civilization the 
world has yet known, wrecked by human selfishness, God 
will in His own due time erect the Messianic Kingdom, 
which for centuries He has promised and which eventually 
will bring the foretold blessing to Israel and to all the 
nations of the earth. If we were obliged thus to prophesy 
evil things, we were glad that we could also prophesy 
glorious things, everlasting blessing, the silver lining to 
the cloud. 

A little more than two years remain before the 
climax of trouble we anticipate— if we are exactly right 



about the time. If we are not exactly right, surely we 
are not far astray, our enemies themselves being the 
witnesses. 

Look at the state of the world. Europe is seething 
with a Socialism which indeed numbers amongst its hosts 
many men of noble impulses who fancy that the course 
they are taking is the only one to bring about a more 
equitable distribution of the rapidly increasing wealth of 
the world. Other less noble men in the ranks of the Socialists 
are thinking evidently less of justice, of a general betterment 
of society and of a more equitable arrangement 
of the world's riches, than of their own selfish interests. 
Others in this growing army of Socialism appear to be 
wholly demagogic— ignorant prattlers upon subjects which 
they do not comprehend. 

The wage-workers of the world, under the names of 
Syndicalism, Socialism, etc., have finally realized that the 
progress of the world really depends upon the coal miners, 
engineers, machinists, etc. They do not dispute, of course, 
that brain capacity is also necessary, but they are inclined 
to say, and still more to think that brain power and Capital 
have appropriated the lion's share of earth's bounties 
for a long time and that now Labor must have the lion's 
share, even if force be required to obtain it. 

The governments of Europe are in perplexity. They 
wonder and fear what a day or a year may develop, but 
hope for the best. Their chief consolation seems to be 
to claim that "all things continue as they were from the 
foundation of the world" (2 Pet. 3:4), and that no radical 

R5062 : page 224 

change in the affairs of humanity need be expected. Indeed, 
while Labor feels its power, Capital also feels its 
strength. Capital says that if Labor should attempt to 
block the wheels of industry and progress, Labor would 
be the first to feel the pangs of hunger and would be glad 
to compromise the situation. It is this confidence on both 
sides of the question that gives the situation the most 
serious aspect. When the struggle comes, both parties 
will feel so confident that neither will be ready to compromise 
and the results will be the more terrible. 

INCREASE OF KNOWLEDGE IS THE CAUSE 

Strange as it may at first appear, it is unquestionably 
true that the troubles upon us are the results of increased 
knowledge amongst the masses. When people did not 
know their power, they were content. The ascertainment 
of their power has brought them discontent and is leading 
on to anarchy. Had the knowledge come a thousand 
years sooner, the trouble would have come a thousand 
years earlier. Had the knowledge come two thousand 
years sooner, so would have come the discontent, the 
trouble. It comes now because Divine providence has 
been gradually lifting the veil of ignorance as the morning 



of the New Dispensation is nearing. We have not yet 
experienced the rising of the Sun of Righteousness, but 
we have with us the early gray dawn. 

The world is awakening before the Master-Hand of 
the Messianic Kingdom, the Controller of earth's affairs. 
Civilization will wreck itself in its ignorant use and selfish 
abuse of the wonderful riches which Divine providence is 
showering upon mankind today through the increase of 
knowledge. The lesson is evident— the recompense also. 
All the blessings which we have would do good and not 
harm were it not for the selfishness and hardness of heart 
which have come upon humanity. Strange to say, this 
selfishness and hard-heartedness is more manifest amongst 
the civilized nations than amongst the peoples of India, 
China and Japan, although all have it, and although the 
more civilized of mankind cloak their selfishness in many 
ways. 

Selfishness is never grateful. It never cries Enough! 
Even its gifts and benefactions are likely to be selfishly 
bestowed. All this is the result of original sin. Disobedience 
to the Divine Word has brought gradual opposition 
to the Divine Spirit of love, kindness, mercy. 
Tender-heartedness has given place to hard-heartedness. 
The strife that is coming will undoubtedly be most severe 
amongst those possessed of large knowledge and great 
blessings— and this means Europe and America, although 
the same malignant influence will assuredly exert itself 
throughout the world. 

Just at the appropriate time religion lost its power. 
Churchianity came instead of Christianity, forms of godliness 
instead of the Spirit of the Lord. What led up to 
this? The educators and preachers of the world lost their 
faith in the Bible. Gradually the spirit of unbelief and 
the theory of evolution (that man was evolved from lower 
forms of life and not created) have spread through all 
the colleges, seminaries, schools and school-books. Now 
the person who possesses faith in a personal, intelligent, 
just, wise, powerful and loving God, is considered a 
simpleton. 

Wealthy men have endowed colleges and schools to 
teach unbelief and Evolution. And now these same men 
stand aghast with wonder that the people whose faith has 
been destroyed by Higher Criticism and evolutionary 
doctrines have no longer faith in God's Word nor in God's 
providence and are determined to take matters into their 
own hands. Is it strange? Is it not merely the logical 
outcome that should have been expected? Do we not 
see here fulfilled the words of the Prophet Isaiah, "The 
wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding 
of their prudent men shall not be manifest"? 
(Isa. 29:14.) The prudent men are the wealthy, whose 
generosity has been showered upon these colleges which 
are doing so destructive a work in the minds of men and 
preparing them to destroy the very foundations of our 
present civilization. 



POLITICIANS ARE SEEING THINGS 

Two great political conventions have been held which 
have had an awakening and enlightening influence on the 
minds of many. The candidates have spoken out with 
considerable freedom. The charges generally made and 
generally believed are that in each of the two principal 
parties there is a warfare in progress between a "stand-pat" 
element (willing to yield nothing) and a reform 
element. The former have apparently the more particular 
backing of the financial world and the Church influence, 
Catholic and Protestant. The other, or more progressive 
party, realizes in some measure the real condition of 
things in the world today— realizes that Capital must 
make concessions to Labor and must improve Labor conditions 
or else a social revolution is inevitable. Mr. Roosevelt 
and Mr. Bryan are the prominent standard-bearers 
of the progressive thought in the two great parties. They 
represent millions of the middle-class people and millions 
of sympathizers in religious circles and in the world. 

The Boston Globe quotes Mr. Roosevelt as saying, 
"With unflinching heart and undimmed eye, we stand at 
Armageddon and we battle for the Lord." Then the 
Globe quotes the Scripture to which Mr. Roosevelt refers 
in Rev. 16:16-18: "And He gathered them together into 
a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon. And 
the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and 
there came a great voice out of the Temple of Heaven, 
from the Throne, saying, It is done.' And there were 
voices and thunders and lightnings; and there was a great 
earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the 
earth, so mighty an earthquake and so great." 

We cannot but wonder how much of what he said Mr. 
Roosevelt believes and appreciates. But the same thought 
is in the minds of others who profess little knowledge of 
or faith in the Bible. The Cincinnati Post, for instance, 
commenting on the same subject, says: 

"And no one knows what it all means now or next 
week or before another generation has begun to crawl. 

"Men talk among themselves— experienced newspaper 
men, men who have attended political conventions for 
years. But they don't print what they talk and don't talk 
all that they fear. 

"There is a feeling that history is being made in a 
more mysterious manner than any of us can understand 
—that something is moving more powerfully than any of 
us can comprehend— and however much men predict or 
hazard guesses, nobody knows. 

"Sometimes one forgets it is a Republican convention 
and sees only two tremendous forces about to clash. It 
is people who are stirring, not mere partisans. And it 
is the same spirit of unrest, the same mysterious uprising 
and breaking forth from beneath of a wonderful and 
awful power that has been breaking forth in spots all 
over the world." 

If, however, it be conceded that the financial powers 



have set themselves in opposition to progress, those who 
know the power of money may well fear that the chances 
of the progressives are small. The money power, through 
the banks and bankers, has its influence upon all borrowers 
of money. There lies the danger. The power which can 
thus control nearly all of the influential is in danger of 
carrying its power too far and sitting upon the safety-valve 

R5062 : page 225 

until the explosion takes place— just such an explosion 
as the Bible warns us to expect. 

What should be the attitude of God's consecrated people 
at this time? They should remember the Master's 
words and not be alarmed. He said, "When ye see these 
things begin to come to pass, lift up your heads, for your 
deliverance draweth nigh." (Luke 21:28.) This does not 
mean that we should ever act or feel boastfully, or even 
carelessly, respecting the welfare of humanity so seriously 
at stake. It means that with quiet confidence we may 
look up to God, and, realizing His omnipotence, wisdom 
and love, we may trust Him where we cannot trace Him 
and rest assured that all things are working together for 
good— especially for the Church, but indirectly also for 
the interests of all humanity. 

God's consecrated people should more than ever "set 
their affections on things above and not on things on the 
earth." (Col. 3:2.) More than all, we should spend time 
and influence in the service of God, of the Truth, of our 
families and of all men, so far as we have opportunity. 
We should do them good, calming instead of arousing 
their fears. Instead of dilating particularly upon the 
trouble coming, we should expatiate especially upon the 
time beyond the trouble, encouraging them to faith in the 
Omnipotent One who has promised that through the Seed 
of Abraham "all the families of the earth shall be blessed." 
-Gal. 3:29. 

Today we have wonderful opportunities. The world 
is waking up and inquiring about the meaning of the 
wonderful things of our day. Intelligent people are perplexed. 
They need the very light upon the Divine Plan 
which we have for them. The Golden Rule bids us do 
toward them as we would have them do towards us, if we 
were in the dark and they in the light. The Class Extension 
work is being greatly blessed and is reaching 
many. The Colporteur work is gathering, we believe, 
many ripe grains. 

On the whole, the Lord's blessing seems to be specially 
manifest thus far this year. No doubt many who are now 
receiving the Truth respecting the Harvest time, etc., 
have been God's children for a considerable time, and 
under Divine providential guidance, direction, discipline, 
in preparation for the Kingdom. To these Present Truth 
comes as a special blessing and refreshment and as a 

R5063 : page 225 



special ripening for the Kingdom. Today's opportunities 
become tests also of our love and loyalty to God. "He 
that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto 
life eternal." (John 4:36.) Freely have we received, 
freely let us give to others the glorious light of Present 
Truth. -Matt. 10:8. 

MEN'S HEARTS FAILING THEM FOR FEAR 

There is a general apprehension of something unusual 
and fearful. Religious people of all denominations are 
distressed, as well as politicians and financiers. Large 
sums of money are still forthcoming, but chiefly from the 
wealthy. And these are growing weary of their trials as 
the supporters, "pillars," of their respective systems. 
Church attendance grows more slim, and many who do 
attend service confess that their worship is largely a form 
of godliness and custom and habit rather than an intelligent 
appreciation of their privileges. The people believe 
—they know not what. The "new thought" offered them 
as a soul-satisfying portion is, "Our forefathers generations 
back were monkeys." There is nothing soul-satisfying 
in this statement. The true-hearted are starving, not 
for bread, nor for water, but for hearing the Word of 
the Lord. (Amos 8:11.) The formalists are discouraged 
because of lack of numbers. All are in dread lest some 
one should ask questions respecting the various creeds of 
Churchianity, knowing that no one of intelligence can 
defend even one creed of Christendom. 

Various schemes have been tried. Various good endeavors 
have been made to awaken the public to an interest 
in religious things. The public interest in Churchianity 
has died out. Evolution and Higher Criticism have undermined 
faith. The public say, "The preachers themselves 
do not believe the Bible. Why should we?" 

Finally, the solemn thought is being pressed home 
daily that a great trial time has come upon Christianity 
as a whole— a day of judgment; and that in harmony with 
the adage, "In union there is strength," all Christian 
people should draw together for mutual support. The cry 
is, "A federation" (a confederacy— Isa. 8:12). This 
movement, foretold by the Scriptures, is now nearing a 
fulfilment, much as the matter was disputed when we 
called attention to it thirty-five years ago. 

As we write, the Conference in Lambeth Palace, London, 
is in session. The chief representatives of the 
churches in Great Britain and the United States have 
assembled to see to what extent they can let down the 
bars of custom and superstition and recognize Protestant 
Christians of all denominations as fellow-Christians of the 
one Body of Christ— the one Church. Very soon there is 
to be a general meeting in the United States to which the 
proposals of the Lambeth Conference will be submitted. 

The feeling of fear, uncertainty, need of union, is so 
generally felt that undoubtedly many Christians of various 



denominations will be glad to be associated, federated. 
The hope is that thus they will present a solid, religious 
backing to the Government and that the Government will 
give them in return a support. It will not surely amount 
to a union between Church and State, as in the old world, 
but it will amount to an understanding between Church 
and State, for the State also is feeling its need of backing. 
The result will be an apparently triumphant Churchianity, 
a brilliant flare-up of success. However, according to our 
understanding of the Bible, their prosperity will be short-lived, 
for it has no real foundation of Christian faith, 
but merely the excuse of necessity for its federative 
existence. 

With the flare-up of Churchianity's apparent prosperity 
all not joining in will be esteemed as enemies, 
however conscientious. And they will have hard experiences 
for a little while, until the Master shall say, "It is 
enough. Come up higher." "To him that overcometh 
will I give power over the nations"; "To him that overcometh 
will I grant to sit with Me in My Throne"; "Be 
thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of 
life."-Rev. 2:26; 3:21; 2:10. 



BAPTISTS DIVIDED ON COMMUNION QUESTION 

"Toronto, Ont, June 15.— The question of restricted 
communion was discussed by the Toronto Association of 
Baptist Churches in Parkdale Baptist Church yesterday. 
The leading speaker on the subject was the Rev. J. J. 
Ross, who maintained that "the ordinance of the Lord's 
Supper is unmistakably a restricted ordinance, and those 
who partake of it unworthily will bring judgment upon 
themselves. 

"The debate was opened in the morning, but gave way 
to other topics until it was resumed by arrangement in 
the midst of the Women's Missionary Conference in the 
afternoon. A lively period of three-quarters of an hour 
was given up to it. Mr. A. M. Denovan took the view 
that it was never proven that Christ did not baptize infants 
a span long. Rev. T. T. Shields quickly retorted 

R5063 : page 226 

that it certainly had been proven that He had never 
done so. 

"A heated discussion followed between those who 
maintained that the love of God in people's hearts entitled 
them to a place at the communion table, and the others 
who rigidly held that the only passport was immersion. 

"An extra session was held at 6:30 p.m., when the 
discussion was vigorously continued. No decision was 
reached."— Woodstock, Ont., Daily Express. 

Our Baptist brethren are having their troubles. After 
more than eighteen centuries they are half inclined to 



believe that they have made a huge mistake! Perhaps 
all the heathen who have not been baptized did not go to 
hell and are not still there roasting! Perhaps the Presbyterians, 
Congregationalists, Methodists, Lutherans, Roman 
Catholics, Episcopalians, etc., are not in hell for similar 
insufficiency of water! 

Perhaps, after all, it has been a mistake that our 
Baptist friends have been excluding others from their 
communion table— claiming that, not being completely 
immersed in water, these are not members of the true 
Church of Christ, not eligible to heaven, etc. It is certainly 
time that our dear Baptist brethren became established 
with definite ideas about baptism, or else they should 
take that particular word from their denominational name. 

The foregoing suggestion from the Daily Express 
respecting the baptism of infants is an outgrowth of the 
general misunderstanding of the subject of baptism. 

The Bible teaches clearly enough that Christians are 
baptized into the Church, which is the Body of Christ, 
but nowhere does it say that it is the water baptism which 
inducts the believer into Christ. On the contrary, it most 
explicitly declares that the real, true baptism is baptism 
"into Christ's death." To be immersed into Christ's death 
plainly enough means to have a participation with the 
Redeemer in the death which He died— death to self-will, 
death to earthly hopes and aims and prospects. Only 
such as are thus immersed into His death will be in His 
likeness in the resurrection. "If we suffer with Him, we 
shall reign with Him"; "If we be dead with Him, we 
shall live with Him. "-Rom. 6:4-6; Col. 2:12; 
2 Tim. 2:12,11. 

If our Baptist brethren come to see what the true 
baptism is, they will all the more appreciate the water 
baptism as merely a symbol of the true immersion. Our 
baptism into Christ's death inducts us into the Mystical 
Body of Christ, which is the Church, whose names are 
written in heaven.— Eph. 1:22,23; Heb. 12:23. 

Throughout this Age some Presbyterians, Methodists, 
Baptists, Roman Catholics, Episcopalians and others have 
had this real baptism into Christ's death, and accordingly 
have had their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life. 
These constitute the members of the One Church. Some 
of them were confused on the subject of baptism and 
used sprinkling— incorrectly, unscripturally. Others used 
immersion unscripturally— the Disciple friends thinking 
it the same as the Jewish baptism practised at the first 
advent of our Lord, for the remission of sin and for bringing 
Israel back into harmony with the Law Covenant. 
Others used water immersion improperly instead of 
the real immersion into Christ's death. The true view of 
the subject shows that we all in the past have been more 
or less in error. Humiliating as this fact is, it needs to 
be learned if we would make any progress. 

YET ANOTHER LESSON 



Another lesson we need to learn is that not merely the 
Church, which is the Body of Christ, is to be saved, but 
that God has a salvation— although a very different one— 
for others.— Heb. 2:3; Jude 3. 

Under the creeds formulated during the Dark Ages 
we supposed that since the whole world is under Divine 
condemnation, therefore every infant is so condemned. 
We were right in this, but wrong in respect to the 
character of the condemnation. None of our race were 
condemned to eternal torment or purgatory. The Bible 
explicitly tells us that we were condemned to death. 
(Rom. 6:23; Gen. 2:17; 3:19.) As a consequence mankind 
are a dying race. The dying processes of the six 
thousand years have affected the race mentally, morally 
and physically.— Psa. 51:5; Jer. 31:29,30. 

Only those baptized into Christ's death and thus vitally 
united to the living Head of the Church, have as yet escaped 
from the condemnation which rests upon the world. 
But God's provision, which begins with the Church, will 
proceed, after her glorification, to bless the world. (Gal. 3:8,16,29.) 
Then all the non-elect, all the unbaptized, 
all out of Christ— infants, heathen, all— will be subjects 
of the blessed Millennial Kingdom. All will have the 
opportunity, not to be baptized into the Body of Christ, 
but to experience the promised restitution to human perfection 
and earthly paradise— all that was lost in Eden, 
all that was redeemed at Calvary.— Acts 3:19-21. 



R5066 : page 226 

VICTORIOUS CHRIST HEADS PROCESSION 

"When He ascended up on high He 
led a multitude of captives."— Eph. 4:8. 

THIS GRAND EXPRESSION respecting the 

glorious outcome of the Savior's work is 

quoted by the Apostle Paul from the Psalms. (68:18.) 

The figure thus thrust before our 

mental eye is that of a great Conqueror 

whose victory is being heralded. With the 

Romans we know that it was a custom that 

generals returning from various wars were 

granted what were termed "Triumphs"— 

that is to say, triumphal processions, that 

the people might have tangible evidence of their victories. 

Thus, for instance, Titus, returning from the war upon 
the Jews in A.D. 70, brought with him certain notable 
persons and the Golden Candlestick from the Temple, and 
these were displayed to the eyes of the people following 
the conqueror. They were subsequently sculptured on the 
Arch of Titus, still standing in Rome. And evidently the 
custom was still older than the days of the Romans, since 
it was so prophetically set forth by the Prophet David. 



Let us permit our mental eye to feast upon the scene 
presented in our text. Jesus, in fulfilment of the Divine 
Program, had left the heavenly condition and descended to 
earth, taking a bondman's form or nature in order "that 
He, by the grace of God, might taste death for every 
man" (Heb. 2:9); in order that He might rescue Adam 
and his race from the dying and death condition in which 
they were— under Divine sentence and under the power 
of Satan. 

Therefore the Redeemer counted not His life precious 
to Him, but freely delivered Himself up for our offenses 
and died, "the Just for the unjust," that He might bring 
mankind back into harmony with God. His humiliation 
ended in death, but His triumph began when, as is recorded, 
God raised Him from the dead by His own power, 
and set him at the right hand of His own Majesty— "far 
above angels, principalities and powers and every name 
that is named, that at the name of Jesus every knee should

HE THAT ASCENDED FIRST DESCENDED 

The prophecy says nothing about our Lord's descending 
from the heavenly glory to the earthly nature, but St. 
Paul supplies this feature saying, "He that ascended, what 
is it but that He first descended, into the lower condition 
of the earth?" (Verse 9.) Thus the Apostle asserts that 
He that descended is He that ascended above all heights, 
that all things may be fulfilled through Him. 

An important thought here noted is that our Lord not 
only left the heavenly glory, but that He returned to a 
still more excellent glory— He did not suffer the disastrous 
loss of the heavenly nature as a result of His obedience 
in taking the human nature. As He left the heavenly 
nature to take the human, so in returning He left the 
human nature to ascend again to that which He had before, 
with the additional glory of the divine nature. 

LEADING FORTH THE CAPTIVES 

With most of the conquerors in olden times the captives 
were made slaves. Not so, however, will be the result 
of Jesus' victory. He leads forth to liberty and eternal 
life those who have been slaves of sin and death. His 
train of captives is a long one indeed; the procession has 
already occupied eighteen centuries, and is yet to be the 
great work of the thousand years of the Messianic reign! 

First of all in the procession are the saints— "the 
Church of the First-born, whose names are written in 
Heaven." In the forefront of them we see the twelve 
Apostles, St. Paul taking the place of Judas. The Apostles 
are to be Kings who are to reign with Christ in preeminent 
positions; but following them are some others of 
the saintly company of Kings— in all a "little flock." 



Then will come a company, more numerous, but less 
heroic— "a great multitude," uncrowned, but with "palm 
branches," not antitypical Priests, but antitypical Levites, 
associates and servants of the Royal Priesthood, the Bride. 
Then will follow (Heb. 11:38-40) other faithful ones of 
the past, the Ancient Worthies. The Prophet speaks also 
of the "rebellious house." The classes previously specified 
were not rebellious, but gladly and willingly forsook 
all to do the will of the Father and to attain the liberty 
of sons of God, as the first-fruits of the triumph of the 
Lamb. 

But during the thousand years of Christ's reign He will 
lead forth the "rebellious house"— the world of mankind— 
not all of them, we may be sure, for some, the Scriptures 
positively declare, will die the Second Death, because, 
after realizing their deliverance, they will love sin and 
will therefore be destroyed as enemies of righteousness. 
But it is a blessed thought that many of those who are now 
aliens, strangers and foreigners from God through wicked 
works, are in this condition of opposition, not willingly, not 
intelligently, but by reason of the ignorance and weaknesses 
which came to them by heredity, under the reign of 
sin and death. 

It is to be a distinct feature of the great Triumph of 
Immanuel that every eye shall be opened and every ear 
unstopped, that "the knowledge of the glory of God shall 
fill the whole earth," during His glorious reign of righteousness. 
Are we not distinctly told of the time that will 
follow, in which all the willing and obedient shall receive 
the Holy Spirit, which then will be poured out "upon all 
flesh" even as now, during this Gospel Age, it is poured 
out upon God's "servants and handmaidens" only?— 
Joel 2:28. 

Oh, that will be a glorious Triumph for the great Redeemer! 
In the language of the Bible, "He shall see the 
fruitage of the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied." 
(Isa. 53:11.) What a glorious fruitage!— not only His 
own exaltation— not only the exaltation of His faithful 
Bride class, and the additional exaltation of "the virgins, 
her companions, which follow her," and the exaltation of 
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and all the Prophets, but finally the 
deliverance to human perfection of all the groaning creation 
willing to accept the same upon the Divine terms of 
loyalty to God and to the principles of His Government, 
as these shall be made known to them. 

"HE GAVE GIFTS UNTO MEN" 

It was the custom in olden times that a king coming 
into authority and power should give gifts according to 
His wealth. Governors and princes would be needed and 
he would dispense the honors of these offices to those found 

R5067 : page 227 

faithful in his service, loyal in the defense of His cause. 



So, in this prophetic reference to our Lord's ascension, it 
is declared not only that He would lead forth a multitude 
of captives, granting them freedom, liberty, blessings, but 
also that He would confer certain gifts. 

We might have spent valuable time guessing the nature 
of these gifts which the great Redeemer would dispense, 
but such a waste of time is unnecessary, since the Apostle 
proceeds to explain the matter and tells us what gifts are 
meant. He says, "And He gave some Apostles, and some 
Prophets, and some evangelists, and some pastors and 
teachers." 

There is an astounding thought connected with this 
statement— that the Apostles were not self-appointed, and 
that they had no successors, and that the work of evangelizing, 
or making known the "good tidings," and the pastoral 
work and the teaching work amongst believers, are 
all under the supervision of the Head of the Church, the 
great Victor, who redeemed us with His blood, and who 
proposes, first, to lead forth a Bride class, and subsequently 
all the willing and obedient. 

It behooves us to notice that the Apostle does not intimate 
that Jesus gave to some Methodism, to others Presbyterianism, 
and others Roman Catholicism, etc. No, when 

we held such thoughts it was because of more or less misunderstanding 
—because we failed to see first that there is 
but the "one Church of the Living God, whose names are 
written in heaven," and second, that that one Church is 
not any of the various sects and parties, but includes the 
saintly in all of these; "the Lord knoweth them that are 
His." 

NOT GIVEN TO CONVERT THE WORLD 

Noting carefully the Apostle's argument in connection 
with our text, we perceive that the Master did not give 
these gifts for the conversion of the world. He does 
specify, however, what they were for, namely, "for the 
perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for 
the edifying of the Body of Christ"— the Church, the 
Bride class. Is it supposable that the Apostle erred in this 
statement and that the fact is the reverse— that these 
gifts were provided for the conversion of the world, and 
that the Apostle thoroughly misunderstood the matter and 
supposed that they were given for the perfecting of the 
saints, for the edifying of the Body of Christ? No! We 
are to be taught by the Apostle and may be sure that there 
is no mistake, no error in his statement. 

Notice the force of the expression, "the perfecting of 
the saints." It is not sufficient that believers have a little 
knowledge, a little faith, and a measure of sanctification 
or devotion to the Lord, for after they have received and 
attained all of these things they still need the instruction 
of the Apostles and ministers, pastors and teachers, provided 
by the great Head of the Church for their perfecting. 
Ah! there is a force and depth of meaning in that 
word perfecting. We remember that of our Head it is 



written, "Being made perfect through suffering, He became 
the Author of eternal salvation to all who obey 

R5067 : page 228 

Him." So His followers are made perfect through suffering. 

The Master's perfecting, indeed, was a little different 
from ours, and yet there is a similarity between the two. 
He was perfect before He humbled Himself; He was still 
perfect as the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself; but 
as a result of His consecration He received a begetting of 
the Holy Spirit to the divine nature, and His development 
as a New Creature required that He faithfully carry out 
His vow, or covenant of sacrifice, in the doing of the will 
of the Heavenly Father. By such faithfulness He perfected 
Himself on the divine plane— that is, He proved 
Himself worthy according to the covenant— "Worthy is 
the Lamb that was slain to receive glory, honor, dominion 
and power."— Rev. 5:12. 

Similarly the followers of Jesus are to be sharers with 
Him in the sufferings of this present time and in the 
glories which shall follow, for "If we suffer with Him we 
shall also reign with Him." (2 Tim. 2:12.) Although 
we are imperfect in the flesh, while He was perfect, yet 
the robe of His righteousness, the merit of His sacrifice, 
covers all of our blemishes and makes us, as His footstep 
followers, holy and acceptable before the Father, as joint-sacrificers 
with Jesus. 

The begetting of the Holy Spirit starts us in the life 
divine. We are not to be perfected in the flesh, but in the 
spirit, and our perfection and acceptance with the Father 
will be demonstrated by our loyalty of heart and the fulness 
and thoroughness with which we submit our all to the 
Divine will and seek to glorify God in our bodies and 
spirits which are His. (I Cor. 6:20.) Our justification 
comes to us as a reward of faith, regardless of works, but 
our glorification will follow as a reward for faithfulness. 

THESE GIFTS ARE LASTING 

Not merely for a few days or years were these gifts 
to the Church provided; on the contrary, they were to 
endure throughout this entire Age, until the Church perfected 
shall pass beyond the veil and be forever with her 
Redeemer, to share His glory, honor and immortality. 
The Lord from time to time has raised up evangelists, 
pastors and teachers for this glorious service of preparing 
the "chaste virgin," the Church, to be the Bride in glory. 
But the Apostolic office, as represented in The Twelve 
specially provided by the Father, has continued and needs 
no replenishment. We still have their instructions as fully 
as the early Church, "that the man of God may be perfect, 
thoroughly furnished unto every good work."— 
2 Tim. 3:16,17. 

That the Apostle did not understand the matter to be 
merely for a day, but throughout this Age, until the completion 



of the Church, is clearly evidenced by his statement, 
namely, that all these gifts were for the edification 
of the Body of Christ and the perfecting of the saints to 
the last— "until we all come to the unity of the faith and 
to the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, 
unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ." 

This is a wonderful statement, however we view it. 
Shall we say that it applies to each individual member of 
the Church of Christ, and that each individual must come 
into that full unity of faith, and that full knowledge of 
the Son of God, and the perfection of manhood in Christ, 
and to a developed stature of maturity in Christ? Or 
shall we understand the meaning to be, until the entire 
Church of Christ shall have reached a full knowledge and 
shall, as a whole, have come to the condition of a perfect 
Man, of which Christ is the Head and we are the members 
—to the full development or stature of the Anointed, 
the Messiah, Head and members? We believe that the latter 
is the Apostle's thought. 

Nevertheless, it cannot be disputed that the selection 
of these members all the way down the Age must have 
been along the lines here indicated. Individually, one 
partially developed would not be fitted for the Kingdom. 
One not in the unity of the faith would not be suitable. 
One not developed to the proper measure or stature as a 
Christian would not be suitable. Nothing is more plain 
than that the individual Christian needs a great deal of 
instruction, edification, building up in the holy faith, testing, 
proving, chiseling, polishing, fitting, preparing before 
he shall be ready for a place in the Kingdom. 

GOD'S PEOPLE NO LONGER NEED BE MISLED 

This thought is confirmed by the succeeding verses, in 
which the Apostle tells us that by the assistance of these, 
the Divinely provided gifts, teachers, etc., God's people 
need no longer, like children, to be tossed to and fro, and 
be misled by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness of 
those who would deceive. On the contrary, being sincere, 
and speaking the truth in love, they are to grow up into 
membership in the Anointed One in all things— coming 
fully and completely into fellowship and obedience, under 
the Head, even Christ.— Verses 14,15. 

Proceeding, the Apostle tells us that all who are recognized 
as members of the Body of Christ must be properly 
joined to the Head— by a proper compact, or covenant, 
intelligently made and fully intended. This union must 
be compacted, and it requires the entire Gospel Age to 
effect this development and compacting as members, that 
the whole Body of the Anointed may be one— symmetrical, 
beautiful, co-operative— making increase in its members 
and edifying itself in love— growing in grace and in 
knowledge and in character-likeness to the Head.— V. 16. 

In conclusion, then, the Captain of our Salvation has 
gone before, He has accepted us as His joint-heirs, and 
we are following on, blest by the gifts which He dispensed 



when He ascended up on high; and we, in turn, will be 
His gifts to the world of mankind. When as Priests and 
Kings we shall be associated with our Lord, we shall bless 
all the families of the earth with a glorious opportunity 
of knowledge and obedience, that they may, if they will, 
attain life everlasting, "the gift of God, through Jesus 
Christ our Lord."— Rom. 6:23.

"THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH" 

OUR FINITE MINDS have difficulty in understanding 

some of the deep things of 

Scripture because of our insufficiency of 

knowledge and of experience. All that we 

know of our Lord's pre-human existence is 

revealed in the Word of God. The Scriptures 

state that our Lord was rich and became 

poor; not that He remained rich and 

seemed to become poor, but that He actually 

became poor that we might become rich. 

The Apostle says that He divested Himself of those conditions 

that He had before He became human, and that 

He took a bondman's form. He was made flesh. The 

explanation is given, "A body hast Thou prepared Me," 

a human body, and thus He was made "a little lower than 

the angels, for the suffering of death."— Heb. 10:5; 2:9. 

Putting together the Scriptural statements on the subject 
we have this: In His pre-human existence our Lord 
was the Logos, "the beginning of the creation of God," 
the Alpha of all God's creation, and the Omega in that 
Jehovah created only this One. Of the Logos it is written, 
"All things were made by Him, and without Him 

R5064 : page 229 

was not anything made that was made." (John 1:3.) He 
was on the spirit plane, next to the Father. 

In the Divine Plan of the Ages, formulated long before, 
a proposition was made our Lord with a view to the 
redemption of mankind; provision was made that if 
obedient to the Father's will, the Logos would receive 
still further exaltation, even to the divine nature. For 
this joy set before Him, our Lord took the various steps 
necessary to complete the great work of redemption. The 
contract into which He entered with the Father was one 
which involved much humiliation. While there was a 
sacrifice of power, of honor, of glory, yet no sacrifice of 
life was involved in the first step taken; namely, His 
acceptance of the Father's arrangement that He should 
be made flesh; that He should become a human being, 
that He should give up His existence on the heavenly 
plane. 



Originally, as the Logos, our Lord was a soul on the 
spirit plane, in the sense that any intelligent being is a 
soul; for the word "soul" signifies being; and the transfer 
of the life principle to a human body brought Him to the 
earthly plane. The life principle was the same that He 
had before, therefore the personality was the same. It 
was important to have identity of mind; and this He had 
by Divine arrangement. 

A BODY GIVEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEATH 

The Scriptures do not explain how the spark of life 
belonging to the spirit being known as the Logos became 
transferred to the human plane. When our Lord was 
thus changed, He merely took the step of getting ready 
to become the sacrifice for sinners. In His pre-existent 
state He could not have given the corresponding price for 
Adam; for He had not the human life to offer. But when 
He became a human being and had reached the age of 
maturity, He was in condition to be the Sin-offering. 

We would say that our Lord as a human being was 
the same soul as in His pre-existent condition; for He had 
the same life principle as before; and that when He became 
human He did not die as a spirit being. The Scriptures 
declare that our Lord was "made flesh," a human 
being; and that the difference between Him and mankind 
in general was that He was perfect— "holy, harmless, undefiled, 
separate from sinners"— separate from the remainder 
of the human race. (Heb. 7:26.) The Scriptures 
also explain that this difference resulted from the 
fact that He was specially begotten. The life principle 
by which He was conceived came directly from the 
Heavenly Father. 

This explanation is altogether different from the 
theory known as Incarnation. The thought of the 
theory of incarnation is that a spirit being took 
possession of an earthly being— became incarnate, 
dwelt in the flesh, in the same way that some 
are possessed of evil spirits which dwell within them. 
This, we believe, is a wrong thought respecting our Lord 
which has come down from the "Dark Ages." There is 
nothing in the Scriptures about incarnation. The Scriptures 
do not say that our Lord's body died, while the 
spirit being within it remained alive. But the Bible says 
that our Lord left the glory which He had with the Father 
and was found in fashion as a man; that He humbled 
Himself unto death, even unto the death of the cross; 
that He was "put to death in the flesh."— John 17:4,5; 
I Pet. 3:18; Phil. 2:8. 

"MADE FLESH AND DWELT AMONG US" 

From what we know of childhood we recognize it as 
the period of development. And so we read of our Lord: 
"And the child grew, and waxed strong, filled with wisdom; 
and the grace of God was upon Him. ..And 



Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with 

God and man." (Luke 2:40,52.) His was not a mind 

that had all the experiences and intelligence of His pre-existent 

state. We read that He grew in wisdom. His 

mind grew. Of course, being perfect He would learn 

much more rapidly and accurately than would others; and 

this accounts for the fact that as a child He was able to 

confound the Doctors of the Law. With His natural qualities 

of mind He was able to grasp the situation, to take 

in things rapidly. 

St. Luke tells us that at the age of twelve years our 
Lord accompanied His mother and Joseph to Jerusalem. 
The Jewish children were accustomed to attending religious 
services; and it was a custom that Jewish boys 
should make a consecration at the age at which Jesus 
did. Jesus knew that He was different from other boys. 
Very likely He told them the facts relating to His 
miraculous birth. It is assumed by some that He was 
even charged with having an illegitimate birth. But since 
we do not know definitely about this, we must confine 
ourselves to the Scriptures. 

Our Lord came into the world in a miraculous manner 
for the purpose of fulfilling the prophecies, which were 
all to attain fulfilment in Him. Naturally He would avail 
Himself of the first opportunity of ascertaining the requirements. 
When at twelve years of age He learned 
from the Doctors of the Law that He could not assume 
the priestly function as a boy, He made no further attempt, 
but was subject to His parents, or to Mary and 
her husband, who properly enough were His guardians 
until He reached thirty years of age, when His first step 
was to make full consecration of Himself. 

"I COME TO DO THY WILL" 

Our Lord at thirty years of age certainly had much 
knowledge that Adam did not possess when he was on 
trial. Our Lord had some knowledge of what constitutes 
sin and its penalty. He had also knowledge of the fact 
that God had arranged for the redemption of mankind, 
through the great Mediator of the New Covenant— a 
Savior, a Redeemer, a Deliverer. He knew that the 
inability of others to keep the Divine Law written in the 
Decalogue and His ability to keep that Law, constituted 
the difference between Himself and others. 

Doubtless our Lord's mother had told Him of His 
miraculous birth and of the message that had come 
through Gabriel and of the prophecy of Anna and of 
Simeon. And He had in mind the prophecy respecting 
Himself and the future of the great Messiah that was 
to come and deliver the world. All this knowledge was 
very valuable. 

But the thing that our Lord evidently lacked was the 
knowledge of the deeper things of the Scriptures. He 
evidently found perplexities in the Bible; for He had not 
received the Holy Spirit. Although He might be better 



qualified to understand these things than were the fallen 
race, yet, as the Apostle says, "The natural man receiveth 
not the things of the Spirit of God,. ..neither can 
he know them, because they are spiritually discerned." 
(I Cor. 2:14.) Jesus had not been begotten of the Holy 
Spirit; therefore He did not have the understanding of 
the prophecies and symbols. 

"THE HEAVENS WERE OPENED" 

All this knowledge began to come upon Him when 
He was begotten of the Holy Spirit. He began to understand 
the higher things, the deep things of God. He had 
understood in a measure about the Lamb that was slain as 

R5064 : page 230 

the sin-offering and the things about the putting away 
of sin, but nothing to identify the One who was to be 
the great Deliverer or to explain the wonderful pictures 
in the Scriptures. Just as soon as He was begotten of the 
Holy Spirit He began to see that if He would reign, it 
would be by a manifestation of loyalty to God and to 
righteousness. As soon as He was illuminated He saw 
the things pertaining to the suffering. 

During our Lord's earthly ministry He learned 
obedience through the things which He suffered. (Heb. 5:8.) 
And thus He received the great illumination which 
was so powerful an addition to Him— just as it is a great 
illumination to us to see the terms and conditions of 
our calling— that we must walk in the steps of our Lord 
if we would reign with Him. 

Just in what manner the higher things were revealed 
to our Lord we may not know. St. Paul tells us of 
wonderful revelations which were made to him. Doubtless 
our Lord also had revelations, but just what was revealed 
to Him thus, in order that He might understand His pre-human 
conditions, etc., we may not know. Nor do we know 
how all the acts and experiences during the previous 
period of His existence before He became flesh could 
have been impressed suddenly upon His mind. The same 
God who is able to give us a spirit body which will assimilate 
all the experiences of the present life, could also 

R5065 : page 230 

impress upon Jesus all the previous experiences which He 
had had. 

The impress of previous experiences did not come to 
Him during His boyhood; for He was then growing in 
knowledge and in stature, and in favor with God and man. 
We believe that the impress came at the time of His 
consecration at Jordan; and that not only had He there 
given to Him the impress of His previous experiences 
with the Father and of the remote past, but also that He 
had light given to Him upon the Scriptures so that He 



could grasp the full purport of what He had done when 
He gave Himself in consecration. 

As the "heavens" continued to open to our Lord, He 
would see that the experiences of the Messiah, which 
could not have been commanded under the Law Covenant, 
were nevertheless to be His privileges as He would see 
these to be the Divine will, as He would see these to be 
the Divine Law in the Prophecies. As a sheep would be 
dumb before its shearers, so He would not rebel as His 
rights were taken from Him. He would know that He 
was to be put to death; and that He was to be an innocent 
victim. He was to be the crucified One, the 
antitype of the brazen serpent. 

Having consecrated to fulfil all things written in the 
Book Jesus was fully prepared for His every experience. 
This we see also is the purport of that beautiful picture 
in Revelation of the scroll sealed with seven seals. The 
proclamation was made, "Who is worthy to open the 
Book, and to loose the seals thereof?" (Rev. 5:2.) Up 
to that time no one had been found who could open the 
Book. But at that time our Lord was found worthy to 
open the Book, and to Him was given all the knowledge 
in the Divine Plan, that He might carry out these things 
in the sacrificing of the flesh. 

At His consecration at Jordan our Lord gave up the 
human life— He gave up all rights and privileges as a 
human being. The ultimate purpose of this full surrender 
of His life was that He might bring everlasting life to 
mankind. The Father's arrangement with Him, however, 
was such that He might retain His personality, His 
identity. But after He was begotten of the Holy Spirit, 
He was a New Creature; and as a New Creature He had 
the human body in which to develop character, in which 
to have His experiences. This New Creature was developed 
to perfection during the three and one-half years 
of His ministry, and was ready for the spirit body which 
had been promised to Him. 

If our Lord had not been found perfect, faithful, loyal, 
in His pre-human condition, He never would have had 
this privilege of becoming a man and the Redeemer of 
men. Because of His obedience as a man He received the 
greater glory, immortality. He was perfect under all the 
favorable conditions before He became a man; He was 
faithful as a man, and being glorified, He is still faithful. 
Therefore He maintains the same relationship to God and 
to righteousness that He ever had. Consequently He 
would not specially need any of those things which assist 
in making character; for He has never shown any defects 
to be rectified. But we may suppose that the experiences 
which He had in His pre-existent state, and 
while He was a man, and since He was glorified, all cooperate 
to make His character intelligent and loyal in 
the very highest sense. 

HE "MANIFESTED FORTH HIS GLORY" 



Let us examine some Scriptures which might be understood 
to imply that our Lord had a clear recollection 
of His pre-human experiences with the Father. 

(1) "Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, 
verily I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, 
but what He seeth the Father do; for what things soever 
He doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise." (John 5:19.) 
These words were used in connection with the 

healing of the sick. They do not, of course, mean 
that the Lord had seen the Father healing the sick, but 
that He had seen the Father's will, the Father's Plan. 
Our Lord was simply carrying out the Father's will 
concerning Him: "The eyes of the blind shall be opened, 
and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped; then shall 
the lame man leap as an hart"; etc. (Isa. 35:5,6.) 
These miracles of healing were some of the things that 
He was to do, as written in the Scriptures. He knew 
that He was to do these miracles and that they were a 
foreshadowing of the things to be done by and by. As 
we read, "This beginning of miracles did Jesus... 
and manifested forth His glory."— John 2:11. 

(2) "I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, 
or ever the earth was. When there were no depths, 

I was brought forth; when there were no fountains 
abounding with water. Before the mountains were settled, 
before the hills was I brought forth." (Prov. 8:23-25.) 
This passage may be viewed either as a 
prophecy of what our Lord understood of His previous 
condition, or as a figure of speech setting forth the Wisdom 
of God all through the ages. But since the Wisdom 
of God is specially revealed in our Lord Jesus, so this 
was a foreshadowing of what Jesus might know respecting 
His pre-human condition. 

(3) When our Lord at twelve years of age asked, 
"Wist ye not that I must be about My Father's business?" 
(Luke 2:49) He would have in mind the Heavenly 
Father, just as any consecrated child of God might think 
of Him. From the information which He had received 
from His mother, Mary, He would know of His 
miraculous birth and of His special mission in the world. 
His mother knew that He could not be true to Himself 
and His mission unless she told Him about these things. 
Having been told that He was specially holy and miraculously 
born for this very purpose, He now turned to 

Mary and asked, Is it possible that you should not know 
that I should be about My Father's business? Did not 
you tell me of this thing? He was surprised that Mary 

R5065 : page 231 

and Joseph should not understand that this was the very 
thing for Him to do. 

MEMORY THE MEANS OF IDENTIFICATION 

(4) Our Lord's statement, "Before Abraham was, I 



am" (John 8:58), serves to identify the man Jesus with 
His previous condition as the Logos before He was made 
flesh and dwelt among us. He is the same today, although 
He has been received to the spirit plane. He says, "I 
am He that liveth, and was dead; and behold I am alive 
forevermore." (Rev. 1:18.) Originally He was on the 
spirit plane. Later as a man, He lived; He died. At His 
resurrection He was made alive on the spirit plane, far 
above angels, principalities and powers. But the identity, 
the personality, is the same. 

And we can readily believe that the memory of things 
past is still with our Lord. We also think that He remembers 
the experiences which He had in the flesh and 
also those which He had before He became flesh. Otherwise, 
He could not identify Himself. Memory seems to 
be the means of identification of our personality. Nothing 
in this Scripture would seem to imply that our Lord 
was born into the world with the knowledge of all His 
previous experiences. After His consecration He received 
the knowledge by some means which we are not great 
enough to understand— by some power the Father used; 
for the Father has all power. 

(5) "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and 
forever." (Heb. 13:8.) This statement would not identify 
our Lord with His previous condition; for in His pre-existent 
state, He was not Jesus. He was called Jesus 
at His birth. He became Jesus Christ at His baptism. 
"By His knowledge shall My Righteous Servant 
justify many; for He shall bear their iniquities." (Isa. 53:11.) 
Our Lord began to bear the iniquities of the 
world at His consecration, and finished so doing at His 
crucifixion. Since then He has been reckoning certain 
persons to be members of Himself. When the Holy 
Spirit came upon Him and the heavens were opened unto 
Him, He probably received the knowledge which would 
enable Him to overcome. 

Before His consecration, when our Lord was a perfect 
man just as Adam was, we know not what force Satan's 
temptations would have had; but when His mind was 
opened, then Satan came to tempt Him along the very 
line of His work, along the line of the consecration which 
He had already made. Satan attempted to overthrow 
His consecration and to thwart its completion. How 
much knowledge our Lord had we do not know; but the 
Heavenly Father gave Him sufficient to enable Him to 
come off conqueror. And so with us. Our Lord gives 
us knowledge of Himself and of the Father. He shows 
us the relation between the sufferings of this present time 
and the glories that are to follow. Thus by knowledge 
all the members of the Body of this Great Righteous 
Servant will be permitted to come off "more than 
conquerors" by His grace. 

THE NATURAL MAN CANNOT PERCEIVE SPIRITUAL 
THINGS 



(6) "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that 

we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive 
not our witness." (John 3:11.) The intimation is 
that our Lord could tell heavenly things, but that He 
was not disposed to do so, because Nicodemus and others 
found it difficult to receive even the earthly things. How 
could Jesus tell of the heavenly things? By that time He 
may have had the impress of memory in respect to His 
pre-existent condition. 

We are to tell the heavenly things, but not to the 
natural man. "Cast not your pearls before swine, lest 
they trample them under their feet, and turn again and 
rend you." (Matt. 7:6.) Our Lord said that He had 
many things to tell His disciples, but that they could not 
receive them until the Holy Spirit came. (John 16:12,13.) 
And, "The Holy Spirit was not yet given; because that 
Jesus was not yet glorified." (John 7:39.) "The natural 
man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for 
they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, 
because they are spiritually discerned"; "but God hath 

R5066 : page 23 1 

revealed them unto us by His Spirit, for the Spirit 

searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God." (I Cor. 2:14,10.) 

Now if the Holy Spirit reveals some of the 

deep things to us, how much more could the perfect mind 

of our Lord enter into the holy things? 

"THE GLORY WHICH I HAD WITH THEE" 

(7) Our Lord's words, "Father, glorify Thou Me with 
Thine Own self, with the glory which I had with Thee, 
before the world was" (John 17:5), would not signify 
that He had no knowledge of His prospective share in the 
divine nature. He had the assurance of the Scriptures, 
one of which was that He should be very high; another 
that the Lord would give unto Him the Kingdom; another 
says that Jehovah God would "divide Him a portion 
with the great, and He shall divide the spoil with 

the strong; because He hath poured out His soul unto 
death" (Isa. 53:12); still another says, "The Lord hath 
sworn and will not repent, Thou art a Priest forever, 
after the order of Melchizedek." (Psa. 110:4.) He was 
to be both a Priest and a King of very high state and 
honor. 

Probably our Lord knew these things fully after He 
was begotten of the Holy Spirit, even as St. Paul was 
caught away to the third heaven and received knowledge 
of wonderful things "which it is not lawful for a man to 
utter." (2 Cor. 12:4.) And so it is most probable that 
our Lord Jesus had some special revelation; for we read 
that He said that "as the Father hath life in Himself, so 
hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself" (John 5:26); 
thus indicating His knowledge of the fact that 
both He and the Church would share in the divine nature 



and inherency of life. 

Our Lord's words show that He was not wishing to 
aspire to these glorious things. Very humbly He said, 
"Father, I have come to do Thy will. Father, I shall 
perform the work Thou hast given Me to do and I shall 
be glad to be returned to the glory I had with Thee— 
to ask nothing as a favor. I am glad that I have had 
this privilege, and I think that I shall not suffer 
by reason of My obedience to Thy will. I shall 
be glad, therefore, to be with Thee in the glory that I 
shared with Thee before the world was." 

He did not say to the Father, "Do not forget to pay 
Me; do not forget what Thou didst promise." No. He 
did the Father's will without any thought of compensation 
connected with it. So with us. Anyone who looks for 
the divine nature merely as a reward and feels that it 
is due him, is taking an improper view. We should feel 
that to be on the side of righteousness and to be identified 
with our Lord Jesus is a great privilege, if there be 
no reward of the divine nature at all; but the thought of 
the reward is a great incentive to run patiently for something 
super-abundant, exceedingly beyond what we could 
have asked or thought.

DELIVERANCE TO THE CAPTIVES 

-AUGUST 25.-LUKE 4:16-30.- 

Text: "He came unto His own, and they that 
were His own received Him not."— John 1:11. 

THE CHILDHOOD HOME of Jesus was 
Nazareth, although He was born in Bethlehem. 
The people of Nazareth would of 
course feel a certain sense of pride in their 
fellow-citizen whose fame was spreading 
throughout all Galilee and Judea. Hearing 

R5068 : page 232 

of the mighty works and wonderful teachings 

given at Capernaum, they not unnaturally 

said to themselves, Well, of course 

He will soon return to His own town and 

give us a sight of His wonderful power. And yet, they 

reflected, Is not this Jesus, whose mother and brethren we 

know, and who has for a long time been identified with 

Joseph's carpenter shop? 

They could scarcely believe what they had heard. How 
could it be that so soon after leaving home He had become 
so famous and so powerful? He never did such 
miracles in all the years that we knew Him, said they. 



They did not, of course, understand as we do that He received 
His power as a special benediction when He was 
thirty years of age, as a result of His full consecration of 
His life to the Divine service, that devotion being symbolized 
by His immersion in Jordan. 

THE SYNAGOGUE AT NAZARETH 

At length He came to Nazareth. It was on a Sabbath 
day. For long years He had been recognized as one of 
the few able to read, and had done the congregational 
reading of the Holy Scriptures. This was therefore just 
what they wished and expected Him to do on the Sabbath 
day of His return. He went into the synagogue and received 
from the custodian the scroll bearing the lesson, 
and read the lesson for the day. 

Thus far all went well; but when Jesus began to comment 
upon passages of Scripture there was a commotion; 
first whisperings of disapproval, and finally an outburst of 
wrath against Him. Ah! they thought, this young man has 
quite lost His head since He left us! We know indeed 
that His people of Nazareth have a mean name throughout 
the country, that ours is reputed to be a mean city of little 
learning; but who would expect that one of our own 
citizens would return to our midst and tell us to our faces 
that we are not worthy of having an exhibition of His 
power— such as He has given to other cities and to their 
people! 

Their pride and patriotism made them wild. They 
drove Him out of the synagogue with angry demonstrations. 
They insulted and jostled Him and led the way 
toward the rear of their city, not daring to lay hands on 
Him, but merely as a mob gnashing upon Him and pushing 
onward in a direction in which they desired that they 
might lead Him to the brow of a hill, and then push Him 
over. 

For a little way Jesus went, but then He turned and 
passed through their midst, overawing them by the 
dignity of His presence, and perhaps realizing that their 
course toward Him was merely a corroboration of what 
He had said respecting their unworthiness to have a share 
of the blessing of God which He was distributing. 

THE TRUTH THAT ANGERED 

What were the words that thus angered them? At 
first we read, "All bare Him witness, and wondered at the 
gracious words that proceeded out of His mouth." What, 
then, made the change? It was the plain declaration that 
because they did not appreciate Him enough, because they 
did not believe in Him fully, therefore it would not be 
God's will that He should perform any miracles for them. 
He backed up His statement with illustrations from the 
past which angered them still more. He said that in 
Elijah's day there was a famine in the land, and that 
Elijah was not sent to the widows of Israel, but to a widow 



across the border, in a Gentile city. 

Again, Elisha was not sent to cleanse the lepers of 
Israel, but did cleanse a Gentile, Naaman. Alas, for the 
power of pride! "Pride goeth before destruction, and a 
haughty spirit before a fall." Instead of the people of 
Nazareth getting angry and resenting these things, they 
should have said, Tell us, then, of our faults and help us 
to overcome them. If God has blessings, surely we, as 
Israelites, may have our share if we will but come into the 
right attitude of heart. Instruct and pray for us. But 
the proud cannot see their difficulties, hence the Scriptural 
declaration of the special favor and blessing to the humble. 

THE LESSON FROM ISAIAH 

The lesson for that Sabbath was from Isaiah 61:1-3. 
It was an excellent text, and the sermon on it was from 
the very ablest of all teachers. The whole difficulty was 
with the heart condition of the hearers; and this is true 
of many a sermon and many a lesson. How His hearers 
should have rejoiced to know that they were living in the 
day of the fulfilment of these words! He had been 
anointed by the Father with the Holy Spirit, that He might 
declare good tidings to the poor. Surely many of them 
were poor and needy! 

We read further that Jehovah sent Jesus to heal the 
broken-hearted. Oh, how those words ought to have appealed 
to all in that audience! How they would have 
appealed to any that were broken-hearted! The difficulty 
probably was that they were hard-hearted. Satan has 
hardened the hearts of mankind in general. God's promise 
is that under Messiah's glorious reign He will take 
away the "stony hearts" and give them "hearts of flesh." 

The declaration further was that the blind would receive 
their sight, that liberty would be granted to the 
captives, that the bruised and injured would be healed, 
and that "the acceptable year of the Lord" would be proclaimed. 
These were indeed wonderful words of life! 
No wonder we read that "they wondered at the gracious 
words that proceeded out of His mouth." 

"DELIVERANCE TO THE CAPTIVES" 

This part of the message might have been applied in 
part to themselves. Were they not captives, bound by the 
fetters of sin, bound also by the fetters and chains of 
heredity, sickness, imperfection and death? Were not 
some of them actually blind also, as respected the eyes of 
their understanding? Evidently the time for them to see 
had not arrived— they were not in the condition to receive 
the blessing of the anointing of their eyes of understanding. 
Were they not all bruised by the fall, imperfect, 
blemished, wounded, sore— mentally, morally and physically— 
and was not the Great Deliverer there to set them 
at liberty, in part at least, from these difficulties? Surely 
that was a favorable moment, and they were a favored 



people! 

But the work that Jesus was doing was merely the 
proclamation of these things, with a few illustrations or 
examples of healing, etc. The real time for Him to accomplish 
the deliverance of the captives, the liberating of 
the sin-bruised, and the giving of sight to the blind, that 
all might sing the praises of God and appreciate His 

R5068 : page 233 

favor— these actual blessings belonged to the Messianic 

Kingdom time. What Jesus was doing was merely a foreshadowing 

of the great things to be accomplished future 

—"In the Times of Restitution of all things which God 

hath spoken by the mouth of all His Holy Prophets."— 

Acts 3:19-21. 

PROCLAIMING "THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR" 

This brief expression, so little understood, pointed out 
the special work of Jesus, far more important than the 
miracles. The term, "acceptable year," or acceptable time, 
refers to this entire Gospel Age of more than eighteen 
centuries. It is "the acceptable time" in the sense that 
during this period God is willing, through the merit of 
Christ's sacrifice, to accept from amongst the sinners a 
Little Flock of joint-sacrificers to share with their Redeemer 
in His Kingdom. 

No opportunity had been granted in the past to become 
dead with Jesus, to present their bodies living sacrifices, 
to walk in His footsteps, to fill up the afflictions of Christ, 
to suffer with Him. The proclamation of this opportunity 
waited until Jesus had made His own consecration, and 
all who accepted His Message and became His followers 
did so under this invitation or proclamation. It was the 
privilege of becoming the sons of God by a begetting of 
the Holy Spirit. (John 1:13.) The acceptance of these 
sacrifices began at Pentecost and still continues. Who can 
say how soon the door of privilege to offer acceptable 
sacrifices may close? Then the door to the High Calling, 
to the Bride class, will be shut— forever. Other blessings 
God has, but not other privileges than those of this Age 
for suffering with Christ and for participating with Him 
in His reign of glory.

FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH 

-SEPTEMBER 1. -MARK 6:14-29.- 

Text: "Be thou faithful unto death, and I 
will give thee a crown of life."— Rev. 2:10. 



TODAY'S STUDY includes the tragedy connected 

with John the Baptist's death. King 

Herod had put away his own wife, and was 

living unlawfully with the wife of his 

brother Philip— Herodias— a vain woman 

apparently and without conscience, who, for 

ambition's sake, had dared everything that 

she might occupy the place of a queen. John 

the Baptist, a fearless teacher, in his preaching 

had referred to the fact that King Herod 

was living in violation of the Divine Law, and that this 

was likely also to bring upon the people a war, for his 

wife whom he had put away was the daughter of King 

Aretas. 

Herodias heard of John's teaching, and was both 
angry and fearful— angry that he should dare to speak so 
of her relationship to the King— fearful, lest the words of 
this eloquent man, which greatly moved the masses, might 
alienate her from the King, or that perhaps the King himself 

R5069 : page 233 

might come under the influence of John's searching 
words. Had Herod put her away, as would have been 
his duty, she would have been an ashamed and a disgraced 
woman in the eyes of the world, for the Herods and their 
affairs were well known in Rome and elsewhere. So a 
denouement would have left her a pitiable spectacle, and 
in her pride she was ready to do murder, or anything that 
would divert such a calamity. 

Herod feared John and feared the people who believed 
John to be a Prophet, but Herodias feared neither God nor 
man. However, in deference to Herodias' wish, Herod 
had John arrested for his temerity. Even then Herod 
liked to hear John talk, though he still kept him a prisoner. 
All the more Herodias feared the influence of John. She 
brooded and she schemed. The King's birthday came, and 
she encouraged him to make it a great day, a festival, and 
to ask to the banquet his principal friends. In the midst 
of the carousal she dressed her own daughter in the airy 
costume of the dancing girls of the East, and sent her in 
to dance before the King and his friends. 

So great a condescension implied that the King should 
make some return. He asked the girl what he should give 
her, promising anything that she would ask, even to the 
half of his kingdom. This was exactly what the wicked 
mother had planned; and true to her agreement the child 
returned for instructions. Herodias had gotten Herod into 
her net. He had refused to kill John in spite of all her 
endeavors. Now, in the presence of his friends, on his 
own birthday, at his own suggestion, he had obligated 
himself to do anything that might be asked. If the daughter 
demurred to ask for the head of John the Baptist, the 
mother probably told her that if John lived both of them 
would probably sooner or later be outcasts; that his death 
was necessary. 



BOUND BY AN UNHOLY OATH 

When the maiden returned and made her request, the 
King was grieved, yet, not being a humble man, nor a 
God-fearing man, but merely a proud man with a man-fearing 
spirit, he felt himself bound to comply with his 
oath given in the presence of those great men. Was he 
not King? Was it not his birthday? Had he not freely 
promised, even though under the influence of intoxicating 
liquor, and should he now draw back and show the white 
feather, and simply that he had some confidence in this 
peculiar Prophet? No! The execution was accomplished; 
the head was delivered to Herodias; the King's honor (?) 
was maintained. 

Alas, poor world! How many are its snares of pride 
in the wrong things, and in fear of the wrong person! 
How many are its attempts to preserve and increase its 
pleasures and honors! 

In a previous study we heard Jesus' words, that no 
greater Prophet than John had ever arisen. We fully 
agree that he was a great man, a holy man; a Prophet of 
the Lord was he. We fully agree that he will have a great 
reward in the future— with all the holy Prophets, and 
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, he will come forth from the 
death-state perfect as a man, because he was found faithful, 
even unto death. He will be one of the class mentioned 
by the Lord through the Prophet David— "Instead 
of Thy fathers, shall be Thy children, whom Thou [Messiah] 
shaltmake Princes in all the earth." (Psa. 45:16.) 
John will be one of those glorious Princes on the earthly 
plane, one of the representatives of Messiah and the 
Church, who will be on the Heavenly and invisible plane, 
like unto the angels, partakers of the divine nature. 

Those who selected our lesson text evidently overlooked 
the fact that John the Baptist is not one of the 
Church class referred to in the Lord's words, "Be thou 
faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life." 
(Rev. 2:10.) John will indeed get life everlasting as a 
glorious portion, but he will not be a member of the Bride 

R5069 : page 234 

class, as we have shown. This honor belongs to us who 
have received Jesus and become His disciples and been 
begotten of the Holy Spirit, since Pentecost. We again 
quote St. Paul's words concerning the Ancient Worthies: 
"All these died in faith, not having received the things 
promised them," "that they, without us, should not be made 
perfect." (Heb. 1 1:13,38-40.) We, the Church, the Bride 
class, the Little Flock, called to be joint-heirs with Jesus 
in His Kingdom, must get our share of the blessing first. 
The Bride and the Bridegroom must be perfected in the 
First Resurrection before the Kingdom can be established; 
and it must be established before the blessing can go to 
any others— even to the Ancient Worthies. 



WHEREIN IS THE DIFFERENCE? 

If John the Baptist was faithful unto death, just as 
faithful as those will be who have lived since Pentecost, 
wherein is the difference, and why should he receive an 
earthly reward and the Bride class receive the heavenly 
reward? There are several reasons for this. In the matter 
of justice God could not justly, not properly, show any 
preference to one person, or to one class; but in matters 
of grace, of favor, as the Scriptures declare, He may do 
what He will with His own. If A owed $5 each to B and 
C, he could not justly give the entire $10 to one of them 
and repudiate the debt to the other. But if he wished to 
make presents, gifts, he may give B $1 and C $9, or give 
the entire $10 to B and nothing to C. 

So far as the world was concerned, God was under 
no obligation whatever to do anything to help Adam and 
his race; hence the entire matter of redemption is of grace. 
But since Jehovah entered into covenant with His Son 
that the latter should pay the redemption price for the 
world, and then become its Restorer, Jesus, having laid 
down His life, the matter has passed from being purely 
of grace, and has connected with it a certain measure of 
justice between God and Christ. 

So far as man is concerned there is a measure of 
obligation, because God has already stated what the results 
of the redemption work shall be— "all the families 
of the earth shall be blessed"; there shall be a "restitution 
of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all 
the holy Prophets." God is therefore bound to humanity 
by principles of justice, because He has made these promises. 
Yea, He has given His oath that all the families of 
the earth shall be blessed. St. Paul's argument on this 
subject is that God has thus bound Himself by two immutable 
or unchangeable things— His Word and His Oath. 

But nothing in God's promise bound Him to give John 
the Baptist a place in the Bride class. The Apostle Peter 
declares that God foreknew this class, predestinated it as 
a class, but not as individuals, from before the foundation 
of the world; and He is now making a selection according 
to principles, to determine who may be of this class. He 
gave no opportunity to John the Baptist to be of this class, 
but in His providence permitted him to die when he had 
accomplished the work specially intended for him. None 
could be of this Bride class who died prior to Pentecost, 
for there the Holy Spirit of adoption and begetting was 
first given, and without that none could occupy the plane 
of sons; those under Moses and of his House were 
servants.

SOME INTERESTING LETTERS 



DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

My husband and I have entered the Colporteur work and 
the Lord has wonderfully blessed us. 

As we are working in another brother's territory, I write 
to ask if Shiawassee County, Mich., is being worked. If not, 
will you assign us this county as soon as possible? 

We have taken orders for nearly four hundred books in 
six days. We each took orders for nine full sets in one 
day. I never believed I could sell a book and dreaded to go 
into the work because of my inability to explain the Scriptures; 
also because I am not much of a talker. But I have 
found that God can use very poor material to do His work. 

We have been greatly blessed and are thankful that we 
took your advice and entered the work. May the dear Lord 
bless you in your work! MRS. S. H. GRIFFIN. --Ohio. 



DEAR BROTHER IN THE LORD:- 

Many of the smaller classes, and perhaps some of the 
larger ones, do not realize the importance of order in regard 
to addressing only the brother occupying the chair. As a 
class we have about overcome this difficulty. We also used 
to think that it was not necessary to be strict in this because 
we were so few in number, but I always felt that I should 
be ashamed if anyone from an orderly class should visit us 
and witness the disorder. 

The Elder of a disorderly class is especially in danger 
of displaying his lack of obedience to this rule when he 
visits another class, for he forgets that he is not occupying 
the chair and unconsciously comments on every expression 
to the annoyance of the class. I feel that it would not be 
easy for the leading Elder to correct him, for it would be 
like correcting your friends' children for misconduct. 

Perhaps these friends overlooked the importance of addressing 
the chair as given on page 327, Vol. VI., and included 
in a past study. It would surely be beneficial to them 
to turn to it again with a spirit of obedience in their hearts. 

May the Lord continue to bless you as you strive to 
carry out His will. 

Your sister in the dear Redeemer, 



DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

Words cannot express my appreciation of the "Meat in 
due season" committed to your charge to dispense in "My 
Vow unto the Lord." 

What a comfort it has been to me! what a help in keeping 
on "the whole armor of God" ! to keep my heart with all diligence; 
to bridle my tongue! 

Surely it is a wonderful gift from our Heavenly Father, 
for in every temptation and trial, in every thought, word and 
action, it helps us to remember our covenant to be dead with 
our Lord— to endeavor to "fill up that which is behind of the 



afflictions of Christ." 

I must confess my tardiness in writing you; I took the 
Vow a year ago and testified to blessings received, promising 
then to send in my name. I feel that I have lost a blessing 
in withholding it so long. J. A. THOMPSON.-Calif.

FAITHFUL BARKING COMMENDED 

DEARLY BELOVED PASTOR:- 

When first reading the article in a past TOWER illustrating 
our "Old Creature," by a dog, it seemed a little amusing; 
but recently circumstances here in the Philadelphia ecclesia 
brought forth the need of studying the parable of the "Sheep." 

We learn that all shepherds keep a good "sheep dog," which 
is gentle, kind, never vicious, but does considerable barking 
when the sheep are inclined to stray; and all sheep belonging 
to the dog's owner are very dear to the dog. Its sense of 
smell is very acute; if a sheep had been near a wolf the dog 
would detect it and bark at the wayward one. 

Learning the above facts partly answered a puzzle in my 
mind, namely, whenever any "sheep" in our ecclesia strays 
from any of the doctrinal points, he or she is usually very 
composed about it, but those watching for such danger-places 
make a big fuss over it. It is talked and talked about. They 
seem very restless, disturbed, even to loud words. 

Questioning the different "barkers" I find each ready to 
suffer anything if only the wanderer may return— have his 
eyes opened. So I have concluded that it belongs to the 
faithful "dog" to bark and bark at even the smell of a wolf, 
and that to err in the "dog" nature is nothing to compare to 
erring in doctrine. In other words, dogs would better bark 
too much than not to be watchers and warners of the approach 
of the wolf.

BEREAN QUESTION STUDIES 

DEAR BRETHREN:— I have been for many years much impressed 
with the importance of Berean methods of study- 
indeed, ever since the Society began to bring them to our attention 
as specially desirable methods. I have since then 
aimed to follow them closely in my personal studies, but have 
realized all the while that, as classes, we were not getting hold 
of them properly. 

A recent visit of the dear brethren, coupled with careful 
consideration of a letter (Tower, Sept. 15), has impressed 
the matter upon me as never before. I trust a new impetus 
has been given to "class" study and, with the thought of possibly 
adding somewhat to the impression, I am sending out 
to Ecclesias in this vicinity some suggestions, of which the 
enclosed is a copy:— 



(1) Berean Study is as old as the Church. 

(2) The volumes-STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES-like the 
Scriptures themselves, are full of interrogation points— that 

is, they suggest questions everywhere. 

(3) The average mind is not competent to make the best 
arrangement of these questions— linking them together in 
their proper, logical order. 

(4) The arranged Questions, furnished by the Brooklyn 
Tabernacle, supply this lack. 

(5) These "Question" Studies have been with us for years. 

(6) The Bethel "Table Talks" are on the same general 
plan— surely a forceful demonstration and endorsement of 
the method. 

(7) They foster concentration of thought, and give a 
definite aim in study. 

(8) They develop ability in analyzing subjects. 

(9) They assist all the members of a class to study along 
uniform lines. 

(10) The Church being made up of separate Ecclesias, in 
proportion as the method is followed by the different Ecclesias, 
the Church as a whole is studying along uniform 

lines. 

(11) We acknowledge the value of uniformity by our 
unanimous adoption of it in use of Daily Hymns and Daily 
Manna. 

(12) They make the leader of a Class less a teacher, thus 
dividing up with the class, more fully, the responsibility for 
development. 

(13) It encourages Class study, which is surely discouraged 
in proportion as the leader, either from inclination or 

as the result of less practical methods, monopolizes the explanation 
of Studies. 

(14) It supplies the best basis for study of the lessons beforehand, 
and neglect of this spells proportionate failure in 

any method of Class work. 

(15) Each member of a Class has a responsibility in this 
respect which he or she cannot afford to ignore. (It is our 
opinion that where Classes fail to make the method practical 
the main difficulty lies (a) in a lack of preparatory study; 
(b) in failure of the leader to impress its importance.) 

(16) Where an Ecclesia lacks "speaking" talent, it supplies 
a good substitute, and we believe in many cases more than 

a substitute. We incline to the conviction that less dependence 
on preaching and more on "class" study should be the order. 

(17) Should the appointed leader be absent from any 
"study," the Class thus equipped could carry along the Study 
without interruption, any member reasonably well-informed 
being competent to take charge. 

(18) If for any reason it should not be deemed wise to 
have a regularly appointed leader, different members would 
be prepared to lead in turn— each member recognizing such 

a one as leader, while filling the office, directing all questions 
and answers to him— thus holding the Class to order as effectually 
as though they had a regularly appointed leader. 

(19) Any answer to a question should be supported by at 
least two good Scriptures. If each member recognizes his or 



her responsibility in finding these Scriptures, it will guarantee 
a study which should make any subject interesting to any 
visitor present who is interested in the Bible. 

(20) Should any question come up on any paragraph, after 
those prescribed for the study have been dealt with, the leader, 
by turning it over to the Class, instead of answering himself, 
will make the study the more helpful. (This method of turning 
questions over to the class would often avoid a delicate 
situation, should the question be such as would call for an 
answer which might not be acceptable to the questioner. The 
leader, in thus sharing the responsibility with the class, could 
express himself the more freely, and no special objection 
could be taken.) 

(21) With the "Berean Question" method uniformly followed, 
in any "study" where a specific number of questions are 
marked off, and kept up with, we would be at home if temporarily 
present with any Class the world over. 

(22) Additionally, we all desire to be as closely in touch 
with the "isolated" ones as possible, and it would seem that 
nothing could operate more effectually in this direction than 
the widest possible application of this principle of oneness 
in study. 

(23) The fact that the Society is continually urging this 
method gives the unmistakable inference that WE NEED IT. 

Your brother in service, W. W. BLACK.

KEY PUZZLES 

We have some key puzzles, which, so long as they last, 
will be sent out to WATCH TOWER subscribers who have opportunity 
for using them. They are intended to advertise 
Vol. I., STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES. Of course, they are of 
no special use to the friends in the Truth, but intended merely 
to attract the attention of the public. We rely upon our subscribers 
to put them into circulation in all parts of the country 
—one puzzle laid in each hotel parlor of your town or in the 
reading room of the Y.M.C.A., or any such place would be 
the thought. One puzzle for each hotel is plenty, as it can 
be used over and over again by different parties. Order as 
many as you can use judiciously up to a dozen— free. 



FRENCH VOLUNTEER MATTER 

We now have PEOPLES PULPIT Volunteer Matter in the 
French language in ample supply. Order as many as you can 
use for your French-reading neighbors and friends. Classes 
of Bible Students in Eastern Canada, New England and the 
larger cities should be able to dispose of considerable quantities. 
Hitherto the French people in this country have had 
almost no witness of the "present Truth." 

European subscribers may order from the Society's French 
Branch, viz Societe de Bibles et de Traites, 10 Rue de la 
Tour Maitresse, Geneva, Switzerland.

MORE BEREAN QUESTION BOOKLETS 

We are pleased to inform our readers that Question Booklets 
are in stock for Volumes I., II., III., IV. and V. of STUDIES 
IN THE SCRIPTURES, and also for TABERNACLE SHADOWS. 
Price 5c. each— 50c. per dozen, postpaid, brings them within 
the reach of all. Order freely according to your needs. 

Many of the Classes find these questions very helpful. The 



difficulty with many Classes in the past has been that not 
every one has the teaching ability to draw the information 
of the lessons from the Class. The successful class leader has 
little to say except as he sums up the answer to each question 
after it has been discussed by the Class; or, if the question 
be not understood by the Class, he may often render assistance 
by paraphrasing it and, if possible, simplifying it. 

Excellent as public preaching is we believe that the Lord's 
people learn more in Berean Classes than by listening to any 
sermon. Thought is stimulated, quickened. 



R5070 page 239 

THE LAW MAGNIFIED AND MADE HONORABLE 

"The Lord will magnify the Law and 
make it honorable."— Isa. 4221. 

"WHERE THERE IS NO LAW there is no 

transgression" (Rom. 415), would seem 

to be an axiom— a self-evident truth. No 

one could transgress a law that was not 

given to him, that was not applicable to 

him. In his discussion of the Jewish view 

of the Mosaic Law, St. Paul used this 

statement to show that the Jews misunderstood 

the matter. They had the thought 

that because God had given them the Law 

at Mt. Sinai, they were justified in God's sight by that 

Law. But receiving a Law is not keeping that Law. 

Therefore, the Apostle shows them that by the deeds of 

the Law no flesh could be justified in God's sight— 

Rom. 320. 

Continuing the argument a little further, St. Paul 
shows that the entire human race was once in God's favor, 
as represented in Adam before sin entered. While 
the race was in that condition of perfection mankind was 
just before God. But when sin entered, it brought the 
penalty of alienation from God and of death. Thenceforth 
the human race was dead in trespasses and in sin, 
having no right to everlasting life. In that condition God 
did not give mankind a law, but permitted the world to 
go without law up to the time of Moses. And even in 
the time of Moses God did not give the Law to the whole 
world, but only to the Jewish nation. If Israel had been 
able to keep the Law that was given to them at Mt. 
Sinai, they would have been a living nation— not a dying 
nation, as the other nations are. 

The Apostle proceeds to say that the commandment, 
which was ordained to life, Israel found to be unto death. 
(Rom. 710.) A man cannot be justified by receiving the 
Law, but by keeping the Law. The rest of the world were 
less condemned than the Jews, for, says the Apostle, God 
did not give them that Law and they never came under 



the penalty of that Law. So, then, Israel found the Law 
to work death; and they were under more condemnation 
than were any other people in the world; for they were 
condemned, not only in Adam, but also by failure to keep 
the Law. By the Law Covenant given on Mt. Sinai, they 
were lifted out of the Adamic condemnation and put on 
trial afresh; and when they failed to keep that Law, they 
had a second condemnation put upon them. 

St. Paul is here demonstrating the mistake of thinking 
that the Law Covenant gave Israel a special immunity 
from condemnation. Then he shows that there are some 
Gentiles who have never come under the Law Covenant, 
as did the Jew, but who, nevertheless, show a work of 
progress, which the Jew had not done; for these Gentiles 
show a law of love ruling in their hearts. In some respects 
they judge themselves, and in other respects their consciences 
excuse or accuse them. 

GOD'S LAW ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN MAN'S HEART 

The Apostle says that since the Jews are condemned 
by the Law given at Mt. Sinai, and since the rest of the 
world recognize by their consciences that they are condemned, 
then the whole world stands guilty in God's 
sight. What then is that which condemns the Gentiles? 
The answer is, the original Law of God remaining in their 
hearts, though marred by the fall. 

God created our first parents in such a condition of 
perfection that the Law of God was clear, or manifest, to 
them instinctively. Now, because of the fall, if a man were 
to use his moral perceptions alone, one man might say 
that a thing is wrong, and another might say that it is 
right; each would be guided by his own mind, his own 
conscience. St. Paul's argument is that no matter how 
fallen a man may be, he still has so much of the original 
Law in his heart that his conscience will either accuse him 
of wrong-doing or excuse his conduct; and unless extremely 
degraded he will know that it is wrong to steal 
or to take human life. 

To whatever extent a man retains this original Law of 
God to that extent he is responsible. No one can sufficiently 
excuse himself so as to say that he is worthy of 
eternal life. The Jew could not claim that he had kept the 
Law, for his atonement for sin was an acknowledgment 
that he had failed to do so; and the Gentile's conscience 
testified to his unworthiness. Therefore, neither was deserving 
of eternal life. Continuing his argument the 
Apostle explains that none of the fallen race can obtain 
eternal life except by the way that God has provided; and 
that way is in Christ alone. By the Divine arrangement 
Christ, who was perfect, was made flesh and gave Himself 
on behalf of Adam and his race, so that God can be 
just and still be the Justifier of him who believes in Jesus. 
-Rom. 326. 

Neither Jew nor Gentile can have eternal life except 
as the result of faith in Jesus Christ. The Apostle tells 



us that we cannot merit eternal life, but that we must do 
all in our power to manifest that if we were perfect we 
would keep God's Law, and that in proportion as we know 
the Divine will, the Divine Law, we should prove our 
desire to be in harmony with God by doing His will to 
the best of our ability. The merit of Christ will off-set, 

R5071 page 240 

compensate for, the weaknesses of the flesh through heredity, 
and ultimately we shall attain to full perfection. But 
none except those who show their willingness to keep the 
Law will reach this perfection; they must be willing to 
spare no efforts to keep that Law, so far as in them lies. 

TWO CLASSES RELEASED FROM ADAMIC CONDEMNATION 

"Where no Law is there is no transgression," for "sin 
is not imputed when there is no Law." (Rom. 415; 513.) 
The world has not yet come under individual condemnation; 
for the world has not yet been placed under 
Divine Law. Why not? Up to the present time the world 
is under the Adamic sentence, and only those who are 
lifted out of that condemnation can come under another 
sentence. The whole world was condemned to death under 
Father Adam, and mankind cannot be sentenced again 
until they get out from under the first condemnation. 
The only ones who have, in any sense of the word, been 
released from this Adamic condemnation are two classes; 
the Natural Israelites and the Spiritual Israelites. The 
Jews could not be tried for life or death without a release 
in one form or another from the Adamic condemnation. 
This release they obtained by the Law Covenant; 
but it was only typical, for the blood of bulls and goats 
can never take away sin.— Heb. 104. 

The only ones who have been actually released are 
those Jews who came under the Covenant of sacrifice, 
the Covenant which began with the Gospel Age with 
Christ, and those Gentiles who have entered into this 
Covenant relationship with Christ. As many of these as 
have entered into this relationship are on trial before 
Divine Law, and subject to eternal life or eternal death 
under that Law. If obedient to that Law they will get 
eternal life. If disobedient to that Law of the spirit of 
life, and if they wilfully sin after having been begotten 
of the Spirit, they will get death. 

In the case of the Jew it would be the Second Death 
if their Law Covenant had been the full and complete 
Covenant which God intended for them. But it was not; 
it was merely a tentative Covenant to give them a tentative 
offer of eternal life; it was simply a typical Covenant. 
The real one is that which God intended should 
come in the New Covenant. "The days come, saith the 
Lord, that I will make a New Covenant with the house of 
Israel and with the house of Judah; not according to the 
Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I 



took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of 
Egypt" (Jer. 3131,32); God will make a New Covenant 
with them. He will take away the stony heart out of 
their flesh and will give them a heart of flesh, that they 
may keep His statutes and ordinances and do them 
(Ezek. 1 1 19), under this New Covenant— the real Law 
Covenant. 

Under that real Law Covenant every Jew will have 
the fullest opportunity of coming into harmony with God. 
And the basis of that harmony will be the "better sacrifices" 
than the typical ones, which Moses offered. The 
great Mediator will be the Messiah— Christ the Head and 
the Church His Body. And that great Mediator has the 
basis of His power in the fact that He has provided the 
"better sacrifices." He provided first His own sacrifice; 
and during the Gospel Age He has been providing other 
sacrifices— those who come unto the Father by Him. 

THE LAW AN INDICATION OF GOD'S WILL 

The Church of this Gospel Age is not under the Jewish 
Law Covenant; for that Law Covenant was given to 
the Jew and not to the Gentile nor to the Christian Church. 
We are not to speak of ourselves as "Gentiles" or as 
"Jews," but as the Church of God. God has made a different 
Covenant with us; it is spoken of as a Covenant of 
sacrifice "Gather My saints together unto Me; those 
who have made a Covenant with Me by sacrifice." (Psa. 505.) 
This Covenant has been made individually with 
the entire Church of Christ. 

Shall we say, then, that the Gospel Church is without 
a Law? By no means! We are not under that Law 
Covenant— the Covenant which demands of us to keep 
that Law and which binds us to keep it. But we are under 
a Covenant of Grace— a Covenant which makes special 
provision for us— for our inability to do perfectly. 
Nevertheless we are still under Divine Law. Every intelligent 
creature is under Divine Law. To the extent 
of her knowledge the Church will be responsible to the 
Law of God. 

How may we know the Law of God? We may know 
of it in part by the Jewish Law and the Ten Commandments. 
Do we ignore the Ten Commandments? By no 
means. We appreciate them as showing us the Law of 
God. It is one thing to strive to keep them in mind, in 
spirit, and a totally different thing to keep them inviolate, 
as those under the Law covenanted to do; for whoever 
breaks one of the commandments breaks them all. (James 210.) 
We are therefore not under the Law, but under 
grace. (Rom. 614.) That same Law which God gave 
to Israel, so beautifully represented on tables of stone, 
is not over us; but the spirit of that Law is applicable to 
us. St. Paul says that the righteousness of the Law, the 
true keeping of the Law, is fulfilled in us, the Gospel 
Church, who walk not after the flesh, but after the 
Spirit. -Rom. 84. 



With the Gospel Church God is dealing differently 
from the manner in which he dealt with the Jewish people. 
God's arrangement with the Jews was that they should 
keep that Law both in letter and in spirit, or else they 
would be condemned. His arrangement with the Gospel 
Church is that they should fulfil that Law to the best of 
their ability, and that the merit of Christ will make 
up for their deficiency. While we of the Gospel Church 
would like to keep the Law we are as unable to keep it, 
as were the Jews, on account of the weakness of the 
flesh. Every Christian should feel that he is strictly under 
obligations to the Divine Law more than are those 
who are not Christians, because of his greater enlightenment 
in Divine things, in the instructions of Christ and 
the Apostles and of the Holy Spirit. Not only is he to 
seek to live up to the requirements of the Law, but he 
covenants to do much more. He covenants to sacrifice 
even those rights which he would have under the Law, 
and to present his body a sacrifice, not even calling for his 
own rights under the Law. 

OBEDIENCE TO THE EXTENT OF ABILITY 

We keep the spirit of the Ten Commandments because 
it is the spirit of righteousness, the Spirit of God. 
We have become God's children; and having His Spirit, 
we are to do those things which are pleasing to Him. If, 
therefore, we can from the Ten Commandments learn 
what things are pleasing to Him, then they are lessons 
that we should learn. If any other thing shows us what 
is pleasing to God, we are to do it. But we are not under 
the Law Covenant. We do not hope for eternal life by 
keeping it. God's arrangement for us is that being obedient 
to the extent of our ability and having the spirit 
of the Law in our hearts, we are counted as perfect in 
His sight and will receive His blessing. 

Some of the Jews thought that they kept the Ten Commandments, 
yet to their surprise they did not get eternal 
life. The teachings of Jesus and the Apostles show us 
that every one of the commandments of the Law had a 
deeper meaning than the Jews could discern, and that 
their failure to perceive the spirit of the Law was one of 

R5071 page 241 

the reasons why they could not get eternal life. Take the 
commandment which says, "Thou shalt have no other 
gods before Me." Some people really have another god 
in their hearts; some idolize their husbands; with others 
their wives have the first place; with some it is their 
stocks and bonds. This is idolatry. 

The Scriptures tell us that the commandment, "Thou 
shalt not kill," has a still deeper signification than to take 
life. He who is angry with his brother, he who would like 
the opportunity to kill and who abstains from so doing 
merely because of fear, is in his heart a murderer. Similarly, 



the Master says, He that looks upon a woman to 

lust after her commits adultery in his heart; he is restrained 

only because of lack of opportunity. 

When we begin to get this deeper view of the teachings 
of the Ten Commandments we see how the Lord 
magnified the Law and made it honorable. (Isa. 4221.) 
But the fact that Jesus was able to keep the Law shows 
that God did not give an unjust Law; that it could be kept; 
that the weakness was in the fallen condition of humanity, 
and not in the Law. 

THE SABBATH OF FAITH IN JESUS' FINISHED WORK 

Now as these other commandments have a higher and 
deeper meaning than that which appears upon the surface, 
so also has the Fourth Commandment, which relates to 
the Sabbath Day. The Apostle Paul gives us the key to 
this higher meaning when he says that this Seventh Day 
typifies the rest of faith for the people of God. (Heb. 49,10.) 
Whoever abides in Christ is a Sabbath-keeper, 
and those who do not abide in Him lose this rest and thus 
fail to be Sabbath-keepers. There is a still further expansion 
of the Sabbath in its typical significance to the 
Thousand- Year Day. Then humanity will be at rest from 
Satan, from sin, from the trials, besetments and difficulties 
of the present time; and all mankind will have an 

R5072 page 241 

opportunity of entering into this rest. The Church will 
enter into it first, in her resurrection. Next the Jew will 
enter into that rest, when he shall understand God's plan 
and become the recipient of God's blessing and eternal 
favors in the Millennial Day; and finally, before its close, 
all the world will come under its blessed influences. This 
was the promise of God to Abraham when He said, "In 
thee and in thy Seed shall all the families of the earth be 
blessed." (Gen. 123.) They will be blessed in the wonderful 
provisions of that great Sabbath Day. 

The Fourth Commandment was never given to us, and 
we are not enjoined to keep the seventh day either in the 
letter or in the spirit. The Sabbath Day was never given 
to the Church. A higher thought than that of physical 
rest is given to us. God has provided for us a rest of 
faith in Christ's finished work. We may enjoy our rest 
seven days of the week, and every day in the year. If we 
begin to appreciate that thought we have a rest about 
which the Jew knows nothing. This is an earnest of the 
future when we shall be through with all our difficulties 
and shall remain ever in the rest of God. 

SUNDAY AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE NEW ORDER OF 
EVENTS 

We are not under commandments ourselves in God's 
sight; we are not under obligation to keep any day of the 



week. Why do we observe a Sabbath? Because of our 
own volition. The Law of this land provides for the 
keeping of Sunday. We are glad that the Law makes this 
provision for a quiet day once a week. We are pleased to 
have it so, and would not have any objection if there were 
two Sundays each week. We do think that the day chosen 
is a beautiful reminder of our Lord's resurrection. It is 
also a very fine illustration of the new order of things so 
soon to be established; and it is a very appropriate day 
for us. As for the world, quite probably, under the New 
Covenant there will be a day set specially for them in 
which they will rest from labors, etc. Perhaps it will be 
the seventh day. 

SONS NOT UNDER LAW OF SERVANTS 

It is nowhere said that Christians are to keep both the 
spirit and letter of the Ten Commandments. If it were 
so stated, we would be under that Law as were the Jews, 
who although bound by their Covenant to keep every jot 
and tittle of the Law, could do no more than to observe 
the spirit of the Law and to endeavor to keep, so far as 
possible, the letter also. 

Christians are under grace; for they are sons of God 
by adoption. A son has many privileges which a servant 
does not have. To illustrate Suppose we had been 
adopted into a millionaire's family. Upon going to the 
new home, as we look around we notice certain inscriptions 
over doorways; as, for instance, "Servants' Entrance," 
"Tradesmen's Entrance," "Servants' Washroom," 
"Servants' Quarters," etc. Upon further observation we 
discover various rules put up, regulating the duties and 
affairs of the servants in general. These we read, and 
thereby gain information as to the will of our kind friend. 
We ask ourself, "Do I come under this classification? 
No, for I have been adopted into the family. These are 
not for me. Yet, from these instructions I perceive something 
of the law of the house, but I have duties and privileges 
far beyond those of a servant; I am a son and have 
privileges corresponding thereto." 

So, the Apostle says, God deals with us as with sons. 
He has not given us the Ten Commandments. Why not? 
It would be an insult to give us of His Spirit, His mind, 
etc., and yet put us under a command which would imply 
that we had not received His Spirit. It would be quite 
inconsistent to say to a New Creature, "Do not steal, do 
not commit murder." The New Creature would not want 
to steal or to murder. The more we know about the Law 
given to Israel the more we appreciate it, the better we 
comprehend the Divine standpoint for everything. So 
while we may get some good out of that Law given to 
servants, we realize that it is not a command given to us, 
although it gives us some idea of what a son should do. 
Those commands should make us know better what is the 
Father's will; and thus we are the better able to do that 
will. 



In proportion as we learn to appreciate the Father's 
will and to copy the principles underlying the Divine 
Character, we as New Creatures are "changed" from glory 
to glory of heart quality. And thus changed in our 
hearts, our minds, our wills, our conduct, we become fit 
or "meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints 
in light."-Col. 112.

Canst receive it? Then thou art

"YE ARE NOT UNDER THE LAW, BUT UNDER GRACE" 

GOD HAS ONE LAW only for His intelligent 
creatures. This Law, therefore, in whatever 
form it may be stated, whether more 
elaborate or more condensed, is applicable 
to angels, to men and to the New Creation. 
There is no higher Law and there could be 
none. 

This Law is based on Justice, and finds 
expression in Deut. 65; Matt. 2237-40; 
Lev. 1918. It would not be reasonable to 
demand that one should do more for another than for 
himself. To do so may be invited; it may be suggested 
to us; but there would never be a command that a man 
should do more for another than for himself; for such a 
command would be unjust. Thus we differentiate between 
Justice and Love. "Love is the fulfilling of the 
Law" (Rom. 1310) and might go much further than 
would Justice. In the case of the Church, however, there 
is a special proposition made— not merely that we shall 
love, but that we shall love on the highest plane of life. 

A HIGHER COMMANDMENT 

The consideration set before Jesus and before His 
followers for carrying out this proposition is glory, honor 
and immortality— the divine nature; and for this joy we 



have engaged, not only to keep the Law, but additionally 
to seek to have love beyond the commandments of the 
Law. Under this arrangement we have agreed to do more 
than to love our neighbors as ourselves. We have agreed 
to lay down our lives for the brethren. This is a special 
requirement, which could not be expected from anyone 
aside from sacrifice. 

Our relationship with the Lord is under this special 
covenant of sacrifice, as expressed in the words, "Gather 
My saints together unto Me; those that have made a 
covenant with Me by sacrifice." (Psa. 505.) These, the 
Apostle tells us, are not without Law, but are under Law 
in Christ. This Law in Christ is the law of their covenant, 
which is the Law of Love. A sacrificing love being 
beyond any requirement of Justice, it necessarily follows 
that anything which they would do beyond the requirement 
of Love would also fulfil the requirements of the 
Law laid down by Justice— the lesser being comprehended 
in the greater. This Law of Love would be a still higher 
law; as Jesus expressed it, "A new commandment [a higher 
commandment] I give unto you, that ye love one another; 
as I have loved you, that ye also love one another."— 
John 1334. 

When the Apostle says, "Ye are not under the Law, 
but under grace," he probably has special reference to the 
fact that Christians who had come from among the 
Gentiles had never been under the Law arrangement, 
but that their first experience under law was under this 
Grace arrangement in Christ. However, in the case of 
the Jews who had been under the Law Covenant, he 
declares that they were freed from the Law to which 
they had been bound; and he speaks as if the Law was a 
very severe requirement which they had been unable to 
keep, and from which release was a great blessing. The 
Law Covenant proposed everlasting life upon the terms 
of keeping the Law. "This do, and thou shalt live."— 
Lev. 185; Rom. 105; Luke 1028. 

Since all the Jews, like the rest of mankind, were 
imperfect because of the fall, therefore no Jew could 
keep that Law, and consequently no Jew could ever attain 
everlasting life. Being unable to keep the Law he could 
not get a reward. But he was really bound by that 
Covenant; for there was no other Covenant offered to 
him up to the time when the Gospel was offered. Then, 
for him, a special arrangement was made— a Covenant 
of sacrifice. He was freed from the Law Covenant in the 
sense that he was released from the Law. 

By becoming dead to the Law the Jews had an opportunity 
to get life in another way. By abandoning all 
hopes of getting everlasting life through the Law, they 
could receive a new hope in Christ; namely, that under 
the arrangement in Christ, the great Advocate, they might 
have fellowship with Him now in His suffering and later 
in His glory, which, by the Father's arrangement, He will 
share with all those who become His followers. 

From the time, then, that the Jew became dead to the 



Law, by abandoning all hope of getting life by obedience 

to it, he came into this one hope, which could be attained 

only through sacrifice. But he was still bound to do what 

is right. But this arrangement to do what is right is for 

the New Creature, not for the old creature, which is 

reckoned dead. The New Creature, however, has purposed 

to do God's Law and more. Such sacrifice all 

earthly hopes. So of these it is said, "Old things are 

passed away; behold, all things are become new!" (2 Cor. 517.) 

They are no longer under the Law Covenant, but 

under the arrangement of grace, or God's favor. 

It is a great privilege to offer ourselves in sacrifice 
and to get so great a reward in return. This is a great 
favor under grace. But there is another sense in which 
we are under grace; namely, the arrangement was made 
not only by which we get so large a reward for doing so 

R5073 page 242 

little, but by which our sacrifice is made acceptable. This 
also is grace. Grace means what the Lord does for us 
freely, not as a reward of any kind. 

What our Lord does for us is to make our sacrifice 
acceptable. Then grace still pursues us and grants us 
blessings all the way; for, having undertaken to follow 
Jesus, we could not carry out our sacrifice. We find it 
impossible to do things perfectly, because we have imperfect 
bodies. But through the arrangement made for 
us in Christ, these imperfections will be forgiven. In 
order that these may be forgiven, it is necessary that we 
come with courage to the Throne of heavenly grace, that 
we may obtain help in time of need.— Heb. 416. 

A REWARD IS NOT OF GRACE 

So then we see three things First, that there is a 
Law higher than Justice, a Law of Love, a Law of Sacrifice; 
second, that God proffers us a reward for walking 
in the footsteps of Jesus, sacrificing self even unto death; 
and third, that He covers our unwilling imperfections by 
the Robe of Christ's Righteousness, in order that we may 
perform acceptably our part of the contract. 

Now, a reward is not of grace. If we offer a man 
$5 for doing a certain piece of work, we should not say 
after the work is done, "This is a matter of grace, and 
we will not give you the $5, but $1." To do so would 
not be right. To pay what we agreed to give is a matter 
of justice. So, then, it was grace to offer a reward for 
walking in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. But once the 
offer has been made, it becomes an obligation. It is a 
contract; it is a covenant, of sacrifice on our part, of 
reward on God's part. Jesus said, "To him that overcometh 
will I grant to sit with Me in My Throne, even 
as I also overcame and am set down with My Father 
in His Throne." To give the reward after the terms have 
been complied with, will not be grace, but justice. 



Again, grace provides the Redeemer's sacrifice on our 
behalf— not only for our original sin, but for all trespasses 
on the way. When the Apostle says that the 
righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in us, he is not speaking 
of the Church as under that Law Covenant; but he is 
saying that while the Jews could not keep that Law because 
of the imperfections of their flesh, yet the Church 

R5073 page 243 

keeps that Law; for it does not apply to our flesh, but 
to our spirit. Hence, the ability to keep that Law we, 
as old creatures, do not have; and we could not thus keep 
the Law any more than they. But we as New Creatures 
should be accounted as not only keeping that Law, but as 
keeping the Law of Sacrifice. 

The Little Flock will keep the Law of Sacrifice. The 
Great Company will keep the Law in the spirit of their 
minds; but failing to do more they will lose the great 
reward of glory and honor. So, then, those of the consecrated 
who keep the Law of Love, the Law of Sacrifice, 
will be accounted as worthy of glory and honor with 
Christ Jesus. And those who fail to keep this Law of 
Sacrifice, but who maintain the Law of Justice, will finally 
be accounted worthy of everlasting life, but not of 
immortality.

THE LIFE-RIGHTS OF THE ANCIENT WORTHIES 

RIGHT TO LIFE is one thing, but right to 

eternal life is another. Adam had the right 

to live, which would have been eternal if 

by obedience he had demonstrated his 

worthiness to live forever. So with the 

Ancient Worthies; when raised from the 

dead they will have the right to live, but 

only through the Mediator. They will not 

have life-rights of their own, for there are 

no such rights except those which are recognized 

by the Father and Justice. The Apostle Paul 

tells us that already the Ancient Worthies have the Divine 

approval. But although they pleased God, He did 

not give them eternal life; and although they shall please 

the Mediator, He will not turn them over to the Father, 

to Justice, until the end of the Millennial Age. 

The Scriptures say also that all live unto God (Luke 2038), 
for from His standpoint they only sleep. (See 
Deut. 3116; John 1111, etc.) Not the Ancient Worthies 
alone, but the rest of the world live unto God in the 
same sense, although they were not counted acceptable to 
Him. He has made provision for them through the Mediator, 
but that provision will not be complete until the end 



of the Millennial Age. The Ancient Worthies, approved 

of God, had this testimony, that they "pleased God," in 

that they came up to the standard— perfection of heart-intention 

and obedience to the extent of ability. While 

He approved them, nevertheless they did not have eternal 

life given them nor was any right to eternal life 

recognized. 

God has, however, made provision whereby all of Adam's 
race will be redeemed and have the opportunity of 
gaining eternal life. This provision will, of course, include 
not only the Ancient Worthies, but also the remainder 
of mankind. 

LIFE THROUGH THE MEDIATOR 

This arrangement made by God is not, however, outside 
of the Mediator, for through the Mediator alone will 
mankind, including the Ancient Worthies, obtain eternal 
life. (The only exception to this provision of the Mediator 
is the Church Class, who come to the Father 
through Christ's acting as their Advocate.) Hence the 
Ancient Worthies cannot come by any different route. 
They must be recognized of the Father through the Mediator; 
for since they are not joint-heirs with Christ, they 
must come in under the other class, during the period in 
which the Mediator will deal with the world as a whole. 
The process of dealing with the world as a whole will go 
on, and not until the end of the Millennium will The 
Christ deliver any of them over to the Father. 

The Lord Jehovah has made a plan by which he can, 
through His Son, deal with mankind. That plan is that 
"The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment 
unto the Son." (John 522.) Hence the Father, 
aside from His Son, did not judge the Ancient Worthies. 
But they may expect a blessing in God's own time and 
season— in "due time"— when Messiah will have taken 
His power and begun His reign; and particularly at the 
end of that reign, when the Son shall have delivered up 
the Kingdom to the Father.— I Cor. 1524. 

The Father is not taking any cognizance of this arrangement 
for the blessing of the world, but is leaving 
it all for the great Messiah, who will be their Mediator, 
their great High Priest, making reconciliation, mediation. 
When the mediation, arranged for from before the foundation 
of the world, shall have been accomplished, it will 
be satisfactory to the Ancient Worthies, who will have 
been "rulers in all the earth," and to mankind as a whole. 

ANCIENT WORTHIES UNDER THE MEDIATOR 

The question as to whether the Ancient Worthies will 
have life-rights when they come forth, may be viewed 
from different standpoints. According to the teaching of 
the Scriptures, whoever is perfect is worthy of eternal 
life. We understand the Scriptures to teach that the Ancient 
Worthies will come forth from the tomb perfect, 



lacking nothing. We would be inclined to say, then, that 
being perfect they would come within the Divine arrangement 
that whoever is perfect shall live. But we must 
remember that God is the Judge of all. (Heb. 1223.) 
Yet, even so far as the Ancient Worthies are concerned, 
they will not have direct dealings with God during the 
Millennial Age. Personally, they will be ready thus to 
deal; but God in His wisdom has seen fit to deal with 
them through the Redeemer, the Prophet or Teacher, the 
Priest, the Mediator of the whole world of mankind. And 
since the whole world of mankind is not ready to be 
turned over to the Father, the Ancient Worthies must 
wait until the remainder are delivered over into the hands 
of the Father, the Great Judge of all. 

At the end of the Millennium, the whole world of 
perfected humanity will be turned over to the Father. 
(I Cor. 1524.) As soon as He accepts them they will 
stand in the same position in which Adam stood when He 
was perfect. But as Adam was required to be tested, so 
the whole world of mankind will be tested in that same 
condition of perfection in which Adam was. Divine Justice 
must test their worthiness of life eternal before it 
will be granted. 

SECOND RANK IN THE WORK OF SALVATION 

The various statements regarding the Ancient Worthies 
all give the impression that, by their voluntary 
course, they reached the point where they were pleasing 
to God. And the Apostle Paul declares that these Ancient 
Worthies all died in faith, not having received the blessing 
of eternal life, because God had some better thing 
for us, the Church, that they without us should not be 
made perfect. (Heb. 1113,39,40.) In other words, while 
they had the testimony that they pleased God, they are 
not to have first rank, but second, in the work of salvation. 
They could not receive their blessing, their perfection, 
until, in the outworking of the Divine Plan, Messiah 
has taken His Kingdom and His Bride has been perfected. 
Then they shall have their restitution blessings. 

The fact that the Apostle says also that the Ancient 
Worthies desired "a better resurrection," implies that the 

R5074 page 244 

resurrection given to them will be better than that given 
to the remainder of mankind, in that they will be worthy 
of having perfection of life at the time of first coming 
forth from the tomb, while the resurrection of the others 
will be gradual after they come forth. "Abraham, Isaac and 
Jacob and all the prophets"— all the Ancient Worthies- 
will be awakened from death fully restored to human perfection; 
and will not require a "resurrection by judgment," 
a thousand years long, as will the residue of 
mankind. 
These Ancient Worthies will come back in exactly the 



same condition that Adam was before the fall; but they 

will have the advantage of greater experience than he 

had. Adam was perfect; these will be perfect. Adam 

had no experience with sin; these will have had much experience 

with sin. These experiences tended to develop 

character; that is to say, they brought about a favorable 

determination in respect to righteousness; the testing 

that came to them was to demonstrate their obedience to 

God, their loyalty to His will. To maintain this loyalty 

many of them laid down their lives. 

While these Ancient Worthies will have neither part 
nor lot in the Spiritual Kingdom, because not called 
thereto— that high, or "Heavenly calling" not being possible 
until after the Ransom had been laid down by our 
Lord Jesus— yet they will occupy a position of preferment 
above the world, having attested their faith and love 
during the reign of evil, in a manner approved of God. 
Thus they were prepared and proved worthy to be the 
earthly ministers and representatives of the Spiritual 
Kingdom. In harmony with this it is written by the 
Prophet David, as addressed to The Christ— "Instead of 
[being longer considered] Thy fathers [they] shall be 
Thy children, whom Thou mayest make Princes [chief 
ones, captains] in all the earth."— Psa. 4516. 

The resurrection of these Ancient Worthies will also 
be "better" than that of the remainder of mankind in 
that they were tried severely during their life and received 
a "good report through faith," and will have attained the 
reward of that faithfulness. They will be perfect men, 
having completely restored to them all that was lost in 
Adam— mental and moral likeness to God, and perfection 
of physical powers. 

ELEMENTS OF CHARACTER-DEVELOPMENT 

If these Worthies of the past have had large experience 
with sin and have proved themselves faithful in 
that they remained loyal to God, even unto death, why 
should they not receive life-rights as well as perfection of 
life at once? Why should they be obliged to wait until 
the end of the Millennial Age for recognition by Jehovah, 
instead of receiving it at the beginning? The answer is 
that God has included the whole world in the Mediatorial 
work of Messiah, as He has included all the Church in 
the preparatory work of the Royal Priesthood, through 
the great Advocate, the Redeemer; and the Mediator's 
work will continue for a thousand years. Hence, all who 
come under that work will be obliged to wait for the end 
of that Epoch before the recognition of any of them will 
be effected. 

The Ancient Worthies "had this testimony that they 
pleased God." They pleased Him in that when they ascertained 
His will they set about doing it, even before 
He gave it to them as a Law, or obligation, even before 
He could ask them to obey Him and promise them eternal 
life for their obedience. Abraham, one of these, manifested 



his faith in God although there was no redemption 
yet accomplished in the world. Christ had not yet 
come. And although Abraham was not on trial for life 
or for death, God granted him His favor and declared 
that he pleased Him. He and all those Ancient Worthies 
will have this resurrection to human perfection. But 
since human perfection— to the world of mankind— will 
come only under the Mediatorial reign of Christ, the Ancient 
Worthies cannot be introduced to the Father until 
the close of the Millennial Age. 

Hence they will not have life in its fullest sense until 
the time when at the close of the Millennial Age the 
Kingdom shall have been delivered over to the Father. 
What they will have in the meantime— during the thousand-year 
period— will be perfection of human nature and 
all the blessings that God provides for mankind through 
the great Mediator. 

ESTABLISHED CHARACTER NECESSARY 

If perfection of organism makes character, then Adam 
was perfect in this respect. He was created perfect in 
mind and body. His mind was in the image of God; no 
blemish was there, no preference for sin, but the reverse 
of this; he had an appreciation of righteousness and a 
tendency toward it; he was all that would constitute a 
good man, for God so made him. 

In another sense, Adam never had perfect character; 
that is, he had no character developed, tested and proved. 
God tried him, and because of his inexperience he failed, 
even though his character was good and his organism perfect. 
He failed in the very first feature of his trial. So 
we might wonder in what manner the Ancient Worthies 
received any testing which would constitute a full proof 
of character. When we examine the records of these 
men we find that they manifested great faith, and that 
they endured some severe ordeals and testings of their 
loyalty to God and their confidence in Him. It does not 
surprise us, then, that the testimony that they pleased God 
was given respecting them. This assures us that they 
had considerable character development. God must have 
seen their hearts to be very loyal, else He never would 
have considered them worthy of a better resurrection. 
Yet we believe they will have need of further experience 
and testing. 

These Ancient Worthies will not be begotten of the 
Holy Spirit, as is the Church; but we are informed that 
"after those days" God will "pour out His Spirit upon 
all flesh." (Joel 228; Acts 217.) The Ancient Worthies 
lived prior to the time of the outpouring of the Holy 
Spirit, therefore, if they receive any measure of this 
blessing to come upon "all flesh," it must be in the future, 
and the giving of the Holy Spirit to them will have much 
to do with fixing, establishing, crystallizing their already 
perfect characters. They will be brought to greater 
knowledge, and having already endured severe testings 



and having proved their thorough heart-loyalty, they will 
have to learn only how to use their talents and powers in 
fullest conformity to the Divine will. 

While this class will be mortal and hence liable to 
death, it is almost unthinkable that any of these would 
come short of eternal life. Men who have stood crucial 
tests under conditions of ignorance and superstition, who 
have endured temptation from the world, the flesh and 
the Adversary, and proved loyal under such conditions, 
would, it is only reasonable to suppose, maintain their 
perfection under the more favorable conditions of the 
Millennial Age. 

It is not probable that they would make mistakes; but 
if, upon their awakening, they should be at once turned 
over to Jehovah, and, as in Adam's case, the slightest deflection 
would mean death, we can see that their position 
would be much less favorable than it will be under the 
New Covenant arrangement during the Millennial reign 
of Christ. This is a very gracious arrangement for their 

R5074 page 245 

best interests, for any possible mistake would be covered 
by Christ's mediation and not bring them under sentence 
of death. 

The history of some of these Ancient Worthies is very 
meager and does not always imply that they were "overcomers" 
in the sense in which the Church is to be. Take, 
for example, the case of Samson, who is mentioned as 
one of these Ancient Worthies. The last we read of Samson, 
still in the hands of the Philistines, is that he was 
still loyal to God and prayed for the opportunity of serving 
God's cause; the Lord granted his prayer, permitting 
him to push down the pillars of the building in which 
he was making sport for the Philistines; they were the 
middle pillars upon which the house stood, and in its fall 
more than three thousand of the enemies of the Israelites 
were killed along with himself. 

Faith seems to have been the chief element of character 
that was developed under Samson's experiences. 
We do not know how much patience, long-suffering, 
brotherly kindness, gentleness, meekness, etc., were developed 
in his character; nothing is stated in regard to 
the matter and we have no reason to suppose that Samson 
was a very gentle man. Indeed, we have never thought 
of gentleness and meekness as being amongst his characteristics. 
The slaying of one thousand men with the 
jaw-bone of an ass, as well as other experiences of 
his, would not seem to indicate this. 

We may reasonably suppose, therefore, that although 
Samson will be brought back in an absolutely perfect condition, 
and under the favorable environments of the Millennial 
Age, there will probably be experiences in life 
that he never encountered and that will be so new to him 
that he might be in danger of making mistakes. Assuredly 
he will have much to learn respecting the things 



of the Spirit of God, in the days of the blessing of "all 
flesh." 

Summing up, we would say, The Ancient Worthies 
will not come into actual and personal relationship to 
God, so as to be determined worthy of eternal life, until 
the completion of the Millennial Age, because that Age 
is set apart for the very purpose of determining who of 
all mankind may have eternal life— aside from the spirit-begotten 
ones of the present time. At the close of the 
Millennial Age, when all mankind shall have reached 
perfection of being, they shall be tried of the Father for 
their worthiness or unworthiness of eternal life— just as 
Adam, while enjoying perfection, was tested as to whether 
or not he was worthy to have his life made perpetual. 

Since the Ancient Worthies will be a part of the 
world under the New Covenant arrangements, it follows 
that they will not have the decision of the Divine Court, 
Divine Justice, respecting their worthiness of eternal life, 
until the completion of the Millennial Age, until the conclusion 
of the trial at the end of that Age, which will 
bring to them, as it will bring to all others who are faithful, 
the great reward of life eternal.

TORONTO AND WASHINGTON CONVENTIONS 

NEARLY ONE THOUSAND of those of "like 

precious faith" assembled in Convention at 

the National Exhibition Park, Toronto, 

Ont., Canada, beginning Sunday, June 30. 

The weather was ideal for such an occasion, 

and the spirit of the friends indicated 

their joy in the Lord, their oneness of purpose 

and implicit faith in the great Creator 

of the Universe. Those in attendance were 

mostly from Canada, although quite a number 

were present from the United States. 

Horticultural Hall proved to be a splendid Convention 
auditorium, having a capacity of about fifteen hundred. 
The friends were quite comfortably lodged in the vicinity 
of the Park, and a substantial luncheon was provided 
each noon, affording at the same time an excellent opportunity 
for sociability and Christian fellowship. The Exhibition 
Park is located on the lake front with a magnificent 
view of the water, and is artistically laid out with 
winding paths, fountain sprays and flower beds. 

With such beautiful surroundings praise to the Almighty 
filled every heart from the very first, and the 
opening day of services was appropriately designated 
"Praise Day." The speakers of the day magnified the 
name of the Lord and forcefully depicted the Divine program. 
"Hope Day," "Kingdom Day" and "Fruitage Day" 
each in turn proved equally interesting and helpful to the 



assembled Bible Students as they had further word pictures 
painted before their mental vision illustrating God's 
wonderful provision for all mankind, and the special 
favors in reservation for the members of "the Church 
of the First-Born." 

At one of these sessions a resolution was unanimously 
adopted expressing the sense of the Convention "that we 
do not find the Bible to teach the doctrine of a literal hell 
fire, or place of fire and brimstone, for the punishment of 
the wicked, but that secular history of the formation of 
the creeds of the Middle Ages reveals the fact that for 
various reasons, either wisely or unwisely, the doctrine 
of punishment in hell fire was added to the Gospel as 
taught by Jesus and the twelve Apostles. We, therefore, 
now unreservedly repudiate as thoroughly unscriptural 
the teaching of a place, state or condition of a literal lake 
of fire and brimstone for the punishment of the wicked, 
and further, that we believe from many personal testimonials 
that the vast majority of ministers of all Protestant 
denominations have privately repudiated the 'hell fire' 
theory, but have, for supposedly good reasons, hesitated 
to inform their congregations; and further, that we believe, 
on this account thousands, and perhaps tens of thousands, 
are being driven into skepticism or infidelity. We 
appeal to every minister in the Dominion of Canada to 
publish in his local newspaper, over his own signature, a 
statement declaring whether or not he believes the Bible 

R5077 page 245 

to teach the doctrine of a literal lake of fire and brimstone, 
and ask every editor to invite the ministers of his 
constituency to avail themselves of his columns for their 
statement. " 

On Thursday, "Fruition Day," Brother Russell arrived 
in the afternoon and found the Convention at its 
height; and on Friday, "Harvester's Day," the enthusiasm 
and zeal seemed, if anything, to excel any former occasion. 
We trust that many of the Harvesters were encouraged 
to renewed activity in the Lord's service for 
the ensuing year, and, too, that others may have received 
an incentive to enter into some department of the grand 
Harvest work. The prevailing sentiment seemed to be 
expressed in the words of our Master during that other 
great Harvest period eighteen centuries ago— "The Harvest 
truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few; pray ye 
therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth 
laborers into His harvest."— Matt. 937,38. 

Saturday was designated "Spirit Begetting Day." At 
the conclusion of the morning praise and testimony service 
Brother Russell addressed the Convention on "Baptism- 
Its Import and Its Symbol." This was followed 

R5077 page 246 

by an immersion service at the lake, where 97 adults symbolized 



their full consecration unto death. The Convention 
proper, according to program, concluded an Saturday 
afternoon with a Love Feast. The elders of the 
Toronto Class, all the Pilgrim brethren present, and 
Brother Russell, enjoyed the blessed privilege of a personal 
hand-shake with each and all in attendance. The 
singing of appropriate farewell hymns and the breaking 
of bread made the scene most impressive, never to be 
forgotten. 

Although not on the program, on Sunday morning a 
large number of the friends gathered again at Horticultural 
Hall for a praise and testimony service and an 
address by one of the Canadian brethren, followed by a 
Berean lesson. In the afternoon the public of Toronto 
were addressed by Brother Russell in the Royal Alexandra 
Theatre on the subject, "Beyond the Grave." The 
meeting was well advertised, and although this is a large 
auditorium, and the day was extremely warm, the place 
was crowded to its capacity and, according to various 
estimates, five hundred to one thousand were turned away 
from the doors unable to gain admittance. The witness 
to the Truth, God's character and plan thus given, we 
trust, may serve to awaken the interest of some who 
heard for the first time. Closest attention was given 
and at the conclusion many were the warm greetings and 
expressions of joy, hope and pleasure respecting the "good 
tidings of great joy which shall be unto all people." 

AT WASHINGTON CITY 

While the concluding sessions were being held at 
Toronto, Ontario, Bible Students from thirty-six different 
States were entering the Capitol City of the United States 
by the gateway of its magnificent Union Station, previously 
mentioned in the columns of this journal on account 
of the appropriate inscriptions of Biblical texts so 
precious to the hearts of our readers, to be found above 
the archway entrances, viz., "Thou hast put all things 
under His feet"; "The Truth shall make you free"; "The 
desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose," etc. 

Via special trains, special cars, electric lines and automobiles 
the friends continued to pour in until by Saturday 
evening, the day before the Convention opened, the 
city was fairly filled with Bible Students, who were assigned 
to over six hundred different homes, private boarding 
houses and hotels. This distribution of the visiting 
Students, we believe, afforded an excellent opportunity 
for witnessing to the Truth before many families and 
persons who might not otherwise have been reached. So 
far as we have heard all were quite comfortably located. 

The opening day's sessions were all held in the Auditorium 
at the Glen Echo Chautauqua Grounds, and in 
spite of the extreme heat the place was filled to overflowing. 
Observing the extraordinary numbers in 
attendance, which more than taxed the capacity of Glen 
Echo Park and the electric car facilities, the committee 



on arrangements concluded that it would be best to transfer 
the majority of the meetings to Washington City 
proper. Accordingly, on Monday morning the Washington 
Academy of Music, a fine auditorium with a seating 
capacity of about 2,500 persons, was secured, and at 9 
o'clock on Tuesday morning the same was packed to its 
limit, with about 300 on the platform. This necessitated 
the securing of another auditorium for overflow services, 
which were arranged for in the beautiful new Masonic 
Temple, seating about 1,400 people. Besides these two 
places the G.A.R. Hall was engaged for Book Stall, Colporteur 
Department, Post Office, Information Bureau and 
a general meeting place for those who desired to make 
appointments with one another. 

We believe we can see the overruling hand of Providence 
in having these various auditoriums, as they served 
to bring before the attention of the public the actual size 
of the gathering of Bible Students. It was a surprise 
to many of the Washington residents to know that there 
were so many people so interested in Bible study as not 
to give their time to sight-seeing or other attractions of 
that beautiful city, but on the contrary would pour into 
each of the auditoriums at each session, morning, afternoon 
and evening, notwithstanding the heated weather. 

Besides the regular features, as designated on the program, 
a reception was held in the G.A.R. Hall on Monday 
evening, attended by six hundred. Another reception, 
in the nature of a special discourse by Brother Russell, 
was held on Tuesday evening in the Academy of Music, 
which was crowded to its capacity. On Wednesday night 
a most inspiring prayer meeting, attended by fully 2,500 
persons, was conducted at the Academy of Music. The 
testimonies all evidenced remarkable growth in grace and 
in knowledge of the Lord and a desire to "praise Him for 
His goodness and wonderful works to the children of 
men."-Psa. 1078. 

Another feature not on the regular program was the 
"Christian Workers' Service" on Thursday afternoon at the 
Glen Echo auditorium, over one thousand being present. 
The discourse by Brother Russell on the subject of Baptism 
on Friday morning was listened to with quiet interest, 
and at its conclusion 167 adults indicated their desire 
to symbolize their baptism into the Body of Christ by 
water immersion. After directing a few personal words 
and extending the right-hand of fellowship to each of the 
candidates, they were conducted to the bathing pool at the 
foot of the imposing Washington Monument, where the 
ceremony was performed with befitting dignity and 
solemnity. 

In the evening Brother Russell addressed a splendid 
assembly of Pilgrims, elders and deacons at the Academy 
of Music, and all seemed greatly rejoiced, comforted and 
encouraged by the remarks, which were based upon the 
text, "Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the 
flock, over the which the Holy Spirit hath made you overseers, 
to feed the Church of God, which He hath purchased 



with the blood of His Son. "--Acts 2028. 

Harvesters' Day, with its usual enthusiasm, brought 
together the active Colporteur workers to learn more 
about the wonderful privileges of the season in which we 
are living. The Master's words, as recorded by St. John, 
seem best to express the sentiments of this blessed day at 
the Convention "Jesus saith unto them, My meat is 
to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish His 
work. Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then 
cometh the harvest? Behold, I say unto you, Lift up 
your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white 
already to harvest. And he that reapeth receiveth wages, 
and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that both he that 
soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together."— 
John 434-36. 

At one of the early sessions of the Convention a 
similar resolution to that passed at the Toronto Convention, 
repudiating the doctrine of the Dark Ages— the 
eternal torture of nearly all mankind— was presented and 
carried unanimously by the Bible Students gathered at 
Glen Echo. Already we learn of considerable discussion 
having been agitated amongst the various clergymen in 
all parts of the country. 

Holiness Day concluded this last, and we must again 
say, "the best yet" of all our Conventions. On account of 
the great numbers in attendance the usual custom of breaking 
bread and shaking hands with all the Pilgrims and 

R5077 page 247 

Brother Russell was not deemed practicable, but instead 
the Pilgrim brethren and Brother Russell were stationed 
at the various points of exit of the Academy of Music 
and bade the friends farewell while they sang, "Blest Be 
the Tie That Binds," "God Be with You till We Meet 
Again," and other hymns of similar sentiment. As this 
leave-taking was in progress many eyes glistened with 
tears of mingled sorrow and joy while we said farewell to 
one another and "God bless you." Let us hope to meet 
again in the Great Convention on High, where we surely 
shall be if faithful to "Him who hath called us out of 
darkness into His marvelous light."

PREACHING THE KINGDOM 

-MATT. 935 TO 10 15. -SEPTEMBER 8.- 

Text "He that receiveth you receiveth Me, and he that 
receiveth Me receiveth Him that sent Me."— Matt. 1040. 

WE HAVE MORE about the Kingdom in the 
study appointed for today. Not only did 



Jesus preach the Kingdom, as our lesson 
says, but realizing that the Harvest work 
of the Jewish Age was great, He sent forth 
His twelve Apostles two and two— to 
preach what? Hark! He said, "As you 
go, preach, saying, The Kingdom of Heaven 
is at hand." 

As the Savior cast out devils and healed 
the sick, not with the view of doing a restitution work 
and general healing, but to allow the people to hear the 
Message which He preached, and to illustrate the healing 
and restoring work which His Kingdom will do in its appointed 
time, so also He gave the same power to His 
Apostles, for the reason that He gave them the same 
Message of the Kingdom to proclaim. 

He told them that the Harvest was plenteous and that 
the laborers were few, and intimated that it was their 
privilege to note this fact and to be all the more energetic 
because of the great "field" and the few to reap it; 
but in the meantime to "pray the Lord of the Harvest to 
send forth more laborers." That is to say, He wished 
them to feel a measure of responsibility in the work, even 
though He Himself was the Lord of that Harvest, and 
even though He was the responsible One. So the Master 
would have every one of us feel a deep interest in the 

R5076 page 247 

Harvest work now in process, in the end of this Age, and 
similarly to pray to Him for more laborers, in the similar 
proclamation, "The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." 

These messengers of the Kingdom were not to go to 
the Gentiles, but merely to "the lost sheep of the House 
of Israel," said our Lord. Why? Did He not love the 
Gentiles? Was the Lord Jesus prejudiced so that He 
cared only for His own nationality? No; the answer is a 
different one. God's Covenant promised the blessed privilege 
of the Messiahship to Abraham's Seed. Jesus was 
the Seed of Abraham in particular and the Messiah. But 
God had another feature in mind in connection with that 
Messiahship, of which Abraham did not know; namely, 
that He would have associated with Messiah in the Kingdom 
others who would share His glory, honor and immortality. 
This blessed privilege, which Abraham could 
not have fully understood, God nevertheless fulfilled to 
Abraham's children, as fully as though He had particularly 
stipulated it in the promise. God would keep the 
very spirit of His engagement as well as its letter. 
Hence, no favor could go to the Gentiles until after 
natural Israel had received the opportunity and used it 
as far as they would. 

HARVESTING THEN AND NOW 

Another reason why the blessing should not have 
been given to the Gentiles was that it was to be a harvesting 



work, and not plowing, harrowing, nor sowing, 

which had not been done with the Gentiles, but only with 

the Jews. It was appropriate, therefore, that the Harvest, 

which belonged to the Jews, should be confined to 

them. What was done for the Gentiles was the seed-sowing, 

as represented in the parable of the Wheat and 

Tares. 

But now we are in the Harvest of the Gospel Age. 
It is not the Jews that are being harvested now, nor the 
heathen, nor the world in general. The reaping is to be 
done amongst those who have received the seed-sowing 
—the reaping work belongs to Christendom— to whatever 
part of mankind the Gospel Message has been made 
known and wherever received and professed. This, therefore, 
is an intimation to us that the Lord would now have 
the harvesting done chiefly amongst those who profess 
to be His people, nominal Spiritual Israel. The Trumpet 
is to be blown in Zion, to awaken those who are at ease 
in Zion. 

Jesus specially instructed the reapers of that Harvest 
that they should go forth fully trusting to Divine providence. 
They were not commissioned to beg nor to take 
up collections, so far as the records show. They assumed 
therefore that they were merely to accept what 
might be voluntarily tendered. If they were not hospitably 
received they were to consider it the Lord's will 
that they should go elsewhere. They were sent to search 
out the worthy ones; they should keep this in mind. In 
going from house to house, a prayer should be in their 
hearts, if not upon their lips, that if there were worthy 
ones there the peace of God, and their peace, might be 
there. If not, they were to take their blessing with them 
to bestow it upon those more worthy, as they should find 
them. "Whoever will not receive you and hear your 
words, when you depart out of that house," or out of 
that city, "shake off the dust from your feet." 

"MORE TOLERABLE FOR SODOM" 

Jesus declared that in the Day of Judgment it will be 
more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah than for the 
city refusing to receive His representatives. What does 
that mean— "more tolerable"? It implies that the treatment 
will be tolerable in any event. But why more tolerable 
for Sodom and Gomorrah and others in the Day 
of Judgment? 

It was Jesus' declaration that, aside from a saintly 
few who received His Message gladly, the remainder of 
the people of that time were more hardened and more 
blameworthy in God's sight than were the people of Sodom 
and Gomorrah, whose sin was of a different kind. 
Let us notice that feature. The sins of Sodom were certainly 
grievous in the sight of God and all good people. 
But, think of it! the sin of carelessness in respect to the 
glorious Message of the Kingdom is in God's sight an indication 
of a still meaner condition of heart, of a still 



more wicked person, one of whom there is less hope of an 
eventual salvation. 

The Sodomites mentioned by Jesus were not so illuminated 
as those living in His day, yet He declares, "Fire 
rained down from heaven and destroyed them all." (Luke 1729.) 
And that took place nearly twenty-five centuries 
before Jesus' birth, yet He declares that those Sodomites 

R5076 page 248 

had not up to that time been judged— their judgment was 
still future; and, "In the Day of Judgment, it will be more 
tolerable" for them than for the people of Bethsaida and 
Chorazin. Sodom sinned grievously, but they had little 
light, practically no knowledge of God. 

THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 

But why should the Sodomites have a Day of Judgment 
at all? Were they not judged, condemned and destroyed? 
Oh, yes; but then, all men, Adam and all of his 
race, were judged and condemned. Those Sodomites 
were condemned to death before they were born, as are 
all of Adam's children— born in sin, "shapen in iniquity." 
The death penalty which came upon Adam reached to 
them as it has reached to us. The only thing that came 
upon the Sodomites specially, in addition to what comes 
upon all mankind, was that they died violent deaths, probably 
accompanied by great sufferings. 

In this blotting out as a Divine punishment, the 
Apostle tells us, they were made an example of the ultimate 
doom that will come upon all who reject God's grace 
and die the Second Death. (2 Pet. 26.) However, 
the Sodomites and all of Adam's posterity are included in 
the Redemption work of Jesus. Hence they are no more 
dead than Abraham, but merely sleeping with their fathers, 
as Abraham sleeps with his fathers, waiting the 
glorious morning, when the Redeemer of Adam and his 
race shall take to Himself His great power, shall establish 
His Kingdom, bind Satan, glorify His Church, and 
begin His work of blessing the world. 

The world's blessing will consist of an awakening from 
the tomb, and there will be an opportunity to the Sodomites, 
as well as the people in Jesus' day, to rise out 
of their sinful and fallen condition, and, if they will, to 
return to full harmony with God and have everlasting 
life. In that glorious Judgment Day of a thousand 
years (2 Pet. 37,8) the Sodomites will find it easier to 
make progress than will those who repudiated the message 
of Jesus and the Apostles. However fallen and degraded 
the Sodomites were in some respects, their hearts 
and consciences were less seared than those who refused 
God's Message.

"BROUGHT DOWN TO HELL" 

--MATT. 1120-30.-SEPTEMBER 15.- 

Text "Come unto Me, all that labor and are 
heavy laden, and I will give you rest."— V. 28. 

TODAY'S STUDY links well with the closing 

of our lesson of a week ago. We there 

heard Jesus say that it would be more 

tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah, in the 

Great Judgment Day of a thousand years, 

in which He will reign and give the world 

a full knowledge of God and a full opportunity 

of returning to Him— more tolerable 

for the Sodomites than for some who have 

enjoyed greater privileges and rejected 

them. 

Today's study tells of how our Lord upbraided the 
city where most of His mighty works had been done, 
because they repented not, because they did not note the 
power of God in their midst and gladly receive the Message, 
the indications of Divine favor. Such, Jesus declared, 
will be less prepared to appreciate the Kingdom 
in the future than will some who have never known Him. 
Tyre and Sidon, heathen cities, would have repented with 
far less preaching. It is but in harmony with Divine 
justice, therefore, that when the Great Day of God's 
favor and of the Messianic Kingdom shall dawn, the 
people of Tyre and Sidon shall have things still more 
favorable than the people of Chorazin and Bethsaida. 

Capernaum, above all the other cities of Palestine, 
was favored, because there our Lord did most of His 
miracles, and uttered more of His wonderful words of 
life than anywhere else. In this sense of the word Jesus 
declared that Capernaum had been exalted up to heaven 
—highly lifted up in point of privilege and Divine favor 
and blessing. This being true, it meant that in justice 
Capernaum's fall would be proportionate. She would fall 
from the heights of heavenly privilege and favor down 
to hell— to the grave. 

And so today we find it difficult to locate that once 
great and beautiful city, so thoroughly has it been obliterated, 
brought down to the dust. Hearken further to 
the reason for this denouncement "If the mighty works 
which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom, 
it would have remained unto this day; but I say unto you, 
It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the 
Day of Judgment than for thee." 

Let us not mistake the lesson While only those who 
fully accept Christ and consecrate their lives to His 
service will receive the spirit-begetting, or any share in 
the Heavenly Kingdom, all the remainder of mankind 
who come to any knowledge of the Lord and His mercy 



and blessing, and who refrain from rendering homage 

and from striving to walk in God's way, will proportionately 

disadvantage themselves in respect to the future 

life and the great blessings and privileges and opportunities 

to be brought to all mankind through Messiah's 

Kingdom and its reign of a thousand years. 

"I THANK THEE, O FATHER" 

It was in Jesus' day as it has ever since been, that 
not many of the great or rich or wise or learned had ears 
to hear the Gospel Message. The difficulty with this 
class is that the things of the present life so fill and satisfy 
that they have no hungering for the better things. They 
have their consolation now, they have their pleasures 
now; they say, Soul, take thine ease now, look out for 
number one, and do not feel too much interest in or concern 
for other people and their troubles; there are millions 
of poor, groaning fellow-creatures, and if you stop 
to sympathize with them you will mar your own pleasure. 

Thus it has been that the majority of the followers of 
Jesus in every Age have been chiefly the poor of this 
world, rich in faith. There are two ways of viewing 
this matter. On the one hand we can rejoice with the 
poor and less influential who have received the Gospel 
Message, that doubtless their poverty, etc., were favorable 
factors to their advantage. And, similarly, we can 
sympathize with the great and rich and learned, that 
their earthly blessings are blinding them to the still 
greater opportunities of this Age, so that not many of 
them will be of the Kingdom class— not many of them 
members of the Bride company, joint-heirs with Jesus in 
His Messianic Kingdom. 

But hearken again to the words of Jesus— how peculiarly 
they read "I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of 
heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things 
from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto 
babes; even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Thy 

R5075 page 249 

sight." How strangely those words once sounded to us, 
when we supposed that all who failed to receive the Message 
of Jesus, all who failed to make their "calling and 
election sure" to membership in the Bride class— all such 
would suffer some kind of an eternal torture! 

How strange it seemed that Jesus should thank the 
Father that these things were hidden from some of the 
grandest and noblest and most brilliant of our race! We 
could not understand. But now, how clear! how plain! 
Jesus was preaching the Kingdom, and all who rejected 
His preaching rejected the Kingdom, and will lose it. 
This does not mean that they may not receive ultimately 
a blessing under that Kingdom, when it shall rule the 
world, and when all that are in their graves shall come 
forth to receive those very blessings which Jesus died to 



procure for them— the blessings of a trial, or judgment 
of a thousand years, to determine whether they will be 
accounted worthy of everlasting life, or of everlasting 
death, destruction. 

Now we see what Jesus intimated, namely, that there 
is a wisdom in God's course in this matter which is not 
apparent on the surface. Had those rich and great seen 
fully, distinctly, clearly the true situation, it would have 
increased their responsibility; their condemnation in not 
receiving and accepting Christ would have been greater. 
Besides, some of them, of strong character and determination, 
might have been impelled thereby to take a course of 
still more violent opposition than they did take; or, if 
they had known and seen the Truth, it would have made 
them either opposers or defenders of it. If they had 
defended Christ, then He would not have been crucified, 
and the Divine Plan would not have been carried out; or, 
if they had intelligently permitted His crucifixion, they 
would have had a tenfold condemnation. St. Peter declares 
that the extenuating circumstance connected with 
our Lord's crucifixion was ignorance. He declared, speaking 
by inspiration at Pentecost, "If they had known, they 
would not have crucified the Prince of Life." 

FEW KNOW THE FATHER OR THE SON 

All men are to be brought to a knowledge of God. 
The Scriptures declare, "The knowledge of the glory of 
God shall fill the whole earth." Jesus declared that no 
one can know the Father except as first they come to 
know the Son, or as the Son reveals the Father to him. 
Hence those who have failed to recognize Jesus as the 
Son of God have not yet come to the full appreciation of 
their privileges. Blessed are our eyes, that now they 
see, and our ears that now they hear, that we may know 
Messiah, and through Him know the Father; and Jesus 
may come in to us and sup with us, and we with Him.— 
Rev. 320. 

We are glad that all mankind in due time will be 
brought to a clear knowledge and full opportunity. But 
oh, how much greater is our blessing, besides the privilege 
of now being the sons of God, and joint-heirs in his glorious 
Kingdom! We may well rejoice with the Lord in 
His thanks to the Father, not only that some cannot hear, 
see, or understand, but also that some of us can hear, 
see and understand the Divine Message now, and thus 
share its blessing. 

The special call of God through Jesus, therefore, is 
to the poor, the broken-hearted, the heavy laden, the unsatisfied 
"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy 
laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you 
and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly of heart, and 
ye shall find rest unto your souls, for My yoke is easy and 
My burden is light." 



R5078 page 249 

SCRIPTURAL USAGE OF THE TERM SALVATION 

HIGHER CRITICS and Evolutionists have 

much trouble in their endeavor to hide from 

the common people the fact that their 

theories are diametrically opposed to all 

the teachings of the Scripture respecting 

human salvation. These latter-day philosophers 

do not like to be called "infidels," 

"unbelievers," but prefer to take their texts 

from the Bible in their weekly endeavor 

to undermine faith. If Evolution theories 

were true, the word "salvation" would be wholly inappropriate. 

If mankind have been climbing upward for six 

thousand years, out of monkeyhood into perfect manhood, 

and if they are gradually to become angels by processes 

of evolution, then the word "salvation" is altogether out 

of place when applied to them. They should rather be 

let alone in their glorious upward progress. They would 

need no Savior, or Redeemer; for according to this 

theory, mankind never was lost— never fell from perfection. 

But the Bible proposition is the very reverse of the 
Evolution theory. The Scripture teaches that man was 
created perfect and holy, in the moral likeness of His 
Maker. It declares that when on trial to determine 
whether or not his life and favors might be continued to 
him everlastingly, Adam sinned and was sentenced to 
death. It tells that through Jesus, God has made a provision 
for the recovery of mankind out of the sin and 
death condition into which he fell; that the work of Jesus 
primarily is that of the satisfaction of Justice; that He 
died, the Just for the unjust, and that sinners are to be 
reconciled to God through the death of His Son. The 
Bible teaches that this redemptive process, this salvation 
of mankind from sin and death, has already begun in 
that Christ has already given His life a Ransom-price, 
and has been exalted and declared to be the Savior, the 
Life-giver of the world. 

But the world has not yet been saved. It lies in the 
Wicked One. Satan is still the "Prince of this world." 
Sin and death reign. The world has only the Divine 
promise which was given to Abraham, but of which the 
majority of mankind do not even know. That promise, 
however, is sure— that eventually all the families of the 
earth shall be blessed by Messiah; and that to effect this 
salvation Messiah in due time will set up a glorious reign 
of righteousness, the Kingdom of God under the whole 
heavens. It shall rule; it shall conquer; it shall destroy 
sin, death and everything opposed to Divine righteousness 
and to the best interests of mankind. Thus eventually the 
knowledge of the Lord shall be made to fill the whole 
earth (Isa. 1 19), and every knee shall bow and every 
tongue confess the Lord. (Isa. 4523.) Thus shall come 



the glorious opportunity for salvation through the knowledge 
of the Lord, and of His will— Jer. 3134. 

Those who desire to do God's will shall be assisted by 
the Redeemer, thus to cultivate a righteous character. 
That assistance will include an uplifting out of, or saving 
from, sin and death and all the terrible associations of 
mental, moral and physical imperfection. That salvation 
will be to life, health and strength— mental, moral and 
physical. The earth also shall be saved— recovered from 
the Divine sentence, or "curse." No longer will thorns 
and thistles cause sweat of face; but the earth shall yield 
her increase and be styled, "The garden of the Lord." 
(Zech. 812; Isa. 513.) The earth is God's footstool, 
which He will make glorious.— Isa. 6013. 

R5078 page 250 

But that salvation of man and of his earthly home and 
future dominion is preceded by another phase, or kind, of 
salvation. Before dealing with the world, God elects, calls, 
draws, instructs a saintly class. These by faith may now 
speak of themselves as saved, although their salvation 
will not really be accomplished until they share in the First 
Resurrection. Now they reckon themselves as passed from 
death unto life, as New Creatures, brethren of Christ, children 
of God. Into all this glorious condition the saintly 
ones will enter with their resurrection change, experiencing 
a transfer from human nature and conditions to 
spirit (heavenly) nature and conditions. 

Thus, eventually, there will be two classes of saved 
ones— two classes saved out of the sin and death conditions 
which now prevail 

(1) The Church changed from earthly to divine 
nature. -I Cor. 1551-54. 

(2) The willing and obedient of the world, who, during 
the thousand years of Messiah's glorious reign, will 

be gradually changed, not to a different nature, but from 
the imperfection to the perfection of human nature.— 
Acts 319-21. 

Meantime all the wilfully wicked, disobedient or rebellious 
will be utterly destroyed in the "Second Death," 
"as natural brute beasts."— 2 Pet. 212. 



R5078 page 250 

SOME INTERESTING QUESTIONS 
QUESTIONS RE THE REDEEMER 

Question (1).— At what period in Jesus' life was He 
a perfect man? 

Answer.— He was always perfect, but did not become 
the perfect man until the 30th year of His life. In the 
very beginning, "the beginning of the creation of God" 



(Rev. 314), He was sinless, perfect on the spirit plane- 
next to the Heavenly Father. When He humbled Himself, 
in harmony with the Divine Plan and in order that 
He might be man's Redeemer and Restorer, He still maintained 
His perfection, His sinlessness. When born of 
the virgin, He was still "Holy, harmless, undefiled and 
separate from sinners." He was the perfect babe. As 
He grew to manhood, His perfection was maintained— 
He was the perfect boy, the perfect youth and finally the 
perfect man. Thus we read, "Jesus increased in wisdom 
and stature and in favor with God and man." 

Question (2).— Was Jesus, at the time of attaining the 
perfection of manhood, possessed of everlasting life, or 
was it necessary for Him to be placed on trial as a perfect 
man before He would be accounted worthy of everlasting 
life? 

Answer.— According to the Divine Law, under which 
Jesus was born into the world, His perfection proved His 
worthiness of everlasting life, just as Adam's perfection 
meant everlasting life to him. But as Adam, who when 
created was in covenant relationship with God, by disobedience, 
by breaking the Covenant, lost the right to life 
which was His by that Divine Covenant, so Jesus, as a 
perfect man, was in covenant-relationship with God, and 
as a human being could have forfeited His right to life 
only by sin or, otherwise, have disposed of it by sacrifice 
—the latter of which He did. 

Question (3).— Was Jesus at the age of thirty years 
qualified to give Himself a Ransom-price for Adam and 
His race, or was it necessary that first He should have 
a personal trial, or testing, in respect to His loyalty to 
God before His sacrifice could be accepted as the Ransom-price 
for Adam and his race? 

Answer.— Jesus was at thirty years of age qualified 
and competent to present His body a "living sacrifice, 
holy, acceptable unto God," as man's Ransom-price— and 
this He did. God accepted the offering and sacrifice and 
signified His acceptance of it by the anointing of the 
Holy Spirit, by which He begat Jesus again, this time to 
the divine nature as a reward for the obedient sacrifice 
of that which He had consecrated unto death. 

Nevertheless, the necessity for a testing of One who 
would become man's substitute was not overlooked in the 
Divine arrangement. Two tests, or trials, proceeded at 
the same time, and both were necessary. As a man He 
must prove loyal to the principles of righteousness represented 
in the Divine Law, otherwise He could not be 
a suitable substitute or Ransomer for Adam and his 
family. On His own account, to prove Himself worthy 
of the divine nature, Jesus needed to have trials as a 
New Creature. His begetting of the Holy Spirit could 
reach the fruition of the divine nature only by His faithfully 
carrying out His covenant of sacrifice. Hence, if 
He had failed to perform the sacrifice as He covenanted, 
He would have failed entirely, and would not have received 
the great reward of Divine glory, honor and immortality 



which came to Him in His resurrection. 

As St. Paul declares, "Wherefore, God also hath 
highly exalted Him, and given Him a name which is 
above every name." (Phil. 29.) The entire test of our 
Lord Jesus was along the lines of His faithfully sacrificing 
Himself, in the doing of the Father's will— in submitting 
to all things "written in the Book"— in the 
prophecies and in the types of the Law. Had He failed 
to keep His covenant of sacrifice, not only would He have 
failed to gain the exaltation to the divine nature, but He 
would have lost everything— even life itself. 

But the keeping of His covenant of sacrifice, obligatory 
upon our Lord as a New Creature, meant also that He 
kept the Law, obligatory upon Him as a human being because 
the things required of Him under His covenant 
were in harmony with the Law. To keep His covenant 
meant that He should keep the Law, and much more than 
that— to sacrifice His rights and interests which the Law 
did not demand should be sacrificed. 

Question (4).— If Jesus had kept the Law blamelessly, 
yet had failed in some feature of His covenant of sacrifice, 
what would have been the status of human redemption? 
Would the Ransom-price of humanity have been 
paid by Jesus' keeping the Law perfectly, even though 
He had failed in obedience to His covenant of sacrifice, 
and thus failed to attain to glory, honor and immortality— 
the divine plane? If not, why not? 

Answer.— Under the circumstances mentioned in the 
above question, the entire matter of redemption would 
have failed, so far as Jesus was concerned. His death 
would not have ransomed man from the death penalty. 
Indeed, the question pre-supposes an entirely wrong view 
of the Ransom. Jesus' death was a Ransom-sacrifice. 
That is to say it was a sacrificial death intended to effect 
the ransom of Adam and all lost through his disobedience. 
But a Ransom-sacrifice is one thing, and the payment of 
the Ransom-price is quite another thing. For instance 
Jesus did His work perfectly; it had the Divine approval; 
the Ransom-price was laid down and was satisfactory to 
the Father, and Jesus has been rewarded for His loyalty 
and obedience manifested in that Ransom-sacrifice; but 
the value of that sacrifice, quite sufficient to be the off-set, 
or satisfaction, for the sins of the whole world, has not 
yet been applied. 

R5079 page 251 

The merit of that sacrifice is in the hands of Divine 
Justice, subject to application for the sins of the whole 
world as soon as God's time shall have arrived. But that 
time has not yet quite arrived, and the world is still not 
redeemed, even in a judicial sense. Hence we read, "The 
whole world lieth in wickedness" and are all "children of 
wrath." (I John 519; Eph. 23.) If the Ransom-price 
had been applied and accepted, the world would not lie 
in the hands of the Wicked One, and would no longer 



be "children of wrath." 

Before the merit of Jesus' sacrifice can be applied as 
a Ransom-price for the world's sins— to secure the world's 
release from Divine condemnation, and the turning over 
of the world to Jesus and the establishment of His Kingdom 
for its blessing— before all these things, or any of 
them, can take place, another matter must, according to 
the Divine Program, be attended to. That other matter 
is the calling and acceptance and begettal to the divine 
nature of an elect "Church of the First-Borns, which are 
written in Heaven." (Heb. 1223.) This is the work 
which has been in progress for nearly nineteen centuries. 
As soon as it shall have been completed the glorious 
Redeemer with His exalted Bride class will inaugurate 
His glorious reign of a thousand years, by binding Satan 
and ushering in the New Dispensation, for which the 
whole groaning creation has so long waited.— 
Rom. 822,19. 

Thus it will be seen that our Lord's testing, which began 
at Jordan at the time of His consecration and which 
ended at Calvary, was two-fold, and the two trials progressed 
simultaneously, and to have failed in either particular 
would have lost all. As a man from the human 
standpoint, born under the Law, He was obligated to keep 
the Law in every particular. To have failed would have 
been death. As a New Creature, who had entered into 
a covenant of sacrifice, our Lord was obligated to sacrifice 
willingly and obediently, His life, His rights, everything 
that He possessed, in harmony with the overrulings 
of Divine providence. "The cup which My Father hath 
given Me, shall I not drink it?" (John 1811.) To have 
failed of the full, complete sacrifice would have cost Him 
everything, and He would have accomplished nothing by 
all of His previous experiences and loyalty. 

Our Lord's faithfulness in sacrificing during the three 
and a half years of His ministry added nothing whatever 
to the perfection which He had at Jordan. He was perfect 
and an acceptable sacrifice to begin with, and He 
merely maintained that perfection and that acceptance 
with the Father "faithful unto death." Wherefore He 
has attained His present exaltation and is in readiness to 
be the world's merciful and faithful High Priest, and He 
has also the merit of His sacrifice in the hands of Justice 
ready at the appropriate time in the end of this Age to 
be applied for the cancelation of the sins of the whole 
world. 

The Church shares in the benefits of our Lord's death 
in a different way from that of the world. She has her 
Redeemer's merit imputed to her by (because of) faith— 
to cover the weaknesses and blemishes of her flesh, so 
that her flesh may be presented holy and acceptable to the 
Father by the Redeemer, who imputes the merit of His 
sacrifice to it and makes it acceptable as a part of His 
own sacrifice. "For if we suffer [with Him] we shall 
also reign with Him"; "If so be that we suffer with Him, 
that we may be also glorified together"; "Present your 



bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, your 
reasonable service"; "Fill up that which is behind of the 
afflictions of Christ." (2 Tim. 212; Rom. 817; 121; 
Col. 124.) These are some of the invitations offered to 
the Church who are now qualifying to be members of 
the Royal Priesthood in the great work of blessing and 
uplifting mankind as God has foreordained and promised. 



AN INTERPOLATED TEXT 

Question.— Kindly explain Rev. 205 "But the rest 
of the dead lived not again until the thousand years 
were finished." 

Answer.— Scholars are agreed that this text is an 
interpolation. We must remember, however, that it is one 
thing to be legally, or officially dead, and another thing to 
be actually dead. But as Jesus said to some, He recognized 
as alive only those who accepted Him. Those who 
had not the Son had not life in any sense or degree; those 
who have the Son, have the beginning of life reckoned to 
them. The world, however, during the thousand years 
will have the opportunity, not only of being awakened, but 
of having fulness of life. If, therefore, after they are 
awakened, they will go on and render obedience to the 
laws of the Kingdom, they will be lifted up, up, up out 
of death to perfection and life. 



BIBLE QUESTIONS A MINISTER'S GREATEST TROUBLES 

Question.— If the Bible has been misinterpreted on 
many vital points, how are we to understand the Bible, if 
we are not educated enough to know these things? 

Answer.— Ministers are less able to interpret the Bible 
than any other class of people in the world. The Theological 
Seminaries do not teach Bible interpretation, 
but instruct the student how to defend the various creeds, 
and how to choke off investigation, and to make the investigator 
feel foolish. Nothing troubles a minister more 
than Bible questions. 

Our advice to those who want to know the Truth 
is to search the Scriptures and use Concordances and 
every Bible help that will assist them in a proper and 
rational understanding of the Scriptures. But be sure 
that the subject is approached honestly and prayerfully, 
with a desire to know the Truth and without sectarian 
prejudices. Remember the words of the Master, "Sanctify 
them through Thy Truth; Thy Word is Truth." 



THE GREAT TEACHER EXPOSED SADDUCEES' IGNORANCE 



Question.— "Whose wife shall she be in the resurrection," 
who had several husbands? 

Answer.— The Sadducees, the agnostics who did not 
believe in the resurrection, tried to entrap the great 
Teacher by asking one of their stock questions. Seven 
different brothers in turn married the same woman and 
all died before she did. "To which of them shall she be 
wife in the resurrection?" They did not ask, "To which of 
these will she be wife in heaven or purgatory or eternal 
torture?" for neither Jesus nor the Jews held any such 
teaching. The Pharisees and Jesus taught the resurrection 
of the dead; and it was against this teaching that 
the Sadducees aimed their sarcastic question. 

Note the majesty of the Master's answer "Ye do err, 
not knowing the Scriptures, neither the power of God!" 
(Matt. 2223-33.) You do not understand the Scripture 
teaching respecting such questions, and you ignore in 
your question the great Divine power which, at the resurrection 
time, will be exercised to straighten out all the 
difficulties of the situation. Then the great Teacher 
proceeded to inform them that such as would (gradually) 
attain to the resurrection— such as would get a complete 
raising up out of sin and death, would "neither marry nor 
be given in marriage," but would be sexless, as are the 
angels. Thus the supposedly unanswerable question of the 
Sadducees fell flat, and their ignorance was exposed.

Many of the Classes find these questions very helpful. The difficulty 
with many Classes in the past has been that not every one has the 
teaching ability to draw the information of the lessons from the Class. 
The successful class leader has little to say except as he sums up the 
answer to each question after it has been discussed by the Class; or, 
if the question be not understood by the Class, he may often render 
assistance by paraphrasing it and, if possible, simplifying it. 



Excellent as public preaching is we believe that the Lord's people 
learn more in Berean Classes than by listening to any sermon. Thought 
is stimulated, quickened.

THE MARK OF CRYSTALLIZATION OF CHARACTER 

"Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended; but this one 
thing I do, forgetting those things that are behind, and reaching 
forth unto those things which are before, I press toward 
the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in 
Christ Jesus. "--Phil. 313,14. 

IN THE EPISTLE to the Philippians, St. 
Paul expresses his full appreciation of his 
opportunity to gain a prize, something 
worthy of laying hold upon, of grasping 
fully, of getting possession of. What was 
that for which the great Apostle was striving 
and which he had not yet attained? 
He spoke of this thing as a prize, which 
he was pressing along to win. 

We may view "the mark for the prize 
of the high calling" from two standpoints, both of which 
are correct. From one standpoint, this mark is that of 
heart-likeness to God's dear Son, of perfection of intention, 
of love for righteousness, for God, for the brethren 
of Christ, and for the world, even our enemies. This 
degree of character-development should be attained as 
early as possible in our Christian experience, and should 
be such that, were we to die at any time after its attainment, 
God would count us worthy of a share in the First 
Resurrection. 

From the other standpoint, this "mark for the prize of 
the high calling" is that of crystallization of character 
in the likeness of our Lord. After having attained a 
heart-likeness to Christ, we must hold it fast, and see 
that in all the testings which the Lord permits to come 
upon us, we are counted by Him as overcomers, not in 
our own strength, but in that of our Redeemer. This 



mark of crystallized character is not attained so early in 

our Christian experience as is the mark of character-development. 

But by fighting the good fight until the 

end of our course, we crystallize our characters in love 

for the principles of righteousness, for God, for the 

brethren and even for our enemies. If thus faithful, 

we shall win the prize of glory, honor and immortality. 

PERFECTION, NOT CONSECRATION, THE MARK 

There is no reason to think that our consecration is 
the mark; for our testing, our proving comes after our 
consecration, and not before it. No one would be at the 
mark merely because he is consecrated, but because he 
had endured the testing, thus proving that his consecration 
was from the heart and that he was sincere in the 
devotion of his every power to the service of God. We 
cannot suppose that the mark is reached the next moment 
after consecration. Some degree of character-development 
must be possessed; there must be some mark of 
character, in order that God may count that person 
worthy of everlasting life. 

God's standard of character is perfection, which must 
be manifested by loyalty and obedience under whatever 
tests He permits to come to individuals upon any plane 
of life. No one will get the prize of everlasting life 
unless he successfully passes those tests. We realize that 
the Church has been under trial throughout the Gospel 
Age, as to her worthiness to obtain "glory, honor and 
immortality"-- joint-heirship with her Lord.— Rom. 817. 

From the Scriptures we learn that throughout the 
Messianic Age the world will be tried by The Christ, 
and that even after passing that test they will not receive 
the reward of everlasting life until God shall have 
proved them at the end of Christ's reign by loosing 
Satan for a "little season." (I Cor. 1524; Rev. 207-10.) 
The fact that the world is thus to be tried by both The 
Christ and God confirms the thought that God has a 
standard, or mark, of character to be attained by all 
those who are loyal and obedient to Him— on any plane 
of existence. 

While this mark of character to be attained by the 
world during Messiah's reign is not the one to which St. 
Paul refers in our text, nevertheless there is such a 
character-mark to be reached by mankind. Those who 
then attain the mark will have everlasting life on the 
human plane. But those who attain the mark to which 
the Apostle refers will be given eternal life on the 
divine plane. 

THE MARK OF CHARACTER-CRYSTALLIZATION 

The Apostle was a noble example of one who had 
reached the mark. So far as we know, he was ready to 
die at any time; hence it was not this mark of character-development 
to which he had not attained. He had not 



yet attained to the prize itself, and could not do so until 
his change should come. He was constantly pressing 
along, trusting that God would give him all the things 
that are in reservation for "them that love him." (I Cor. 29.) 
We could not think the Apostle to mean that he 
would reach this mark of character-development just at 
the moment before death. This would be an absurdity of 
thought. 

Our Lord Jesus was at the mark of perfect character 
at the time of His consecration; and He maintained 
Himself at the mark. As a sacrifice He would have 

R5080 page 256 

been acceptable at any time. It was His part to consecrate 
His life and not to hold it back. It was the Father's 
part so to arrange matters that the Jews might not take 
our Lord until the Father's hour for Him had come. In 
everything that He did He submitted Himself to the 
Father's will. Our Lord spoke of His "cup" as the one 
which the Father had prepared for Him.— John 1811. 

If our Lord had determined for Himself the time and 
the manner of His death, then He was pouring the cup. 
If the Jews had determined these points, then they were 
pouring the cup. But neither our Lord nor the Jews did 
so, for both time and manner were foretold by the 
Prophets. Our Lord took the cup and accepted it as the 
Father's providence for Him. If the Father's providence 
had led to His death a year sooner or two years 
sooner, if the Father's will had been expressed in our 
Lord's crucifixion at an earlier time, even then it would 
have been well with Him. But He "learned obedience 
by the things which He suffered."— Heb. 58; 210. 

At Jordan our Lord was shown to be perfect and to 
have made a perfect consecration, both by the descent of 
the Holy Spirit and by the voice of Jehovah. (Matt. 316,17.) 
He had also a perfect body— though it was earthly 
—in which the New Creature operated. But His 
obedience must be tested— His loyalty even unto death. 
Whatever the degree of testing to which our Lord might 
have been subjected, it was just the right amount, according 
to the Father's wisdom. Our Lord would have been 
just as much an overcomer had He died at any time 
after His consecration. But if He had died sooner than 
He did, it would merely have proved that the Father did 
not require as much evidence of our Lord's faithfulness 
and loyalty as He did require. 

OUR LORD AN OVERCOMER AT CONSECRATION 

Here some one may ask, "Is it proper to say that our 
Lord was an overcomer as a New Creature at the time 
when He made His consecration?" 

Our answer is, Yes. An overcomer is a victor. The 
word does not imply that a man has completed the victory, 
however; for we sometimes say, He will lead them 



from victory to victory. So with our Lord. He continued 
faithful as an overcomer down unto death; but 
He was not counted as an overcomer unto death. Between 
the Father and our Lord as a human being there 
was no Mediator, and as a New Creature there was 
neither Robe to cover nor Advocate to represent in case 
of any deviation from the will of God; and the slightest 
deflection therefrom would have meant the Second Death. 

The Scriptures give us two pictures of our Lord as 
an overcomer at His consecration, where He gained the 
first great victory over His flesh. The first of these pictures 
(Lev. 1611), the killing of the bullock on the Day 
of Atonement, represents the death of our Lord's humanity 
at the moment when He consecrated Himself at Jordan. 
There He gained a victory and continued victorious 
until the end of His course. 

The second picture is found in Rev. 52-7. Here 
our Lord is represented by a newly slain lamb. He was 
not this newly slain lamb at His death when He had finished 
His course, but at His consecration, when He began 
His course. The proclamation which the Revelator 
heard was, "Who is worthy to open the Book, and to 
loose the seals thereof?" We read that John wept 
much. "And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not 
behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, 
hath prevailed to open the Book and to loose the seven 
seals thereof... And He came and took the Book out 
of the right hand of Him that sat upon the Throne." 
Our Lord alone was worthy of the honor of receiving 
the Divine Plan into His care. We also read that John 
looked and saw the newly slain Lamb open the Book.— 
Rev. 6. 

After our Lord had entered upon His consecration 
He was the newly slain Lamb. Then the Father gave 
into His hand the scroll of the great Divine Plan of the 
Ages— the scroll written on both inside and outside. The 
outside He was already able to read. But the inside, 
which contained information on spiritual things, remained 
sealed. 

As soon as our Lord came up out of the water after 
His baptism, He was begotten of the Holy Spirit and 
began to understand spiritual things. "The heavens 
[higher things] were opened unto Him." The time 
when He began to be considered the slain Lamb, the 
time when the scroll was delivered to Him, was the time 
of His consecration. 

R5081 page 256 

SUBMISSION THE FIRST REQUISITE-PATIENT ENDURANCE 
THE SECOND 

A good illustration of the process of character-development 
and crystallization is afforded by the work of a 
potter. First, he must select the right kind of clay, for 
some clays would produce very coarse ware, others would 



crack or warp in the drying, and still others would not 
stand the intense heat. Having selected the proper clay 
the potter subjects it to very many processes of grinding, 
mixing and wetting until it comes from the mill a soft, 
plastic mass of the consistency of tough dough, ready 
for the potter's use. Then comes the moulding into the 
article desired. The dish is formed, or shaped, with 
care and dried. Next it is placed in the kiln and fired 
with an intense heat for two or three days and nights. 
Then it requires a long time to cool before it can be removed 
from the kiln. But even then it is only a porous, 
leaky vessel, altogether unfit for use until it has been 
dipped into a liquid glaze, or slip, which it readily 
absorbs. 

Again it is subjected to the heat of the glaze kiln, 
which not only melts the glaze, but converts it into a perfectly 
transparent glaze all over the surface, making the 
article beautifully smooth and comely. But if the vessel 
is of very choice porcelain, to be made still more attractive 
to the eye by decorations, the ornamentation and 
gilding must be done at this stage, and the vessel must 
again be placed in the kiln for a third firing. Some vessels 
which have stood all the other tests, fail at this 
point and are cast into the waste heap. But if the vessel 
passes successfully the last test, it is ready for the 
service for which it was designed. 

So in our Lord's case. Not only was He perfect as a 
man, but His own will was in complete subjection to the 
Father's will. When trials came, there was no swerving, 
no twisting, no bending. He was of the proper material. 
His heart (applying this word to the mind) was of the 
proper character. So must it be with us. Those who 
will be accepted and found worthy of the great reward 
will be of His character-likeness in this respect; they 
will be loyal to God's will. Not only will they endeavor 
both to ascertain and to do the Father's will, but they 
will be in heart submission to that will in every degree. 
The "cup" they will be required to drink is the same that 
our Lord drank— and "all of it!" 

To follow in His steps, we must first reach this mark 
of character-development; and having done all, we must 
stand there. It is well to repeat the thought that it will 
not do for us to think that one reaches the mark of 
proper character-development just at the moment of 

R5081 page 257 

death. Character should be attained as soon as possible. 
But having reached this character-development called the 
"mark," it is for us to stand faithful, and not be thrust 
away from it by the opposition of the world, the flesh and 
the Devil. All such opposition must be endured before 
we can win the prize. Some of the noblest characters, 
who have been in an acceptable condition, and used of the 
Lord, did not get to the mark until they had passed 
through certain severe experiences. 



"WE HAVE THE MIND OF CHRIST" 

The thought of the Apostle seems to be, Here is a certain 
line of conduct and character-development which 
God has marked out; and it is the same for all who are 
in the race. The life of Christ is the rule. If we 
would attain the mark, obtain the prize, we must follow 
this line, or rule, or mark. 

The Apostle Paul had but one mind or will. "This 
one thing I do," he said. He was not a double-minded 
man, at one time thinking he would like to serve the 
Lord, at another time himself, and then again the Adversary, 
etc. He had accepted the Divine proposition to 
give all his talents to the service of the Lord. He had 
before his mind the great promise that God had made. 
For him there was but one thing in life. 

The Scriptures tell us that during the Gospel Age God 
has sent out a special call, or invitation, and that those 
who have accepted that call have "exceeding great and 
precious promises" of wonderful things to look forward 
to. All who accept the call should practically forget all 
the trifling things of life in order to attain these promises. 
There is but one way to win the prize— by manifesting 
to God faithfulness, obedience and loyalty. 
Character, not talent, makes us acceptable. God could 
give any one intellectual powers as good as ours or better. 
He will not grant any one a place in the Kingdom 
on account of physical strength or endurance. He will 
not admit any one to the Kingdom because of worldly 
prosperity or honor of men, or because of riches. 

CONDITIONS REQUIRED IN THE RACE 

What then is God seeking? To what has He called 
us? The Apostle Peter says that God has "called us to 
glory and virtue." (2 Peter 13.) Certain conditions 
God requires of those who will run in the race. He requires 
that none be proud, but that they possess humility. 
And He will have no one in the Kingdom of His Elect 
who is weak, vacillating, so far as his mind is concerned. 
He may not have a strong intellect; but he must manifest 
to God that he has a strong will and firm determination, 
and that he has cut off everything in life in order to win 
the prize. He must also demonstrate his loyalty to God. 
He must not merely seek glory, but he must recognize and 
appreciate his responsibilities to God. 

Loyalty is one of the great tests of character- 
loyalty to God, to His Word, loyalty to principle. Whatever 
follows, the Christian must be submissive to God, 
trustful and faithful. To such alone could we expect 
God to give the great blessings promised to overcomers. 
Hence we see that the Apostle was quite right in giving 
up all that he might serve God, that he might please the 
Father, and thus attain to this glorious reward of joint-heirship 
with His Son. 



"EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVETH" 

Not necessarily all who make a consecration, but all 
whose consecration God accepts, all whom He begets of 
His Holy Spirit to become New Creatures, will have the 
opportunity of reaching this mark of crystallization of 
character before they die. These will have full testing— 
"Every son whom He receiveth." (Heb. 126.) This 
promise guarantees that they shall have trials and difficulties 
to develop them in the proper character-likeness 
of our Lord; and that none of their experiences will be 
cut short of this attainment. God will see to it that they 
have the full opportunity to develop character-likeness 
to Christ. Those who turn to sin wilfully, deliberately, 
will fall into the Second Death. Others may fall from 
the priestly class into the Great Company. But even 
these must have sufficient time to manifest their loyalty 
to God. 

At the time of His consecration, our Lord was at the 
mark by virtue of His perfection. We are not at the 
mark at the time of our consecration; for we are imperfect. 
But we wish to do the Lord's will; and we have 
given ourselves to ascertain what that will is in order 
that we may render intelligent obedience thereto. In our 
Lord's case He had no such imperfection to overcome as 
we have. At the time of His consecration He loved His 
neighbor as Himself, and He loved God with all His 
heart. 

When we consecrate ourselves, we agree to do this; 
but we do not know what it means; just as St. Peter 
"wist not" what he said at the time of the transfiguration 
in the Mount "Lord, it is good for us to be here. 
If Thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for 
Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias." (Matt. 174.) 
Neither did the two Apostles know what they 
were asking when they requested Jesus that they might 
sit the one on His right and the other on His left hand 
in the Kingdom. Our Lord said to them, "Ye know not 
what ye ask. "-Matt 2022. 

Since at the time of our consecration we do not fully 
understand what we do, therefore we do a great deal of 
running to reach the mark. This our Lord had no need 
to do; for He was perfect. At consecration He was at 
the mark of perfect character, so that had He died at any 
subsequent time He would have received the reward of 
the Father, who said, "This is My Beloved Son, in whom 
I am well pleased." (Matt. 317.) At His baptism our 
Lord was at that mark of character which merited the 
promised reward of the Father, and to which we must 
attain before we can secure everlasting life, either on the 
plane of glory or otherwise. 

Stephen, who was martyred very soon after Pentecost, 
must have lived habitually near to the Lord; for he, like 
Nathaniel, was an "Israelite indeed" in whom was no 
guile. The fact that the Truth of God came to such as 



these men means that so far as their heart attitude was 
concerned they had been very near to the Lord under 
the Law as their schoolmaster (Greek, pedagogue,) so 
that when brought to Christ they could quickly learn of 
Him. So it appears to be with us now. The differences 
in our natural education in right and wrong, in truth 
and error, are such that we cannot tell just how long it 
will take for each to attain to the character-likeness of 
our Lord and thus to prove worthy of eternal life. 

"PUT YE ON THE LORD CHRIST" 

We have suggested that the Lord's people, at the 
time of their consecration and begetting of the Holy 
Spirit, are not ready for the Kingdom, but require development, 
which time alone can accomplish. Notwithstanding 
this suggestion, is there not a sense in which 
God's people are regarded perfect at the time of their 
consecration— at the moment of their acceptance? Our 
answer is, Yes; they are counted so, but are not so 
actually. The flesh is reckoned perfect so that God can 
accept their offering. 

R5082 page 258 

But at this time the New Creature is merely a babe 
in Christ and has not yet attained to the stature of manhood. 
Therefore, the necessity exists for entering the 
School of Christ and for "putting on Christ," as the 
Apostle expresses it. We begin to put on Christ after 
consecration, and after our begetting of the Holy Spirit. 
The babe grows into a child, and the child into a man. 
(Eph. 414,13.) The work of growing up into Christ is 
necessary before the child of God would be fit for the 
Kingdom. The difference between a babe in Christ and 
one fit for the Kingdom is that the latter has been tried 
and tested and has proved himself to be an overcomer. 

When our Lord Jesus was at Jordan He was an overcomer. 
(Heb. 109.) He was perfect and had correspondingly 
a larger appreciation of what He did than we have 
respecting our course when we consecrate. But He tells 
us, "Fear not, little flock," "be of good cheer; I have 
overcome the world."— Luke 1232; John 1633. 

Yet even in our Lord's case, while He was an overcomer 
at the moment of His consecration, He really did 
not win the prize of the divine nature until the end of 
His race-course, until there had been demonstrated a sufficiency 
of worthiness for that high exaltation; and we 
know that the Father continued tests of obedience even 
unto the death on the cross. It was not until after this 
that our Lord was fully accepted as an overcomer, to 
whom it was granted to sit with the Father in His 
Throne. 

THE GREAT TEST IS TO REMAIN AT THE MARK 



The possession of perfection necessarily means that 
one is at the mark, as in the case of Adam. The test is, 
not whether one can reach the mark, but whether one 
will remain at the mark— "having done all, to stand." 
(Eph. 613.) When we reach the mark of character 
which God approves in every sense of the word, let us 
continue there. When our Lord came into the world He 
was perfect, loyal, at the mark— God's standard, perfection. 
Whether or not He would be moved away from 
the mark by the contradiction of sinners against Himself, 
was to be proved. But none of these tests led Him 
to abandon His determination to continue at the mark. 
So it should be with us— to the best of our ability. 

The Spirit of God is the same whether manifested in 
Himself or in angels or in men or in New Creatures. 
We do not find the Spirit of God manifest in the majority 
of men, because of sin. We would find the Spirit of 
God manifest in angels. We should find the Spirit of 
God very manifest in the saints, who should carry with 
them into the new relationship all that they have naturally 
of the character-likeness to the Lord. The graces 
of spirit exhibited in the Lord's people are properly to be 
considered fruits of the Holy Spirit; for their possessors 
have become New Creatures, have entered into the race 
for the prize of the high calling. Some saints might be 
able by reason of natural qualities to make more rapid 
progress than would others in developing and perfecting 
these fruits and graces of the Spirit. 

"RESPECT UNTO THE RECOMPENSE OF THE REWARD" 

Sometimes the question arises, Should not the Lord's 
people preferably strive for character-likeness to Christ, 
with no particular desire as to what the Lord's reward 
will be? We answer, No. We should have "respect 
unto the recompense of the reward." In order to have 
the proper respect for the reward which God promises, 
it is necessary that we hold it up before us continually, 
and that we never lose sight of the prize. 

Our Lord Jesus does not deprecate this looking at the 
prize. Listen to His words "Father, glorify Thou Me 
with Thine Own Self, with the glory which I had with 
Thee before the world was." (John 175.) Thus He 
prayed to the Father for the reward which the manifestation 
of His obedience would bring. So it should be 
with us; not that we have a right to insist that our efforts 
be rewarded, but that we should think of the blessing 
which God has promised those who love Him, as 
"exceeding great and precious." Many in the nominal 
church do not see these things. 

Let us keep the goal distinctly before our eyes. 
Doubtless the Lord meant the knowledge of the prize to 
serve as a stimulus for our upbuilding and strengthening. 
We look for "glory, honor and immortality"; and it is 
right for us to seek for them. Any other attitude would 
be false modesty. If the thought that it is presumption 



for us to aspire to the high calling comes before our 
minds, let us remember that our Lord wants us to be so 
inspired by the "great and precious promises" that we 
will work for these things which He has set before us, 
and that it would be presumption for us to refuse what 
He offers to us. 

FREE MORAL AGENCY A FACTOR IN CHARACTER-DEVELOPMENT 

Character may be viewed from two different standpoints. 
When Adam was created, he was a man of great 
and good character— "crowned with glory and honor." 
He was perfect, the image of God. There is a difference, 
however, between a character thus given, and one that 
is developed and tested by the exercise of free will. Our 
Heavenly Father desires that His intelligent creatures 
exercise their wills. Therefore instead of giving 
Adam a part of His own character-likeness and eliminating 
that which we call moral choice, He chose to give 
Adam His character-likeness, including free moral 
agency. "So God created man in His own image." God 
foreknew the fall of man and all the circumstances connected 
with it. He knew that the permission of evil for 
a time would ultimately result in great blessings for all. 
He knew that the time would come when every creature 
in heaven and in earth would be obedient to Him, not 
only because there was no opportunity of doing otherwise, 
but from choice. 

Those who are appreciative of God's character should 
desire to have this character-likeness. Only such will 
merit everlasting life amongst either angels or men. God 
is testing along these lines the worthiness of those who 
are on trial for life eternal. Hence, "The Father seeketh 
such to worship Him" as "worship Him in spirit and 
in truth"— intelligently.— John 423,24. 

WE MUST "LOVE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HATE INIQUITY" 

In the formation of character, we see that the lessons 
which we learn in the School of Christ are very helpful 
to us. Originally, man was made in the image of God. 
Yet in us the image is blurred, indistinct. Those who 
learn the lessons now and appreciate them to the full will 
be given no further trial. Those who have not had a sufficiency 
of opportunity will have a full trial in the Age to 
come. Under the discipline, the chastenings and the rewards 
of that time, they will learn how much better is 
righteousness than sin, Truth than error. They will 
develop in the character-likeness of God, which Adam 
lost, and will see the exceeding sinfulness of sin. They 
will learn both to will and to do righteousness. All who 
fail to learn this lesson will be judged unworthy of 
eternal life. 

We see that the angels willed of themselves whether 

R5082 page 259 



they would be obedient, or be disobedient and enjoy the 

pleasures of sin for a season. All the holy angels, who 

are now in favor with God, are such as have had their 

testing and have come off victors. Their example will 

prove more and more a lesson to us as we come to understand 

it. As a result of this knowledge, we see in God 

the noblest sentiment that could actuate our Creator and 

Father in dealing with His creatures; and we are glad 

that we have chosen to do His will concerning us. 

Finally it is important that we should keep in mind the 
fact that since true love on our part will manifest itself 
in obedience, then disobedience is an evidence of a loss 
of love, as viewed from the Lord's standpoint, a deflection 
from loyalty, a failure to endure the tests. We must 
agree that the Lord's standpoint of judgment is a reasonable 
one. Should one ask, How would it be if we should 
disobey through ignorance? The answer is, that the 
Lord has made provision against our ignorance first, 
He has given us the Word of Truth, "that the man of 
God may be perfect [perfectly informed], thoroughly 
furnished unto all good works"; and second, He has 
promised to supply such helps to the spirit of holiness and 
the understanding of His Word, as will enable us to do 
what is pleasing in His sight.— 2 Tim. 317; 
John 1613,14. 

Love is the crown of all graces, "the fulfilling of the 
Law." Without a fervent, glowing love, it will be impossible 
to render obedience or to stand the tests for 
development and crystallization of character arranged for 
by Divine Love. Our Lord tells us that He was beloved 
of the Father; and the Father Himself declared, "This is 
My beloved Son." We can readily see why our Lord 
Jesus was greatly beloved, for He expressed and fully 
manifested the Father's love. But it astounds us to 
know that this same love is exercised by the Father 
toward us! "Behold what manner of love the Father 
hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons 
of God!" "The Father Himself loveth you"!— I John 31; 
John 1627. 

LOVING OBEDIENCE BRINGS JOY AND PEACE 

Let us, dearly beloved, be more than ever careful 
respecting the Word of the Lord; let us not by negligence 
give evidence of a decay of love. Our Lord points out 
that His continuance in the Father's love, as the well-beloved 
Son, with all which this implies, was because of 
His obedience to the Father's will; and that following 
the same line, He must require that we should be obedient 
to Him if we would abide in His love and share His 
Throne and glory.— John 1510. 

Our Lord's instructions and commandments are not 
intended to terrify us, nor to deprive us of happiness. 
On the contrary, "These things have I spoken unto you 
that My joy may be in you, and that your joy might be 



filled full." (John 1511.) Those who give surest evidence 
of living nearest the Lord well know that obedience 
to the Lord's words, together with the privilege thus obtained 
of abiding in Him and His love, is the greatest joy, 
a joy which wholly outweighs all the trifling pleasures 
which the world has to offer. It is the joy and peace 
which "passeth all understanding," which rules in the 
heart, and which brings with it the promise, the assurance, 
"not only of the life which now is, but also of that 
which is to come."— I Tim. 48. 



R5083 page 259 

THE WORLD CALLED TO REPENTANCE 

"God now commandeth men everywhere to repent because He 
hath appointed a day, in the which He will judge the world in 
righteousness by that Man whom He hath ordained."— Acts 1730,31. 

WHEN GOD sentenced Father Adam to death 
He very properly said nothing about repentance, 
for He offered Adam no hope of 
a future life. If, then, no hope of a future 
life was known to Adam or revealed to 
him, why should God deal with him at all? 
Adam was sentenced to death, to destruction. 
There is no basis upon which to command 
a man to repent unless something is 
offered him as a reward for repentance. 

God had put upon Adam the sentence of death, which 
could be removed only by the payment of a ransom-price. 
God fully intended that some day all mankind should have 
an opportunity of coming into harmony with Him and 
of having another trial, or judgment, for life; but it was 
not His due time to explain His program. Therefore, 
Adam lived and died without any command whatever to 
repent. And so did his children. 

The first intimation of what God might do was given 
by the Prophet Enoch. But the revelation made by Enoch 
was not a sufficient basis for offering hope to mankind 
nor for telling them to repent— Jude 14,15. 

A SUGGESTION OF HOPE FOR THE WORLD 

So years passed by until the time of Abraham. Then 
God told Abraham that He would reveal a secret to him, 
because Abraham was His friend. That secret was not 
a message to be preached, but to be believed by himself 
and by those who would be heirs of that promise, which 
was not yet applicable to any outside of Abraham's descendants. 
The secret was, "In thee and in thy Seed shall 
all the families of the earth be blessed." (Gen. 2814.) I 
intend to bless the world, Abraham. If you are obedient 
to My instructions, your Seed will get the blessing and 



transmit it to the world in general. It was only by implication, 
therefore, that Abraham had any suggestion that a 
life of repentance would be rewarded. 

In due time God called the children of Israel and 
dealt with them through Moses. Practically He said, 
"Do you wish to be My people? If so, come now, enter 
into a covenant with Me; I will be your God and you 
shall be My people."— Lev. 2612. 

Israel was not commanded to repent, nor were any 
of the rest of the world. It was an invitation, not a command. 
God was ready to make a covenant with them. 
That covenant was that they were to obey the Law, and 
that by their obedience to the Ten Commandments and 
the spirit of their covenant they would become God's 
people. But when they tried to keep the Law they found 
that they could not do so, because of inherited weakness. 
Hence there was nothing more to be said to them along 
that line. They had had their opportunity and they had 
failed. 

THE CALL TO REPENTANCE 

When Jesus came He kept the Law, and inherited all 
the promises of the Law Covenant. Then He offered a 
share of the Kingdom which God had promised to set 
up (Dan. 244), and blessing, honor and glory to as many 
of the Jews as would come into harmony with Him, as 
many as would walk in His steps of self-sacrifice and 
thus have God's favor. (John 112.) In substance He 

R5083 page 260 

said, "This is the way. Trust in Me and walk in My 
steps. Thus you shall be My disciples. You shall share 
in My sufferings now, and by and by in My glory and 
Kingdom." 

In due time, after a certain number had been gathered 
from the Jews, this message was extended to all the 
Gentiles who were in the right condition of heart. The 
Gentiles not having indicated their desire to come back 
into harmony with God as the Jewish nation had done, 
God then commanded them everywhere to repent. (Acts 1730.) 
This He did through those who were the representatives 
of His teaching, the Apostles and the Church. 
In proportion as they understood the Plan of God and 
were in harmony with it, they could tell their neighbors 
that a new condition had been established and that God 
would deal henceforth with the Gentiles. 

THE RANSOM THE BASIS OF HOPE FOR THE WORLD 

Why should God deal with the Gentiles now, when 
He had refused to deal with them before? The explanation 
of this new condition is that Christ had died, and 
God's great Plan had now matured enough to be made 
applicable to all men everywhere. God had appointed 



a day in which to judge the world in righteousness. (Acts 1730,31-) 

That great Day is the next Age, the Day of 

Christ, the Day of Messiah's Kingdom. God has made 

this provision for the redemption of all through the 

death of Christ. Mankind were all under the death sentence, 

and God could not deal with them until that sentence 

was lifted, or until provision was made for lifting 

it. He has not annulled the death sentence, but He has 

provided a Ransom for all. — I Tim. 26. 

Whoever knows of this Plan of redemption knows 
that God intends to give every individual of Adam's race 
an individual trial for life. That trial will not be merely 
to determine whether mankind will try to do right and 
battle against all the evil influences of the world, but 
God will subdue sin and uplift all of Adam's race who 
are desirous of being uplifted. 

God has declared that no member of Adam's race 
need die. Everyone who will may return to God through 
the great Atonement to be effected by the Redeemer. 
He has not completed this work yet, but to those who have 
an ear to hear, the word has gone out that there is to be 
a future trial, and that the manner of one's life now will 
have a bearing upon that trial. It is proper to tell this 
now, because the provision has been made through Christ's 
death. 

THE PRESENT MESSAGE TO THE WORLD 

Prior to the Gospel Age it was of no use to tell the 
people to come into harmony with God. But now the 
whole world is to be brought into a trial to help them 
and not to condemn them— a trial to see whether they 
are worthy to have the everlasting life that God will 
provide for them and assist the willing to attain. Wherever 
people are willing to hear, the message is, Repent! 
repent! Cease from sin, and this reformation of character 
will have an influence upon your everlasting life. 

If one is not of the Church class he is not on trial 
for life or death. But it will be to his advantage to live 
uprightly, for there is a time of reckoning coming. God 
has provided for this day of trial in the death of Christ. 
Beforehand, however, the Lord is selecting a Church 
class. The Lord is thus preparing a great class of missionaries 
who will do everything possible to assist men 
out of sin and degradation back to harmony with God. 

In times past God acted as though He did not notice 
when sin was committed— unless it was a grievous sin. 
Then He merely took the lives of the sinners under 
unpleasant conditions— they went to sleep. The Prophet 
Ezekiel says that God took all of the Sodomites away as 
He saw good. (Ezek. 1650.) After the Church's trial, 
or judgment, shall have been finished and the overcomers 
shall have been found worthy, then, in that time of the 
world's judgment, the Sodomites will have an opportunity 
as had the Jews who heard Jesus at the first advent. And 
it will be much more tolerable then for the people of Tyre 



and Sidon and Sodom and Gomorrah than it will be for 
the people of Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum, etc.; for 
the latter had had opportunities of knowledge, against 
which they had sinned; they therefore had more wilfulness 
in the matter than did the Sodomites.— See 
Matt. 1121-24. 

At that time God had sent no command to the Sodomites 
to repent. So God merely "winked at" (overlooked) 
the ignorance and sin of that time. (Acts 1730.) 
He neither threatened nor did anything else in the matter. 
He merely blotted the Sodomites out of existence. 
Their fate served as a foreshadowing, as the Apostle says, 
that God will not forever permit mankind to remain in 
sin, but that He will destroy the sinner. None shall be 
destroyed, however, until first he shall have had the 
opportunity for everlasting life, secured for every member 
of Adam's race, through our Lord Jesus Christ. 

JESUS' RESURRECTION THE ASSURANCE OF GOD'S FAVOR 

The Apostle recognizes the fact that the judgment had 
not begun in his day. He points forward to the Day of 
Christ and declares that God's assurance now set before 
the world of mankind is that there will be a future time 
of judgment. Through Christ's sacrificial death the opportunity 
for everlasting life will come to all. Mankind 
have already been condemned in Adam. They could not 
have another trial until the condemnation of the first 
trial was lifted. Therefore, not until God had provided 
a Redeemer would He command any to repent. The 
Apostle says that God's assurance to mankind in this 
matter is based upon the fact that He had raised Christ 
from the dead.— Acts 1731. 

When God had raised Jesus from the dead it became a 
testimony that His was a sacrificial death, an acceptable 
offering. And Jesus' ascension was a still further demonstration 
that this One whom the Father had raised from 
the dead by His own power, was to be the great King 
to rule, the great Priest to succor, assist and instruct, and 
the great Judge to direct and order the affairs of the world 
and to give proper rewards in the great Day of God. 

Whoever therefore hears about Jesus' death and resurrection 
should understand that this was God's redemption 
arrangement. They should also be informed that 
mankind are all sinners and that death is the penalty of 
sin. If any should ask, How does Jesus' death affect 
humanity? we show that God has highly exalted Him to 
be a Savior. In God's due time, as soon as the elect class 
shall have been completed and the reign of six thousand 
years of sin and evil shall have ended, then He will 
grant redemption from sin to all— to the Jew first and 
afterwards to the Gentile. 

As many as hear now should repent; but as many as 
do not hear in the present time are not commanded by 
God to repent. St. Paul's thought seems to be, Repent 
now and thus influence your future conditions, even if 



you do not wish to become a member of the Body of 
Christ. Thousands of millions of mankind have gone 
down into death. When they are awakened during the 
period of Messiah's reign, this will be the great message 
—"God has opened up a fountain for cleansing from sin 
and uncleanness. Whosoever will may partake of the 

R5084 page 261 

blessing and reconciliation with God and thereby attain 
everlasting life."— See Zech. 131; Rev. 2217. 

At present the god of this world hath blinded the 
world's eyes of understanding (2 Cor. 44), but soon 
their eyes will be opened. The time is coming when all 
shall see and hear, and when none, from the least to the 
greatest, will need to say, Know ye the Lord, for all 
shall know Him. Then when they know, each will be 
responsible. At the end of the Millennial Age when 
they shall have received their full blessing through the 
Mediator they will be required to do God's will on earth 
even as it is done in Heaven.— Jer. 3133,34. 

FUTURE LIFE INFLUENCED BY PRESENT CONDUCT 

It is a very important feature of our work to let our 
light so shine that men may see our good works and 
glorify our Father which is in heaven— not their Father, 
but our Father. (I Pet. 212.) The present time is not the 
world's, but the Church's visitation. God is seeking the 
people who are in a voluntary condition of righteousness. 
This is not the time for dealing with the world, but for 
God's people, as burning and shining lights, to reprove all 
sin. In proportion as the light shines out it will reprove 
darkness. 

If we speak at all about a future Age it is a special 
part of our duty to make clear to our hearers that the 
conduct of life at the present time will have a bearing 
on the future life. To say that there are two chances— 
a chance now and a chance by and by— is wholly wrong. 
We say to them that during this Gospel Age there is 
only one chance, and the only way to get that chance is 
to walk in the footsteps of Jesus. 

But for those who are by and by to be under the 
Mediatorial Kingdom it is proper to tell them that a life 
of obedience to God in harmony with the principles of 
righteousness will be a blessing to themselves in the present, 
and also in the future. There are a great many people 
who are living upright and honorable lives and who are 
doing a great deal of good in this present time. If they 
thought they were not doing good, they would be discouraged. 
An incentive to a high standard of life would be 
taken from them; for they believe that righteous living 
now has a bearing on the future. In this they are right. 
But their standard is not so high as that set forth in the 
Scriptures for the Church. That standard is necessarily 
high; for saints, and saints alone, are to be joint-heirs 



with Christ and members of the Bride class. 

A great mistake was made in the past when Brother 
Calvin declared that the non-elect were to be roasted to 
all eternity. On the contrary, we find the teaching of 
God's Word to be that the non-elect are to be blessed 
by the Elect with an opportunity for life on the earthly 
plane. God will use the elect class for the purpose of 
blessing the world of mankind. God has a loving, sympathetic 
Plan for all of His creatures, which will be 
revealed to them in His own due time. 



R5084 page 261 

MENTAL SUGGESTION A MEANS OF TEMPTATION 

"Get thee hence, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship 
the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve."— Matt. 410. 

SHORTLY after our Lord's baptism, He was 
led of His own spirit, illuminated by the 
Holy Spirit received at baptism, to go apart 
to the wilderness of Judea for a season of 
quiet study. It was at the close of this 
period of Bible study and prayer, when our 
Lord was weak from His forty-day fast, 
that the Adversary assaulted Him with 
subtle temptations. 

We are not told how Jesus recognized 
Satan, but we are inclined to think that the Adversary was 
not visible to our Lord's natural sight, but to His mental 
vision— His eyes of understanding; for Satan, like the 
other fallen angels, has been under restraint of darkness 
until the Judgment of the Great Day. It is our thought 
that Satan was permitted to bring mental suggestions before 
our Lord's mind. Evidently our Lord recognized the 
source of these presentations as evil, in whatever way they 
came to Him. 

The popular conception of Satan as a monstrosity with 
hoofs, horns, etc., is a superstition belonging to the Dark 
Ages. Really in his own personality he is a very glorious 
being, who has not been impaired by the six thousand 
years of alienation from God, although his countenance 
may have lost some of its Godlikeness. 

SPIRITUAL POWER NOT TO BE USED SELFISHLY 

In approaching our Lord, Satan did not attempt to lie 
outright, nor to distort facts, but rather to put a false color 
on them. He may have approached Jesus as a friend, 
who had known Him in His pre-existent state and who 
was deeply interested in His welfare. Satan's intrusion 
was, first of all, to give our Lord some kindly advice, by 
suggesting that since Jesus had been fasting for a long 
time, He was doing Himself injury; and that if He really 



knew what power He possessed He would command those 
stones to be made bread. 

Thus approached by one who was of a higher order of 
being than Himself, one who had not taken upon himself 
a bondman's form, it was natural that Jesus did not repulse 
Satan, but answered in a kind manner. Our Lord 
said, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every 
word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." (Matt. 44.) 
I have made a full consecration of Myself to God, 
and am seeking to know His will, in order that I may 
do it, whatever difficulties may be involved therein. 
Therefore, since My life is consecrated, I will not use 
this holy power which I possess, to do anything for My 
own comfort or benefit in any manner. 

SPIRITUAL POWER NOT TO BE USED FOOLISHLY 

Foiled in his first attempt, the Adversary quickly 
changed the subject, not even dissenting from our Lord's 
decision. He then presented a second subtle temptation 
to use the Divine power given our Lord. We do not understand 
that Satan took our Lord bodily to the pinnacle 
of the Temple in Jerusalem, but that he suggested a plan 
by which our Lord could bring Himself into prominence 
before the people and at the same time demonstrate that 
the power of the Most High God was upon Him. 

Our Lord's quick mind detected the error, and He 
promptly answered "It is written again, Thou shalt not 
tempt the Lord thy God." (Matt. 47.) Again changing 
his method of attack, Satan endeavored to give the 
impression that he himself was tired of the condition of 
rebellion against God in the world, and that he was ready 
to join our Lord in a great social uplift. Jesus probably 
knew that Satan was the Prince of this world and 
that his influence was everywhere felt. 

SPIRITUAL POWER NOT TO BE USED CONTRARY TO 
GOD'S WILL 

As in the second temptation, we do not think that our 

R5084 page 262 

Lord was taken out of the wilderness, but that mental 
suggestion was used to influence Him to disobedience to 
the Father. In all the world there is no mountain from 
which all the kingdoms of the world can be seen. We 
understand the "mountain" to be a symbol of Satan's Empire, 
which is world-wide. Satan doubtless brought before 
the Lord's mind all that He knew of the great Roman 
Empire, and the wonderful influence which He as 
a perfect man could exert if He occupied a prominent 
position therein. 

We can imagine Satan as saying, "Messiah is to be 
King over all the earth. I can easily and quickly help 
You into that position. Let us co-operate. I will make 



You chief ruler of the earth on the sole condition that 

You recognize me. I do not ask that You shall not recognize 

Jehovah; but that You shall be under my supervision. 

I can give You all this dominion without any 

trouble. Never mind the future; let me show You how 

to make progress now. I will get You into a good position, 

without removing anyone else. You will not be 

required to do anything very bad." 

During the forty days in the wilderness our Lord had 
come to see that the dominion of earth could be attained 
only through great suffering. He was weak from His 
long fast, and all the details of prophecy were before His 
mind. He saw Himself as a lamb dumb before its shearers; 
as the serpent lifted up in the wilderness. Satan's 
suggestion was a temptation. But after consideration 
He saw that Satan was asking Him to violate His covenant 
—to go contrary to God's will. Immediately He answered, 
"Get thee hence, Satan; for it is written, Thou 
shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou 
serve." 

Then the Devil left our Lord, finding nothing to work 
upon— so loyal was Jesus to the very Word of Jehovah. 
Afterwards the angels came and ministered to Him. 

EVEN FALLEN ANGELS EXCEL IN STRENGTH 

The fact that Jesus discussed matters with the Adversary 
does not furnish us with an excuse to try our 
ability in this direction. For any of us, with our imperfect 

R5085 page 262 

reasoning faculties, to get into a discussion with 
Satan or any of the fallen angels would be very unwise. 
There are doubtless reasons why our Lord conversed with 
Satan; but it would be very unsafe for us to do so. If 
we are sure that we have had a communication from 
fallen angels, let us remember that we are commissioned 
to preach to men, not to angels. 

Some of the Lord's people have gotten into difficulty 
by not using the spirit of a sound mind along this line. 
Evil spirits have a way of drawing the unsuspecting on, 
little by little. They are "seducing spirits," as St. Paul 
tells us. (I Tim. 41.) A brother in the Truth once 
told us of his experience with them. Strange to say he 
was in the Truth when he had communication with the 
spirits. He did not say how he first got into communication 
with them, but he explained the Divine Plan of the 
Ages to them and told them what would happen to the 
fallen angels. For several days they manifested interest, 
coming frequently to hear him. After a while they began 
to dispute among themselves and finally to curse one another. 

The brother had so cultivated the clairaudient power 
that he could hear them. In disgust he tried to get rid 
of them. Not only would they not go, but they made 
matters intolerable for him. Finally he wrote us in distress, 



asking what method to use to get rid of them. We 
advised him to go to the Lord in prayer, confessing that 
he had done wrong, and asking the Lord's forgiveness; 
then, in the name of the Lord, to command them to leave 
him. Afterward he wrote us that he had followed our 
advice, and after a tedious time had finally gotten rid of 
his unwelcome visitors. 

POWERS OF EVIL INCREASING 

As the time of trouble draws near, we can readily 
suppose that our Adversary will have increased power. 
Satan and his fallen angels will have a very baneful influence 
upon humanity. 

Some peculiar occurrences have been brought to our 
attention. One was an account of a picture manifestation. 
A picture had been taken of a piece of property. 
When the photograph was developed it showed the likeness 
of a man who was recognized as a former owner 
who had been dead for some time. It seems evident, then, 
that evil spirits are able to exert some influence even 
upon a camera. 

Another case was that of a person who declares that 
he actually saw certain things which could not possibly 
have taken place. How this could be we do not know. 
We do not know what powers evil spirits may possess. 
We have all heard of cases of mesmerism, hypnotism, 
etc., where the person under control of evil spirits was 
able to describe accurately things taking place at a distance. 
We cannot tell how these things are done. We 
assume that it is the fallen angels who have power so to 
impress the brain of the medium that she would seem to 
see what was being done in another city. In our dreams 
we see people walk and hear them speak. If we can have 
such mental pictures naturally, we may easily suppose 
that evil spirits may have power in this direction. 

RESIST EVERYTHING AKIN TO OCCULTISM 

The facts, however, do not make us understand the 
philosophy of the matter. Nor do we know to what extent 
these things will be used in the future. We have 
no doubt that some very startling events will occur. 
Even to those who have the knowledge of the Divine 
Plan the things permitted will be strange. We should be 
prepared for almost anything that may be told. 

We have great confidence in the power of these evil 
spirits who claim to do wonderful deeds. In fact, we 
can see that while materialization would be possible to 
them, yet a representation to the mind would be much 
easier. To impress a picture upon the brain would also 
be easy. Suppose such power were to be exercised, and 
the Lord's people misrepresented by the Adversary as 
doing some desperate act. Be prepared for all such 
things. It is too near the end of the race to think of turning 
back! 



MY CONFIDENCE 

"You ask me do I fear? 

Should that child fear 

Whose Father owns earth's store of precious things; 

Whose Will carves destinies, whose Wish sways kings; 

Whose Love surpasses fondest mother-love, 

And whose unsleeping eye guards from above? 

"My Father is the Lord; I am His child. 

His storehouse groans beneath a golden weight, 

And I shall never want, though sore my strait. 

When danger threatens and the way seems drear, 

My Father's guiding hand is ever near; 

His kindly counsel will my way attend 

And bring me safely to my journey's end."— Unknown. 



R5085 page 263 

THE SACRIFICE OF THE CHRIST 

AT JORDAN our Lord made a consecration 

of Himself, even unto death. That is to 

say, He was baptized, immersed. He said, 

"Henceforth, I shall have no will of My 

own. Whatever is Your will, Father, shall 

be My will. I shall do anything that You 

will have Me do; not merely those things 

required in obedience to the Divine Law 

—failure to do which would be sin— but 

all the things written in the Book. I have 

given up My life. Direct Me through Your providences 

and through Your words that I may see Your will and 

do it." This was not a giving away of life in the sense 

of giving it to the world; for He was giving Himself to 

God. When He made His consecration unto God, He 

was prepared to face even death itself and to give up His 

existence if such should be the Father's will.— Psa. 407,8; 

Heb. 107. 

Following His consecration He began His ministry. 
As He advanced in the service of fulfilling the Father's 
will, He submitted Himself to everything that was written 
in the Book. The language of His heart was, "Lo, 
I come (in the volume of the Book it is written of Me), 
to do Thy will, O God" (Heb. 107), and in His submission 
of Himself He gave out His power, strength, to such 
an extent that it is stated that great multitudes of people 
out of all Palestine and beyond, "came to hear Him and 
to be healed of their diseases; and they that were vexed 
with unclean spirits; and they were healed. And the 
whole multitude sought to touch Him; for there went 



virtue [vitality] out of Him and healed them all." (Luke 617-19.) 

He kept back nothing for the purpose of recuperating 

His vigor, but was daily yielding His life in 

obedience to what He understood to be the Father's will; 

He was, therefore, doing the things pleasing to God— 

everything that God wished to have Him do, as well as 

the things written in the Law. 

"IT IS FINISHED!" 

When on the cross our Lord cried, "It is finished!" 
He had "poured out His soul unto death"; He had "made 
His soul an offering for sin" (John 1930; Isa. 5312,10); 
He had permitted His life to be taken from Him in obedience 
to the Father's arrangement. These things had 
all been prefigured in the type. On such a day and in 
such a month the passover lamb must be slain. Our Lord 
recognized everything particularized in the Law— whether 
by direct command or in type— as God's will. He declared 
that men did not take His life from Him, in the 
sense of doing something that He was unwilling to have 
them do. He had truly said, "I delight to do Thy will, O 
My God; Thy Law is within [in the midst of] My heart" 
(Psa. 408), and He permitted them to put Him to death, 
because He was submitting to God's will. 

Our Lord realized that His life was taken away fraudulently. 
He did not resist, but allowed this to be done. 
He had agreed that He would not resist, that He would 
do whatever the Father sent Him to do. After He had 
once made a consecration could He have withdrawn? 
No; for He had covenanted to submit to whatever Divine 
providence might indicate to be the Father's will. He 
had entered into a positive contract under which He had 
obligated Himself to be faithful to God's will, and God 
had bound Himself that He would give our Lord the exceeding 
great reward of exaltation to the divine nature 
because of that faithful obedience. God had given Him 
the Holy Spirit as a bond of that contract. 

HUMAN LIFE -RIGHTS BELONG TO OUR LORD 

There is a wide difference between making an exchange 
and bestowing a reward. To exchange is to part 
with something in return for something else regarded as 
an equivalent. To reward is to give something in acknowledgment 
of merit. This word conveys no idea of 
obligation. Whoever gives a reward acts altogether of 
his own free will. 

The arrangement made between the Father and our 
Lord did not, therefore, involve our Lord's right to 
earthly life; for the Father did not contract to give Him 
life on the highest plane of existence in exchange for His 
life as a human being. Had this been the case our Lord 
would have had nothing to give to any of the human 
race— either to the Church or to the world of mankind. 

On the contrary, the Father was to reward our Lord 



by exalting Him far above angels, principalities and 
powers as an acknowledgment of the Son's obedience 

R5086 page 263 

even unto death. The earthly life-rights are still our 
Lord's. The fact that He is to give human life to mankind 
is evidence that He has the right to that earthly life. 

We do not understand that our Lord Jesus agreed 
with the Father merely to lay down His life. So great 
was His love for and His confidence in Jehovah, that He 
was eager to carry out the Father's plan for the blessing 
of mankind, whatever the cost might be to Himself. The 
Scriptures set forth His position at consecration, in the 
words, "Lo, I come to do Thy will, O God." How much 
of God's will did this assertion involve? "In the volume 
[the roll] of the Book it is written of Me," I come prepared 
to do everything that is written in the Book. Not 
only had He come with God's Law written in His heart, 
but He had offered to do everything written in the scroll 
of the Book. 

How could Jesus know what was written in the Book? 
There is every reason to believe that He did not, at the 
time of His consecration, know all that was therein written. 
The things written in the Book, written in the types 
and shadows of the Old Testament, were understood by 
none of the Jews. Many of them, doubtless, our Lord did 
not fully understand before His baptism. God's will is 
expressed in the types of the Law Covenant. Our Lord 
had said, "Everything written in the Book." But who 
will say that at that time He knew how much was involved? 
As a matter of fact, He did not know until after 
His baptism, when the higher things were opened to Him 
and made known to Him; and following this enlightenment 
He went into the wilderness to study and meditate 
upon them. 

DEAD TO EVERYTHING BUT THE WILL OF GOD 

Although prior to His consecration, Jesus did not 
know everything written in the Book about Himself, yet 
His consecration was complete. He had pledged His 
whole life to the doing of God's will. His own will was 
dead to all else. Later, He realized that His Covenant 
meant also actual death as a malefactor. 

The question has been asked, Did Jesus after His resurrection 
have human life-rights by reason of the fact 
that they were not relinquished in death, or by virtue of 
the fact that He had been appointed "Heir of all things"? 
-Heb. 12. 

This, like many other subjects, is capable of various 
shades of thought and expression. Our Lord possessed 
a right to human life and to all earthly things. This right 
to life and all its blessings Adam had forfeited by disobedience, 
but Jesus had secured it by obedience and held 
it absolutely free from risk of loss. Then, if some one, 



contrary to Law, cut Him off from His rights, this cutting 
off did not cause Him to forfeit any of them. 

In other words, we cannot see how anyone could deprive 
our Lord of His life-rights in a judicial way. To 
our understanding, Jesus was cut off from His life and 

R5086 page 264 

from all the rights that pertained to it by a fanatical 
company of fallen men; but their action could not destroy 
any right which God's Law had given to Him. So, then, 
when God raised Him from the dead and rewarded Him 
with a higher nature and certain wonderful blessings 
connected therewith, this exaltation could not interfere 
with the RIGHT which God's LAW had given and which 
He had neither given away nor forfeited. He had merely 
allowed men to take His life from Him, thus separating 
Him from His RIGHTS, which remained His. 

HOW OUR LORD BECOMES FATHER OF MANKIND 

Since our Lord therefore had neither forfeited those 
rights nor given them away, then when God highly exalted 
Him because of His obedience unto death, this right 
to human life was amongst the things that He possessed. 
This right was His irrespective of anything which the 
Father gave Him. It is because He holds this right to 
human life as an asset— His legally and not as a gift- 
that He is said to be the LIFE-GIVER. 

During the Millennial Age, in fulfilment of the Divine 
promise, our Lord will give mankind restitution to perfect 
human nature. In doing this He will not be giving 
something that the Father has given Him, but He will 
be acting in a special sense in His own name. If He did 
not have this right to everlasting life to give, then He 
could not be spoken of as the LIFE -GIVER. But since He 
possesses this right to human life, it is His to bestow 
during the thousand years of His reign. 

At the end of the thousand years our Lord will no 
longer be the Life-Giver. He cannot be the Life-Giver 
to angels nor to any other than mankind, for His right appertained 
merely to Himself as a perfect human being. 
What He will give away to humanity in general, is what 
He now imputes, or loans, to the Church, to permit us to 
share with Him in sacrificial work and in His glorious 
work of the future. 

RIGHT TO HUMAN LIFE OUR LORD'S PERSONAL GIFT 
TO MANKIND 

We do not see how as "Heir of all things" our Lord 
could gain any additional control of His earthly nature 
and earthly life-rights which were His by obedience to 
the Law. As Heir of all things He will be the representative 
of the Father to all eternity. He takes the position 
at the right hand of authority on High. In due time, 



every knee shall bow to Him, and even the angels shall 
be subjected unto Him. 

All these things came to our Lord as a part of the reward 
which the Father promised. But this one particular 
feature, the restitution of all things lost by Adam, is a 
special privilege coming as His own gift to humanity— 
that which He purchased at His own cost; that is to say, 
the laying down of His earthly life is the basis upon 
which He obtained the new nature and the right to control 
that earthly life, which shall be applied in restitution 
in behalf of the world. 

If He had already applied that life and had actually 
given it up, then we do not see how He could accomplish 
anything special for mankind. But since He has this 
asset of earthly rights and privileges to give away, the 
process of bestowing it will continue during the Millennial 
reign; and what He will give is what He has by reason 
of His obedience to the Law.— Lev. 185. 

SCRIPTURAL USAGE OF THE TERM "SACRIFICE" 

The word "sacrifice" may be used from different standpoints. 
If an animal were killed for some benevolent 
reason or purpose, it might be spoken of as a sacrifice, 
particularly if it were something done in harmony with 
the Divine arrangement. But the mere killing of an animal 
would not be sacrifice. A dog might be killed without 
being sacrificed. But if the dog's life were surrendered 
for the purpose of scientific experiment, we might 
say that it was given in sacrifice to science. From this 
standpoint we should view the matter of sacrifice. The 
lives of God's consecrated people are surrendered for a 
purpose. 

At our consecration we present our bodies as living 
sacrifices. We give up to the Lord our life, our human 
bodies and everything that we possess. It does not follow, 
however, that God accepts this sacrifice to be put to 
death in some special manner. Some may spend their 
lives in serving the Lord's Truth, and may be said to be 
sacrificed as truly as though they had died at the stake. 
We may say to the Lord, All my life is in Your hands; 
do with it as You please. If it means joy or pain, sacrifice 
or pleasure, we surrender our own will in the matter 
and become like unto Jesus, who said, "I came down 
from heaven, not to do Mine own will, but the will of 
Him that sent Me. "-John 638. 

WHAT DO WE SACRIFICE? 

The sacrifice of Jesus was made at Jordan, but it was 
finished at Calvary. His consecration was absolute. The 
killing of the bullock is symbolical of what Jesus did when 
He surrendered His will. And so with us. Following in 
His footsteps we become dead in the sense that we sacrifice 
our wills. But in what manner the Lord may accept 
that sacrificed will is His affair. We give it freely, 



that the mind of Christ may dwell in us richly. 

We part forever with the right to our wills, but we 
do not sacrifice our lives, although we know that the giving 
up of our wills ultimately leads to the giving up of 
our lives. But we have nothing to do with the parting 
with our rights. When Jesus becomes our Advocate, He 
takes us in charge. From the time we give up our wills, 
our bodies are counted as His Body. We merely give up 
our wills in the matter and leave everything for Him to 
dispose of. He attends to the sacrificing; for He is the 
High Priest; we are not. 

Similarly, the great outcome is in the Lord's hands. 
During the Gospel Age He imputes of His merit to the 
Church. When He has finished the work of sacrificing 
He will apply the merit of this great sacrifice, which He 
calls His own, for sealing the New Covenant for the 
world. But we have nothing to do with the sacrificing. 
We leave it all to our Attorney, or Advocate. 

The New Creature is certainly the owner, or controller, 
of the body and is made so by the Lord. We as 
New Creatures have a work to perform with our body. 
When our Lord accepts us as His servants, we are to 
use all our talents as His stewards. In that sense of the 
word, the body will be under the control of the New 
Creature until death. 

LIFE-RIGHTS MERELY IMPUTED TO THE CHURCH 

Our position is somewhat different from that of our 
Lord. We had no earthly life-rights to begin with; and 
we had, therefore, none to give away. They were forfeited 
by Adam's sin. But if we become the Lord's disciples, 
if we surrender all to Him and accept the merit 
that He is willing to impute to us, our great Advocate 
will count us as members of His Body and permit us to 
share in His sufferings. When He imputed His merit to 
us all rights passed to Him. He gave His members whatever 
right they have and whatever privilege of earthly 
right comes to them. 

When it shall be necessary for our Lord to use these 
rights in the future for the world, He will be quite competent 
and privileged to do so. Having never violated 

R5086 page 265 

the Divine Law He will have the full right to use, command 
and direct in respect to all of His earthly rights, 
which He did not forfeit, but which He laid down with 
the understanding that He should use them again in giving 
life to the world, so that He would be called the 
Father of mankind, in respect to their future life. 

Nowhere in the Scriptures is the statement made that 
Christ came to sacrifice Himself. What the Scriptures 
say is that He came to do the Father's will. He did not 
refuse to drink the "cup" which the Father prepared for 
Him, but drank it to the dregs. And for His obedience to 



this Will, even unto death— no matter how long or how 
short a time the Father should be pleased to have that 
life continue— He received the reward. He gave over 
all into the Father's hands. This was a sacrifice; for He 
had a right to use His life. But His obedience to His 
Father's will led to the sacrifice for which He obtained 
the reward.

FIVE LOAVES AND TWO FISHES 

-MARK 630-44. -SEPT. 22.- 

Text "Jesus said unto them, I am 
the Bread of Life."— John 635. 

WHEN THE TWELVE APOSTLES returned 

to Jesus they exclaimed, "Even the demons 

were subject to us in Thy Name." But He 

said unto them, Rejoice not specially because 

of this, let your special rejoicing be 

that your names are written in Heaven. 

They explained to Jesus the instance of 

their tour and what they had taught; and 

He called them away to a desert place to 

rest awhile, because of the crowd and because 

they had not even time to take nourishment. So 

they went privately to such a place by ship. But the 

news went also and the crowd went on foot from various 

cities. 

Jesus would have no time to Himself. His entire life 
was devoted and being rendered up a living sacrifice to 
the Divine service, in feeding the sheep of Jehovah's 
flock, and, of course, His own sheep also, because all that 
were the Father's were His. As He looked upon the 
multitude, He felt a yearning compassion for them. He 
saw their needs "They were like sheep without a shepherd" 
and He continued to teach them. 

But, says one, did they not have synagogues, and 
regular reading of the Scriptures? Did they not have 
Scribes, Pharisees, Priests and Levites? How could 
they be without shepherding? Ah, well, they had 
a soul-hunger, which the forms, ceremonies, rituals 
and burdens bound upon them could not satisfy. They 
were really wanting the "Bread of Life" which Jesus had 
—which Jesus was, for He personified the Truth. Why 
then did they not receive it? What was their defense? 
They were bound by superstition, prejudice, the fear of 
man, traditions of the ancients, and the opposition of the 
great and the learned of their time. 

Did they not frequently inquire, "Have any of the 
Scribes and Pharisees believed on Him?" Again, "Do 
our rulers indeed know that this is the very Christ?" 



The common people always referred to the learned. The 
learned therefore have the greater responsibility. Jesus 
declared of them, "Ye have taken away the key of knowledge" 
you will neither enter into the favor of God yourselves, 
nor will you permit others to enter in who so desire. 
-Luke 1152. 

And is not this in a large measure true today also? 
The learned of the colleges and principal pulpits are telling 
the people that the Bible is not the Divine Message 
which Jesus and the Apostles declared it to be. They are 
telling the people that Moses and the Prophets did not 
write the books accredited to them; and thus indirectly 
they are telling the people that Jesus and the Apostles 
were deceived when Jesus said, "Moses wrote of Me," 
and the Prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah said thus and so. 
Thus the people are becoming more and more unbelievers 
in respect to the Bible. 

But what will the great and learned teachers of today 
give to the masses as a soul-satisfying portion instead of 
the Bible? Oh, they tell us, "This is the good tidings, 
the Gospel Your forefathers were apes; a law of Evolution 
prevails. As a result we have come as far as we 
are. We need no Savior, because we had no fall. We 
have no Redeemer, because if we were restored to our 
original condition it would make monkeys of us. God 
has allowed the law of Evolution to operate in you and 
in your children. You thus live in your children, and 
by and by will reach a very high plane of existence— not 
that you yourself will have any knowledge of that, for 
you will be dead, but your children will have that joy 
instead." 

What is there in this to satisfy soul-hunger? Ah, 
nothing! No wonder the lament is going up all over 
Christendom that the public no longer care to go to 
church; that they can scarcely be bribed to go, even with 
the attractions of talented essays and choirs rendering 
operatic music, nor even be attracted by vaudevilles and 
worldly trash. Alas! what we need is that all of God's 
people should unite their hearts and voices in proclaiming 
the Gospel which Jesus and the Apostles taught— the 
Gospel of the Kingdom— Messiah's Kingdom— and the 
glorious work it will accomplish for men, and the glorious 
privilege it will be to obtain a share in that Kingdom. 
Surely then church attendance will be better and without 
any of the attractions and gewgaws now thought necessary. 
Let us with one heart and with one mind return 
to the Gospel Message of the New Testament. 

THE SYMPATHY OF JESUS 

The multitudes in their enthusiasm went a long journey 
from home without making proper provisions for 
food. The disciples urged that the meeting break up and 
that the people be sent home. Jesus suggested, "Give 
ye them to eat." But they declared they had nothing 
wherewith to feed so many, and that if even they should 



go to purchase it would cost much for even one satisfying 
portion. 

Finally they found five loaves and two fishes. By 
Jesus' direction they seated the multitudes in companies 
on the grass, and the five loaves and two fishes, under 
heavenly blessing, were divided and divided, again and 
again and again, until all had portions and ate to their 
satisfaction; and the fragments amounted to twelve baskets, 
while those who had partaken were 5,000. 

This wonderful miracle not only attests our Lord's 
sympathy, but it also spoke volumes to the people of the 
Divine power that was in the Great Teacher; but there 
is still another lesson which it teaches us. Like all of 
the miracles which Jesus performed it was merely another 
foregleaming, or illustration, of His coming glory 
and of the coming blessings. He who provided the nourishment 
for the 5,000 is shortly to be the Great King of 
Glory, whose Kingdom will extend from shore to shore, 
and bring blessing and refreshment to all mankind. 

R5087 page 266 

This miracle speaks to us of the power that our Lord 
will then have for providing for the necessities of the 
whole world. True, we do not expect that during the 
reign of Christ the world will be miraculously fed, but 
rather in accordance with the Scriptural promise, "The 
earth shall yield her increase"; and again, "I will call 
for the wheat, and will increase it," etc., etc. But specially 
the feeding of the multitude reminds us of the fact 
testified in our text that Jesus is "The Bread of Life"— 
the Divine Provision for the necessities of the whole 
world. 

"I AM THE BREAD OF LIFE" 

As the Church now partake of the merit of Christ's 
sacrifice, and become members of His Body, the one Loaf, 
and thus are made partakers of the eternal Life through 
Him, so in God's due time the Bread from Heaven is to 
feed the multitudes of earth. During the thousand years 
of His reign, the Bread of Life will be freely distributed 
amongst all mankind. That Bread of Life is the Truth 
—particularly the Truth related to and connected with 
the great redeeming work of Jesus. He is to be the 
Bread of Life to the world, because He bought the world 
with the sacrifice of His own life. The Bread that came 
down from Heaven they may all freely partake of and 
live. 

The Church, however, in this present time, has another 
privilege which the world in the future will not 
share, and that is represented in the Lord's "cup." His 
"cup" to us represents our privilege of suffering with 
Him and becoming His joint-heirs in the Kingdom.

TEACHING BY PARABLES ONLY 

--MATT. 1334,35,55. -SEPT. 29.- 

Text— "The words that I speak unto you, 
they are spirit and they are life."— John 663. 

TODAY'S LESSON declares, "All these 
things spake Jesus unto the multitudes in 
parables, and without a parable spake He 
not unto them; that it might be fulfilled 
which was spoken by the Prophet, I will 
open My mouth in parables; I will utter 
things which have been kept, secret from 
the foundation of the world." 

Bible students and Bible scholars have 
generally expressed surprise that the Great 

R5088 page 266 

Teacher, in harmony with the above Scripture, spoke always 
to the people in symbolic language, "dark sayings," 
the meaning of which they rarely understood. Another 
Scripture informs us that the reason was that the true 
invitation was not intended for the ordinary multitudes, 
but merely for the consecrated. 

To those who accepted the Lord as the Savior, and 
who took upon themselves the required vow of faithfulness 
in walking in His footsteps unto death— these were 
granted special enlightenment, as it is written, "To you 
it is given to know the mystery of the Kingdom of 
Heaven, but to outsiders these things are spoken in parables, 
that they might not see and understand." 

The simple explanation of the matter is that an understanding 
of spiritual things would do harm rather 
than good to those not spiritually begotten— to those not 
fully consecrated to the Divine will. But with the views 
we once entertained, and which are voiced by all the 
creeds of the Dark Ages, none of the explanations would 
be tenable; because, according to those creeds, only the 
Elect are to be saved, all the non-elect are to be lost, 
and the Elect would be the only ones permitted to understand 
the things pertaining to the Heavenly calling. 

The entire matter is clarified when we recognize the 
difference between the salvation of the world to the 
human nature, during Messiah's reign of a thousand 
years, and the salvation provided for the Elect, called 
during this Age, and specially instructed and guided with 
the view of their making their calling and election sure. 

THE APOSTLES JESUS' MOUTHPIECES 

It has been claimed that the doctrines of Christianity 



can be better gleaned from the writings of the Apostles 
than from the sayings of Jesus, as reported in the Gospels. 
There is considerable truth in this claim, and the 
reason is manifest; namely, Jesus' words were addressed 
mainly to the multitudes, and when He addressed the 
disciples He could not discuss even with them deep, spiritual 
truths, because they had not been begotten of the 
Holy Spirit, and therefore could not understand spiritual 
things. Jesus Himself declared, "I have many things to 
tell you, but ye cannot bear them now." 

On one occasion our Lord's words were so deep, so 
highly figurative, that many of His followers left Him, 
saying, "This is a hard (difficult) saying, who can understand 
it?" (John 660.) The saying was, "Unless ye 
eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man, ye 
have no life in you." God's consecrated and spirit-enlightened 
people can understand that statement, but none 
others can even yet understand it. St. Paul explains the 
reason why, saying, "The natural man receiveth not the 
things of the Spirit of God,. ..neither can he know 
them, for they are spiritually discerned."— I Cor. 214. 

"AFTER YE WERE ILLUMINATED" 

St. Paul gives the key to the situation in one of his 
Epistles, saying, "After that ye were illuminated, ye endured 
a great fight of afflictions." (Heb. 1042.) The 
illumination received was the begetting of the Holy Spirit. 
Similarly, the Apostles at Pentecost received an illumination 
of the mind which enabled them to understand 
the things of God, yea, the deep things of God; for He 
hath given unto us His Spirit, "that we might know the 
things which are freely given us of God."— I Cor. 212. 

Jesus had this same thought in mind when He declared 
that there were certain things His disciples could 
not understand at that time, but would know afterwards, 
because He would send the Holy Spirit, which would 
bring all things to their remembrance whatsoever He had 
spoken; and would show them things to come. (John 1426; 1613.) 
This was not only true with the Apostles, 
but has been true with respect to all the members of the 
Body of Christ throughout this Age. Each one presenting 
his Body a living sacrifice has been accepted by the 
great Advocate, and presented as a part of His own Offering; 
and then the offerer has been begotten of the 
Holy Spirit to be a New Creature in Christ. 

It is to these New Creatures that the statement is 
made, "All things are yours, for ye are Christ's, and 
Christ is God's." It is to these the Bible has promised, 
"He will show you things to come." It is these that are 
to be guided into all Truth as it shall become due. It is 
for these that the Word of God is a Storehouse, from 
which "things both new and old" are to be produced under 
the Spirit's guidance, as they become "meat in due season" 
to the "household of faith." 



BABES IN CHRIST AND MEN 

Along the same line we note the fact that even the 
spirit-begotten New Creatures must make progress in 

R5088 page 267 

their appreciation of spiritual things. The Apostle urges 

such that "As new born babes they should desire the sincere 

milk of the Word, that they might grow thereby." 

And the growth is necessary if they would attain join t-heirship 

in the Kingdom; hence the Apostle again urges 

that each seek not to continue a babe, but to become a 

man, and to use the "strong meat" of Divine Truth. By 

becoming a man, he is sanctified, developed as a New 

Creature and filled with the Spirit, and "thoroughly furnished 

unto every good work," by knowledge of the Word 

of God. 

It must have been a difficult matter for our Lord, in 
teaching, to follow the rule which He gave to His disciples, 
namely, to "be wise as a serpent and harmless as 
a dove." Appreciating the Divine plan fully, completely, 
He must frequently have had a yearning desire 
to tell His beloved followers more of the mysteries and 
deep things of the Divine Plan than they were able to 
appreciate. 

"SPIRIT AND LIFE" WORDS 

Now our text "The words that I speak unto you, 
they are spirit and they are life." Here was another endeavor 
to impress His dear disciples with the thought 
that they should not take His words too literally, but 
should look for the deeper meaning. Furthermore, they 
were to remember that they could not expect to get that 
deep meaning until after the Master's ascension; as He 
said, "It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go 
not away the Holy Spirit will not come unto you; but if 
I go away I will send Him unto you"; "for the Holy 
Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified." 
-John 167; 739. 

Jesus was not glorified because His glorification would 
not take place until His resurrection, and in a fuller sense 
until His ascension to the Most Holy on High, there to 
appear in the presence of God on our behalf— to make 
application of the merit of His sacrifice for those who 
have consecrated to walk in His steps. 

It was, therefore, after they had been illuminated that 
the Apostles and others of the Church understood the 
meaning of this text, that the words of Jesus were spiritual 
and could be understood only by those possessing the 
spiritual key, the illumination of the Holy Spirit. 

The Master's words were "words of life" in the sense 
that they conveyed the great Message of the terms upon 
which we may have everlasting life and become His 
joint-heirs. Although the Apostles explain the philosophy 



of the Divine Plan in great detail, and mention more 
than did Jesus, yet in His sayings we find the very essence 
or kernel of the Gospel. Nowhere are the terms 
of discipleship more carefully laid down than in Jesus' 
words, because the disciples could understand what would 
be the meaning of the figures of self-denial, cross-bearing, 
and walking in His steps, even if they could not understand 
the philosophy of justification, sanctification, 
election and Divine foreknowledge. 

From Jesus' words more clearly than from any other 
words we get the thought of the "water of life," and how 
it is now in His followers a "spring" of truth, grace and 
everlasting life. Nowhere else do we more clearly get 
the general statement that the Father hath life in Himself, 
and hath granted unto the Son life in Himself, and 
that He might share this life with His disciples— with 
whomsoever He would. Thus, as St. Paul says, the 
words of this salvation in which we rejoice began to be 
spoken by our Lord. It is He also that declared that He 
brought life and immortality to light, thus distinguishing 
between the general reward of everlasting life to be given 
to the world, and the special reward to be granted to the 
Church.

OUR SPECIAL "I.B.S.A." BIBLE 

The "I.B.S.A." Bible is becoming more and more indispensable to 
all readers as they learn how to use it. The translation, of course, is 
not at all different from that of other Bibles of the Common Version. 
We specially recommend it for its smallness of size, lightness of weight 
and good-sized print, and above all for the helps to Bible students and 
teachers bound with it; printed on India paper; excellent press work. 
Its special feature, distinguishing this Bible from all others, is 

BIBLE TEACHERS' MANUAL. 

Biblical Comments from Genesis to Revelation, with references to 
the STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES and others of our publications. It 
represents four hundred and eighty-one pages of matter. 

INSTRUCTORS' GUIDE TEXTS. 

This is a topical arrangement of Bible subjects. It is in condensed 
form, very convenient, and consists of eighteen pages solid matter. 

BEREAN TOPICAL INDEX. 

This, alphabetically arranged, presents a large variety of subjects 
showing references to the STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES and others of 
our publications treating the same. This feature covers twenty-eight 
pages. 

DIFFICULT TEXTS EXPLAINED-SPURIOUS PASSAGES NOTED. 

In this, specially difficult texts are brought to the attention and 
references given showing where they are treated in our publications. 
Following this is a full list of various interpolations and spurious 
passages of the Scriptures not in the original MSS., as proven by the 
oldest Greek MSS.— fifteen pages. 

All of our "I.B.S.A." Bibles contain the above, and some of 
them, the numbers of which end with a nine, contain additionally 
Bagster's Bible Study Helps, including an alphabetical index of proper 
names and Bagster's Bible Concordance and Maps— a total of one 
hundred and eighty-six pages. The price is the same whether the order 
be for one copy or for more. To save danger of misunderstanding 
we below quote the prices, including postage.

R5088 : page 271 

THE NEW CREATURE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO DIVINE LAW 

PARTI 

THE LAW COVENANT was a Covenant 

that God made with Israel, based upon the 

keeping of the Law, which was briefly expressed 

in the Ten Commandments. The 

Apostle Paul says that our Lord was born 

under the Law (Gal. 4:4); not under the 

Ten Commandments merely, but under the 

Law Covenant. This Law Covenant, the 

Apostle elsewhere shows, was that addition 

to the Abrahamic Covenant which was 

typified by Hagar and not by Sarah. Our Lord was under 

this Hagar Covenant, then— under the Law Covenant, 

the Covenant of the flesh— up to the time when He was 

thirty years of age. 

We have no record whatever respecting our Lord's 
obedience to the Law before He became of age, although 
we have every reason to believe that He kept the Law 
Covenant. But the time of His special trial began at 
His baptism. The fact that God was willing to enter into 
a Covenant of sacrifice with our Lord shows that He was 
perfect at that time. Our Lord persisted in keeping the 

R5089 : page 271 



Law during the time of His ministry, and at the same 
time sacrificed those rights which were His because of 
keeping the Law. 

With our Lord it was the same as with Adam. Jesus 
was perfect at the time of His baptism; therefore, no one 
could question His right to life. Consequently, God dealt 
with Him as with One who had life rights. But as Adam 
was placed on trial to see whether he would prove faithful, 
so our Lord Jesus was on trial during the three and 
a half years of His ministry, to prove His worthiness to 
retain His life rights. If He had failed to keep the Law 
any time during His ministry, He would have failed to 
have Divine approval. Likewise if He had failed to 
keep His Covenant of sacrifice He would have failed to 
make His calling and election sure. 

CONDITION OF HEART TESTED CONTINUOUSLY 

What our Lord did in this matter is on a parity with 
what each one of us does. We come to the Lord in the 
beginning and present ourselves living sacrifices; His acceptance 
of us and the imputation of His merit to us 
makes us perfect beings from the Divine standpoint. 
Everyone who is perfect in the flesh has a right to life, 
according to the Divine Law. But the fact that we have 
a right to life for the moment, does not prove that it will 
be everlasting. 

At the end of the thousand years of Christ's reign 
the world will be actually perfect. They will then be 
subjected to a testing to prove whether or not this perfection 
is deep and abiding, whether or not it is the permanent 
condition of their hearts. So it was with our 
Lord. Before His consecration He certainly had no such 
trials and contradictions of sinners against Himself as 
He had afterwards. "Consider Him that endured such 
contradiction of sinners against Himself?" (Heb. 12:3.) 
Practically all His trials began at the time of His consecration. 
We have no reason to suppose that our Lord 
was undergoing a trial for life or death before His 
consecration. 

When our Lord was thirty years old, He was holy, 
harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners. His trial, 
which was to prove His worthiness, began at His consecration 
and continued until His death. For three years 
and a half the spirit of His mind was being tested. If 
during that time He had committed any sin whatever, 
would He have been accepted of God then? Surely not! 
He was on trial, not as an old creature, but as a New 
Creature, and His trial did not end until on the cross He 
cried, "It is finished!" This did not alter the fact, however, 
that He was still under the Law. The Law had 
dominion over Him as long as He lived. As a New 
Creature He did not have a body of the spirit kind. He 
had a human body, and was, therefore, responsible for 
everything that His human body would do. 

It is just so with us. The body is reckoned dead in 



one sense of the word. As the Apostle says, "If ye be 

risen with Christ, seek those things which are above." 

Does this refer to us merely as New Creatures? Yes. 

Is not our flesh reckoned dead? Yes, but we are figuratively 

raised from the dead. (Rom. 6:4,5; Col. 3:1.) 

To whatever extent our bodies fall short of perfect obedience, 

Christ, as the great Advocate, makes good. So 

if any of us sin, we have an Advocate with the Father. 

No matter how trivial the sin may be, it is a sin. God 

keeps no accounts with the flesh, but holds the New 

Creature responsible. It is for these weaknesses of the 

flesh that the New Creature goes daily to the Lord and 

says, "Forgive us our trespasses." We have an Advocate 

with God, and if we sin we may come to God and obtain 

grace in every time of need.— I John 2:1; Heb. 4:16. 

THE TWO-FOLD TRIAL OF THE NEW CREATURE 

As we have seen, when our Lord made His consecration 
at His baptism, He was a perfect human being. 
When the Father accepted His sacrifice, He was begotten 
again; and He was to this degree a new soul, a New 
Creature— spirit. But He had this treasure of the new 
mind in an earthen vessel, and the New Creature was 
responsible for all that the old creature did. If the old 

R5089 : page 272 

creature had gotten Him into trouble, the New Creature 
would have been responsible. 

As previously stated, our Lord was under the domination 
of the Law as long as He lived. The question then 
arises, How long did He live as a man? Our answer is 
that in a very important sense of the word He died at 
the time of His baptism; that is to say, He died so far as 
His human will was concerned, but His human body did 
not die. His human body, therefore, was still as liable 
to every Law as it had been before. He became a New 
Creature in the spirit of His mind, but a New Creature 
without a new body; and in the Divine arrangement the 
New Creature accepted and used the old earthly body, 
with all the responsibilities of that earthly body, whatever 
they might be. 

In other words, the flesh has its law and its responsibilities. 
But as a New Creature our Lord was under an 
additional law. We are not to understand that as a New 
Creature He was released from the Ten Commandments. 
In his flesh He was a perfect human being, under the 
Law. As a New Creature He undertook to do more than 
merely keep the Law; and so the New Creature was on 
trial— not merely to prove whether the flesh would live 
up to the requirements of the Law, but whether the flesh 
should be brought into subjection to the higher law of 
the New Creation. Thus our Lord more than kept the 
Law— not less than kept the Law. 

Jesus died to the Law Covenant, but not to the Law, 



at the time that He made His consecration. He was not 
relieved from His responsibility to the Law according to 
the flesh, but as a New Creature He gave up all hope, 
all anticipation, as respects that Law Covenant. When 
He gave up the human nature He would have no use for 
that which applied to the human nature, which He was 
giving up in order to get something better. Therefore, 
He died to the Law Covenant, not because He could not 
keep it, but because by becoming dead to that Covenant 
He might become alive to the Covenant of sacrifice. The 
blessings of that Law Covenant would have been merely 
earthly life. So when our Lord consecrated Himself, He 
sacrificed everything that went with the Law Covenant. 

NO ADVOCATE FOR OUR LORD 

If our Lord's human nature had failed to keep the 
Law, the New Creature would have been held responsible. 
It is the same with us, as we have illustrated before in 
the case of a man and his dog. The New Creature is 
like the man and the old creature like the dog. But the 
man is responsible for the dog. If the dog does damage 
or bites anyone, the owner is responsible. God has made 
a special arrangement for us, however, by which we may 
go to the throne of heavenly grace for the imperfections 
of the flesh, because we have an Advocate. But Jesus 
had no Advocate; and therefore any misdeed on the part 
of His flesh would be charged to Him directly, as He 
would be responsible for all the flesh might do. 

As we have seen, our Lord at thirty years of age was 
a perfect man, accountable under the Law Covenant. 
When He had made a consecration and when that consecration 
had been accepted by the Father, He was 
counted alive as a New Creature and reckoned dead as an 
old creature. These facts should not cause us to lose sight 
of the other fact that He was not really a New Creature, 
but merely begotten to a new nature, and that He would 
not be entirely free from the earthly nature until He was 
actually dead. 

So, then, as a New Creature our Lord was responsible 
for all of God's laws that applied to Him as a man. The 
fact that He had given up all the earthly hopes and ambitions 
and privileges did not give Him liberty to violate 
the Law of God; and therefore His passing from under 
the Law Covenant did not give Him liberty to break the 
Law. 

Even so with us. We cannot trespass against our 
neighbor in any degree. The fact that we have become 
New Creatures in Christ makes us still more responsible 
for good behavior. We have need of the Lord's covering 
merit for every fleshly imperfection that we have. The 
very fact that we have need of that covering for our 
fleshly imperfections shows that our every thought, word 
and action are taken cognizance of by God; and since 
we are still imperfect, an arrangement is provided for 
us by which we may go to the Throne of Grace and have 



our weaknesses covered by our Lord's merit. 
GRAVE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON OUR LORD 

But our Lord had nothing to shield Him. Although 
He had given up all hope of human life, that He might 
have the spiritual blessings, yet He was responsible for 
every feature of the Divine Law. 

The Divine Law has always existed. God always had 
certain laws of right and wrong; He Himself is under a 
law of righteousness. Our Lord Jesus and all the holy 
angels are subject to a law of righteousness. What 
ceased at our Lord's consecration was the Covenant promise 
of life which was based upon that Law and which 
had been won by our Lord. Since no imperfect being 
can keep that Law, another arrangement is made for us 
—a sacrificial arrangement, based upon our Lord's merit, 
imputed to us. "Gather My saints together unto Me; 
those who have made a Covenant with Me by sacrifice." 
-Psa. 50:5. 

From the Divine standpoint our Lord kept the Law 
as a New Creature; from the human standpoint He kept 
it as an earthly creature. To God we are one thing; to 
men we are another. Before God Jesus had the standing 
of the New Creature. But He did not keep the Law 
merely in the spirit; He kept it in the letter as well. As 
for ourselves, we cannot keep the letter of the Law, but 
we must keep the spirit of it. Our Lord, being perfect, 

R5090 : page 272 

kept the Law both in spirit and in letter. Every act of 
obedience to the Law was credited to the New Creature, 
and any failure would have brought death. Even though 
the account was entered in the name of the New Creature, 
these acts of obedience were only credited to it. Just as 
a parent might put into the bank money for a child, the 
child does not have the money and cannot receive it until 
he becomes of age; so with our Lord. Everything that 
He did was put to His credit. And if He had done anything 
wrong, it would have been charged to the New 
Creature. "The wages of sin is death."— Rom. 6:23. 

CHANGE OF NATURE A GRADUAL PROCESS 

But had our Lord remained under the Law Covenant, 
He would not have become the heir; for the child of the 
bondwoman could not become heir with the son of the 
freewoman. (Gal. 4:30.) The son of the freewoman 
was the New Creature. 

When our Lord made the Covenant of sacrifice at 
Jordan He passed from His position under the Law 
Covenant and from His fleshly relationship to Abraham, 
into the spiritual relationship and became the spiritual 
"Seed" of Abraham; for there He sacrificed all the blessings 
and favors which were His under the Law Covenant. 



But we are to remember that in our Lord's case, this 
change of nature required three and a half years. He 
did not pass instantaneously from one relationship to the 
other, but by a process in which He was dying daily and 

R5090 : page 273 

also becoming alive daily. He had accepted the terms of 
the Covenant of sacrifice. During those three and one-half 
years, He was in the process of transfer from the 
Law Covenant to the Sacrificial Covenant. After He 
had fulfilled the terms of that Covenant, He was put to 
death in the flesh, and quickened in the spirit. (I Peter 3:18. 
R.V.) But He did not enter into the glorious station 
typified by Isaac until after His resurrection from 
the dead. 

So it is with us. We renounce the earthly that we 
may share in the heavenly. But the change requires a 
period of time, during which we are dying daily and becoming 
more alive daily. We shall be made fully alive 
only in our resurrection, for flesh and blood cannot inherit 
the Kingdom of God. (I Cor. 15:50.) While this 
change is not instantaneous, but by degrees, yet the 
Father dealt with our Lord from the moment of His consecration, 
and so He deals with us. We have the foretaste 
of the blessing now, but it will not be ours completely 
until the sacrifice shall have been finished. Our 
Lord's baptism did not constitute Him The Christ in the 
full sense of the word, but He was declared to be The 
Christ with power when He was raised upon the spirit 
plane.— Rom. 1:4. 

PURPOSE OF OUR LORD'S SUFFERING 

The Scriptures give us to understand that our Lord's 
sufferings produced a variety of results. First of all, 
those sufferings were in fulfilment of the Law, and by 
them He testified His obedience to the Law of God. He 
suffered for well-doing and not for evil-doing. Second, 
it was appropriate that He should prove to God His 
loyalty and faithfulness, so as to establish His worthiness 
to be made the great Messiah and to be granted the great 
power and glory which Messiah will exercise. 

The Apostle Paul gives us this particular thought, 
when he says that it pleased God to make the Captain 
of our salvation perfect through suffering. (Heb. 2:10.) 
At the same time this suffering would demonstrate our 
Lord to be the great Messiah who would eventually lead 
the people out of sin and death. The Apostle also intimates 
that His sufferings were expedient and wise for 
the assistance of those who would be His followers, when 
he says that this High Priest was touched with a feeling 
of our infirmities, that He might be able to sympathize 
with those who are in trouble. He was faithful Himself, 
having gone through various trials and testings.— 
Heb. 4:15. 



When mankind come to know how it was that Messiah 
assumed control of the world, all humanity will have 
full confidence in Him— not only in the power with which 
He will rule His Kingdom, but also in His justice, His 
love and His mercy. He has been tempted in all points 
as the Church is, and therefore, not only can we have 
the benefit resulting from His experience, but the whole 
world in the future may also have an opportunity to appreciate 
it. 

The sufferings of Jesus became a witness both to angels 
and to men. He gave the demonstration of the full 
extent of loyalty even unto death. As a reward the 
Father did not give Him merely the high position that 
He had at first, but exalted Him to His own right hand 
in the heavenly places, "Far above all principality and 
power and might and dominion, and every name that is 
named" (Eph. 1:21); even to the divine nature. All this 
was a part of the Father's great Plan; and by our Lord's 
experiences we see that the Heavenly Father has demonstrated 
His Justice, His Power and His Love in a most 
marvelous way. 

THE CHURCH'S EXPERIENCES SIMILAR TO OUR LORD'S 

Our Lord's perfecting, indeed, was a little different 
from ours, and yet there is a similarity between the two. 
He was perfect before He humbled Himself; He was 
still perfect as the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself; 
but as a result of His consecration He received a begetting 
of the Holy Spirit to the divine nature, and His development 
as a New Creature required that He faithfully 
carry out His vow, or Covenant, of sacrifice, in the doing 
of the will of the Heavenly Father. By such faithfulness 
He perfected Himself on the divine plane— that is, He 
proved Himself worthy according to the Covenant— 
"Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and 
riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and 
blessing."— Rev. 5:12. 

Similarly the followers of Jesus are to be sharers with 
Him of the sufferings of this present time and in the 
glories which shall follow, for "If we suffer [with Him] 
we shall also reign with Him." (2 Tim. 2:12.) Although 
we are imperfect in the flesh, while He was perfect, yet 
the Robe of His Righteousness, the merit of His sacrifice, 
covers all of our blemishes and makes us, as His footstep 
followers, holy and acceptable before the Father, as joint-sacrificers 
with Jesus. 

The begetting of the Holy Spirit starts us in the life 
divine. We are not to be perfected in the flesh, but in 
the spirit; and our perfection and acceptance with the 
Father will be demonstrated by our loyalty of heart and 
the fulness and thoroughness with which we submit our 
all to the Divine will and seek to glorify God in our bodies 
and spirits, which are His. Our justification comes to us 
as a reward of faith, regardless of works, but our glorification 
will follow only as a reward for faithfulness— "Be 



thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of 
life. "-Rev. 2:10.

FEET-WASHING AS A LESSON IN HUMILITY 

"Ye also ought to wash one another's feet."— John 13:14. 

WE REMEMBER the occasion on which our 

Lord washed the feet of His disciples. The 

Lord and His twelve Apostles had met in 

the upper room to commemorate the Passover 

Supper. This feast was followed by 

the inauguration of the Memorial Supper, 

the bread and wine of which represented 

the body and the blood of our Lord Jesus. 

The disciples, full of the enthusiasm which 

had been incited for some days previous, 

were all at a loss to understand the sadness of our Lord 

Jesus. While He was saying, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, 

even unto death" (Matt. 26:38) and desiring that 

His baptism might be accomplished, they were inclined 

to think that He was taking a pessimistic view of matters. 

During the five preceding days the disciples had witnessed 
the feast in the house of Lazarus, Martha and 
Mary, the breaking of the alabaster box of ointment, the 
riding on the ass, and the spreading of palm branches 
for the little animal to walk on, and the demonstration 
of the people, who had cried, "Blessed is He that cometh 
in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest!" 
(Matt. 21:9.) They had heard the Pharisees ask Jesus 
to put a stop to this demonstration. But He had said to 
them that if these people should hold their peace the very 
stones would cry out. (Luke 19:40.) To fulfil the 

R5090 : page 274 

prophecy (Zech. 9:9) there must be a shout, and there 
was a shout. 

We remember that the little company went to the 
Temple, that the whole city was in commotion, that the 
rulers were impressed, and that they were afraid of the 
people. We remember that Jesus had gone into the 
Temple and had driven out those who sold merchandise; 
that when the Pharisees, the Sadducees and others tried 
to make Jesus appear confused, He had wisely turned all 
their arguments upon themselves; and that they dared 
not ask Him any more questions, for by so doing they 
would only make a bad matter worse. 

From all these things it must have seemed to the 
Apostles that they were on the eve of attaining great 



prominence and that Jesus would be exalted. Therefore, 
they could not understand His attitude of sorrow. As an 
evidence, we have the fact that James and John went to 
Jesus and asked about the place they might occupy in 
the Kingdom. Could they be next to Him? There was 
no doubt in their minds that the Kingdom was near. 
They specially loved Him and would like to have the 

R5091 : page 274 

favor of being near Him. Others might not care so 
much where they were placed, but James and John would 
like to be close to the Master. 

These were the thoughts uppermost in their minds. 
As a result, when they came to the upper room, they had 
not the humility of mind to take thought of serving. No 
doubt it was the custom of the Jews to have a servant 
to minister to the comfort of the guests. But there was 
no servant here and not one of them had the humility of 
mind to offer to be the servant. Apparently they not only 
did not have the disposition to serve one another, but they 
did not desire to wash even the Master's feet. 

SELFISHNESS EVEN IN LOVE 

Since it is difficult for us to gage our own hearts 
thoroughly, we should use great charity in measuring the 
hearts and intentions of others, and should err on the 
side of too great sympathy and leniency rather than on 
that of too strong condemnation. Doubtless had the 
Apostles been asked as to their motives and conduct, they 
would have denied that these were selfish, and would 
have spoken only of their zeal for the Lord and their 
desire to be near Him. This illustrates to us what the 
Scriptures declare, that the human heart is exceedingly 
deceitful, and that it requires careful scrutiny, lest under 
the cloak of good motives, it harbor qualities which, if 
recognized, it would spurn. 

Apparently our Lord let the matter go to its full limit 
to see whether or not any of His followers would improve 
the opportunity to make himself servant of all. 
He waited until supper was being served (not ended as in 
our common Version); then, arising from the table, He 
laid aside His mantle and got a basin and a towel. Then, 
girding up His garments to keep them from getting into 
the water, He proceeded to wash their feet. 

We can well imagine the consternation of the Apostles 
as they watched the procedure, and then saw the 
Lord go from the feet of one to those of another, as they 
protruded from the couches on which the Apostles reclined. 
The method of feet-washing at that time was 
different from that of today. The water was poured 
from a pitcher in a small stream upon the feet, which 
were washed and rinsed. The basin was merely a receptacle 
for receiving the soiled water. 



OUR LORD'S ACT A DEEP SPIRITUAL LESSON 

This act was a pointed reproof for their neglect to 
wash His feet and one another's. They were all silent 
until He came to St. Peter. When our Lord paused before 
him, St. Peter said, "Thou shalt never wash my 
feet!" St. Peter had too much reverence to wish the 
Lord to be his servant. He had as a natural trait, more 
than had some of the others, that courage, or boldness, 
which led him to speak out. But the Lord said to him, 
"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with Me." (John 13:8.) 
St. Peter did not understand how this washing 
would give him a part with the Lord, but he said eagerly, 
"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head," 
if this gives me a more particular part with You. The 
Lord answered him, "He that is washed needeth not save 
to wash his feet, but is clean every whit." I am doing 
all that is necessary. What I am doing you do not understand 
now, but you shall understand hereafter.— See 
verses 7-10. 

In all this the Lord was giving a deep spiritual lesson 
—that no one is naturally fit for the Kingdom. Each 
one needs to be washed, to be cleansed, before he can 
be a joint-sufferer, before he can be a joint-heir. He must 
be a joint-sacrificer in order to become a member of The 
Christ. Jesus said to His disciples, You have witnessed 
My humility in this matter, and now I want to tell you 
that you ought to have this attitude toward one another. 
You should have been careful for even the humblest one 
in your number. Whether or not it was by washing My 
feet and those of all the others, you should have done 
whatever was necessary for the refreshment of the 
company. 

THE ACT NOT THE INSTITUTION OF A CEREMONY 

We are to remember that things were different then 
from what they are today. Because of the wearing of 
sandals, the feet would be considerably soiled even after 
only a short journey and would, therefore, need refreshing. 
It was the custom that the servant should come forth 
and make the guests comfortable— not to the inconvenience 
of the traveler, but to his further comfort. This 
was a menial service, which afforded Jesus the opportunity 
to impress upon His Apostles the lesson of the necessity 
of humility in all the members of the Body of Christ. 

We do not get a lesson of the institution of a formal 
ceremony. It was only a case of necessity, of which the 
Lord took advantage to give a lesson of humility. No 
such need exists with us today. Our streets are paved 
and we wear shoes that are closely laced and are sufficient 
protection. So there is no necessity to wash each 
other's feet, at a public gathering, to have a public exhibition 
of feet-washing. 

The incident affords a lesson in humility to us as well 
as it afforded one to the Apostles. We should be glad 



to do any service, even to the humblest of the members 
of Christ, in whatever way the opportunity may come. 
There is no suggestion in the Scriptures that feet-washing 
was ever done as a ceremony. We have an intimation, 
however, that feet-washing was a custom in Palestine. 
In I Tim. 5:9-16, we read that if a widowed sister had 
washed the saints' feet, meaning that if she had shown 
such a disposition, St. Paul would advocate a special care 
for such a sister in need; for she had manifested a loyal 
and true spirit. 

There are some very good Christian people who have 
adopted feet-washing as a religious custom. We are not 
to berate them unnecessarily for following their consciences. 
Rather we should say to them that so long as 
they think they are doing the Lord's will, they are right 
to follow the custom; but that the Scriptures relate only 
this one case where the feet-washing was done in public, 
and it was very unlikely, therefore, that it was ever done 
in public by the Church except on this occasion. As the 

R5091 : page 275 

commandment, "Thou shalt not kill," has a deeper meaning 
than that one shall not take the life of another, so this 
washing of feet has a deeper meaning. Throughout His 
ministry Jesus indicated the deeper thought by His treatment 
of others; He lightened the burden and happified 
the condition of those with whom He came in contact. 
So we should do all in our power for the consecrated ones, 
members of Christ's Body. 

OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ONE ANOTHER 

This lesson suggests that the members of Christ's 
Body should have a mutual watch-care over one another's 
welfare; to keep each other pure, holy, clean and 
to assist one another in overcoming the trials, temptations 
and besetments of this present evil world, arising from 
the three sources of temptation— the world, the flesh and 
the Devil. Only as we cultivate the various graces of 
the Spirit— meekness, gentleness, patience, brotherly-kindness, 
love— can we hope to be specially helpful to 
others in putting on these adornments of character and 
purities of life, and in getting rid of the defilements of 
the world and of the flesh. 

It requires peculiar qualifications to enable us to assist 
each other in this respect. Before we can help others to 
cleanse their way of life in every little particular, so that 
every thought, word and deed shall be brought into subjection 
to the Divine will, it is necessary that we have 
experience along the same lines. Only as we cultivate 
purity of thought, word and deed in our own lives, only 
as we put on the various graces of the Spirit, can we 
wash the feet of the saints. 

Many who would reject well-meant criticism of conduct, 
who would resent well-meant offers of assistance to 



a higher standard of character, as interferences with 

their private business, would be very amenable to the influence 

of the same person if he approached them with 

such evidences of true devotion and loving interest as 

would be indicated by the performance of some menial 

act. It is the sympathetic ones who are most successful 

in helping the various members of the Body of Christ 

out of the besetments and difficulties incident to the following 

of the Lord in the present time. Oh, let us study 

and strive and pray that we may be very successful in 

obeying the Master's injunction, "Ye also ought to wash 

one another's feet!" 

How many opportunities we have for comforting, refreshing, 
consoling and assisting one another in some of 
the humblest affairs of daily living or in respect to some 
of the unpleasant duties, experiences or trials of life! 
By love we are to serve one another, but not as a mere 
formality. Any service done or attempted to be done in 
love, with the desire to do good to one of the Lord's 
people, has, we may be sure, the approval of the Head of 
the Church. 

Let us lose no opportunities of this kind; let us remember 
the Master's example. Let us not merely assume 
the guise of humility, but let us actually have that grace 
of character which will enable us to do kindnesses and 
service to all with whom we come in contact. Then we 
shall all the more enjoy this privilege as we find the needy 
ones to be members of the Body of Christ— The Christ.

"CAST NOT AWAY YOUR CONFIDENCE" 

"Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath 
great recompense of reward."— Hebrews 10:35. 

WITH VERY MANY of God's people, as well 

as with the world's people, the ideal Christian 

life is one of constant peace and tranquility. 

They have never learned that "the 

peace of God which passeth all [worldly] 

understanding," promised to the Christian, 

is to rule in and keep his heart (Phil. 4:7; 

Col. 3:15), but does not apply to his outward 

life. They forget, or perhaps never 

learned, that our Master's words were, "In 

the world ye shall have tribulation, but in Me ye shall 

have peace" [in your hearts]. "If the world hate you, ye 

know that it hated Me before it hated you." "If they 

have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how 

much more them of His household?" "Yea, and all that 

will live godly in Christ Jesus [in this present world, or 

dispensation], shall suffer persecution." It is of a wicked 

class, and not of the saints, that the Prophet declared, 



"They are not in trouble as other men."— John 16:33; 15:18; 
Matt. 10:25; 2 Tim. 3:12; Psa. 73:5. 

Only to those who have some knowledge of God's 
great Plan is His dealing with His people understandable 
and readable. The world marvels that those whom God 
receives into His family, as sons by redemption and adoption, 
should be required or even permitted to suffer afflictions. 
But to the well-instructed saint the Apostle 
says, "Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial that 
shall try you, as though some strange thing happened 
unto you." (I Pet. 4:12.) And this saint may now 
clearly discern the object and utility of present trials, 
afflictions and persecutions. He sees that these are in 
fullest accord with his high calling, his heavenly calling 
—to be an heir of God and a joint-heir with Jesus Christ 
our Lord, "if so be that we suffer with Him, that we 
may be also glorified together."— Rom. 8:17. 

But why should a share in the coming glory be made 
dependent upon present sufferings? We answer, For 
two reasons: 

POSITIVE CHARACTER NECESSARY 

(1) Severe trials and testings of our love for God 
and for His Truth, and of our faith in Him and in His 
promises, are only a wise provision on God's part, in view 
of the very high honor and responsibility of the great 
office to which He has called us. If it was proper that 
our Lord and Redeemer should be tested in all points as 

to faith and obedience before His exaltation to the excellent 
glory and power of the divine nature, much more so 
it is fitting that we, who were once aliens and strangers, 
far from God, and children of wrath even as others, 
should be thoroughly tested. 

We are not tested as to the perfection of our earthen 
vessels, for God and we well know that in our fallen 
flesh dwelleth no perfection; but tested as to our new 
minds, our consecrated wills, whether or not these are 
fully consecrated to the Lord, firmly established in the 
love of truth, purity and righteousness in general. We 
are also tested to see whether we will compromise any 
of the principles of righteousness for worldly favor, 
selfish ambition, or for any of "the pleasures of sin for 
a season." Those who love righteousness and hate iniquity, 
who develop positive characters, these are the 
"overcomers" who shall, as members of Christ, inherit all 
things. The undecided, the lukewarm— neither cold nor 
hot— are far from having the spirit of the Kingdom class, 
and will surely be rejected— "spewed out."— Rev. 3:16. 

LOVE, NOT SELFISHNESS, THE RULING PRINCIPLE 

(2) A share in the coming glory is dependent upon 
present sufferings, for the reason that the coming glories 
are to be bestowed only upon those who have the Spirit 



R5095 : page 276 

of Christ, the spirit of holiness. And whoever has received 

this Holy Spirit, or disposition, and has been transformed 

by the renewing of his mind, or will, so that no 

longer selfishness but love shall rule over his thoughts 

and words and deeds, that person, if in the world at all, 

could not avoid present suffering. His love for God, his 

zeal for God's service and people, his faith in God's 

Word and his uncompromising attitude respecting everything 

relating to these, would be so greatly in contrast 

with the prevalent spirit of doubt, selfishness and compromise 

that he would be thought peculiar, called an extremist 

and a fanatic, if not a hypocrite. 

Evil surmisings, out of hearts not fully consecrated, 
will attribute every good deed to some selfish or evil 
motive, and, therefore, "Ye shall be hated of all men for 
My [Christ's] name's sake"; for "the world knoweth 
[understandeth] us not, because it knew Him not." 
(Luke 21:17; I John 3:1.) The reason for all this is 
evident: it is because "the god of this world hath blinded 
the eyes" of the vast majority of men; because the faithful, 
who appreciate the Truth, who have new hearts 
(wills) and the right spirit on these subjects, are but a 
"little flock." 

PRESENT CONDITIONS MOST FAVORABLE FOR 
OVERCOMING 

These conditions will not be changed until the testing 
of the "little flock" is finished. God will permit evil to be 
in the ascendancy until that testing, sifting, refining and 
polishing of the Bride of Christ is fully accomplished. 
Then Satan shall be bound for a thousand years, and not 
be permitted to blind and deceive the nations during the 
Millennial Age of blessing; but, on the contrary, the 
"little flock" of overcomers, with Christ, their Lord and 
Head, will bless all the families of the earth with a full 
knowledge of the Truth. 

Therefore, dear brethren and sisters, let us give heed 
to the Apostle's words, and not cast away our confidence 
—confidence in God, in the outworking of His great 
Plan, and in all who trust in the precious blood and are 
bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit in their daily lives 
—meekness, patience, brotherly kindness, love. 

CONFIDENCE THE BASIS OF CHRISTIAN EFFORT 

With some of the Lord's people, however, there is a 
tendency to become discouraged, to think that they may 
have been unfaithful and thus to lose their peace of mind. 
In some instances, this feeling of discouragement leads to 
such fear and distress that the Second Death is apprehended. 
The Apostle seems to have in mind this condition. 
We are surrounded with imperfection of both 
judgment and conduct; and those who have a proper estimate 



of themselves must know that they come far short 

of the Divine standard and of their own vow of consecration. 

This knowledge should tend to make all very 

humble, and very generous in considering others, but not 

to discourage us. 

St. Paul exhorts all such, saying, "Cast not away your 
confidence." Let such remember that the fact that they 
have received this Divine favor is an indication that their 
offering has had Divine acceptance. Faith, or confidence, 
in God and in the "great and precious promises" is the 
very basis of all Christian endeavor. Without this faith 
one cannot fight a good fight. In proportion as the promises 
are before our minds, in that proportion we have 
strength and courage to run the narrow way. 

If a follower of the Lord has been thus discouraged 
or has felt that his expectations have not been realized, 
he should not be weary in well doing. He should go to 
the Lord in prayer and renew his vow of consecration. 
He should rise from the ashes of discouragement and 
lift the cross with renewed zeal. He should endeavor to 
walk on a higher plane than ever. If he lose confidence, 
lose faith, he will easily be overcome by the Adversary. 

The very ones whom God will approve are those who 
walk by faith. The rewards are for those who hold the 
faith even unto death. We must beware of everything 
that tends to weaken or destroy our faith. The Lord 
deals graciously and generously with us. He will do for 
us whatever is right. Knowing this we can have confidence 
in God, even though the decision of Divine Justice 
should bar us out of Divine favor. Those whose hearts 
are right are submissive to the Divine will. The Lord 
wants us to have a faith that will continue in sorrow and 
in sunshine; that will trust where it cannot see, that will 
continue under all the leadings of Divine providence. 

COMMUNION WITH CHRIST IN SUFFERING 

In Hebrews 10:32-39 the Apostle clearly shows that 
there are two ways of enduring the afflictions of Christ: 
(1) to be made a gazing-stock both by afflictions and 
reproaches, and (2) by avowing our sympathy for the 
reproached ones and thus sharing their reproaches and 
afflictions. For if one member suffer, all the members of 
the Body of Christ suffer with it. 

"Call to remembrance the former days," and note that 
your afflictions and trials came principally after you had 
been illuminated with the light of the knowledge of God, 
shining in the face of Jesus Christ our Lord; and that 
they have increased as the light of Present Truth has 
increased with you. It is not difficult to discern the reason 
for this. The great Adversary is not interested in 
disturbing those who are "asleep in Zion"; but he is ever 
on the alert to mislead and entangle those who are awake. 
And the more active we become in the service of the 
Lord and the Truth, and, consequently, the more actively 
opposed to Satan and error, the more he will fight against 



us. And the more faithfully and vigorously we fight the 
good fight, as good soldiers of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
the more we shall have of the Master's approval now, 
and the greater will be our reward in the Kingdom. 

INCREASING SEVERITY OF TRIALS 

No doubt there are many and more severe trials just 
before us. From God's standpoint, having been blest 
with greater light, we should be able to endure greater 
trials and afflictions. From Satan's standpoint we, as a 
Gideon's band, armed with the Truth, are more injurious 
to his cause than all others combined. The only wonder 
to us is that he has not assailed us still more fiercely in 
the past. Perhaps he was hindered; perhaps he will be 
granted yet more liberty to buffet us, as the night draws 
on. Such is our expectation, based upon the direct statements 
and the types of Scripture. 

But such reflections should bring us no sadness, no 
fear; for He that is on our part is more than all that be 
against us. (I John 4:4; Rom. 8:31.) His promises, as 
well as His providences, are walls of salvation and protection 
on every hand. What shall separate us from the 
love of God in Christ? Shall tribulation? No! it shall 
but cause us to draw closer to Him; and under His protecting 
care we shall rest. His grace is sufficient for us. 
His strength is made manifest in our weakness. When 
we feel weak in ourselves, then we are strong in Him. 
He will never leave us nor forsake us. 

"Watchman, what of the night?" "The morning 
cometh, and also the night."— Isa. 21:11,12.

"ANOTHER VOICE FROM HEAVEN" 

"Come out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her 
sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues."— Rev. 18:4. 

THE REVELATION of our Lord to St. John 

is a Book of signs, in which the things 

stated symbolize the things meant. To illustrate: 

In this Book a woman is used to 

represent a Church— a pure woman a pure 

Church, a false woman an apostate Church. 

In Rev. 17:1-6 a picture is given of a false 

woman, disloyal to her engagement, and 

therefore no longer worthy to be the Bride 

of Messiah. This unfaithful woman is 

branded "Babylon." We read that she sat upon a beast, 

a symbolic statement of her control of the power at Rome. 

In her hand this woman held a golden cup full of 
abominations, and thus symbolically she is represented as 
making all nations drunk with the wine of false doctrine. 



The cup suggests that the unfaithful Church, symbolized 
by this woman, had once been the receptacle of Divine 
Truth— "Babylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord's 
hands." (Jer. 51:7.) In Revelation 17:5 she is called 
"The Mother of Harlots"— a term suggesting a mother 
church, and daughter churches which are said to closely 
resemble the mother. As the mother was called "Babylon," 
the daughters— so like their mother— bear also the 
family name. 

BABYLON-MOTHER AND DAUGHTERS 

All about us we see the fulfilment of this prophecy. 
We see that the daughter systems have proceeded out of 
the mother system; that they are all developed from her. 
In Pittsburgh, some years ago, a very prominent Presbyterian 
minister said, "Wince as you will, you must admit 
that this [the Catholic Church] is the Mother Church. 
She possesses an unbroken history extending back to the 
times of the Apostles. For every fragment of religious 
truth which we prize, we are indebted to her as the depository. 
If she has no claim to being the true Church, 
then are we bastards and not sons." 

A fair examination of the denominations shows that 
they are more or less in sympathy with the mother system. 
Revelation 18 traces the history of the Apostate Church 
and foretells that Babylon— both Papal and Protestant 
systems— will fall. But the Lord has a true Church, to 
which He says, "Come out of her, My people!" In other 
words, the saints of God are scattered throughout the denominations. 
But now, in the closing of the Age, God 
sends forth the Message that His people shall no longer 
remain in the denominations; for the time is coming 
when the doom of Babylon will be upon her and she will 
fall.-Isa. 13:1-22. 

PROPHECY A GRAPHIC PICTURE OF HISTORY 

When we examine the Scriptures with the purpose of 
understanding prophecy, we find that during the Jewish 
Age, God made various types and pictures. The Jews 
themselves were typical. The Scriptures also show that 
there are two Israels, one of which is to be as the 
"stars of heaven" and the other as the "sand of the seashore." 
(Gen. 22:17; Isa. 8:14; I Cor. 10:18; Gal. 6:16.) 
Natural Israel was used of God to make types of 
the spiritual things— the "better things." Their Jubilee 
years were types of the antitypical Jubilee of better times; 
their Levitical priesthood was a type of the Priesthood in 
glory, etc. 

During the great Babylonian captivity the Jews were 
compelled to live in Babylon, to be a part of her, to support 
her, although their bondage was not severe. So today 
God's people are required to stay in Mystical Babylon, be a 
part and parcel of Babylon; to support some of her wards 
and denominations. Therefore it becomes a difficult matter 



to flee out of Babylon. But we find in the Scriptures 
graphic pictures of what is coming upon Mystic Babylon, 
and those who would escape must flee. As Cyrus, a type 
of Christ, overthrew Babylon, so a part of the work of 
the Second Advent will be the overthrow of antitypical 
Babylon.-Jer. 51:6; Rev. 18:21. 

BABYLON THE SYMBOL OF CONFUSION 

Originally "Babylon" signified "Gate of God." But 
the word came subsequently to have the meaning of confusion, 
mixture; and in this sense it is used in the Revelation. 
Babylon is a symbol of confusion. God's people in 
Babylon are dishonored; they are held in restraint. Now, 
through the prophecy we hear the command, "Come out 
of her, My people!" This call applies not only to those 
in Babylon the Great, but to those in other denominations 
—mother and daughters. "Come out of her, My people, 
that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive 
not of her plagues." (Rev. 18:4.) Be not of those who 
cannot see the errors of Babylon and who, consequently, 
are not of the called ones. 

The object of the call to come out is not for people 
merely to withdraw from a nominal Church; but whenever 
any true Christian comes to see the error in which 
he has been held, and which Babylon has taught, he will 
see that he will misrepresent not only himself and the denomination 
to which he belongs, but also the Heavenly 
Father and the Word of God, if he remains connected 
with what he sees to be error. As he realizes his position, 
the voice of the Lord through His Word tells him that he 
must stand for truth and righteousness. 

No one is called out of Babylon until he sees her true 
condition. So then, never urge anyone to come out of 
Babylon; for if they have "ears to hear," God's voice tells 
them plainly to take this step, and gives the reason why 
they should do so. This Book of Revelation shows us by 
symbols that dire trouble is coming upon Babylon. The 
nominal Church claims that Christ's Kingdom was set up 
hundreds of years ago. Consequently, they are not looking 
for Christ to come to establish His Kingdom, for they 
think that He set up His Kingdom at the time of His 
First Advent. 

"GATHER MY SAINTS TOGETHER UNTO ME" 

The expression, "Come out of her," signifies that the 
Lord's people are to separate from all things which are 
in conflict with the Divine Word. We are to come out 
of the errors and systems of error which are contrary to 
the Word of God. But we are not to organize another 
denomination, for the original call was to membership in 
the Body of Christ. 

"Come out of her, My people," is a call to associate 
with Christ, with Messiah. This call is given by the 
Lord through the Prophet when He says, "Gather My 



saints together unto Me; those that have made a Covenant 
with Me by sacrifice." (Psa. 50:5.) They were to be 
gathered, not to the Roman or other systems, but to the 
Lord, to become one with Him. Therefore they could not 
be gathered to all these different denominations, nor to 
any one of them. Those who hear the call should come 
out of Babylon and take their stand with the Lord. They 
are no longer to be mis-representatives of God and of 
themselves. 

Those who see these things and have sufficient courage 
will come out. Those who see these things and lack the 
courage to come out are more responsible than are the 

R5092 : page 278 

majority of people who are in Babylon, but who do not see. 
If those who see do not have sufficient courage to obey 
the Lord, they will surely receive of her plagues by remaining 
in, and will probably have a large share in the 
punishments of the day of vengeance. 

MANY BECOMING IRRELIGIOUS 

Many people who have been identified with the different 
denominations are not coming into the Truth, but 
are becoming irreligious. They are by no means bad 
people; and they feel convinced that there has been a 
great error connected with Christianity. They repudiate 
much that Babylon does and says. Babylon claims that 
she has civilized the world; but she forgets that civilization 
existed before Christianity began. She forgets that 
Jews are just as civilized as Christians; and that Mohammedans 
are more temperate than many so-called Christians. 
By no means do we wish to say anything against 
whatever good people have received from her. If they get 
a still further blessing, they will probably find that while 
the blessing which they previously had was better than a 
message from heathendom, yet Babylon's best is far inferior 
to the Truth, the Light. 

Dearly beloved, we are permitted to enjoy wonderful 
things! By the grace of God, we are privileged to see the 
meaning of things that were once mysterious, not only 
to us, but to our parents. While some in Babylon are 
going into infidelity, some out of Babylon are becoming 
stronger spiritually, entering by hope "into that which is 
within the veil." If Christ is our Forerunner, we shall 
enter there with Him. To do so will mean to become 
partakers of The Messiah, by becoming the Bride of Messiah, 
as symbolically represented. The true Church is to 
become associated with Christ in His Kingdom. Then 
will come the promised blessings to "all the families of 
the earth." 

As we perceive the consistency of the Divine Plan of 
the Ages, our hearts are full of thanksgiving to God. 
We see that the New Dispensation will be ushered in with 
"a Time of Trouble such as never was"; and that this 



Time of Trouble is located, among other ways, by that 
prophecy which tells that "Many shall run to and fro, and 
knowledge shall be increased"; that there will be a time 
of trouble; but that "the wise shall understand." From 
what source do the wise receive their instruction? They 
will understand according to the wisdom from on high— 
in humility accepting the Divine Word and being blessed 
in so doing.— Dan. 12:4,10. 



R5093 : page 278 

WHO MAY FALL FROM GRACE 

ONE WHO is down cannot fall. Originally 

Father Adam was up; that is to say, he 

was perfect, created in God's likeness, free 

from sin. He was in God's favor, and 

while in that condition, he was on trial for 

life or death. He sinned and fell from 

favor into disfavor— condemnation, death. 

His posterity, the whole human race, have 

been born in God's disfavor. They are 

fallen. As we read, "I was shapen in iniquity, 

and in sin did my mother conceive me." (Psa. 51:5.) 

By nature mankind are all children of wrath. 

They cannot fall any further down; for as it is written, 

"The whole world lieth in the Evil One."— I John 5:19. 

-Diaglott. 

But something occurred which has raised a portion 
of the race of mankind from the fallen condition. Christ 
came into the world, gave His life a Ransom-price, and 
ascended into heaven "to appear in the presence of God." 
(Heb. 9:24.) Thus far, however, He has appeared only 
for us, not for the world, but for all those who have 
trusted in the precious blood of Christ. His appearance 
for these enables them to approach God, to become disciples 
of Christ and to receive the begetting of the Holy 
Spirit. 

This is the attitude in which we stand: we have accepted 
the Redeemer, we are seeking to walk in His steps, 
we are lifted up out of condemnation, we are no longer 
dead in Adam. "You hath He quickened, who were dead 
in trespasses and sins." (Eph. 2:1,2.) Once we were 
strangers and foreigners, but having been "made nigh by 
the blood of Christ" we are now members of the Body of 
Christ. (Eph. 2:12,13.) So, then, we are children of 
God by adoption. 

After Adam had fallen, he was regarded as an enemy 
of God. But we have come near to God through Christ. 
We are "accepted in the Beloved," accounted worthy of 
life everlasting, if we are faithful; for eternal life is the 
gift of God. (Eph. 1:6; Rom. 6:23.) The Church, then, 
have come back from the fallen state; but the world remains 
in that condition and, therefore, cannot fall. The 



only ones who can do so are those who are the recipients 
of the Holy Spirit. 

The manner of life here during the present existence 
may indeed affect the opportunity and future destiny of 
the world. If they knowingly violate obligations, they 
sin against light and they injure their characters; but 
they cannot sin away their share of the merit of Christ's 
sacrifice, for they have not yet received that share. Only 
the consecrated children of God are in the position to do 
so; as the Apostle points out, "It is impossible for those 
who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the 
heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy 
Spirit, and have tasted the good Word of God and the 
powers of the world to come, if they shall fall away, to 
renew them again to repentance."— Heb. 6:4-6. 

This thought will well bear repetition: The only class 
that can fall away are those who have been made partakers 
of the Holy Spirit; but if any of those who have 
been brought into full harmony with God, through the 
begetting of the Holy Spirit, neglect or misuse their 
blessed privilege, there remains for them no more an interest 
in the great Atonement; because they have received 
their portion in Christ's redemptive work. 

KNOWLEDGE BRINGS RESPONSIBILITY 

The only evidence there is at the present time that we 
are begotten of the Holy Spirit is the fact that we have 
"received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, Abba, 
Father." (Rom. 8:15.) The world, having had no life 
in them, cannot lose what they never possessed. But as 
for us, "If we sin wilfully after that we have received 
the knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more 
sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of 
judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the 
adversaries. He that despised Moses' Law died without 
mercy under two or three witnesses. Of how much sorer 
punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy who 
hath trodden the Son of God under foot and hath counted 
the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctified 
an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of 
grace? "-Heb. 10:26-29. 

Only those who have been sanctified through the blood 
of the Covenant can do despite to it. Only those who 
have a knowledge of the Son of God can "trample Him 
under foot." The world in its ignorance cannot do these 

R5093 : page 279 

things. So, "If we sin wilfully after that we have received 
the knowledge of the Truth" (not if the world sin 
wilfully, but if we sin wilfully), there remaineth no 
longer a share for us in the sacrifice of Christ. 

For the others, there would still remain their share in 
the sacrifice of Christ, and their responsibility will be in 
proportion to their knowledge. We have large responsibility, 



because we have large knowledge. We have tasted 
of the Holy Spirit, we have been made partakers of it. 
The Apostle says that "those who despised Moses' Law 
died without mercy." There was nothing more for them 
then. They did not get eternal torment for disobedience 
to Moses, but theirs was the death penalty. Those who 
thus died will, nevertheless, have their share in the redemptive 
work of Christ. 

Those who died under the Law will eventually have 
an opportunity to receive God's grace in Christ Jesus. 
But if they were cut off from life under the typical penalty 
of death, how much more severe would the penalty 
be upon those who have the understanding and enlightenment 
through the antitypical Moses— Christ! The intimation 
of the Scriptures is that such will die the Second 
Death for wilful disobedience. For such there is no 
hope of recovery whatever. Let this solemn thought be 
made emphatic. There will be a recovery from the death 
by Moses' Law. But for those who die the Second Death, 
there will be nothing further. They have had their share 
in the Atonement. They have counted the blood of the 
Covenant with which they were sealed an unholy thing. 
"Christ. .dieth no more!"— Rom. 6:9.

CHARACTERISTICS OF A SOUND MIND 

"God has not given us the spirit of fear; but of 
power, and of love, and of a sound mind."— 2 Tim. 1:7. 

IN THIS TEXT St. Paul is addressing the 
children of God— those who have left the 
world, who have turned their backs upon 
the things of sin and selfishness, who have 
been begotten of the Holy Spirit because of 
full consecration to God and to whom the 
Advocate has imputed His merit. They 
have received of His Spirit, the new mind, 
and so have the spirit of a sound mind. 

In the beginning of the Gospel Age there 
were marked manifestations of the Holy Spirit, known as 
"the gifts of the Spirit" (I Cor. 12:4-1 1), such as knowledge, 
healing, miracles, tongues, etc. These gifts were bestowed 
at that time for two reasons: first, to witness who 
were God's people; and second, to confirm the faith of 
the early Church. They were necessary that the Church 
might have a start, so to speak. 

The Apostle says that these miraculous gifts were to 
continue only for a time, but that the fruits of the spirit 
were to abide— meekness, patience, gentleness, brotherly 
kindness, faith, hope and love, the greatest of all. (I Cor. 13.) 
The gifts of the Spirit died out with the death of 
the Apostles and of those also upon whom they had conferred 



the gifts. But the fruits and graces remain to this 
day. 

Just as soon as we have been begotten of the Holy 
Spirit a transforming work begins with us. But in general 
the reception of the Spirit is at first without marked 
manifestation. We grow in knowledge, love and all the 
fruits of the Spirit, in proportion as we have received 
the Holy Spirit, which is given in order to develop our 
minds and hearts and to do a transforming work, bringing 
forth the fruitage of the spirit in our characters and 
our lives. With some of us the fruitage develops rapidly; 
with others, slowly. 

The grape-vine gives us gifts in that it bears grapes. 
As fruit-bearing in nature is in one sense of the word a 
miracle, so also are the fruits and graces of the Spirit 
which show in our lives, but which are such a gradual 
development that they do not seem to be miraculous. 

The Lord is the true Vine and His true disciples are 
the branches. The Spirit of the Vine must permeate all 
the branches, and the fruit of the Vine must appear on 
every branch. The one thing necessary to remember is 
that our ultimate blessing and acceptance of the Father 
depends upon our abiding continually in this blessed relationship 
of branches in the Vine and our bearing fruit. 
If we fail to do this, we shall not remain in this relationship. 
But if we bear the fruits of the Spirit abundantly, 
we shall some day be branches in the glorified Vine— The 
Christ of God. 

FEAR A FORM OF SELFISHNESS 

In our text the Apostle is discussing the character of 
this Spirit which God has given us. It is not the spirit 
of fear, not the spirit of dread, not the spirit of timidity. 
Where the spirit of selfishness goes, there is more or less 
fear accompanying it. We can realize that with our first 
parents the spirit of fear led them to hide themselves from 
the Lord. We recall that Cain feared and fled. (Gen. 3:10; 4: 14.) 
So all down through the ages, the spirit of 
fear has exerted a powerful influence upon mankind. If 
a storm comes up, many people act as if they feared that 

R5094 : page 279 

it was something sent especially after them. 

All fear, being a manifestation of one form of selfishness, 
is made up of the elements of self-love. People 
fear lest they may lose some of the things which they 
selfishly desire to retain. The spirit of many of the heathen 
as well as of many in Christian lands is a spirit of fear. 
They are serving God, not from a desire to be co-laborers 
in His work, but from fear. They have been taught that 
they ought to go to Church. They know not what God 
might do to them if they were to neglect to go. Some 
ministers have said, "If I believed, as you do, that there 
is no eternal torture, I would do all the wicked things 



imaginable." They show by these words that they are not 
impulsed by a Holy Spirit, but by a spirit of fear, a spirit 
that belongs to sin. The spirit of fear does not come from 
God. 

There is, of course, a holy fear— a fear to do anything 
to offend God or to offend a friend. And we ought to be 
afraid of offending a friend, afraid of hurting or injuring 
a friend or anybody. If we love our Heavenly Father, 
we ought to fear to do anything to displease Him. 

In Hebrews 4:1 the Apostle says, "Let us fear, lest a 
promise being left us of entering into His rest, any of you 
should seem to come short of it." Let us not fear evil— 
but let us fear lest we fail to attain the blessings promised 
to the overcomers. God will give those blessings only 
to those who reach a certain development of character. 
But the fear of the world is wholly improper. If any of 
the Lord's people have that fear, they have received it 
from some other source than the spirit of Truth. 

TRANSFORMING INFLUENCE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT 

The Apostle proceeds to tell us what this Spirit of the 
Lord has brought to us. It has been a spirit of power, of 
strength. All who are seeking to walk after the Spirit and 
have a knowledge of the Lord's love— these He will not 

R5094 : page 280 

forsake, but will deliver them from evil. These have a 
courageous spirit, or influence of mind proceeding from 
this spirit of power. It gives them such energy that they 
are able to do more than otherwise they could. They 
astonish themselves. They have the peace of God to 
work in them to will and to do His good pleasure.— 
Phil. 2:13. 

Those who receive the Truth are very different from 
what they were before they had received its spirit; and 
as a rule their neighbors and friends discern the change. 
Where a wife comes to the knowledge of the Truth, her 
husband is often surprised to find how much more firmness 
she has for everything that is right. This firmness 
is not a spirit of arrogance, but a spirit of assurance that 
God is able and willing to work things together for good. 
It is the same with the husband. Many wives have seen 
how much the Truth has strengthened the husband. This 
change is due to the spirit of power which the Lord has 
given His people. In proportion as we get this spirit, we 
get this power. Of course, some characters are naturally 
strong, but the Truth will make them stronger. Others 
naturally weak are made so much stronger that they surprise 
their friends and neighbors. 

All who have been in the School of Christ seem to 
make like development. They become better people than 
they have ever been before. They are not necessarily 
better looking, but the Spirit of the Lord helps them to 
keep their clothes tidy and neat. It helps them to be more 



particular as to what they say and how they say it. It influences 
their words, actions, conduct— everything. It 
makes them more patient, brotherly-kind. All these qualities 
are manifested increasingly. 

Some who have been a little while in the Lord's service 
have been remarked upon by others. They say, "These 
are a very intelligent people. Where did they get their 
vocabulary? They are not well educated, yet how much 
they know of affairs in the world! They seem to have a 
general knowledge of everything." God's Word gives 
this broad knowledge, and His Spirit gives us power to 
use this knowledge and to appropriate it to ourselves, for 
we see it to be the Word of the Lord. 

We receive the spirit of love also. The Apostle says 
that the Spirit of God is the spirit of love, because "God 
is Love." (I John 4:8.) God's Spirit is God's mind, 
God's disposition, God's influence. Since God is love, His 
Spirit must partake of all the qualities which go to make 
up love. 

In proportion to the measure of the Holy Spirit which 
we have, we shall have love— first, toward God; secondly, 
to the children of God; thirdly, to our neighbors and 
friends, and lastly it will extend even to our enemies. It 
would lead us to be considerate of birds and beasts also. 
The spirit of love has a generally benevolent influence. 
Whatever affects the thoughts is sure to affect the words. 
Whoever has the spirit of love will manifest its influences 
and will become more loving and more lovable as that 
spirit increases. 

DISREGARD FOR THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS A FORM OF 
SELFISHNESS 

Finally, the Apostle brings in the spirit of a sound 
mind. Man was created with a well-balanced mind. Adam 
and Eve did not need an outward record of God's Law. 
They had the sense of right and wrong so well defined in 
their minds that they knew right from wrong intuitively. 
But when they fell, they lost this balance of mind. 

As we come down the centuries from their day to ours, 
we find that this keen sense of right and wrong has become 
dull. Thus in cannibal lands the inhabitants believe it 
right to eat each other. They think that if they feed on 
enemies who are strong, they will be made strong. This 
utter disregard for the rights of others is the spirit of 
selfishness. We see this spirit manifested in civilized 
lands also, where they do not eat up the enemy literally, 
but eat up his fortune, his reputation. 

Our Lord said that while the Pharisees were very particular 
to give a full tenth of the mint, anise and cummin, 
yet they had omitted the weightier matters of the Law- 
judgment, mercy and faith. He showed that the Law 
which says, "Love thy neighbor as thyself," is more important 
than the giving of tithes. He also said that the 
Pharisees were full of extortion and excess, and that 
they strained at a gnat and swallowed a camel, that they 



devoured widows' houses.— Matt. 23:23-25,14. 

By this our Lord meant that when a widow was left 
alone, with no one to look after her interests, some of 
these professors of religion would get possession of her 
property if they could. So in our day there are people 
who scheme to discover how they can injure their neighbor. 
They do not eat the persons of their neighbors, but 
they eat their substance, their property. These people are 
cannibals in spirit. 

CHARACTERISTICS OF A SOUND MIND 

In proportion as we get the spirit of love, we get the 
spirit of a sound mind. This spirit leads us to consider 
what is right and what is wrong, in all the affairs of life. 
Not only have we the spirit of the Law, but in addition we 
have the spirit of the Lord to instruct us. The Law says, 
"Thou shalt have no other gods before Me." The spirit 
of the Law says that we shall not permit wealth or anything 
else to take away our minds from the Lord. We 
today find people worshipping bonds, stocks, giving the 
best of their time to the worship of Mammon. They do 
not know what they are doing. 

These people are very well illustrated by Bunyan's 
picture. You remember that when the pilgrims were in 
the house of the Interpreter, he took them into a room 
where there was a man with a muck-rake in his hand, 
drawing to himself straws, small sticks and the dust of the 
floor. Above his head was one with a celestial crown in 
his hand. This crown he proffered to the man in exchange 
for the muck-rake. But the man neither looked 
up, nor regarded what was said. 

Today we see some who use muck-rakes, gathering all 
the trinkets of life, not knowing what to do with them 
after they have been accumulated. When such people 
die, perhaps these things will be injurious to those to 
whom they are left. The pilgrims had sound minds, but 
the man who was raking for sticks and straws and dust 
had an unsound mind. More or less we see all around us 
the spirit of an unsound mind, overlooking the things that 
are really valuable and grasping at trifles. 

As we develop the spirit of a sound mind we get to see 
what things are valuable, and we look at other things as 
being insignificant. More and more we desire the heavenly 
things. But the world thinks, "Look at this dust! Is 
not this fine straw?" or what not. They say, "Get some 
of these sticks and worm-eaten fruits that we have here." 
But what they strive for is all illusion. 

They say of us that we are of unsound mind because 
we care for the better things, the heavenly things. So 
they said of Jesus, "He hath a devil and is mad." (John 10:20.) 
As the Apostle said, "Whether we be beside ourselves, 
it is to God." (2 Cor. 5:13.) Others think it 
strange that we run not to the same excess of riot. (I Peter 4:4.) 
And it is true today that whoever will live 
godly will be misunderstood, slandered. (2 Tim. 3:12.) 



But it is for us to show our courage, our faith and our 
loyalty to the Lord and to manifest His Spirit "of power 

R5095 : page 281 

and of love and of a sound mind." (2 Tim. 1 :7.) The 
manifestation of His Spirit will help those who are His to 
become "more than conquerors." (Romans 8:37.) Thus, 
even if we are not helping the world, we build one another 
up in our most holy faith.— Jude 20,21. 

The spirit of a sound mind is a most wonderful manifestation 
of the Holy Spirit in the Lord's people. It gives 
them much advantage every way over the remainder of 
mankind. It sees in the present life opportunities for the 
attainment of character. It broadens and deepens the 
mind along all good lines. It makes one less touchy in 
respect to his own rights, privileges and preferences, and 
more considerate of the rights and feelings of others. 

The spirit of a sound mind makes one's judgment 
clearer, truer, more trustworthy than before, for it impels 
him to accept the instructions of the Word of God in 
respect to what he should and should not do, and to reject 
his own faulty judgment. The meek will He guide in 
judgment. Whatever may be the imperfection of mind and 
body resulting from the fall, those who receive the spirit 
of a sound mind are thereby made purer, kinder, gentler, 
less selfish and more thoughtful in regard to others. Those 
who are thus rightly exercised will develop the spirit of 
love increasingly until that which is perfect shall have 
come and that which is in part shall have been done away. 
-I Cor. 13:10.

"IT IS I, BE NOT AFRAID" 

-MARK 6:45-56. -OCTOBER 6.- 

Text:— "Straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be 
of good cheer, it is I; be not afraid."— Matt. 14:27. 

TODAY'S STUDY shows us how interested 

people become in anything that will relieve 

them of sickness and ailments, which cause 

our race to be, as St. Paul described it, "a 

groaning creation." The crowds continued 

to gather wherever Jesus went, partly for 

hearing, partly from curiosity, and partly 

because the Message that He gave was one 

of consolation, comfort, hope. He was not 

forever blaming them for not keeping the 

Law, but, on the contrary, He was continually expressing 

sympathy for them in their weaknesses, and helping them 

out of them and encouraging them to "go and sin no 



more. 

After the feeding of the five thousand, Jesus urged His 
disciples to leave Him and to return to the other side of 
the Lake. He dismissed the multitude and went into the 
solitude of the hills for prayer. It is noteworthy that 
nearly all of the Great Teacher's prayers that are recorded 
are simple and brief. Whenever He wished to make long 
prayers He went to the Father alone, by Himself. Undoubtedly 
this would be a good example for all of His 
followers to observe. Long prayers are frequently a 
weariness to the flesh, and so far as we can discern are 
likely to contain many vain repetitions, or to be attempts 
to instruct the Lord and counsel Him concerning matters 
which He understands much better than do any of His 
children. 

WALKING ON THE SEA 

The disciples in their fishing boat experienced contrary 
winds and found the rowing toilsome. In the night 
they saw what they supposed to be an apparition, a spirit 
manifestation in human form, walking on the water, and 
apparently intending to pass by their boat. They cried 
out, for all saw it and felt troubled. Then they heard a 
voice saying, "It is I, be not afraid." Jesus got into the 
boat with them, and the wind ceased, to their amazement, 
for they had already forgotten the lesson of the previous 
afternoon— the feeding of the five thousand with the five 
loaves and two fishes. 

In addition to seeing in this a further manifestation 
of Divine power operating through the Redeemer, we 
may see a further suggestion of a spiritual lesson. No 
doubt, after the Master's ascension, the disciples felt 
themselves very much alone in the midst of a contrary 
people, and found progress difficult and all of their experiences 
stormy. No doubt it helped them to look back 
to this occasion and to remember the Master's ability to 
come to them on the troubled seas, and how His coming 
brought peace and quiet. 

Thus their hearts may have been led to look for Him 
who instructed them, "I will never leave nor forsake 
thee;" and again, "Lo, I am with you alway, even to the 
end of the Age." And this precious lesson still holds 
good for all who are truly the Lord's people— all who 
have made a Covenant by sacrifice with the Lord, all who 
have presented their bodies living sacrifices through the 
merit of Jesus. He is with them continually, to sanctify 
to them their deepest distress. 

"LORD, SAVE, OR I PERISH!" 

St. Matthew gives an additional feature of this lesson 
not recorded by St. Mark. He tells us that when St. 
Peter learned that it was Jesus who walked upon the sea, 
he requested the Lord to sanction his walking on the water 
to Him. The Lord consented, and St. Peter had the 



wonderful courage to make the effort. Had his faith 
continued, doubtless he would have been sustained, but 
the Lord's rule with His people seems to be, "According 
to thy faith be it unto thee." We are not to encourage 
credulity in ourselves or others, but we are to remember 
that faith which has a true foundation is very precious in 
the Lord's sight. 

In St. Peter's case it was entirely proper that he should 
attempt to go to the Lord, because the effort had been 
sanctioned. It would have been credulity for him to have 
supposed himself able to walk on the water, without the 
Lord's sanction and invitation. But when he saw the 
boisterous waves his faith failed, he began to sink; and 
then it was that he cried, "Save, or I perish!" How true 
it is of all God's people that like St. Peter they would 
like to do some wonderful thing to show their faith in 
the Lord! And how like St. Peter's are their experiences, 
often! They would utterly fail did not the Lord interpose 
for their rescue. However, as the Lord found no 

R5096 : page 281 

fault with St. Peter for his effort, we are bound to admire 
the degree of faith and courage which he manifested. 

ST. PETER THE TEACHABLE 

Much has been said respecting St. Peter's rashness 
and the difficulties he repeatedly got into. The criticism 
is surely to some extent justified, but we are to remember 
that the Master loved him greatly, partly on account of 
his zeal, partly on account of the energy which on several 
occasions got him into difficulty. One thing should always 
be remembered in his favor, that although he was 
the oldest of the Apostles he was evidently one of the 
most meek and most teachable of them all. Of his mistakes 
he made a mirror, and thus, learning to know himself 
more particularly, he was safeguarded through the 
many dangers natural to his temperament; and he stands 

R5096 : page 282 

forth in the Scriptures as one of the very noblest of the 
Apostles. The wisdom of St. Peter's course is illustrated 
in a little verse published in the New York Sun. 

THE THREE FAULT FINDERS 

The poem tells that the three fault-finders were provided 
each with a crystal, to do with as he pleased; and 
this was the result: 

"The fool contrived of his a lens, 

Wherein, to gloating eyes, 
The smallest blot that could be found 

Was magnified in size. 



"The just man made of his a pane, 

All clear without a flaw; 
Nor summer sun nor winter rain 

Affected what he saw. 

"The wise man pondered long and well 

How best to search, to aid, 
Then, taking up the crystal given, 

Of his a mirror made." 

There must have been a great strain continually upon 
the Great Teacher and Healer, for He was continually 
expending His vitality in both directions at once. In 
healing the sick, virtue, or vitality, went out from Him 
and He healed them all, we read. And all His public 
teaching cost considerable vitality, especially when He 
addressed large multitudes. Thus was fulfilled in part the 
saying of the Prophet respecting Him, "Himself took 
our sicknesses and bore our infirmities." 

Nevertheless, we find Him ever ready, ever alert about 
the Father's business, and looking after the welfare of, 
and instructing all who gave evidence of being, or of ever 
becoming, children of God. 

When the ship reached shore in the morning, the 
people recognized Him and ran round-about that whole 
region, and began to carry about on beds those that were 
sick, to where they heard Jesus was. And wheresoever 
he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, 
they laid the sick in the public places, and besought 
Him that these might touch if it were but the corner of 
His garment; "and as many as touched Him were made 
whole." 

The healings which our Lord gave forth during His 
ministry were physical. As we have already seen, none 
but Himself had yet received of the Holy Spirit in its 
begetting power. But did we not hear His word saying, 
"Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the Age"? 
And have not God's consecrated people throughout the 
past eighteen centuries realized a blessing also— a spiritual 
blessing— as Jesus passed their way, as they came to 
a knowledge of Him, as by faith they reached out and 
touched the hem of His garment, realizing Him to be 
the Son of the Highest, the Redeemer of the world, the 
Head of the Church which is His Body, and shortly to 
be the King of Glory, reigning for the blessing of all the 
families of the earth?

GOD'S WORD NOT MAN'S 
-OCTOBER 13.-MARK 7:1-13.- 



"For the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness 
and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."— Rom. 14:17. 

THE STUDY TODAY shows that the Pharisees 

of eighteen centuries ago, while professing 

to keep carefully the Divine Law, 

and while even boasting of faithfulness in 

this respect, had gradually gotten away 

from God's Word and become followers of 

human tradition. It is so with the Jews 

today. Although they read the Holy Scriptures 

of the Old Testament it is regarded 

as a sealed Book which they cannot understand; 

instead of endeavoring to comprehend it they study 

and shape the course of their lives by the Talmud. The 

latter admittedly contains both wise and unwise statements, 

sound and foolish advice; but according to it the 

orthodox Jews shape all their religious sentiments. 

And surely the same is true of Christians today. The 
Bible is the recognized Authority and Standard, but each 
denomination of Christians has its own theory, its own 
proof-texts, its own catechism. When the Bible is read 
the gloss or interpretation of the accepted creed is before 
the mind and veils it. Thus it is that with Bibles in our 
hands and with reverence in our hearts Christians are 
divided into six hundred different sects, with very little 
prospect of coming together, because each one insists 
upon using his own creedal spectacles in the study of the 
Bible. 

If truly wise would not all Christians cast aside and 
destroy these creed spectacles which have so long separated 
us, given false coloring to various passages of 
God's Word and confused our minds in general? Would 
it not be following Heavenly counsel and Heavenly wisdom 
to take a different course and to begin a study of 
the Word of God afresh in the light which shines from 
one page upon another? We surely will all agree to 
this theoretically; shall we not put our agreement and resolution 
into practice? 

EATING WITH UNWASHED HANDS 

The Pharisees would have liked nothing better than 
to have had so very able a person as Jesus to be one of 
their number— to conform to their usages and thus to 
mark them with His approval. They could not fail to 
note the lofty character of His teachings along the lines 
of Justice, Mercy and Love. They could have forgiven 
Him for some of the truths which He uttered and made 
them wince, if only He had enforced their formalism. 
As it was, He really suited nobody. To the impure He 
was too pure; to those of loud, hypocritical profession 
He was too sincere; to the worldly-wise He was too 
frank, too truthful. 

In this lesson the Pharisees inquired why the followers 
of Jesus were not instructed along the lines of the Talmud 



—to be very careful to always wash their hands before 

eating, as a religious duty. We may be sure that 

Jesus set His followers no example of filthiness or impurity. 

Indeed, we know that in proportion as truth 

enters the heart it has a cleansing and purifying effect 

upon the entire life, upon the whole person— mental, 

moral and physical. What the Pharisees meant was a 

ceremonial washing, whether the hands were clean or 

unclean— to make a formal washing a part of their religion. 

This was what Jesus objected to. He could not 

so teach because it would have been ceremonial hypocrisy. 

As He said on another occasion, These customs of the 

Pharisees, of wonderful washings of their persons and 

of the vessels in a perfunctory and ceremonial way, consumed 

much of their time and were burdensome upon the 

poor, who had no servants to do these things for them, 

and not doing them were considered unclean, unholy, out 

of accord with the Divine arrangements, not true Jews. 

Answering the Pharisees on these points, Jesus said 
to them, You are the holy people mentioned by Isaiah 
the Prophet saying, "This people seeketh Me with their 

R5096 : page 283 

lips, but their heart is far from Me. But in vain do ye 
worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments 
of men," for ye leave the commandments of God and hold 
fast the traditions of men. 

Jesus gave them an example of how they neglected 
the Divine commandments while giving so much attention 
to ceremonial washings, which were commanded, not 
of God, but of the Talmud. The illustration was that the 
Mosaic Law commanded that father and mother should 
be honored and that he that spoke evil of either of them 
should be put to death. But this command had been 
changed by the Talmud and any man might be free from 
his parents by consecrating himself and substance to God 
and religious uses. Having done so, according to the 
Talmud, he was freed from all obligations to his parents. 
Thus they had made God's direct commandment on this 
subject null and void, which they had no right to do. 

This was the conflict between the teachings of Jesus 
and the teachings of the Pharisees. Both claimed holiness 
and strict observance of the Divine Law, but Jesus 
held to the Word of God and rejected the Talmud, the 
traditions of the Elders, and the Pharisees neglected the 

R5097 : page 283 

Word of God and held to the traditions. What are we 
as Christians doing today? "Let us hold fast the faithful 
Word," "The Word of God, which is able to make us 
wise." Let us search the Scriptures daily and critically, 
and let us abandon everything which conflicts therewith. 

WHAT IS GOD'S KINGDOM? 



Our text is frequently misunderstood to mean that 
God's Kingdom consists in righteousness and peace and 
joy in the Holy Spirit. The context shows that this is 
entirely a wrong thought. Let us follow the context 
and see. 

Let us bear in mind what we have already seen respecting 
the Kingdom mentioned in the Bible— that it is 
the glorious reign of Messiah for a thousand years, for 
the uplift of the human family, and that during that reign 
the Church will be associated with Jesus in His Kingdom 
glory, power and honor. The call of this Gospel Age is 
to select this Bride class and to develop them and make 
them "meet for the inheritance of the saints in light." 

We have seen that in the present time these called out 
ones— called to be the "Bride, the Lamb's Wife"— are 
the Kingdom in embryo or in an undeveloped state. 
These probationary members of the Kingdom, the Scriptures 
tell us, are not under the Law of Moses, expressed 
in the Ten Commandments; they are not hoping for 
eternal life through them, but they are under Grace- 
under a gracious arrangement which God has made for 
them through the merit of Christ's death. St. Paul points 
out that while these are free from the various commands 
of the Jewish Law they are not without Law, but under 
the great Divine Law, as members of the Body of Christ. 
He says that thus we, as New Creatures, do fulfil the real 
meaning of the Divine Law when we "walk, not after 
the flesh, but after the spirit," even though we be not able 
to walk fully up to the spirit of the Law because of weaknesses 
of our flesh. It is the New Creature, the desire, 
that is being judged and not the flesh. 

Accordingly the Gentiles who came into membership 
in the Body of Christ were not required to conform themselves 
to the demands of the Jewish Law. For instance, 
a Jew, according to the Law, might not eat fish that had 
no scales, mackerel, etc., neither might he eat rabbit meat, 
nor pork, etc., and in a variety of other ways he was restrained 
and limited in his eating and drinking. But none 
of these restraints apply to Christians who had come from 
amongst the Gentiles and who never had been under the 
Law Covenant. 

In our text St. Paul urges that these liberties respecting 
what they might eat and drink were not to be esteemed 
as the real blessings of this embryo Kingdom class 
in the present life. Far from it; the real blessings of this 
class consisted in their enjoyment of righteousness and 
peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. Transformed by the 
renewing of their minds, they had come to appreciate and 
love righteousness and truth; good things rather than evil 
things; pure things rather than impure things; spiritual 
things rather than earthly things; their citizenship now 
was in Heaven instead of being an earthly one. They 
had come to appreciate "the peace of God which passeth 
all understanding," and its rule in their hearts was one of 
the grand blessings which they enjoyed as members of 



the embryo Kingdom class. 

"There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked." 
"The wicked are like a troubled sea which cannot rest." 
Our heavenly peace and confidence in God are the result 
of our union with Christ as members of His Kingdom 
class. This we prize and not specially the privilege of 
eating pork or some other thing forbidden to the Jews. 
Joy in the Holy Spirit— fellowship with the Father and 
with the Son and with all who possess the spirit of righteousness 
—is the blessed privilege of every member of 
the embryo Kingdom class, every member of "the Church 
which is the Body of Christ." 

Thus the Apostle would have his hearers place a 
proper valuation upon the various favors which they had 
received, so that if the interests of the Lord's cause or 
the interests of the brethren in Christ should ever require 
them to forego their liberties in respect to food and drink, 
they would count such self-denials for Christ's sake and 
for the brethren's sake as nothing— as sacrifices they 
could make with joy, because they would not interfere 
with or disturb in the least the real value of the blessings 
and privileges which are ours in Christ.

"A CUP OF COLD WATER" 

"The Lord of the Harvest walked forth one day, 

Where the fields were white with the ripening wheat, 

Where those He had sent in the early morn 
Were reaping the grain in the noonday heat. 

He had chosen a place for every one, 

And bidden them work till the day was done. 

"Apart from the others, with troubled voice, 
Spake one who had gathered no golden grain: 

'The Master hath given no work to me, 
And my coming hither hath been in vain; 

The reapers with gladness and song will come, 

But no sheaves will be mine in the harvest home.' 

"He heard the complaint, and He called her name: 
'Dear child, why standest thou idle here? 

Go fill the cup from the hillside stream, 

And bring it to those who are toiling near; 

I will bless thy labor, and it shall be 

Kept in remembrance as done for Me.' 

"Twas a little service, but grateful hearts 

Thanked God for the water so cold and clear; 

And some who were fainting with thirst and heat, 
Went forth with new strength to the work so dear; 

And many a weary soul looked up, 

Revived and cheered by the little cup."

RESPONSIBILITIES OF CHRISTIAN CITIZENSHIP 



"The night is far spent, the day is at hand; let us therefore 
cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of 
light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting 
and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, 
notin strife and envying."— Romans 13:12,13. 

THE SCRIPTURES call attention to the fact 

that there is a night of weeping in contrast 

with a day of joy. (Psa. 30:5.) The 

"night" is that period of darkness which 

set in after Adam fell. By one man's disobedience 

sin entered into the world, and 

death as the result of sin. (Romans 5:12,19.) 

Evil has brought sorrow and the 

darkness of ignorance and superstition 

among mankind until human affairs have 

become demoralized. As the Prophet Isaiah says, "Darkness 

shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people."— 

Isa. 60:2. 

There is however a morning promised. That morning 
is to be ushered in by the Sun of Righteousness, rising 
with healing in His beams. (Mai. 4:2.) That Sun of 
Righteousness is Christ and the Church with Him. 
"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the 
Kingdom of their Father" (Matt. 13:43)-Christ as the 
Head and the Church, which is His Body. 

Another Scripture speaks of the present as daytime: 
"I must work the works of Him that sent Me, while it is 
day; the night cometh when no man can work." (John 9:4.) 
While for many centuries there has been a period 
of darkness, nevertheless since the First Advent of our 
Lord the glorious light of Truth has had more effect upon 
the world than at any previous time; for with the coming 
of our Lord Jesus a blessing came upon the world. 
At that time so much light came in, that the Gospel Age 
may be called day in contrast with previous experiences. 
This day, in turn, gave place to a long period known as 
the Dark Ages. Then, since the Reformation, a measure 
of light came in again, through certain influences which 
have brought blessings to the Lord's people. Now it is 
time for the Sun of Righteousness to rise with healing 
in His beams. 

"THE MORNING COMETH" 

We believe that the day is actually at hand; that we 
are living in the early dawn of a New Dispensation, and 
that as soon as the Harvest of the Gospel Age shall have 
been garnered, "the kingdoms of this world" shall, during 
a great time of trouble, "become the Kingdom of our 
Lord and of His Christ."— Rev. 11:15. 

The Scriptures inform us that the period of time during 
which the present dominion of Satan shall become 
the Kingdom of God's dear Son, will be a specially evil 
day. It will be a season in which all the children of 



light shall be crucially tested; a day that will try every 
man's faith and work; a day of fiery trial through which 
only "the gold, the silver and the precious stones" will 
pass unharmed and in which all the "wood, hay and 
stubble" of error, sin and human tradition will be entirely 
consumed.-I Cor. 3:12,13; I Pet. 4:12. 

"AND ALSO THE NIGHT" 

While we observe the glorious dawn of the New Dispensation, 
we notice clouds also. The Bible forewarns 
us that before the Kingdom of Heaven shall have been 
set up fully there will be a very dark hour for the world 
—a period in which sin will have great liberty in its 
operation, and during which the saints of God will suffer 
persecution. At the same time we can see the reflection 
from the "Sun," although it has not yet arisen; we are 
now in the early dawn. But the coming darkness will 
make matters appear as though the morning will not 
come, as though the night had again set in, as though the 
Divine recognition of all things had ceased. 

There is, however, a silver lining to the clouds. Soon 
the Sun of Righteousness will arise with healing in His 
beams. The Church in glory with her Lord will put 
down sin, will dispel the superstition and evil which now 
becloud the minds of men and will give clear light to the 
people respecting God and His Word. "I will turn a 
pure language [Message] to the people, that they may all 
call upon the name of the Lord, to serve Him with one 
consent." (Zeph. 3:9.) The Message was originally 
given in its purity, but this freedom from adulteration it 
did not retain. It has been more or less obscured by 
ignorance and superstition. When through Messiah's 
Kingdom the Lord shall make His Message pure and plain 
to mankind, then every knee shall bow and every tongue 
confess. Those who refuse, however, to develop heart-loyalty 
to the Kingdom shall die the Second Death.— 
Isa. 45:23; Acts 3:23. 

While the day has not yet come, there are those who 
Scripturally are called children of the light (I Thess. 5:5), 
and who do not belong to the realm of sin. We 
who are of this class have laid down our lives in consecration 
for the purpose of becoming servants of righteousness. 
We are in harmony with God and are enemies 
of sin. We have been begotten of the Holy Spirit to the 
new nature and are promised joint-heirship with our 
Lord in the future. Let us, then, who are of the day, 

R5098 : page 288 

cast off superstition and ignorance— the works of darkness 
—and put on the armor of light.— Rom. 13:12. 

ARISE AND SHINE IN LIGHT ETERNAL 

What, then, is the Christian's duty throughout this 



period of darkness? Shall we live in sin while our hearts 
are in harmony with righteousness? The Apostle says 
we must not live in sin. (Rom. 6:15.) Let us put off 
everything which we think will be displeasing to the 
Lord, everything that is contrary to the light of the New 
Day— the light which we have seen, but which the world 
has not seen. Let us put on the full "armor of light," the 
"whole armor of God, that we may be able to withstand 
in the evil day." And putting it on let us remember that 
it is not a useless weight, but a necessary protection in 
battle.-Rom. 13:12; Eph. 6:13. 

No man ever puts on armor unless he expects to fight. 
If he is a soldier of the Cross, the "Sword of the Spirit" 
is the great weapon with which he will prove his loyalty 
and strength. The brethren should build each other up 
in the most holy faith, fighting the good fight and showing 
their loyalty to the Lord and to the Truth. (Jude 20; 
I Tim. 6:12.) Those who succumb to the influences 
of darkness show themselves unworthy of the new order 
of things, and they may not expect to be sharers with 
Christ in His Kingdom, but to be amongst those rejected 
of the Lord as unworthy. 

Let us remember that we are well along in the hour of 
temptation which was promised to come upon all the 
world to try them that dwell upon the earth. (Rev. 3:10.) 
Higher Criticism, Evolution, Christian Science, Hypnotism, 
New Thought, Mind Cures and other works of darkness 
are casting a deep shadow over all who are not fully 
consecrated to the Lord and who therefore are not kept 
by His power, through His Word and His providences. 

"WALK HONESTLY AS IN THE DAY" 

While we are not yet fully in the Day, yet we belong 
to the New Dispensation, and therefore should live as 
nearly as possible in accordance with the perfect standard 
of the future. So to live will imply that we shall be 
misunderstood by the world; that we shall be thought 
foolish; and that we shall be considered enemies, not 
only by those in gross darkness, but particularly by those 
who, professing to be the Lord's people, really prefer 
darkness to light, error to truth. 

We are inclined to lay special stress upon the word 
honestly, for we believe that the Apostle used it advisedly 
and in a special sense. As we look about us we find that 
dishonesty is very prevalent, not only in the world, where 
we expect a certain amount of duplicity, misrepresentation, 
deception and hypocrisy, but even among professing 
Christians. 

Every true child of God should see to it that he is 
honest, not only in money matters, but in his treatment 
of his neighbors and his brethren in the Church, and 
above all, in his confessions respecting his faith. The 
test is being made along this line, and those who love 
the favor of men rather than the favor of God will be 
given opportunity to prove that they are unfit for the 



Kingdom, whatever else they may be fit for. The Apostle 
tells us (2 Thess. 2:11) when speaking of this evil day, 
that God will send strong delusions that a certain class 
may believe a lie, because they were not honest, but acted 
deceptively, hypocritically. 

HONESTY THE BASIS OF CHARACTER 

Probably the most valuable trait of character is 
honesty. Where there is little honesty, there is little 
character; where there is great honesty, there is great 
character. We mean not merely honesty as to dollars 
and cents, pounds and shillings, but as to the very 
thoughts and intents of our hearts, as well as to our 
words. 

We should always endeavor to do to others as we 
would that they should do to us, and not to retaliate. At 
the First Advent the principal charge which our Lord 
made against the religious teachers of His day was that 
they made great professions of holiness, when, as a matter 
of fact, they were not holy. He said that they devoured 
widows' houses— not that they literally ate the 
houses, but that they tried to get possession of the 
property because of the more or less defenseless position 
of widows. At that time widows and orphans were not 
protected as in our day. Consequently they fell an easy 
prey to the greed of those whose professions of godliness 
should have protected the weak and helpless. 

Probably our Lord would denounce a great deal of the 
wisdom of today as He did of that day. But we have 
not the ability to read the heart and therefore cannot 
speak as positively as He did. In respect to the great 
ministers of today, however, we readily see that some of 
them hold their positions under false pretenses. They 
profess to receive their salaries as ministers of Christ, 
when they do not believe in the Bible at all. Some of 
them have written to us that they are in great trouble; 
that, realizing their position, they would like to get out of 
it, but they cannot easily get another position as desirable 
as their present one; and so they are dishonest 
enough to keep their charges. 

The Apostle says, "Let us walk honestly." Let us 
take our proper stand for the Truth. While we should 
always speak the Truth in love, whether to our enemies 
or to our friends, while we should always have consideration 
for the opinion of others, yet we should take our 
stand firmly. We doubt that the Lord would care to take 
into the Kingdom any who are not honest. We fear, 
therefore, that those who have high positions are "deceiving 
and being deceived." (2 Tim. 3:13.) There is 
such a thing as deceiving one's self by repeating a sentiment 
until one believes it. 

The lesson to us is that, however others may walk, 
we must see to it that we "walk honestly as in the day" 
(Rom. 13:13), as though we were living in the broad 
daylight, so that if the world understood all about any 



transaction of ours they would realize that we are honest 
—even as the Lord understands all about it. Any other 
course is dangerous and is not "walking as in the day." 
-John 11:9. 

QUALITIES INJURIOUS TO THE BODY OF CHRIST 

The translators of the Bible seemed to forget that the 
Epistles were written "to the saints" (see dedication of 
the various Epistles), and not to the world; hence when 
mentioning certain sins they used English words which 
are applicable to the crimes of the most depraved class 
of people, instead of using such language as would properly 
represent the misdemeanors that might be expected 
amongst saints. In urging the Lord's people to avoid 
chambering and wantonness, etc., we are not to understand 
the Apostle to mean the wickedness practised by 
the most depraved and benighted of the children of the 
world. Rather, we understand him to address the words 
to saints, urging them to continence in their social relations, 
that the thoughts of the Kingdom should lift their 
minds to a large extent from the earthly affections. 

By the general rules of language St. Paul would not 
begin his argument with the grosser sins and end with the 

R5098 : page 289 

less, but reversely he would conclude with the stronger, 
as evidently he does in enumerating the list of sins given 
in verse 13 of our text. Here he concludes with the 
exhortation that the saints, in walking as in the day, 
should avoid strife and envy. The other difficulties 
would be comparatively their own affair and might do no 
injury to others. But strife and envy are two qualities 
that indicate a wrong condition of heart on the part of 
the transgressor that would eventually bar him from the 
Kingdom. 

Be it noted carefully that the various dispositions 
mentioned in verse 13— rioting, drunkenness, chambering, 
wantonness, strife and envy— result from being intoxicated 
with the spirit of the world. Carelessness of life in 
any of the earthly affairs, and lack of self-restraint in the 
connubial relationship are very liable to go hand in hand 
with a wrong spirit in the Church— a spirit of strife, 
contention, wilfulness, not submitting to the Divine Word 
and providence, but on the contrary, arousing jealousy 
and ambition on behalf of self or others, for prominence 
in the Body. 

SOBRIETY COMMENDABLE 

We yield to none in our opposition to intoxicating beverages 
and in abhorrence of the terrible results which 
they entail. No saint should ever be intoxicated. The 
Word of God says that no drunkard shall inherit the 
Kingdom of God. (I Cor. 6:10.) The Scriptures do not 



say that a moderate use of liquor brings woe, sorrow, 
redness of eyes, etc., and we are not to add to their words. 
But we do well to remember that "They that tarry long 
at the wine" probably reached that condition through 
habit, and that most of such began the use of liquor with 
the intention of becoming moderate drinkers only.— 
Prov. 23:30. 

R5099 : page 289 

Beware of the slavery of habit! Even the force of 
the "exceeding great and precious promises" is not sufficient 
to hold in check our fallen appetites when they 
are constantly being fed and the chains of habit are being 
forged. Surely the new nature cannot thrive under conditions 
which deprave even the old nature! Let every 
New Creature resist faithfully the seductive influences 
of evil, if he would make his calling and election sure to 
the Kingdom. 

There is a marked contrast between the spirit and 
sentiment of the world and that of a true Christian. 
With the world there is a general tendency to indulge at 
times in a little revelry, and with many of them there is 
a decided inclination toward drunkenness. Even among 
the abstemious there is a feeling that an occasional drink 
is not only permissible, but quite necessary. 

The Christian, however, has set before him the high 
standard of a sound mind, with meekness, gentleness, 
patience, brotherly-kindness, love. The more a Christian 
possesses the spirit of righteousness, the Holy Spirit, the 
more he realizes that he has passed from darkness into 
light. The Divine standard is to be his viewpoint always. 
Instead of looking forward to revelry, he is rather to 
turn away with regret that any such conditions prevail 
among mankind. The world considers the use of liquor 
to be proper if not too frequently indulged in. The 
Christian, on the contrary, considers drunkenness and 
revelry to be improper and to be resisted so far as he and 
his influence are concerned. 

The Christian is to display increasingly the spirit of 
true holiness. The Apostle says, "Let your moderation 
be known of all men." (Phil. 4:5.) The very promises 
made to us in the Scriptures tend to make us sober. Our 
God is most gracious! 

"What more can He say than to you He hath said, 
You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?" 

Hence anything that might lead our steps away from the 
spirit of holiness is to be regarded as something pernicious, 
for it might cost us Divine favor, our eternal life 
and a share in the Kingdom. 

The world, on the contrary, have no such incentive to 
influence them. It is their custom to indulge in just as 
much revelry as would not be too seriously disapproved 
by society. Banquets are given for the very purpose of 



having a so-called "good time." When worldly people 
get together there is a general tendency to revelry and a 
certain amount of looseness. All this has a demoralizing 
effect upon society. 

THE TRUTH A RESTRAINING INFLUENCE 

The Christian has a restraining influence which is 
unknown to the world. Not only does he wish to have 
the approval of his neighbors, but more than all he desires 
the still higher standard of Divine approval; for he is 
on trial before the Lord Himself as to his manner of 
life. Hence, with him there is a principle to help him 
to shun rioting, drunkenness, reveling or similar conditions. 
The Apostle Paul admonishes the Christian to 
make straight paths for his feet, lest that which is lame 
be turned out of the way. (Heb. 12:13.) For instance, 
if a man have an appetite for liquor, he should avoid 
everything that would tend to arouse that appetite. Thus 
he would make "straight paths for his feet," that he might 
walk pleasing to the Lord. 

The Lord does not deal with His people along the 
lines of commands. In His Word He sets the standard 
of a sound mind, not only in respect to revelry and the 
use of liquor, but to all manner of conduct. Those who 
love Him will strive to attain that standard. Whether 
therefore we eat or drink or whatsoever we do, we should 
do all to the glory of God. (I Cor. 10:31.) But we find 
that Christians called out from the world need to learn 
and to develop true character. At first they think nothing 
of what subsequently they would consider grievous 
error. As the Christian grows in knowledge and in love 
toward his fellow-men, he learns to measure things more 
carefully by the Divine standard. So we find that those 
who have been Christians for a long time show good 
judgment in respect to everything in life. They use the 
spirit of a sound mind, which is the most desirable thing 
in the world.— 2 Tim. 1:7. 

The Christian has before him high standards and the 
hope of the high reward of association with Christ in the 
Kingdom. We are glad to note that with the centuries 
there has developed a tendency toward morality and all 
the good things of life. And although there is much corruption 
below the surface of society, yet there is something 
which keeps that surface comparatively smooth, 
whatever may be below it. 

When we compare civilization with heathendom, we 
do not find much more evidence of self-control in the 
former than in the latter. The heathen live as have their 
ancestors for centuries, with very little rioting and drunkenness 
of any kind. In a journey around the world we 
saw only two intoxicated men, except in what we call 
civilized, or Christian lands. The vast majority of 
heathen are temperate. Mohammedanism has done a 
great deal for mankind in respect to temperance. So 
has Buddhism. In one city we met a Christian brother 



who told us that he was a temperance missionary. When 
questioned as to his mission, he replied, "Oh, amongst 
those who accept Christianity there is much more need 

R5099 : page 290 

for temperance work than amongst others! I am spending 
my life in this way." 

PLAIN LIVING AND HIGH THINKING 

In all parts of the world it is customary to use liquor 
in the so-called "upper strata" of society. At hotels 
abroad nearly every person at the table is supplied with 
liquor. On the steamers the use of liquor is so customary 
that to ask for water is enough to create a sensation 
among the waiters. We are greatly blessed in America 
in that alcoholic beverages are held in disapprobation, although 
a great deal is used here in social circles. Liquor 
is justly regarded with opprobrium, for it is doing a great 
deal of harm and should be frowned down. 

Christians are not to walk in reveling, nor in drunkenness, 
nor in rioting, but are to live on a high intellectual 
and moral plane. We are not to take pleasure 
merely in the animal appetites— in food, drink, etc.— but 
we are to live the higher life from our knowledge of 
God and His Plan and of all things that pertain to our 
welfare. This course should include also a sanity and 
sobriety of mind in regard to religious matters. 

The great "harlot" pictured in the Revelation (17:4,5), 
has in her hand a cup, in which there is the 
wine of false doctrine, intoxicating the people who drink 
it. This drunkenness is upon all; but we are gradually 
emerging from its intoxicating effects. The hobgoblins 
that we saw when we were under its influence are disappearing, 
and sanity is returning to us. Now we have 
more pleasure in the Lord, more of the spirit of a sound 
mind. The Lord's people should be moderate, not only 
in respect to the temporal food and drink, but also the 
spiritual. Whoever finds it wise to be careful in the one, 
finds it best to be careful in the other. Whatever doctrine 
is not based upon the Word of God is to be rejected. 
"To the Law and to the testimony; if they speak 
not according to this word, it is because there is no light 
in them."— Isa. 8:20. 

WORLDLY WISDOM NOT LIGHT 

From the Divine standpoint there are two great principles 
in operation— right and wrong, light and darkness. 
All the children of God, so far as they have received the 
Holy Spirit of begetting, are children of light. The 
world's condition is not that of light, but of darkness. 
(Eph. 5:8; I Thess. 5:5.) There are different shades of 
darkness, however. The Scriptures declare that "Darkness 
shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people"; 



"The darkness hateth the light"; "If ye were of 
the world, the world would love its own"; "Let your 
light so shine before men that they may see your good 
works and glorify your Father which is in Heaven."— 
Isa. 60:2; John 15:19; Matt. 5:16. 

Neither the philosophies of men nor their moral sentiments 
are light. The true light cometh down from 
above; and only those who are begotten of the Spirit of 
the Lord have that light. To these, old things have 
passed away and all things have become new. (2 Cor. 5:17.) 
The elements of darkness that reign in our mortal 
bodies are to be discouraged and to be expelled therefrom. 
The clause, "If the light that is in thee become 
darkness," refers only to the Church class and means, If 
the light of the Holy Spirit of our begetting become extinguished, 
how great will be that darkness!— Matt. 6:23. 

When the Apostle says, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit 
of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption" 
(Eph. 4:30), he evidently is warning us against 
losing the light that has illumined us— the Spirit of our 
adoption. The caution, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit," 
implies that it will not leave suddenly without being 
grieved. We can readily see that little things may be 
the entering wedge in the displacement of the Spirit. 

SELFISHNESS LEADS INTO DARKNESS 

"Love is the fulfilling of the Law." (Rom. 13:10.) 
We who are in Christ Jesus have the righteousness of 
the Law fulfilled in us, because we are walking not after 
the flesh, but after the Spirit. (Rom. 8:4.) The fulfilment 
of the Law is love supreme for God and love for 
our neighbor as for ourselves. Everything in the nature 
of selfishness tends to displace love. Selfishness in its 
various forms is the work of the Devil. Selfish ambitions 
have a distracting influence and in time will remove 

R5100 : page 290 

us from the Lord. The Apostle mentions as branches 
coming out of this root of selfishness, anger, malice, 
hatred, envy, strife— all of which are works of the flesh 
and the Devil, in contrast to the fruits of the Spirit, 
which are meekness, patience, gentleness, brotherly-kindness, 
and love.— Gal. 5:22,23. 

To whatever extent those begotten of the Holy Spirit 
as dear children of God allow that Spirit to be displaced 
in their hearts by an evil spirit, to that extent darkness 
comes in. A little anger dispossesses a proportionate 
amount of love; a little envy, jealousy or contention is 
very injurious. Love cannot dwell where strife is found. 
Whoever, therefore, having received the Spirit of the 
Lord, allows a wrong spirit of the flesh to return and to 
displace the Spirit of the New Creature, will in that 
proportion go into darkness. 

This darkness will not only cause the person to become 



more quarrelsome in disposition, but will affect him 
also in respect to his spiritual vision. As the enlightenment 
of the Holy Spirit gives him a better knowledge of 
the deep things of God, so, in proportion as this Spirit is 
lost, the knowledge of the deep things will vanish, until 
there will be gross darkness. The individual will then be 
in the same condition as the world in respect to spiritual 
things. No matter what he once knew and saw, he will 
not henceforth be able to understand these things; for 
"The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him."— 
reverence Him. (Psa. 25:14.) To whatever extent we 
lose the Spirit of the Lord, the Spirit of love, loyalty and 
obedience, to that extent we lose its illumination. 

The Apostle Paul speaks of the "Mystery," which is 
explained as the peculiar relationship existing between 
Christ and the Church. (Eph. 3:3-6.) No one can 
appreciate this Mystery unless he is begotten of the Holy 
Spirit. If one loses the Spirit of his begetting and goes 
into darkness, how great is that darkness! He loses all 
knowledge of that Mystery.— Matt. 6:23. 

Perhaps all have noticed that we may sit in a room 
dimly lighted and not particularly heed the darkness. 
But if we go to an adjoining room which is brilliantly 
lighted, and then re-enter the dimly lighted room, it will 
seem darker than when we left it. For a time at least 
we cannot see anything. The eye must become accustomed 
to darkness gradually. So it is with those who receive 
the light of Truth and afterwards lose it. They 
seem to go into grosser darkness than before they had 
the light. 

CHRISTIAN STANDARD VERY HIGH 

In the heathen world there is gross darkness. With 
every step of civilization comes a clearer view of the difference 
between right and wrong, and a general progress 
toward the right. Sometimes we find people in the 
world who have not been begotten of the Holy Spirit and 
who, not having the light in them, are still in darkness, 
but who try to regulate their conduct by certain principles. 
They say, "This is right and that is wrong. We 

R5100 : page 291 

will do this, but not that." They make rules of righteousness 
for themselves, although they are not willing to 
live up to the drastic laws which the Lord has established 
as His standard. They say, "We will do what the 
majority of people think is right." These people form a 
moral code of their own, based upon what others think. 
They have no standard other than public opinion. Wherever 
they go they practise what the majority of their 
neighbors think to be right. 

But the Christian takes the extreme view which God 
sets before him— full consecration unto death. He is 
considered an extremist, a fanatic, by the world who 



hate his course and think it foolish. They say, "You 
Christians raise the standard too high. We are willing 
to live up to the standard of the majority in our community, 
but not to yours. You have such peculiar views." 

The Lord's people gauge their views, not by what 
others think, but by what the Word of God teaches. 
They say, "To my Lord I must be true." To everything 
else they decline to conform. Thus they are led by the 
Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, the Spirit of Love, 
which actuates them. But if this Spirit be extinguished, 
a mind once under its control will be in a worse condition 
than that of a worldly mind; for the latter, not having 
the special direction of the Lord's Spirit, has for its 
standard the opinion of others. The Lord's people have 
lost the fear of man, and if they lose also the mind of 
the Lord, they have no fixed principle to govern their 
course. Then their natural disposition will assert itself; 
and the light in them having become darkness, "how great 
is that darkness!" 

St. Paul tells us (Heb. 6:4-6), that "It is impossible 
...to renew again to repentance" any who are 
wilful sinners against full light and knowledge. These 
have committed the "sin unto death"— the Second Death 
—from which there will be no recovery.— I John 5:16. 

Let us then, while rejoicing in Divine favor, see to 
it that we act circumspectly. Our walk in life is not to 
be "after the flesh," which leads more or less directly to 
death, but "after the Spirit," which leads to everlasting 
life with our Great Redeemer. "This is the will of God, 
even your sanctification."— I Thess. 4:3. 



R5101 : page 291 

THE NEW CREATURE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO DIVINE LAW 

PART II-EXPERIENCE OF THE NEW CREATURE EDUCATIONAL 

THE NEW CREATURE is represented by the 
will, the mind; but there can be no New 
Creature without a body. God does not 
give the New Creature its own body in the 
present life, but permits it to practise on the 
old body. And according to the New Creature's 
faithfulness in the old body will be 
its reward— either as a member of the Little 
Flock or of the Great Company or— for unfaithfulness, 
its punishment, Second Death. 

The New Creature owns the mortal body, possesses 
that body. The body is not the New Creature's body except 
in a possessive sense. If one were living in a cabin 
temporarily while his house is being built, and someone 
else were to ask, "Is that your house?" he would say, 
"No; I am staying here merely until my house is built." 
So the New Creature occupies the old body. That body 



is dead because it has been devoted to God in connection 
with the Sin-offering. --Col. 3:3; Gal. 2:20. 

The Lord knoweth our frame. He knows that we are 
all fallen, imperfect— mentally, morally, physically. His 
message to the New Creature is, "Be ye therefore perfect, 
even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." 
(Matt. 5:48.) This means perfection of will, of intent, 
of endeavor. But God knows that we have this treasure 
of the new will in a mortal body, which is imperfect. 
Through Christ He has made provision that every imperfection 
of our flesh may be forgiven on condition that we 
come to Him for that forgiveness in the name of our Advocate, 
Jesus. This arrangement is to our advantage, for 
it leads us to watch the more carefully in respect to our 
trespasses and to note the more carefully that they cannot 
be forgiven except through the merit of our Redeemer. 

THREE BLESSINGS RESULTING FROM FAITHFUL 
OBEDIENCE 

The experience of the New Creature in coming to the 
Throne of Grace for help is, therefore, educational. It 
will strive the more diligently, the more earnestly, the 
more perseveringly, to live according to the will of God, 
not only in mind, but also in body. The result of faithfully 

R5102: page 291 

following this course of daily scrutinizing our 
thoughts and words and doings must be the strengthening, 
the fortifying of the New Creature against the wiles of 
the world, the flesh and the Adversary. 

Additionally, this course must mean not only a higher 
and nobler earthly life, even though still imperfect, but a 
great sympathy for others of the human family and for 
the Church, who similarly strive against the weaknesses 
of heredity in the flesh, and also a general enlightenment 
of the heart sympathetically toward the members of the 
human family— born in sin, "shapen in iniquity." It must 
mean thus much of preparation for the future Kingdom 
—for helping poor humanity up out of the degradation of 
sin and death. 

CAUSES OF SPIRITUAL DECLINE 

Although the New Creature cannot consent to sin, cannot 
sin wilfully, cannot sin with deliberation, and still be 
a holy mind, it can become slack, careless, inattentive, 
overcharged with the cares of this life— not sufficiently 
loyal and alert to fight against the Great Enemy. In this 
condition it may become more or less stupefied, while the 
will of the flesh may gain the ascendancy in some particular. 
The flesh has its cravings, its demands; and it has 
a plausible way of urging what it thinks to be its rights 
and privileges. Sometimes the flesh is very persistent 
along these lines. 



If the New Creature become overcharged, become 
weak through a failure to eat the strengthening food which 
the Father has provided, it may be almost helpless for a 
time, until at last it becomes non-resistant to sin. To 
whatever extent the New Creature is to blame for this 
condition, it will receive stripes, not merely as a matter of 
justice, but also as a matter of correction, for if it were 
not corrected it might go on to greater carelessness as to 
its responsibilities. 

We all need to be disciplined in order that we may 
stand firm for the principles of righteousness. To whatever 
extent the New Creature fails to resist the flesh, there 
will be stripes, punishment of some kind, retribution. 
But even when those punishments come, there will be 
also manifestations of the Lord's favor. 

The experiences of the Prophet David were not altogether 
like those of the saints, for he was on a different 
plane from us. But we may apply the general principles 

R5102: page 292 

deduced from his experiences. David sinned and the Lord 
allowed certain chastisements to come upon him. David 
was contrite and asked forgiveness for those sins. Although 
he had the light of the Lord's favor, yet the Lord 
declared that he must be punished for doing those things 
which he knew were wrong, even though all the while his 
heart was set on the Lord. The after experiences of the 
man proved his contrition. He committed sin; he repented; 
he was forgiven; he was restored to the Lord's 
favor. Yet in due time he received chastisements for 
those very sins; and when he received those chastisements, 
he recognized that they were a just recompense of 
punishment upon him. 

STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF WILFUL SIN 

Inattention or carelessness on the part of the New 
Creature does not necessarily mean the Second Death, 
unless that carelessness went to the extent of intelligent 
choice of sin— wilful sin. The wilful sinner cuts himself 
off entirely from Divine favor and lapses into the condition 
of condemnation to death, out of which he had been 
lifted. Of this the Apostle speaks, saying, "We are not 
of those who draw back unto perdition," destruction- 
Second Death. Furthermore, it should be noted that none 
ever steps suddenly from loyalty to disloyalty to God and 
to righteousness. 

Wilful sin coming upon the New Creature destroys 
him so gradually that he seems not to be conscious of its 
development at the time. First, the wish, the desire, the 
pride or the ambition develops; he is not submissive to 
the Divine will. Later on, an attempt is made to acquire 
the gratification of the pride of life, the lust of the eye 
and of the flesh and a corresponding neglect of the heavenly 
things— of the hope set before us in the Scriptures 



and of the Covenant of sacrifice which we have made. 

A later development of this wrong spirit by and by 
finds opportunity, under one pretext or another, to put 
the person into opposition to the Lord, to the truth and to 
the brethren. He thus gradually passes from being a soldier 
under the banner of Christ to becoming a co-laborer 
with the Adversary in opposing the things of God. 

As the Apostle says, "Behold, how great a matter a 
little fire kindleth!" (James 3:5.) Behold what a great 
destruction of all the work of grace may be accomplished 
speedily by a little pride or fond desire or self-gratification! 
—not that the little beginnings mean the Second 
Death, but that they will surely lead on toward it unless 
the individual be recovered. St. James emphasized this 
thought, saying, "When lust [desire] has conceived, it 
bringeth forth Sin; and Sin when it is finished [completed] 
bringeth forth Death."— James 1:15. 

THREE METHODS OF ADMONITION USED BY THE LORD 

Meantime, while one of the Lord's sheep would be 
thus straying, would the Great Shepherd be inattentive 
and allow him to wander without warning? Surely not! 
Through some Divine providence, such as sickness or the 
coming to the attention of some message from God's 
Word, directly or indirectly, or through faithful testimony 
and witness of the brethren, the Lord will speak to all 
such straying sheep, pointing out to them the danger of 
the path they are taking. If they heed well, they shall 
be recovered fully, and ultimately attain to the highest 
state as overcomers. But the Lord will not coerce. 

In the beginning the Lord appealed to our wills, and 
He continues to do so. The Lord will not use force in the 
selection of the present time; for He seeketh only such 
to serve Him as worship Him in spirit and in truth. The 
same will which He accepted and which brought us such 
great blessing can reject God's favors— can receive the 
grace of God in vain and gradually draw back out of fellowship 
with the Lord and with the spirit of the Covenant 
and toward the Second Death. 

If the admonitions of the Lord's providences, including 
the counsel of the brethren, etc., fail, and if there be a 
measure of ignorance connected with the perverse course, 
the Lord may give severe chastisements to awaken thoroughly 
such a person, that the spirit may be saved in the 
day of the Lord Jesus, through those chastisements. 
(I Cor. 5:5.) Many such, the Scriptures assure us, will 
come up out of great tribulation, washing their robes and 
making them white in the blood of the Lamb. (Rev. 7:14.) 
But while they may attain to a good position on 
the spirit plane, they have lost the great, pre-eminent 
prize of joint-heirship with the Lord in the Messianic 
Kingdom, unto which they were called. 

ALLOWANCE MADE FOR IMMATURITY OF CHARACTER 



It seems to be a correct principle, however, that a person 
begotten of the Holy Spirit, who had not yet developed 
strength of character sufficient to qualify him to be 
a child of God on the heavenly plane, would not have 
judgment passed upon him until he had enjoyed the opportunity 
of coming to a knowledge of Present Truth and 
of demonstrating his loyalty. 

This thought seems to be borne out by the Apostle in 
Hebrews 6:4-6. There, where he says in substance, If 
those who have tasted of the good Word of God and 
been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, shall fall away, 
it will be impossible to renew them, he implies that those 
who have not had this opportunity for development are 
not responsible to such an extent and would not be liable 
to the Second Death. If a babe had done something 
worthy of stripes, he would be treated according to his 
infancy. The Apostle Peter says, "As new-born babes, desire 
the sincere milk of the Word, that ye may grow 
thereby."— I Peter 2:2. 

These texts seem to suggest a process of development. 
If one made his consecration today, he would not be 
counted worthy of the Kingdom today; for only through 
trials and tribulations shall he become worthy. A certain 
period of probation would be granted to him, an 
opportunity to make good his covenant of sacrifice. Then 
if he failed to make good that covenant of sacrifice, he 
would be responsible in one of the two ways, as we have 
seen; either he would receive chastisements of the Lord 
which would bring him to a realization of his privileges, 
or if wholly unworthy of God, he would go into the 
Second Death. Anyone becoming a Christian will have a 
long enough time in which to make his calling and election 
sure, if he so run in the race as to obtain. 

SELF-IMPOSED DISCIPLINE RECOMMENDED 

Sometimes God's people, appreciating their own weaknesses, 
the blemishes of their flesh, properly feel themselves 
unworthy of the glorious things which God has in 
reservation for the Elect. It is their duty to do the best 
in their power, but not to attempt to judge, to decide their 
own cases. There is One that judgeth them, even God. 
Whatever the sin, whatever the circumstances, it should 
be taken promptly to the Throne of Heavenly Grace in 
the name of Jesus, to obtain the mercy of God provided 
thus, and to find increasing help for future times of need. 

We must not become discouraged and lose faith and 
hope, even though obliged to come to that Throne, repentantly, 
seventy times seven times. To whatever extent, 
however, the sin be repeated as the result of earthly 

R5103 : page 293 

weakness of heredity, to that extent there is forgiveness, 
in the Divine arrangement. But to whatever extent the 
sin contained a measure of wilfulness, or to whatever 



extent we failed to use our knowledge and ability to resist 
it, to that extent the New Creature will be held responsible, 
and will have certain chastisements imposed. Happy 
are those people who seek to punish themselves by some 
discipline, such as fasting. The Apostle says, "If we 
would judge ourselves, we should not be judged" [chastened 
of the Lord]. -I Cor. 11:31,32. 

We should all keep in memory, however, the fact that 
God expects of us a demonstration of loyalty to Him and 
to the principles of Truth and Righteousness— in an overcoming 
degree. It will not do simply to stand still from 
week to week and from year to year and to say, "These 
are my weaknesses and I take them to Jesus." Overcoming 
is the gaining of some victory by the New Creature 
over besetting weaknesses as well as over trespasses. 
Only such as strive will be crowned and acknowledged of 
the Lord as overcomers. And their overcoming will be, 
not of themselves, but of God's grace and the assistance 
of the Great Advocate.— I John 5:4. 

THE NEW CREATURE'S RIGHT TO LIFE 

From the time that we become New Creatures in 
Christ, a right to life on the spirit plane is given us, just 
as a right to life on the human plane was granted to 
Adam when he was created. But as he lost that right 
to life by disobedience to God, so we, as New Creatures, 
if we sin wilfully, would forfeit that right to live, and we 
could not be redeemed again, for "Christ dieth no more." 
(Rom. 6:9.) Those who really accept God's proposition 
as laid down, heartily consecrate themselves, have passed 
from death to life, and the Apostle says that these are 
alive. 

That right to life, according to the Divine record, is a 
very different matter from anything we had before. Formerly, 
we had a right to die. Since we became New 
Creatures we have a right to live, unless we take some 
adverse step. Therefore, it is a very different thing with 
the Church from what it is with mankind. The world 
will gain the right to life under the opportunities offered 
to them during the thousand years of Christ's reign. We 
have that right to live now. Our "life is hid with 
Christ in God." (Col. 3:3.) Men can kill the body, but 
no man can take from us the right to live. Our eternal 
life has already begun in a sense. We are on trial now, 
and if we pass the trial successfully, we shall forever 
possess that right to life. 

Not so with the world. There is no provision by which 
the world has a right to life. "The rest of the dead 
lived not again until the thousand years were finished." 
(Rev. 20:5.) Therefore the Church gets eternal life at 
least a thousand years before the world will be given the 
right to everlasting life; it is ours now and forever if we 
continue faithful unto death. Mankind will all be awakened 
from the tomb, but we do not know what proportion 
of them will get everlasting life. We hope that many 



will obtain it. But there is a difference between having 
and hoping. We have a right to life because we are in 
Christ; because the Father so decreed for us. 

DEATH OF HUMAN WILL AT CONSECRATION 

At the time of our consecration the old creature dies 
in the sense that the old will dies. The old will, in the 
Scriptures termed the "old man" (Col. 3:9,10), is reckoned 
dead at the time of our consecration. But this is 
not real death; and hence there is a continual mortifying 
until the time of actual death. The Apostle says, "I die 
daily." (I Cor. 15:31.) His old will was given up. The 
body of flesh which had belonged to the old creature and 
which had been reckoned dead since consecration, was 
not really dead. He was not only reckoned alive as a 
New Creature, but the flesh body was reckoned to be his 
body until such time as in God's providence, by the power 
of the First Resurrection, he should be clothed upon with 
his new body. Hence his flesh is the flesh of the New 
Creature, and his body that belonging to the New Creature. 

The New Creature is responsible for the flesh body, 
and the weaknesses of the old creature are charged up 
against the New Creature. There is an arrangement, 
however, by which the New Creature can have the appropriation 
of the merit of Christ for the weaknesses of 
heredity. So St. Paul exhorts the Church to come boldly to 
the Throne of Grace, there to obtain mercy for the shortcomings 
of daily life. ~Heb. 4:16. 

DEATH OF THE HUMAN BODY 

The New Creature never dies, unless it forfeits its 
right to life and goes into the Second Death. What dies 
is the human body, which was consecrated to death, but 
which has been loaned to the New Creature to practise on, 
as it were. God gives the New Creatures their new bodies 
in the First Resurrection. 

Speaking of the First Resurrection, St. John says, "It 
doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that 
when He shall appear we shall be like Him; for we shall 
see Him as He is." (I John 3:2.) This statement is satisfactory 
to the Lord's people, for though they might 
without impropriety be curious to know full particulars 
respecting their spirit bodies— shape, size, elements, etc.— 
they can well imagine that the new conditions will be so 
different from present conditions as to be beyond the 
power of the human brain to comprehend, no matter how 
particular the description given. But the whole question 
is settled with the assurance that the Church shall be like 
her Lord, and see Him— not as He was in the days of 
His humiliation, the Man Christ Jesus, nor as He appeared 
to His disciples after His resurrection, robed in flesh in 
various forms, with various garments— but see Him "as 
He is," behold His glory, and be like Him, sharing His 
glory.

THE TWO WORDS 

PROVERBS 18:8,21. 

"One day a harsh word rashly said, 

Upon an evil journey sped, 

And, like a sharp and cruel dart, 

It pierced a fond and loving heart; 

It turned a friend into a foe, 

And everywhere brought pain and woe. 

"A kind word followed it one day, 

Flew swiftly on its blessed way; 

It healed the wound, it soothed the pain, 

And friends of old were friends again; 

It made the hate and anger cease, 

And everywhere brought joy and peace. 

"And yet the harsh word left a trace 
The kind word could not quite efface; 
And though the heart its love regained, 
It bore a scar that long remained. 
Friends could forgive, but not forget, 
Or lose the sense of keen regret. 

"Oh! if we could but learn to know 
How swift and sure our words can go, 
How would we weigh with utmost care 
Each thought before it sought the air, 
And only speak the words that move 
Like white-winged messengers of love!" 

PSALM 19:14. 



R5100 : page 294 

TO THE JEW FIRST 

-OCTOBER 20.-MARK 7:24-30; MATT. 8:5-13.- 

"Him that cometh unto Me I will in no wise cast out."— John 6:37. 

THERE IS general confusion prevalent 
amongst God's people respecting the relationship 
between the Gospel of Christ and 
the Jewish nation and between the Jewish 
nation and all other nations. In the past 



we have been too free to guess, to imagine, 
to suppose, and have not carefully enough 
studied the clear statements of the Bible 
on this subject. The Bible tells that until 
the coming of Christ— yea, until three and 
a half years after Jesus died, arose from the dead and 
ascended on high, the Divine dealings were confined to 
the Hebrew race— to Abraham and his natural posterity. 
The whole world is involved in the penalty that came 
upon Father Adam because of his disobedience— the 
whole world is under Divine sentence as being unworthy 
of everlasting life or of relationship with God— the whole 
world, therefore, as St. Paul describes, "are by nature 
children of wrath," and all were strangers, foreigners 
and aliens from God. 

The Jews were no better than the remainder of the 
race, so far as the Scriptures tell, but God, having from 
the first determined to provide a Redeemer for mankind, 
through whose Kingdom all the world ultimately should 
be blest and have the privilege of return to Divine favor, 
made a selection of Abraham's posterity, because Abraham 
himself was a noble character whose faith and 
obedience to God were thus rewarded. It was not, therefore, 
anything of which the Jews might boast that their 
nation and not another nation came into relationship with 
God through the Law Covenant. It was of Divine grace 
or favor. According to Divine prophecy this favor was 

R5101 : page 294 

to continue with the Jew for a definite period of time, 
namely, until three and a half years after the cross. 

THE GOSPEL TO CORNELIUS 

As soon as the limit of time expired God manifested 
His favor toward the Gentiles by sending the Gospel 
Message to Cornelius, a reverential and holy and generous 
Gentile. Since then God's favors are as open to 
the Gentile as to the Jew— "the middle wall of partition" 
has been "broken down." The Gentiles and Jews are 
now both received on the same terms, viz., faith in Jesus 
and consecration to walk in His steps. 

It is from this standpoint that we should read the 
Apostle's statement that the Gospel of Christ "is preached 
to every creature under heaven." He did not mean 
nor would it have been true that the Gospel had been 
preached to every creature in the sense of being proclaimed 
to all. For now, eighteen centuries later, it has 
not yet been proclaimed to all mankind. What the Apostle 
did mean is that the Gospel is now unrestricted, free to 
be preached to every creature under heaven, no matter 
what his nationality— that it is no longer confined to 
Jews as at first. Now, whoever has "an ear to hear, let 
him hear" the good Message of the Kingdom. Now, 
whoever hears and has a heart to accept God's gracious 



Message, let him present his body a living sacrifice, holy 
and acceptable unto God through Christ. (Rom. 12:1.) 
Now, "Him that cometh unto Me I will in no wise cast 
out." 

THE SYRO-PHENICIAN WOMAN'S FAITH 

The narrative of today's study fully confirms what 
we have said about it, namely, that at the time of our 
Lord's ministry, and for three and a half years after 
His death, all God's favors still belonged to the Jews 
only. The Syro-Phenician woman of our study was a 
Greek— not a Jewess. Her daughter was possessed of 
an evil spirit, a demon— "obsessed." She heard that Jesus 
was near the border of Judea, near her home, and she 
sought Him out, imploring that He would cast out the 
demon. 

But Jesus said to the woman, "Let the children first 
be filled, for it is not proper to take the children's bread 
and cast it to the dogs." She understood the force of 
this statement. The Jews claimed to be God's people, 
and the Gentiles were styled "Gentile dogs," because 
they had never been in covenant-relationship with God. 
Yet the poor woman's faith in Jesus and her earnest desire 
for the relief of her daughter moved her to press her 
case and she answered, "Yea, Lord, but the little dogs 
under the table eat of the children's crumbs." She was 
one of these "little dogs"; might she not have the crumb 
of comfort and blessing which she craved— the healing 
of her daughter? Jesus replied, "For this saying go thy 
way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter." She got 
the crumb, her faith prevailed. 

Today the Israel of God, to whom belong all the 
blessings and promises and favors of God, are the Spiritual 
Israelites. These, through full consecration to the Lord 
and through the imputation of the merit of Jesus' sacrifice, 
begotten of the Holy Spirit, are embryo sons of 
God, partakers, inheritors of the Divine nature and 
Kingdom. 

Have we not, however, from time to time heard of 
some outsiders— Gentiles— who have never come into 
covenant-relationship with God and who are therefore 
strangers and foreigners to all the blessings which belong 
to the "household of faith"— have we not heard of some 
of these receiving occasional crumbs of comfort and of 
blessing? We have. But surely these will be exceptional 
cases. The door to come into Natural Israel was barred, 
but the door into Spiritual Israel is open, and as our text 
declares, Him that cometh unto Jesus He will in no wise 
reject. Hence there is no excuse today for any being in 
the attitude of "dogs," receivers merely of an occasional 
crumb of God's blessing. If they will, the door of favor 
still stands open that they may become "sons of God 
without rebuke." 

THE CENTURION'S SERVANT HEALED 



A Centurion in the Roman army service corresponded 
to a Captain in our military service today. Palestine, as 
a Province, was subject to the Roman Empire, and little 
garrisons of Roman soldiers were stationed here and 
there, usually under a Centurion. They were Gentiles, 
of course. One of these knew of Jesus and His mighty 
works, and when his faithful and appreciated servant 
fell sick he went to Jesus asking for healing. In our 
Lord's metaphor this was another Gentile dog desiring 
a crumb from the children's table. 

The Centurion's faith, our Lord declared, was superior 
to anything that He had found amongst the Israelites, 
God's favored people. He was so confident of Jesus' 
power that while he urged that, being a Gentile, Jesus 
would not wish to honor or recognize him by coming 
under his roof, yet he besought Him simply to say the 
word and he was sure it would be sufficient to heal his 
servant. He explained that he had this faith because 
he himself was a man of authority and could command 
his servants to come and go, and that as Jesus had still 
higher authority, His messengers, whatever they were, by 
which He healed sickness and pain, could be commanded 
and would obey. He got his request. 

R5101 : page 295 

Jesus took the occasion to say that the Israelites, who 
were counting so much on their relationship to God as 
the children of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, would find 
themselves greatly mistaken in the end. Being the children 
of Abraham did indeed mean that they would have 
special privileges and opportunities, but these they were 
enjoying and were not appreciating them. They should not 
think that God would take them for His Elect people regardless 
of their character, their faith, their obedience, or 
their likeness to Abraham. They were indeed the children 
of the Kingdom— the ones to whom it was properly first 
offered, but God would not thrust it upon them. 

God did take out of their nation the "Israelites indeed"; 
meantime the rest were blinded, and for the past 
eighteen centuries He has been completing the Elect 
Kingdom Church, out of all nations, peoples, kindreds and 
tongues. But He is selecting none except such as have 
the faith and obedience of Abraham and the spirit of His 
Son Jesus— none but the holy, the loyal, the true. These 
will be associated in the Kingdom, while the natural 
Israelites, over-confident, let the privilege go by. 

Nevertheless the Scriptures most clearly declare that 
the natural seed of Abraham, the Jews, are still heirs of 
a certain promise of God, which in due time will come 
to them. To their nation will come the great privilege 
of being the foremost nation amongst men during 
Messiah's glorious reign, when the Church glorified, 
spiritualized, will be with Him in His Throne, invisible to 
men. St. Paul thus explains that the full number, to 



complete the Elect Kingdom class, must be first found 
amongst the Gentiles, and then, these being glorified in 
the First Resurrection, Natural Israel will obtain the 
great earthly blessings which are still theirs and which 
were promised to their fathers. Natural Israel will receive 
blessings from Spiritual Israel. "They shall obtain 
mercy through your mercy."— Rom. 11:25-34. 



R5103 : page 295 

"HE DOETH ALL THINGS WELL" 

-OCTOBER 27. -MARK 7:3 1-8: 10.- 

"He hath done all things well: He maketh both the 
deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak."— V. 37. 

IN PREVIOUS STUDIES we have noted 

the fact that Jesus invariably, in connection 

with His miracles, impressed the healed 

ones in particular, and all the witnesses in 

general, with the fact that the healing 

power was Divine, thus to establish faith 

in God. Today's lesson gives a special illustration 

along this line. A person was 

brought to the Savior to heal who was 

deaf and who had an impediment in his 

speech. They besought Him that He would lay hands on 

him. 

From this it seems evident that most of the miracles 
were performed by the laying on of hands, although the 
record also is that some were healed by touching Jesus 
or touching His garments. In the latter case it is evident 
that the healed person exercised faith, otherwise he 
would not have touched the garment in hope of healing. 
In another case we read that Jesus could not do many 
mighty works at a certain place on account of their unbelief. 
Hence, willingly or unwillingly, the power of healing 
was associated with the exercise of faith; it was 
either on the part of the sick, or for him by his friends. 

The instance under consideration is peculiar. (1) Because 
Jesus took the man away from the multitude and 
healed him privately; and (2) it is peculiar as to the 
means used. He put His fingers into the man's ears, as 
though to start some life current through them; then He 
spat and touched the man's tongue. We cannot suppose 
that the Master's power was limited to these means, 
when on other occasions He exercised other means. It 
seems preferable to understand that these methods were 
used in order to attract the man's attention and assist 
him in the exercise of faith. 

As the man could not hear, nothing said to him could 
explain the situation; he could see the spitting, he could 
feel the touch, he understood what was going on, and incidentally 



the healing of his person. These matters 
meant the submission of his mind, or the exercise of a 
degree of faith. Additionally, after having given those 
lessons, and while the man still looked at Him, Jesus 
looked up to Heaven, and thus the patient had a third 
lesson on the subject, namely, that the power for his cure 
was expected from God. Jesus sighed, and said, 
"Ephphatha," that is, "Be opened," and immediately the 
man's ears were opened and the difficulty of his speech 
was gone. 

The statement that Jesus sighed is worthy of note; 
we can only surmise that it indicated His deep sympathy 
with the man before Him and with the groaning creation 
in general. We remember another occasion on 
which it was said that Jesus "groaned in spirit." That 
was when He stood by the tomb of His friend Lazarus, 
and saw Mary weeping and the Jews weeping with her; 
"He groaned in spirit and was troubled," and wept also. 
The general lesson seems to be that He was 

TOUCHED WITH A FEELING OF MAN'S INFIRMITIES, 

as had been prophesied. The fact is, He was perfect- 
He did not have an imperfect body with aches and pains 
and blemishes, such as other men have, but this did not 
make Him cold and unsympathetic, rather the reverse. 
His perfect mind would make all His sensibilities more 
active than ours; His sympathy would be stronger, His 
sense of pain keener. We, as a fallen race, have become 
so accustomed to many of our surroundings that they 
are commonplace and we are inclined to consider them 
natural— forgetting that the natural order of man would 

R5104: page 295 

be the perfect order, and that the blemished state is the 
unnatural. 

In yet another way may we suppose our Master was 
touched with a feeling of our infirmities, namely, by reason 
of His losing vitality on the occasion of each miracle. 
Is not this the meaning of the Scripture which declares 
that "He poured out His soul unto death"? Daily, 
hourly, His vitality was being exhausted in the healing, 
blessing, comforting and instructing of those with whom 
He was in contact. We have a very clear expression on 
this very subject, in the case of the poor woman who had 
an issue of blood for years, and who quietly and unostentatiously 
touched the hem of His garment, saying 
within herself, "If I may but touch His garment, I shall 
be healed." She was healed instantly, and Jesus turned 
Himself about and asked, "Who touched Me?" for He 
perceived that virtue, vitality, had gone out of Him. 

This thought, that the Master was not merely using 
a Divine power as an Agent of God, but that He was 
using up His physical power for man's relief, should 
properly bring our hearts into very close touch and sympathy 



with Him, and give us that much clearer view of 

R5104: page 296 

the Savior's love, and that much better foundation for 
confidence in Him in respect to all our affairs. 

In the miracle under consideration in this lesson, our 
Lord's sigh may also have been, as with us, an evidence 
of physical weakness— the result of His bestowing 
of His vitality and energy in the cure of the patient. 
We are not to think of the death of Jesus, therefore, as 
having been entirely accomplished at Calvary. Rather 
are we to understand that it began at His consecration, 
at thirty years of age, at Jordan, and that it continued 
day after day, and year after year, and merely culminated 
and was finished at Calvary. 

The day before His crucifixion our Lord intimated 
this. Speaking of His consecration unto death, He said, 
"My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death; I 
have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened 
until it be accomplished!" It was accomplished 
fully the following day, on Calvary, when He cried, "It 
is finished!" His baptism into death was accomplished. 

"HE DOETH ALL THINGS WELL" 

It is following the account of this miracle that we 
read that the multitude declared the words of our text. 
We are not, however, to understand that merely this one 
healing was the basis of their comment, for the account 
of these same instances by St. Matthew (15:29-31) tells 
of great multitudes gathered, having with them many 
lame, blind, dumb and maimed and many others, and 
they cast them down at His feet, and He healed them, 
insomuch that the multitudes wondered when they saw 
the dumb speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to 
walk and the blind to see, and they glorified the God of 
Israel. 

"MANIFESTED FORTH HIS GLORY" 

Let us never lose sight of the great central thought 
connected with our Lord's miracles. His mission was not 
to heal the sick and to cast out devils, but to "give His 
life a ransom for all, to be testified in due time." The 
secondary feature of His work was the calling of the 
"Israelites indeed" to be His footstep followers, who 
would be received of the Father and begotten of the Holy 
Spirit, at and after Pentecost. The miracles and cures 
performed were merely incidentals and not His real 
work. They were incidental in the sense that they were 
illustrations on a small scale of the great work which 
His Kingdom will accomplish during the thousand years 
of His reign. Then "all the blind eyes shall be opened 
and all the deaf ears shall be unstopped." 

It would have been a still greater and grander work 



for Jesus to have expounded the Divine Plan, and to 
have opened the eyes of the understanding of the people, 
and their deaf ears; but this work could not be accomplished 
to any extent until after He had ascended up on 
high, and had appropriated the merit of His sacrifice to 
the justification of believers. Hence it was that Jesus 
said to His disciples, "Greater works than these shall ye 
do, because I go to My Father." 

And so it is today that the followers of Jesus are 
permitted to do greater things than He did, greater than 
any of those miracles, because it is surely a greater 
miracle to open the mental eyes than to open the physical; 
to unstop the mental ears is more wonderful than 
to open the physical ears; to cause the dumb to sing 
praises to God in the spirit of their minds is still greater 
work than the giving of natural speech. It is not that 
we can do greater works than Jesus of ourselves, nor 
that we could do as great, for without Him we could do 
nothing. As it was Jesus who did the cures accomplished 
by His Apostles when He sent them forth to heal 
the sick and to cast out devils, so it is Jesus now who is 
doing these greater things through His consecrated 
people. 

ANOTHER MULTITUDE MIRACULOUSLY FED 

The account in the conclusion of this lesson, of the 
feeding of four thousand people with seven loaves, and 
the taking up of seven hampers of fragments, was another 
manifestation of Jesus' power, or as He would 
express it, of the Divine power in Him. When the five 
thousand were fed, five loaves and two fishes were used, 
and they were gotten from a small boy. In this case 
the disciples themselves had seven loaves, and gave their 
all for the feeding of the multitude, and all had sufficient; 
and the fragments, according to the Master's direction, 
were again collected. 

It is worthy of note that in both cases the Master 
displayed frugality and encouraged economy on the part 
of His followers. No doubt it would have been just as 
easy for Him to have created more delicate viands and 
in great variety. The loaves used then were the same 
as are used in Palestine today by the natives; they are 
about the size of our large buns and are made of the 
entire wheat, ground. Many of the strong natives of 
Egypt and Palestine seem to live almost exclusively on 
this bread, about two such small loaves constituting a 
meal. Quite possibly some of us would find ourselves 
equally healthy and strong on similarly plain food. It 
is for us to exercise faith in God and to partake of our 
daily bread with grateful hearts; there will be a blessing 
in it, however plain.

THE HOLY SCRIPTURES THE SOURCE OF TRUE WISDOM 

IT IS POSSIBLE that even the Lord's people 

may sometimes fail to appreciate the value 

of that great Book, the Bible, which has 

exerted more influence in the world than 

all other books combined. Few realize that 

the Bible has been in the hands of the public 

for only about one century. When our 

oldest Bible Societies were organized, 

Bibles were possessed by the rich alone. 

Now they are to be found in every house 

and can be obtained free of cost by the destitute. Additionally, 

many helps to Scripture study are in print and 

people are learning the value of some of these and the 

usefulness of Bible Concordances. 

Furthermore, we are prone to forget that general 
knowledge has just begun to reach the masses. It is not 
more than a dozen years since education has been made 
compulsory in all the most civilized lands. Thus God has 
favored our day in a two-fold manner— by giving us the 
Bible and by giving the intelligence necessary to its study. 

HIGHER CRITICISM THE MOST DANGEROUS ENEMY TO 
FAITH 

But just as these most precious opportunities are in 
the hands of the masses, just as these blessings of increased 
knowledge are being given to humanity, just as 
Christendom is prepared for Bible Study, the Lord has 
allowed the Adversary to bring forward the most subtle 
influence in opposition to the Scriptures. The foul-mouthed 
infidelity of the past has been supplanted by a 
far more dangerous enemy to Christian faith— the infidelity 
generally known as "Higher Criticism," dangerous 
because of its insidious character. 

R5104: page 297 

Higher Criticism has entrenched itself in nearly all 
the colleges and theological seminaries of Christendom. 
While all of our churches of all denominations ostensibly 
stand as defenders of the Bible, yet the citadel of faith is 
being captured by the great Adversary of God and the 
Truth— Satan— who is deceiving, estranging and misleading 
the hosts of Christendom through the very theological 
professors and doctors of divinity to whom they have 
been led to look for spiritual light and direction and whom 
they had supposed to be stanch defenders of the Bible as 
the inspired Word of God. 

This arraignment is severe, but it is a generally truthful 
one, as each may demonstrate for himself. Most regretfully 
we are persuaded that four out of every five of 
all the ministers and Sunday School superintendents of 
Christendom have ceased to believe in the Bible as the 



Divinely inspired revelation of the will and the purposes 
of the Almighty. Some of these, nevertheless, claim to 
be earnest followers of Jesus, as the Son of God and of 
Divine origin. Yet how weak is their position! If 
Moses did not write the Law, if that Law is not inspired, 
what shall we think of Jesus and His Apostles, who accepted 
these writings as inspired and founded all their 
teachings thereupon? Most evidently, Higher Critics who 
still believe in Jesus as the Divine Son of God have not 
thought logically on the proposition, and upon further 
reflection will reject everything pertaining to the 
Scriptures. 

R5105 : page 297 

THOUSANDS ARE FALLING INTO INFIDELITY 

While sorrowfully we behold the fulfilment of the 
Scriptures in the falling away of these our friends who 
have been ensnared by the great Fowler (Psa. 91:3), we 
are not compelled by anything either in reason or in the 
Scriptures to suppose that their punishment for such infidelity 
will be eternal torment. We feel sure that the 
Lord's people are growing stronger in their faith day by 
day, even though as foretold by the Scriptures a thousand 
shall fall at their side and ten thousand at their right 
hand. -Psa. 91:7. 

The study of the Bible with the assistances which God 
now provides is clearing up the mysteries which have perplexed 
us all our lives and is bringing us to greater appreciation 
of His glorious purposes, to greater loyalty to 
Him and to a more earnest desire to serve His Cause of 
Righteousness and to lift up the standard of the Cross of 
Christ. Truly, as the Lord through the Prophet has 
promised, our feet have been kept from stumbling, because 
the greater intelligence of our day has lifted us up 
to a higher plane of devotion and appreciation of the 
heights and depths and lengths and breadths of the love 
of God, which passeth all understanding ! 

SOME MAY BE RECOVERED FROM THE SNARE OF THE 
FOWLER 

We are not speaking harshly nor unkindly of our dear 
friends who are stumbling over the educational opportunities 
of our day. On the contrary, we sympathize with 
them. Once we stood exactly where they stand. Once 
we repudiated the Bible as the Word of God. We were 
as honest then as we are today, and feel bound to give 
credit to others for equal honesty. We explain their 
position by the realization of the fact that they are 
blinded by the dazzling glare of the earthly science of 
our day. If they ever knew the Scriptures, they have forgotten 
and have dropped the Science which comes only 
from above. We trust that some of them may be recovered 
from the snare of the Adversary, as were we. 



There is, however, a marked difference between the 
position of the so-called Higher Critics and that of ourself. 
The majority of them seem to exult in their unbelief 
and to pride themselves upon opposition to the Bible, 
while our position was the very reverse of this. We deplored 
the necessity for abandoning the Bible. We considered 
it the rational thing to expect from the Supreme 
Creator some revelation of His purposes respecting mankind 
—the object of their creation, the purpose to be attained 
by the permission of evil and kindred themes. 
This revelation we had hoped the Bible to contain. 

We have no doubt that many of you have had experiences 
similar to our own. Let us hope that as we have 
been recovered from the snare of the Fowler, so also may 
some others be. Let us be prompt to lend the helping 
hand and to give an encouraging word. Let us realize 
that to the honest-hearted the loss of the Bible must mean 
disaster to faith and hope, as it was in our own case. Let 
us trust that there are many others as honest as ourselves, 
who will yet be recovered. Let us be encouraged to 
help them by a remembrance of how great a blessing 
came to us through the proper understanding of the Word.

INTERESTING QUESTIONS 

WILL GREAT COMPANY HAVE PART IN FIRST RESURRECTION? 

QUESTION. -Will the Great Company have 
part in the First Resurrection? 

Answer.— Those in the First Resurrection 
will live and reign with Christ a thousand 
years. (Rev. 20:4,6.) Therefore 
those of the Great Company will have no 
part whatever in the First Resurrection. 
The Apostle Paul speaks of Christ's Resurrection 
—"That I might know Him and the 
power of His Resurrection and the fellowship 
of His sufferings, being made conformable unto His 
death." (Phil. 3:10.) This is the First Resurrection. 

There are, however, two other Scriptures which include 
the Great Company: Heb. 12:23, where the Apostle 
speaks of the Church of the First-borns whose names are 
written in heaven, and Rev. 2:27, where mention is made 
of those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of 
Life. All will attain life on the spirit plane, whose names 
are written in the Book of the Lamb, and the Lord said 
that He would not blot out the names of any overcomers. 
-Rev. 3:5. 

Do the Great Company overcome? Yes. God has no 
blessings to give to those who are not overcomers. What 
is the difference between the Great Company and the Little 
Flock? The difference is that the Little Flock are 



those who are more than loyal to God. The Great Company 
will be loyal to God in that they will not withhold 
their lives when the test shall come. They will perish 
rather than deny the Lord; and thus they will experience 
the destruction of the flesh. But they did not go forth 
with sufficient zeal to carry out their consecration. They 
were loyal to God, but they did no more than maintain 
their loyalty. 

Then we have our Lord's statement as recorded in 
John 5:28,29: "For the hour is coming, in the which all 
that are in the graves shall hear His voice and shall 
come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection 
of life." This will include both the Little Flock and 
the Great Company; both classes will get eternal life. If 
this statement includes the Ancient Worthies, then it 

R5105 : page 298 

means three classes: the Little Flock, the Great Company 
and the Ancient Worthies, though there will 
be different planes of perfection— human perfection, 
then the perfection that will be like that of the angels, 
and lastly the perfection that will come to those who shall 
be like Christ, namely, that of the Divine nature. 



"WISDOM-RIGHTEOUSNESS-SANCTIFICATION-REDEMPTION" 

Question.— In what way was our Lord made unto us 
wisdom, righteousness [justification], sanctification and 
redemption?— I Cor. 1:30. 

Answer.— In a great variety of ways our Lord was 
made unto us wisdom. He is the Head of the Church 
which is His Body. And as the head is the center of 
knowledge, so the Lord Jesus is the Head of His Church. 
But the particular thought of the text seems to be that 
of a progressive order. Looking, then, to see how Jesus 
was our wisdom before He became our Justifier and 
Sanctifier, we perceive that the Scriptural declaration is 
that "no man cometh to the Father but by" our Lord. 

Previous to justification the Father draws, for none 
can come to Christ except through the Father. After the 
Father has drawn, the wisdom comes from Christ, who 
instructs us how to come to the Father. Just as the 
disciples were instructed by our Lord, so it is all the way 
down throughout the Age. There is no other way by 
which men may be saved— "None other name under 
heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." 

Sinners could not be acceptable to the Father except 
by the way of justification such as the Father has provided. 
This justification means their blessing. "Come 
unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will 
give you rest." (Matt. 1 1:28.) We need to be instructed. 
The light was not prior to Jesus Christ; for we read that 
He is the Light. He makes that statement Himself: "I 



am the light of the world; he that followeth Me shall not 
walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." — 
John 1:9; 8:12. 

This wisdom was first promulgated by our Lord. So 
the same wisdom which instructed His disciples guides 
men back to the Father, instructs them as to what 
discipleship means, makes them wise in order that they 
may take the steps by which that discipleship is to be 
gained. Whoever will be His disciples must take up their 
cross and follow Him. No matter in what way one may 
get the wisdom, it comes to him from our Lord Jesus 
Christ; and without this wisdom we could not know how 
to come to God. No one can ever come to God without 
this wisdom. And so His wisdom instructs what will be 
the reward of discipleship. 

Our Lord appeared in the presence of God for us— on 
our behalf. Thus, according to the Father's plan and arrangement, 
He became the Justifier of those who come 
to the Father by Him, and none can get the justification 
except by a consecration of life. Then He becomes their 
sanctification by assisting them in everything necessary 
to their sanctification. They have the will to do, and as 
they have this will, so now He works in them a sanctified 
character in life. 

This course being followed, the one who has the wisdom 
of the narrow way first obtains justification through 
our Lord's blood and then sanctification through following 
in the Lord's footsteps. Finally comes the deliverance 
[redemption] by the First Resurrection. The One 
who led us all the way is the One who leads us still and 
who will finally lead us into the New Jerusalem, the 
glorious condition beyond the veil. 

FORGIVENESS OF ALL SIN 

Question.— "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and 
just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all 
unrighteousness." (I John 1:9.) How comprehensive is 
the word "all" here used? 

Answer.— Except sin against the Holy Spirit (Matt. 12:31,32), 
all manner of sin amongst the sons of men 
shall be forgiven, either in this Age or in the Age to 
come. The Holy Spirit here denotes a light, an intelligence, 
respecting God's purpose. Whoever wilfully and 

R5106 : page 298 

intelligently would sin against Jesus, would be guilty of 

blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. But if he blaspheme 

the name of Jesus, being deceived in some way, then the 

sin is not blasphemy against the Holy Spirit and may be 

forgiven. In the case of the Church, these forgivable 

sins will be forgiven through the Advocate, who has appeared 

for us in the Heavenly Court and can restore us 

to favor with the Father, unless we sin against full light 

and knowledge. To do this would be to take ourselves 



out of His hands. 

But there might be a sin partly wilful— a sin in which 
both superstition or weakness and a certain amount of 
wilfulness had a part. As to how this would be possible 
we answer that there is a difference between the forgiveness 
of the moral obliquity and the sin. For instance, 
a child has committed some trespass and the parent says, 
"I will punish you for what you have done." There 
might be two parts of the punishment, one corporal punishment, 
the other the displeasure of the parent. 

With some children the latter part of the punishment, 
the cloud between the child and parent, would be unbearable. 
Then the parent might say, "Since you tell me 
that you are sorry and that you will never do it again, 
I forgive you. But I told you that there would be a 
penalty attaching to disobedience. I will make the penalty 
as light as would seem best in my judgment, but 
you must still bear punishment." And that which would 
be proper for an earthly parent we may consider might 
be done by the Heavenly Father. 

In the case of the Prophet David: he committed two 
very serious, grievous sins— one in respect to Uriah and 
Uriah's wife, and the other in respect to Uriah's death. 
But we remember with what perseverance David pleaded 
with the Lord; and though the Lord indicated His forgiveness, 
yet there must be a punishment. David's child 
died. -2 Sam. 12:15-22. 

Again, Satan provoked David to number Israel, contrary 
to the command of the Lord; God was displeased 
and smote Israel. Again David repented and prayed 
earnestly for forgiveness. The Lord offered him three 
things, one of which he must choose as the punishment 
for his sin. "Thus," saith the Lord, "Choose thee either 
three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed 
before thy foes, or else three days the sword of the Lord, 
even the pestilence in the land, and the angel of the Lord 
destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel." (I Chron. 21:10-14.) 
Realizing his own weakness, David, in 
humility declined to make a choice. The three days' 
pestilence was sent upon Israel, and there fell seventy 
thousand men; but in the meantime, before the punishment 
reached David, he had received the Lord's forgiveness 
for his sin. 

So with the sins of the Lord's people. If there is 
more or less of ignorance, then the punishment is in proportion 
to the amount of wilfulness. Temptations come 
to us and to all mankind. Christ died for man's sin, 
from which He freely absolves the whole human family— 
the Church now, and the world in their day of trial.

INTERESTING LETTERS 



DEAR PASTOR AND BROTHER BELOVED IN THE LORD:- 

Greetings! Since I cannot see my way to join in personal 
fellowship with you and the dear friends in Aberdeen, I must 
give vent to my sentiments by writing a few words to congratulate 
you, the Lord's honored servant, on this welcome 
visit to the "Granite City." 

How could I let such an opportunity pass without telling 
you that my heart still warms toward you because of the soul-cheering 
message, which flows from your lips and pen, setting 
atune the melodious heartstrings of so many of the Lord's 
holy harpers! 

I know you will respond, "Let the praise be His," but as the 
Master said, "Whom my Father honors I will also honor"; 
therefore, I thank you, as the servant whom He uses in dispensing 
His favors so free, and my sincere prayer, in which 
Sister Blaikie joins, is that the good Lord shall continue to 
bless and prosper you in your earnest labors of love on behalf 
of His precious, consecrated flock. 

Humbly yours, in the Morning Light, 

R. W. BLAIKIE.-Scotland.

MY DEAR PASTOR RUSSELL:- 

We are now paying our 15th annual visit as evangelists to 
our native county of Worcestershire, and being supplied from 
your London depot with two large parcels of your publications, 
we are entering upon a new phase of the Mission. We 
have already distributed large quantities in Sydenham and 
London. I regard them as direct and powerful weapons of 
destruction against (1) Darwin's doctrine of Evolution; (2) 
Roman Catholicism; (3) John Calvinism; (4) The natural 
immortality of the soul; (5) The ferocious doctrine of Eternal 
Torment in hell; (6) The monkish teaching of an eternal 
Devil:— and reconstruction in favor of (1) A Scriptural 
mode of exegesis of the Bible; (2) The true science of geology 
and the creation of the earth, involving its perpetuity; 
(3) The divinity of Christ on which doctrine the Ransom-price 
is paid; (4) God's "plan" of destroying evil and establishing 
everlasting righteousness as one Jehovah; (5) 
Making future life depend on resurrection; (6) The doctrine 
of Restitution "of all things spoken by the mouth of the Holy 
Prophets since the world began." 

In these books issued by your Society there is a grace 
and power of expression which, accompanied by high intelligence, 
makes them most suitable to place in the hands of 
all classes, the religious and the irreligious alike, and therefore 
the uncompromising spirit of toleration and the absence 
of offensive dogma breathed through every page of these 
writings reflects great credit upon both the publishers and 
the author. They are well adapted to accomplish the work 
for which they are intended. I am pleased, even delighted, 
at having discovered such labor and laborers in the Master's 
vineyard and I hope heartily to co-operate in such labors 



until "the laborer's task is o'er" and we are called to higher 
services. 

The teachings are not new to me as you will have observed 
from my publications, but although David and Solomon 
were closely related, and deeply interested in God's purposes, 
what David was not called upon nor permitted to do, 
Solomon in due time accomplished. 
"God moves in a mysterious way 
His wonders to perform." 
He is the Great Supreme. Praise His Holy Name! 

Yours in the hope of Christ, (REV.) J. MARTIN. 



DEAR PASTOR RUSSELL:- 

I have been enjoying the light of Present Truth for two 
and a half years. The Vow did not appeal to me when first 
I read it, but as time passed I realized the narrowness of 
the way and in November last I decided to take the Vow, 
and have been greatly blessed by so doing. In times of 
trial it has been a great help to know that others of like 
precious faith are praying for me. The part that helps me 
most is scrutinizing my thoughts and words. 

Before coming into Present Truth I was a member of 
the M. E. Church. When my husband received Present 
Truth I felt very much worried about him and asked my 
Pastor if he had ever heard of MILLENNIAL DAWN books. 
He told me that the books were worse than poison; if they 
were branded poison, no one would touch them. As my 
husband attended the church with me I asked the minister 
to call and have a talk with him, but he never came and 
I thought he did not do his duty; so I left the church and 
went to a mission. My friends and I prayed earnestly for 
my husband and at last I pleaded with our Heavenly Father 
to show me if I was wrong and my husband was right. 

In a short time I got the "hell" theory cleared up; having 
a dear brother burned to death who did not profess to be 
a Christian, and, having asked fully one dozen ministers 
where he was and gotten ten different answers, it almost 
made me an unbeliever in the Bible! 

May the dear Father continue to bless you! Grace be to 
you, and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ! 

Brother Moody and I send our names, as we have taken 
the Vow. 

With Christian love, 

MR. AND MRS. EDWIN R. MOODY.-Can.

VIEWS FROM THE WATCH TOWER 
ZIONISM FAVORED BY TURKEY 



PALESTINE LIFTS up its head with hope. 

The new Governor of Jerusalem has recently 

made a most sympathetic pronouncement. 

It is believed that he voices the sentiment 

of the Turkish Government. Everywhere 

the Pacha, Muhdi Bey, is enthusiastically 

received by the Jewish colonists. The 

principal of these, Richon-le-Zion, gave a 

gala dinner in the Pacha's honor. At it the 

colonists expressed unswerving fidelity of the Jews to the 

Ottoman Constitutional Government. 

The Governor made quite a lengthy speech, the substance 
of which is reported as follows: 

"Gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank you for the 
hearty reception you have accorded me. 

"You have undoubtedly heard from both people and 
press abroad that our Government objects to Zionism. 
This is incorrect. We, Ottomans, know the Jews too well 
to suspect them of disloyalty. 

"We know that the Jews do not come to Palestine for 
mere political reasons. It is the holy associations connected 
with this land that act magnetically upon them; 
therefore our Ottoman Government has no reason to oppose 
Zionism. 

"History proves that Turkey has always welcomed the 
Jews in times of persecution and distress, and we have embraced 
with open arms the exiles from Judae-phobian 
countries. 

"We rejoice to see the wonderful progress you have 
made in Palestine during the few years of your indefatigable 
labors, and you are this day a model for the Arab 
villagers around you. You are an object lesson to your 
native neighbors, who can neither read nor write, that 
they may see the great possibilities of the land. I therefore 
lay before you the following proposition: 

THE GOVERNMENTAL PROPOSAL 

"In order that your life and property may be placed 
beyond jeopardy, it is your bounden duty to establish yourselves 
on a firm basis, and this is what you should do. 

"Choose from among yourselves a municipal head, 
whose appointment will be ratified by the Government, to 
administer justice and execute judgment according to the 
rules and regulations of the Ottoman provinces. 

"You will have to appoint guards and gendarmes, 



whose names will be registered by the local government, 
which will provide them with uniforms and all necessary 
accoutrements and invest them with authority. 

"You must also install telephonic communication between 
colony and colony, village and village, so that any 
attack or outrage may at once be notified at headquarters 
and the marauders be apprehended and punished. 

"I know there are unlimited possibilities in this land, 
but we are unfortunately still handicapped. I trust, however, 
that little by little the goal will be reached, to the 
great benefit of the country. 

"For my part, I will try to put you in possession of the 
sandhills bordering on the seashore and give you legal 
title-deeds for the same. 

"A part of it I will allot you for a capacious Government 
Building which will serve as your central administrative 
premises. 

"Brethren and kinsmen, give your helping hands to the 
Government, and the Government, on her part, will aid you 
on to further progress." 



"THY KINGDOM COME"! 



The following from a worldly standpoint sticks closely 
to the predictions of the Bible, hence we reproduce them 
from Woman's World: ~ 

JUST A FEW GROWING PAINS. 

"Coal strikes in England and America— revolution in 
Mexico— anarchy in China— Italy at the throat of Turkey 
—woman clamoring for the vote! 

"What of it? There's no cause to be pessimistic- 
nothing's really the matter with the world— just growing 
pains! 

"Progress has set for herself a sudden and terrific 
pace. The earth has been spinning faster in the last 
twenty years than it ever before whirled. Naturally, 
there's a bit of displacement in spots, but nothing to hurt. 

"We can't very well apply electricity to a thousand 
uses, go snooping among the clouds, universalize education, 
introduce penny journalism, and give science a free 
rein without some trivial consequences. 

"Old viewpoints are sure to shift, old creeds must give 
way to new ideals, society is bound to readjust its 
divisions. 

"The ancient molds of thought and economics, religion 
and government, are splitting. Our eyes see truths which 
our ancestors could not behold and by their light we 
perceive their errors and their inadequacies. 

"The greatest revolutions that have ever swept the 
universe will break within the coming hundred years. 



"Before this century is closed, the last king shall have 
lost his throne, the last battleship shall be scrapped, the 
last army shall have junked its guns. East and West shall 

R5107 : page 304 

meet in a thousand common causes and the Five Races 
join hands in brotherhood. 

"Perfected wireless telephony and telephotography, 
mile-a-second trains and airships will condense the seas 
and continents into ponds and back lots. 

"Africa will become a week-end resort for the New 
Yorker, and the Canadian farmer will press a button, lift 
his receiver and exchange crop gossip with his son in 
Siberia. 

"Pain will be banished. Surgery will have accomplished 
the relief of insanity and blindness. Cancer, 
tuberculosis, paralysis, will be as easily cured as sprains 
and lumbago. 

"There will be no waste in food nor in land. The air 
will yield its wealth of nitrates to the condensers and 
every arable acre will luxuriate with vegetation. 

"The stored heat of the sun will furnish power and 
warmth for all humanity. Plagues and pests will 
disappear. 

"Eugenics will regulate society; men and women will 
mate by definite laws; efficient organization will check 
economic spendthriftry and eradicate poverty; engineering 
will solve the problems of competent housing, ventilation 
and sunlight; the standardization of health and of welfare 
will extirpate prostitution and crime. 

"A dream? Not a bit of it! 

"A far-fetched vision? You are wrong! 

"No imagination can pierce the horizons that cloak the 
tomorrow from our sight. 

"The farthest-flung optimism can only estimate a 
fragment of man's coming glories. How can you sneer! 

"Turn back and view the fifty years behind you. What 
prophet in your father's youth would have dared proclaim 
the many magics of today? 

"Strikes, revolts and wars are but chips that fly beneath 
the chisel of progress. 

"There will be many wars, mobs will rage, battles will 
wage, tyranny will clutch with strangling fingers, bigotry 
will plot, avarice will scheme— but to what will these 
avail?"

"FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT" 

"Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal 
life, whereunto thou art also called."—! Tim. 6:12. 



IF WE ARE naturally combative, we may see, 

or think we see, cause for a continual warfare 

from the cradle to the grave; and a 

little warping of sound judgment may give 

this disposition a seemingly religious turn 

and deceive such a one into the idea that 

he is fighting the "good fight," when in 

reality he is only cultivating a quarrelsome 

disposition, out of harmony with the spirit 

of meekness and temperance, which is a 

most essential feature of the Christian character. Again, 

many of an opposite disposition are inclined to ignore 

the fact that the Christian life is to be a warfare, and to 

regard only those Scriptures which counsel meekness, forbearance, 

patience, gentleness, etc. 

Here are two extremes, both of which must be guarded 
against; and in order to help us to rightly judge and balance 
ourselves, the Apostle recommends us to mark, to 
observe closely those who walk circumspectly, according 
to the rules laid down in the Scriptures, and counsels us 
to beware of the influence of those who do not so walk. 
"For," he says, "many walk, of whom I have told you 
often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies 
of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, 
whose God is their belly, and whose glory is their shame, 
who mind earthly things," which they covenanted to sacrifice. 
-Phil. 3:17-19. 

Let us then mark some worthy examples that we may 
see how they ran for the prize and notice whether there 
is any indication that they ran successfully. First, we 
mark the perfect example of our Lord, our Leader and 
Forerunner, in whose footsteps we are invited to follow. 
We notice that His course in the "narrow way" of sacrifice 
began with an entire consecration of Himself to the 
will of God. His consecration was made with simplicity 
and sincerity, and included all that He had— "Lo, I come 
to do Thy will, O God!"-Heb. 10:7. 

He did not say, Father, I will give Thee a tithe of My 
time, My service, and My means, and retain the remainder 
for Myself and for the pursuit of My own ambitions 
and plans. He did not say, Father, I have chosen this or 
that special work, and I trust Thy blessing will attend it. 
He did not say, As far as I understand Thy will, Father, 
I am willing to do it— with the implication that if the 
Father should ever ask anything too severe, or seemingly 
unreasonable, He might change His mind. No. His consecration 
was simply to the doing of the Father's will, 
whatever that will might prove to be. And then He earnestly 
applied Himself to the study of the Law and the 
Prophets, that He might know the will of God concerning 
Him. 

When tempted to change His course He replied, "How 
then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?" 
"The cup which My Father hath given Me, shall I not 
drink it?" (Matt. 26:54; John 18:11.) He laid aside His 
own will and carried out the will of God, though it cost 



Him privation at every step and finally a death most painful 
and ignominious. From this course of sacrifice He 
never wavered, even for a moment. 

Our Lord's was a grand character for our imitation. 
"Yes," says one, "but our Lord was perfect and therefore 
could do the Father's will perfectly." Very true; we are 
thankful and rejoice in this, for had He not been perfect 
He could never have redeemed us. Yet we needed also 
just such an example; for however imperfectly we, like 
school children, may succeed in imitating the copy, we 
need to have a perfect copy. 

ST. PETER A NOBLE SOLDIER 

But while Christ was much more to us than a perfect 
example for our imitation, which under our present infirmities 
we cannot fully duplicate, we have other examples 
furnished among brethren of similar infirmities 
with ourselves. Let us mark them and see how they followed 
the Master. 

There was St. Peter, with his quick, impulsive nature, 
always loving, yet vacillating— now defending his Master 
at his own peril, and again disclaiming and denying Him; 
now boldly contending for the faith, and again compromising 
with Jewish prejudices, calling forth and justly 
meriting St. Paul's faithful reproof. Yet, rightly exercised 
by reproof and discipline and endeavoring to rule 
himself, his Christian character ripened and beautified 
from year to year, as evidenced by his grand and noble 
Epistles to the Church, written by inspiration and handed 
down from generation to generation for nineteen centuries; 
and he had many evident marks of the Lord's loving 
approval. 

R5109 : page 305 

Before St. Peter had time to express in words his 
regret of his denial of the Lord, he was assured of forgiveness 
and of the continued favor of feeding our Lord's 
sheep; for the Lord knew the sincerity of his love and 
realized that through weakness and fear he had sinned. 
Mark, too, St. Peter's affection for his "beloved Brother 
Paul" (2 Pet. 3:15,16), who had so plainly reproved and 
rebuked him; and for the Lord, who had said, "Get thee 
behind Me, Satan [adversary]; thou art an offense unto 
Me; for thou savorest not the things that be of God, but 
those that be of men." (Matt. 16:23.) Poor St. Peter! 
It was an uphill road for him, but he seemed to consider 
and appreciate his own weakness and to put his shoulder 
to the wheel in a more determined effort to overcome 
the propensities of his old nature, and to cultivate the 
graces of the Christian character. 

But did he finally overcome? and was he accepted as 
one of that glorious company which shall constitute the 
Bride of Christ? Yes, truly; for the risen Lord Himself 
declared that his name is written with the others of the 



twelve Apostles in the very foundations of the Heavenly 
City, the New Jerusalem, the Kingdom of God. (Rev. 21:14.) 
See what poor, weak St. Peter gained by his 
meekness and patience under painful discipline! 

OTHER VALIANT WARRIORS 

St. Paul was a stronger character by nature. He had 
evidently made a life business of ruling himself, though 
he was naturally positive and firm. When the Truth 
reached him he had a great advantage at once, both in 
his natural disposition and in his early culture, so that he 
could walk more firmly and steadily; and using all his 
energy in this direction he furnishes for our imitation a 
noble example of steadfastness and endurance, of untiring 
zeal and sincerest devotion. See and ponder well, 
2 Cor. 11:23-33; 12:10,15. 

St. John was naturally loving, gentle and meek; and 
that very disposition would make it difficult for him to 
sever the many ties of human friendship which such dispositions 
always draw about them. Yet he was faithful 
to his Master, regardless of the human ties. He was 
a patient, faithful teacher of the doctrines of Christ, and 
willingly suffered banishment to the lonely Isle of Patmos 
for his faithful witnessing to the Truth. 

Similar was the course of all the Apostles. They were 
bold, faithful advocates of the Truth, and examples of its 
power to sanctify wholly, as they gradually grew in grace, 
submitting themselves to its transforming influence. They 
were men of similar and varied dispositions like ourselves. 
Mark those who so run, and do likewise. God marked 
these, and kept a careful record of their course, 
judging them by their motives and endeavors; and He 
shows us that their course, thus judged, all their imperfections 
being covered by the imputed righteousness of 
their Leader, was acceptable to Him. They left all and 
followed Christ. Their all was not very much, not more, 
perhaps, than we have to leave; but it was their all, and 
so was acceptable. 

St. Peter had left his fishing business and his friends 
to travel with the Master and learn and teach the Truth. 
He had thus given up his own will and his present interests 
to do the will of God. When he said to the Lord, 
"Lo, we have left all, and have followed Thee" (Mark 10:28), 
our Lord did not say that St. Peter's little all was 
not worth mentioning, but He recognized it and encouraged 
St. Peter to continue to sacrifice all, with the assurance 
that in due time he should be rewarded. (Mark 10:29,30.) 
And so shall we all be, if we faint not; for faithful 
is He that hath called us, who also will exalt us in due 
time.-I Thess. 5:24; I Pet. 5:6. 

As we thus mark the course of the faithful ones, we see 
that their warfare was largely one with themselves. It 
was their endeavor to keep down their own human wills 
while they carried out the Divine will. Even in the case 
of our Lord, where the human will was perfect, it was a 



hard thing to do, as evidenced by His words, "Father, if 
it be possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, 
not as I will, but as Thou wilt. "--Matt. 26:39. 

THE WARFARE IN PROGRESS FOR CENTURIES 

But there is another side of this warfare which we 
have not yet considered, and which we dare not overlook 
if we would be faithful overcomers. The Truth has its 
enemies now as well as in the days of the Apostles, and 
we are set for the defense of the Truth. Hence, the 
forces against which we must contend are not only those 
within, but also those without. To be listless and indifferent 
under such circumstances as surround us is certainly 
evidence that we are not fighting the good fight of 
faith. 

To fight the good fight of faith implies, first, that we 
have a faith for which to fight. No man can fight this 
good fight who has not come to some knowledge of the 
Truth— a knowledge sufficient to awaken his sympathies 
and enlist his energies in its propagation and defense. 

Now look at the warfare from this standpoint and see 
how the faithful soldiers of the cross from the beginning 
of the Age to the present time have contended for the 
faith delivered to the saints. (Jude 3.) Have they calmly 
and comfortably rested in luxurious ease, enjoying what 
they knew of the Truth themselves, and saying nothing 
about it where it would cause a ripple of opposition, and 
then flattered themselves with the idea that their lazy, do-nothing 
tranquility was evidence of their growth in grace? 
By no means! 

The saints have endured hardness as good soldiers for 
the Truth's sake. They have proclaimed it boldly and 
have taken the consequences of public scorn and contempt, 
the loss of earthly friends, the sacrifice of business 
interests and earthly prospects, together with stripes, imprisonments, 
and perils to life on every hand; and in many 
cases they have met violent deaths. They have not only 
enjoyed the glorious prospect of future blessedness, but 
have become active to the extent of their ability in carrying 
out God's Plan for securing that end. Had they done 
otherwise they would have proved themselves unworthy 
of the high honors to which they were called. So it has 
been throughout the entire Age, and continues still. 

When the great Mystery of Iniquity, or Papal system, 
had reached the height of its power and the very depths 
of its corruption, and the eyes of a few faithful children 
of God were opened to see its true character, noble reformers 
stepped out and boldly declared their convictions 
in the face of most violent persecution. Encouraged by 
their example, many other noble souls braved the same 
dangers and endured great hardships while contending 
for the Truth. Thus they gave evidence of their zeal and 
consecration by their faithfulness, even unto death by 
violent hands, and unto persecution and torture of the 
most revolting and fiendish character. 



THE DECISIVE BATTLE NOW AT HAND 

It is well that we consider frequently such examples 
that they may serve to spur our own zeal, and that 
we may the more lightly esteem the comparatively light 
afflictions which we are now called upon to endure, in our 
efforts to disseminate and defend the Truth today. We 

R5109 : page 306 

have now no bloody persecutions, though it is still true 
that those who will live godly shall suffer persecution. 
(2 Tim. 3:12.) To "live godly," however, implies earnestness 
and consequent activity in God's service. 

Remember, too, that the Apostle refers to these last 
days of the Age as the most perilous times of all. Why? 
Because the errors and temptations of this day come in 
more subtle forms than heretofore. This is emphatically 
the Age of Reason— an Age of advancement in almost 
every direction; many are running to and fro, and knowledge 
is increasing on every subject. 

On the other hand, human conceit and presumption 
are running vastly ahead of knowledge; and reason, unguided 
by the Divine Revelation, is falling into many 
foolish and hurtful errors, which are passing current 
among those who profess to be the children of God, but 
who are deceived by these errors and are falling away 
from "the faith once delivered to the saints." The great 
Babylonian system is crumbling into decay, but multitudinous 
errors, far more injurious than the formalism and 
slumber of Babylon, are at work to build upon its ruins 
other systems of iniquity in which even the foundation 
principles of Christianity find no place whatever. 

These errors must be met by the faithful few who are 
armed with the Truth— others cannot detect or defeat 
them. It is for these, armed with the Sword of the Spirit, 
which is the Word of God, to show by its profound reasonings 
the difference between Truth and error, and to 
prove that God's Plan, in God's way, is superior to all the 
plans and ways of human arrangement. 

To escape falling into these errors, and being deceived 
by their subtle sophistries and by the professions of loyalty 
to God on the part of the deceived deceivers who advance 
them, the children of God must keep close to their 
Father's Word, and be filled with His Spirit; and when 
they see the Truth they must be bold and fearless in its 
defense, regardless of all consequences. 

This is fighting the good fight of faith, whether you 
are severely wounded in the conflict or not. Those who, 
sacrificing home comforts, etc., scatter the Truth by the 
printed page, which, read and pondered by those receiving 
it, gives light and scatters darkness, are just as surely 
fighting the good fight of faith as if by word of mouth 
they were arguing with those whom they meet. Often they 
do it much more effectually. Such shall just as surely receive 



their reward and lay hold on eternal life as will 

St. Peter and St. Paul and other faithful soldiers of the 

cross— if they faint not. 

PREPARATIONS FOR THE BATTLE 

This little army of faithful soldiers, all told, is but a 
handful, a Little Flock. Though in numbers they are so 
insignificant that the hosts of the opposers of the Truth 
fear little from their efforts, the final victory shall be 
theirs; and God's power shall be glorified and manifested 
in them proportionately more. 

Like Gideon's three hundred picked men who feared 
not to face the hosts of Midian because the Lord was with 
them, these have but to go forth likewise, strong in faith, 
sounding their trumpets of Truth and breaking their 
earthen vessels (sacrificing their human nature) that the 
blessed light of God's Spirit may shine out; and at the 
appointed hour the hosts of the enemy shall take the alarm 
and flee. Systems of error, new and old, shall be turned 
to destruction and, as in the case of the Midianites, each 
shall turn upon the other to accomplish the work of their 
destruction. 

To have the privilege of fighting this good fight of 
faith and of being the Lord's chosen ones for the great 
work now to be done, God's children, like Gideon's army, 
must first be proved— tested. At first there was a host 
of thirty-two thousand with Gideon; and when all that 
were fearful were told to return to their homes, only ten 
thousand remained; and when God further tested these, 
only three hundred remained. A little, insignificant company, 
truly, they must have appeared, not only to the 
Midianites, but also to themselves. Yet, God's power 
was made the more manifest by their smallness and weakness. 
-Judges 7:3,7,22. 

Just so it is now. No one is compelled or urged into 
this service. All who are fearful, whose faith in God's 
ability and intention to carry out His Plan is not strong 
enough to make them bold and courageous, and in haste 
to go forth, anxious to sound the trumpet-tones of Truth, 
and willing to break their earthen vessels (to sacrifice 
themselves) in the service, have the privilege of retiring 
from the battlefield. But, of course, such shall have no 
part in the honors of the victory with the greater Captain 
than Gideon. 

THE CONTENDING FORCES 

For whom do we fight— for God? for Christ? No, we 
answer. We fight for ourselves. A great mistake is 
made on this point by many who seem to imagine that 
fighting the good fight of faith is doing something for 
God, which deserves His thanks and reward. The Almighty 
God does not need that we should fight for Him. 
He is omnipotent, abundantly able to take care of Himself 
and His cause; He needs not our puny efforts. God 



is fighting for us, and assisting and encouraging us to fight 
the good fight of faith on our own behalf. It is well that 
this feature of the case be clearly discerned. 

Against whom do we fight? We answer, our battle 
is not against our fellow-creatures, nor with carnal weapons; 
indeed, we can have large sympathy for even our 
most relentless foes, who, to the extent that modern civilization 
will permit, are ready and willing to "despitefully 
use and persecute" us, and to say all manner of evil 
against us falsely. (Matt. 5:11.) We can readily see 
that they are blinded in considerable measure, either by 
their own prejudice and passion, or by the great Adversary's 
delusive false doctrines and superstitions. Hence 
our warfare is not directed even against our enemies, and 
as we have opportunity we are to seek to do them good, 
"in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves."— 
2 Tim. 2:25. 

Hence also, when dealing with these, so far from battling 
with them and resisting evil with evil, our Captain 
has commanded that we return good for evil, gentleness 
for rudeness, kindness for discourtesy; and that we seek 
to do good to those who speak evil of us and persecute 
us, that thus the eyes of their understanding may be 
opened, and that they may be able to discern that there 
is such a thing as the spirit of Love, generosity, kindness, 
whereas they supposed all to be actuated by the same 
malevolent spirit of selfishness which controls themselves. 

Our fight is to be against Sin— the great taskmaster 
which captured our race in the person of Father Adam, 
and has held it as slaves from then till now— mankind 
paying regularly for six thousand years the terrible 
penalty of death, with all its concomitants of sickness, 
pain, sorrow and trouble. Yes; this is the enemy whom 
we are to fight. 

Indirectly, Satan is our enemy, because he it was 
through whose influence Father Adam first became the 
slave of Sin; and Satan has continued to pursue the same 
course, and is even now endeavoring to bring us back 
under the dominion of Sin, and to hold us there. We are 
not to forget, however, that our battle is not directly with 

R5109 : page 307 

Satan, nor are we to bring against him "a railing accusation" 
(Jude 9); rather, we are to say, with Michael, "The 
Lord rebuke thee"; and we are to await the Lord's time 
and the Lord's way for rebuking Satan. Nevertheless, we 
are to resist him; that is, we are to resist his influence and 
deceptions and endeavors to mislead us into error and into 
sin. 

The Lord instructs us that "we wrestle not against 
flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, 
against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against 
spiritual wickedness in high places [exalted positions]." 
(Eph. 6:12.) Satan, as the great master, or general of 
Sin, has largely to do with all the various influences with 



which we must battle. It is his cunning, his "wiles," that 

supervise the battle against us; and since he is a spirit 

being, and therefore much more intelligent than ourselves, 

the contest would be a very unequal one if we were without 

a much more powerful Spirit Leader. But we are not 

thus left to battle alone against superior wisdom and cunning. 

Our Captain, the Lord Jesus, has conquered 

Sin and has been glorified, and He is on our part, so that 

we can confidently say, Greater is He that is on our part 

than all they that be against us— Satan and his cohorts 

of evil spirits, and his deluded earthly agents and servants. 

"If God be for us, who can be against us?"— Rom. 8:31. 

St. John seems to sum up the agencies through which 
our great captor, Sin, seeks to hold us as his slaves, or, if 
we have gotten free, to regain his influence over us, as 
three— the world, the flesh, the Devil. We have seen 
the powerful influence of the Devil, as the great general 
of Sin. We next notice in what sense the world is our 
opponent, and in what sense we are to battle against it. 

We have just seen that we do not battle with carnal 
weapons, nor do we in any sense of the word battle or 
contest with our fellow-creatures, seeing that they are 
blinded by the Adversary, and really little, if to any 
extent, accountable for their course. Our battle is not 
with these. It is with "the spirit of the world," its influence, 
that we are to do battle; it is to be fought against 
and resisted. The world's disposition, the mind of the 
world, the ambitions of the world, the motives which actuate 
the world, the pride of life and the deceitfulness of 
riches— these things, these wrong views of matters as seen 
from the worldly standpoint, we are to resist, to fight 
against— and it is a daily battle. 

Finally, our battle is with the flesh— our own flesh. 
Ever since Sin captured our race, in the person of Father 
Adam, its slavery has been conducive to mental, moral 
and physical degradation. Its tendency is toward evil 
only, and that continually; and only as we get rid of the 
blinding influences, the perverted tastes, desires, ambitions, 
hopes and loves which sin cultivates— only in that 
proportion do we come to see matters in their true light, 
and to have even a faint glimpse of our degraded condition. 
But our great Captain, who is also the Chief Priest 
of our Profession, redeemed us from this slavery to Sin 
with His own precious blood. He had compassion upon 
us, and when we realized our deplorable condition and 
accepted His aid, He set us free from the yoke of Sin's 
slavery. 

But we still have the motions of sin in our bodies— 
the tendencies toward sin, which have become almost 
second nature to us, through the long period of nearly 
six thousand years of slavery. So while we are now free, 
and with the mind are serving the Law of Christ and are 
accepted into His army as soldiers of the cross, to battle 
on the side of righteousness and Truth and goodness and 
purity, we nevertheless find our new selves harassed by 
the old perverted tastes and inclinations of our own flesh, 



toward the service of the old taskmaster. Not the least 
of our fightings, therefore, as New Creatures in Christ 
Jesus is against these perverted tendencies of our flesh, 
and the battle with these is a daily battle. With the 
Apostle Paul, one of the great soldiers of our war, we 
should be able to say, "I keep my body [my flesh and its 
desires] under [in subjection to my new will, my new 
self] lest, when I have preached to others, I myself 
should be a castaway."— I Cor. 9:27. 

We enlist under the banner of our Captain; that is, 
from the time that we make a full consecration to Him, 
to fight the good fight, and to lay down our lives in His 
service— from that moment He reckons our flesh as dead. 
Our minds are renewed— alive toward God with a newness 
of life; and hence those motions of sin, which we are 
seeking to bring into absolute subjection to the will of God 
in Christ, are not recognized by our Lord as the will or 
motions of the New Creature, enlisted in His service, but 
merely as a part of the general enemy, Sin, pursuing after 
and battling with us, which we are pledged to resist and to 
war against, and to overcome which our Lord promises 
grace and help in every time of need.— Heb. 4:16. 

CONTINUAL VIGILANCE URGED 

It is these great enemies in our own flesh which cause 
us the greatest difficulties. It is to these that Satan appeals; 
it is these which he seeks to encourage in their 
warfare against the new spirit of our minds; it is through 
these that the spirit of the world gains closest approach 
to us, and seeks to capture us and lead us back as slaves 
of Sin. So to speak, the New Creature in Christ is beset, 
surrounded on every hand with enemies, seeking our disaster 
and re-enslavement. 

We must battle— battle for ourselves, battle for our 
own liberty, battle for victory over our own weaknesses, 
battle against the spirit of the world, battle against delusions 
and snares of the Adversary by which he seeks to 
make the evil things appear good and the right to appear 
undesirable. No wonder, then, that the Christian soldier 
is urged to be continually watchful; no wonder that he is 
urged to "put on the whole armor of God"; no wonder 
that he is cautioned in regard to his various and wily foes, 
and especially against those of his own flesh. 

Thanks be to God for the great Captain of our salvation! 
Thanks be to God for the great armory of His 
Word, from which we obtain the helmet of salvation, the 
intellectual knowledge to protect us from the delusions of 
our own perverted sense, from ignorance, and from the 
wiles of the Adversary! Thanks be to God also for the 
breastplate of righteousness, the merit of Christ and His 
great sacrifice, compensating for our imperfections, covering 
our vitals and securing thereby our life— eternal 
life! 

Thanks be to God also for the shield of faith, of trust, 
of confidence in Him who has bought us, in realization 



that He who has begun the good work in us is both able 
and willing to complete it! Since God so loved us while 
we were yet the slaves of sin, and redeemed us from bondage 
with the precious blood of Christ, much more does 
He now love us, and much more is He prepared to aid 
us now that we have, by His grace, become free from Sin, 
and become the servants of righteousness! Thanks be 
to God also for the sandals, the preparation to endure 
hardness patiently, which the Truth gives, protecting us in 
the walks of life, and from the sharp animosities of the 
world! Thanks be to God also for the Sword of the 
Spirit, the Word of His Truth, as a defense by which we 
can resist the Adversary and come off conquerors, through 
Him who loved us and bought us! 

R5109 : page 308 

Previous to St. Paul's exhortation to the faithful few, 
to fight the good fight of faith, he gives the very wholesome 
advice that we lay entirely aside from us the weights 
of our former earthly cares, etc.— pride, ambition, discontent, 
money-loving and such-like things. We cannot 
grasp or hold the treasures of this life, and at the same 
time run successfully for the heavenly prize— "Ye cannot 
serve God and Mammon"; and "A double minded man is 
unstable in all his ways."— Matt. 6:24; James 1:8. 

Let us then take St. Paul's counsel— flee these earthly 
things and, following after righteousness, godliness, 
faith, love, patience, meekness, fight the good fight of 
faith, and lay hold on eternal life as joint-heirs with 
Christ in the glory of victory shortly to be granted. If, 
after we have consecrated our all to God, we turn back to 
mind and seek earthly things, and glory in their possession, 
we are really glorying in our shame; and the end of such 
glory, if pursued to the end, is destruction. "See that ye 
walk circumspectly," not minding earthly, but heavenly 
things, and not yielding to the temptations of those who 
walk otherwise. Then we also shall be setting an example 
for others, worthy of their imitation. 

"O watch and pray! for thou hast foes to fight- 
Foes which alone thou canst not overcome; 

Watching and prayer will keep thine armor bright; 
Soon will thy toils be o'er, thy victory won. 

O watch and pray! the Lord is at the door, 

O watch and keep thy garments spotless, pure!"

THE NEW CREATURE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO DIVINE LAW 

PART 3 -RESURRECTION OF CHURCH DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF WORLD 

WE SHALL NOW consider some texts which 



are not generally understood, but which will 
enable us to set forth clearly the sharp 
distinction between the resurrection of the 
Church and that of the world in general. 

In I Thess. 4:14,16 the Apostle Paul 
mentions two classes— "those who sleep in 
Jesus" and "the dead in Christ." Our 
Lord's Ransom-sacrifice accomplished on 
Calvary has changed the future of the 
Adamic race, so that they may now be said to "sleep in 
Jesus." The world, therefore, is not to be considered as 
extinct, eternally dead, but as asleep, waiting for the time 
foreordained of the Father, when "all that are in the 
graves shall hear His voice [the voice of the Son of God] 
and shall come forth."— John 5:28,29. 

"The dead in Christ," however, is an expression applicable 
only to the Elect Church. The call to be baptized 
into Christ (the Anointed) is an offer which is restricted 
to the "called and chosen and faithful" Church of the 
Gospel Age. The Apostle is here referring to those who 
have been begotten of the Holy Spirit, and later have 
fallen asleep in death. 

But they are not to be considered dead in the same 
sense in which the world is dead in Adam. "The dead 
in Christ" are the dead, who are to have the Resurrection 
of the dead— the First Resurrection— the chief resurrection. 
The others will be of the subsequent resurrection. 
We are not to understand, however, that these "dead in 
Christ" were dead as New Creatures, but that as far as 
the flesh was concerned their death was fully 
accomplished. 

The term "asleep" has been applied to both classes. 
Those of the world who go down into death are still in the 
unsatisfactory condition in which they died and will come 
forth in the same state, in order that they may rise from 

R5108 : page 308 

it. But those who now belong to Christ will experience 
an instantaneous resurrection, and will receive new bodies 
like unto the Lord's glorious body. 

The Church really begin to rise from the time when 
they become New Creatures; and unless we begin this 
rising now we shall not have the change— "in a moment, 
in the twinkling of an eye," at the end of our course. 
(I Cor. 15:51,52.) These shall not come forth under a 
future judgment, or trial, but in their change will pass 
fully from death unto life— into the glorious reward, the 
Divine nature. 

"THE SPIRIT RETURNS TO GOD" 

"Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was; and 
the spirit shall return unto God who gave it."— Eccl. 12:7. 

This text has no special reference to the Church. It 
has a general application to all mankind as they die. 



There can be no question as to what is meant by the first 

part of the text, for human bodies have crumbled to dust 

for centuries. The latter part of the text is wholly misunderstood 

by many Christians. It has no reference to 

the breath or anything returning through the air to God. 

The thought is this: When God created Adam, He 
gave him a life that would continue forever if he would 
be obedient. When Adam sinned God did not take away 
the spirit of life immediately. He allowed him to hold 
on to that spirit of life just as many years as he could, 
battling with the thorns and thistles until the "breaking 
of the silver cord." 

Adam transmitted a portion of that spirit of life to 
his children, in some of whom that portion of life continued 
for centuries. But mankind have no right to that 
spirit of life; it is merely something transmitted to them 
by their parents. God recognizes none as having a right 
to live except those who are in harmony with Him— 
those who are perfect. Since the fall all mankind have 
lived without a right to live. Therefore, from the Divine 
standpoint the whole world is spoken of as legally dead. 
Every right to life from the Divine standpoint is forfeited. 
No one can say to God, "I have a right to live." 
God could say, "You have no right to live; for your first 
parents sinned and thus lost that right." 

Adam could not give to his descendants what he had 
lost. When Adam died he gave up the spirit of life; that 
is, he no longer held that portion of life which he had 
held for nine hundred and thirty years. Where did that 
spirit of life go? It went back to God from whom it had 
come originally. Everything goes back to God. Adam 
could not say to his children, "I bequeath my life-rights 
to you"; for he had none. No one but God can give a 
right to life. 

"The spirit returns to God who gave it." When one 
who has possessed the right to life has forfeited it, he 
cannot say that he has a right to life or to anything. 
There is no way to get life other than through Christ. 

"NOT OF THE DEAD, BUT OF THE LIVING" 

"The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the 
God of Jacob. ..is not a God of the dead, but of the 
living. "-Luke 20:37,38. 

When we note the context we see that our Lord was 
combatting the theory of the Sadducees, and proving 
that Abraham and Isaac and Jacob would have a resurrection. 
Jesus said, "Now that the dead are raised, even 
Moses showed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the 
God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of 
Jacob." (Luke 20:37.) If they were dead in the sense 

R5108 : page 309 

that the beast is dead, God would never have spoken of 
them in this manner. They had come into accord with 



God, and He spoke of them in harmony with the general 
Plan. St. Paul says, "There shall be a resurrection of the 
dead, both of the just and of the unjust." (Acts 24:15.) 
The Ancient Worthies had this testimony, that they 
pleased God; and we know that they had the promise of 
a better resurrection than would have been theirs if they 
had not pleased God.— Heb. 11:35. 

These Ancient Worthies lived in exactly the same 
sense that the begotten New Creatures live. Unless God 
raises us up from the dead there will be no resurrection. 
The same thing that applies to the New Creature in Christ 
applies to the world in general. They may think that 
those in the tomb are absolutely dead; but God intends 
that they shall have an awakening. So the Apostle speaks 
not only of those who are asleep in Christ, but also of 
those who are asleep in Jesus. Those who are asleep in 
Christ are those who had become New Creatures in Christ, 
heirs of God, partakers of the Divine nature and have 
passed into death. These are spoken of as "the dead in 
Christ" who shall rise first. 

Jesus is not the Savior merely of the Church, but also 
the Savior of the world. (John 4:42; I John 4: 14.) He 
is the propitiation not only for our sins, "but also for 
the sins of the whole world." (I John 2:2.) Therefore, 
those who believe this statement— that there will be a 
resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the 
unjust— speak of the whole world in exactly the same 
way that they speak of those who have slept in Christ. 

But in the awakening, those of the world who are 
asleep in Jesus will have the earthly nature, and those 
who have slept in Christ will have the higher nature. 
Christ gave His life as a corresponding price for man's 
life. But we who have come into the Church have come 
under different conditions altogether from those of the 
world. As Jesus said, "Ye are not of the world." (John 15:19.) 
We are separate and distinct from the rest of 
the world. The Apostle tells us that our life comes from 
the Father— "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus 
Christ." -I Peter 1:3. 

Does Jesus do nothing for the Church? Yes, indeed! 
As Advocate He imputes of His merit to the Church that 
we may be counted in as joint-sharers of His sacrifice, for 
"if we suffer [with Him], we shall also reign with Him." 
(2 Tim. 2:12.) This willingness to suffer is the Covenant 
of sacrifice that we make with our Lord. Without Him 
we can do nothing. We can never come up to the Divine 
standards as He did; but as our Advocate He makes good 
our deficiencies. We have the same begetting of the Holy 
Spirit by the same Father and we shall also share in the 
same Resurrection, being made conformable to His death. 
The Resurrection of Christ is to the Divine nature, in 
which we shall be "changed, in a moment, in the twinkling 
of an eye."— I Cor. 15:51,52. 

The world will receive earthly resurrection. The Life-Giver, 
Jesus, will give to them all that was lost— human 
nature and the Edenic condition. So then, the dead world 



is said to be asleep, but they are to be awakened. Theirs 
is exactly the same kind of sleep as with us; but the 
Church were asleep as New Creatures and the world are 
not. 

"GOD GIVETH IT A BODY" 

"Thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare 
grain, it may chance of wheat or of some other grain; 
but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased Him." 

Here is the thought: Mankind belong to the Adamic 
nature. The kind of nature that God has been pleased to 
give to the Adamic race is earthly nature. But if we 
belong to the spirit nature we shall come up accordingly. 
If you plant corn, you will reap corn; if you plant wheat, 
you will reap wheat; if you plant barley, you will reap 
barley. So in death. If an animal body is sown, the animal 
body will be raised. The Church is an exception to 
the rule. We New Creatures are sown as animal bodies, 
but we have these animal bodies merely loaned to us, in 
which to operate. We are New Creatures, not human 
beings. We are sown natural bodies, we are raised spirit 
bodies, in the First Resurrection. 

THE TWO RESURRECTIONS 

"The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the 
graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they 
that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and 
they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment." 
-John 5:28,29., R.V. 

The Divine provision is that through the obedience of 
One, the sins of the whole world will be atoned for, and 
a blessing come to every member of the Adamic race. By 
a man came death, and by a man comes the resurrection 
of the dead. (I Cor. 15:21-23.) We have two classes 
here; they that have done good are those who, during the 
present time, have heard the Gospel, and who have and 
use an opportunity to do good, and those who have done 
evil are those who have not heard and who have not, 
therefore, had an opportunity of doing good. 

Who can be said to have done good? "There is none 
righteous, no, not one." (Rom. 3:10.) After having received 
this good Word of God we should make good use 
of it, enter into the School of Christ to be taught of Him, 
and pass through our trials and testings. These things 
will determine whether or not we are worthy of this high 
position, to attain which we have consecrated our lives. 

But we shall not in this life be perfect as Jesus was— 
in body as well as in mind. We cannot be perfect in the 
flesh, as Jesus was; but Jesus had a perfect will, and we 
can also have a perfect will, although we may have drawbacks 
and hindrances in carrying out that will. But to 
cover our defects, we have our Advocate, in whom God 
has arranged that we may be accepted. The Church 
have had their trial in advance of the world; and if they 



have overcome, God has said that the verdict will be, 
"Well done. ..I will make thee ruler over many 
things." (Matt. 25:21.) These constitute the "good." 

Who are they that have done evil? None have 
been perfect; not even in their minds have they come up 
to a standard that God can approve. They are unsatisfactory, 
which means unfit. When God shall have established 
the glorious Messianic Kingdom, then He will put 
all mankind under trial to see whether, during the 
thousand years of His Reign, the rewards and punishments 

R5109 : page 309 

will bring them to a proper condition of heart. At 
the end of the thousand years, Jesus, as Mediator, will 
present them to the Father for a final testing. If they 
pass that test, God will give them everlasting life. But 
those who take a thousand years to make good, will not 
get as high a reward as those who, by self-sacrifice, now 
prove their love for the Truth and die for righteousness' 
sake. 

"HIDE ME IN THE GRAVE" 

"O that Thou wouldst hide me in the grave, that Thou 
wouldst keep me secret until Thy wrath be past, that 
Thou wouldst appoint me a set time, and remember me!" 
-Job 14:13. 

This passage of Scripture refers, not to the New 
Creature, but to a human being. It refers to a man and 
not to a spirit-begotten son of God and member of 
Christ. Job was here speaking as one of mankind. He 

R5109 : page 310 

was willing to die, for life had become burdensome to 
him. He said, "Oh, that Thou wouldst hide me in Sheol 
until Thy wrath be past! " In the midst of his very 
severe afflictions he cried, Oh, that I might die! but do 
not leave me as the brute creation; only hide me in the 
grave until all this time of wrath and sin and curse is 
done away with and the New Era shall be ushered in. 
We can hardly believe that Job realized the meaning of 
what he was saying, but we should rather suppose that 
he was uttering words, the full import of which he did not 
realize. 

There is no reason to suppose that when David said, 
"Thou wilt not leave my soul in Sheol" (hell), he knew 
that he was speaking prophetically of the Messiah. St. 
Peter pointed out that these words referred, not to David, 
but to Christ, that His soul was not left in hell, neither 
did His flesh see corruption. (Acts 2:27-31.) But Job 
was speaking for himself, and yet prophetically for mankind. 
He was a type of the world. He had lost his flocks 
and herds, his friends, his home, his children, his wife 
and even his health. 



But in due time, God gave Job back just as many 
sons and daughters and twice as many flocks and herds, 
etc. In this way he was a type of the human family. 
Adam and his family have been lost. He was the king 
of the earth, but he lost his authority, and with it everything 
that he had. Ultimately Adam and all of his 
children will come back to their own— child for child. 
And so far as the earthly riches were concerned, he will 
get very much more than he ever lost. Job is a type of 
this Restitution. 

The world is asleep from the Divine standpoint. As 
Job could say, "Hide me in the grave," so once a Christian 
could have said, "I shall be hid in the grave until the 
resurrection." God has made provision for the resurrection 
of all. But did all die alike? We answer that the 
Adamic family are dead in the sense that their life-rights 
were forfeited at the time of the fall. But God looked 
forward and could speak prophetically either through Job 
or through any one else. Job could speak as if he were 
not dead, taking cognizance of the fact that there will be 
a resurrection. The point here seems to be, Was Job's 
life carried over in the same sense that St. Paul's life was 
carried over? By no means. Job was asleep in the 
Adamic death; St. Paul was asleep in Christ. The one 
was the life of the New Creature, and the other was the 
life of the old creature, not begotten of the Holy Spirit 
to the new nature. 



R5109 : page 310 

THE LONDON AND GLASGOW CONVENTIONS 

WHILE ONLY the meetings at Glasgow and 
London have been officially styled Conventions, 
yet really we have had a series of 
Conventions from the time we landed at 
Liverpool. In each place we had at least 
one meeting for the interested, as well as 
one meeting for the public. In every case 
the meetings for the interested were attended 
by friends from nearby places, and 
in every case the public meetings were 
simply splendid, the audiences ranging from five hundred 
to five thousand. And such attention! Evidently the 
message of the Lord's grace was attractive to many— 
and to some most precious and sweet. 

The Glasgow Convention, lasting three days, registered 
an attendance of the interested of about eight hundred, 
while the public meeting ran to five thousand, with 
hundreds turned away. A very loving spirit was manifested 
by the friends. Ireland, Scotland and England 
were well represented. It was good to be there! It was 
a season of refreshment long to be remembered. Those 
in attendance manifestly voted it the best Convention 



they had ever enjoyed. The number immersed was 45. 

The London Convention was held in the Tabernacle, 
which was crowded beyond anything in past history. 
Friends from Scotland, Wales, Ireland and Sweden were 
in attendance; but of course the majority were Londoners 
and from the country round about. The average 
attendance at the meetings was about twelve hundred. 
We had a pleasant time. Again the friends declared that 
this was the best of all Conventions and again we explained 
to them that it should be so— that we are all 
growing riper as the days and weeks go by, and that in 
proportion to our growth in grace should be our growth 
in appreciation of the blessed privileges we are enjoying, 
co-operating with our dear Redeemer in the glorious harvest 
work. Eighty-five were immersed at the Tabernacle. 

The work in Great Britain seems to be prospering 
greatly. The Class Extension feature has been appreciated 
and utilized. Good results are noticed. Many 
have been brought to a clear knowledge of the Truth, 
and some from a partial to a full consecration. We were 
greatly encouraged by our visit. The Lord has much 
people here, and we were pleased with the blessing which 
we see attending the efforts to bring them into touch 
with Present Truth. 



R5109 : page 310 

OUR EUROPEAN CONVENTIONS 

OUR VARIOUS STOPS in Europe were not 
announced as Conventions, but nevertheless 
they were more or less of that character, in 
that friends from the surrounding parts attended. 
Although our principal attention 
was given to the public meetings we greatly 
appreciated the opportunities of addressing 
those already interested. In every case we 
sought to leave practical lessons, and to 
show their relationship to the Scriptures. 

We sought specially to impress the necessity for character 
development on the part of all hoping to share 
Christ's Kingdom. We emphasized the brevity of the time 
for so great a work, provided our understanding of God's 
times and seasons be correct. We freely admitted, as we 
have always done, that we are walking by faith and not by 
sight. But we pointed out that the evidences seem more 
and more to corroborate our expectations. At the same 
time we suggested that should our expectations for October, 
1914, not be realized— for years thereafter— this 
delay would not invalidate God's Great Plan nor our faith 
therein. Our consecration vow calls for faithfulness, 
"even unto death"— whenever death may come. 

Leaving London our first stop was at Denain, France. 
The two meetings were for the interested— the attendance 



being about one hundred. The brethren, mostly coal-miners, 

manifested a deep and intelligent interest in the 

Truth. We had a blessed season of rejoicing with them. 

Our next stop was at Paris, where we had much pleasure 
in meeting and addressing the brethren, but no public 
meeting. Our friends considered the Trocaderro the only 
suitable place. It was partially promised, but afterward 
refused. It is under Governmental control, and its regulation 
forbids that it be used for religious purposes. 

R5110 : page 311 

On we went to Geneva— the chief city of Switzerland 
—Calvin's city. In the forenoon we visited Calvin's Cathedral 
and tried the hard wooden seat once used by the 
scholarly Reformer. Its hardness reminded us of the hard 
doctrine of the predestination of the non-elect to eternal 
torture. 

We visited the monument erected to Servetus by the 
Free Thinkers. It pictured Servetus in jail in rags pleading 
vainly for a change of garments, and saying, "The lice 
are eating me up." It was shortly after that appeal that 
Servetus was roasted alive at the stake for four hours, 
with the wood fire just far enough away not to choke or 
asphyxiate him— that he might suffer the most horrible 
death imaginable. His crime was his inability to count 
"three times one is one." He was too honest to profess 
what he could not believe. 

We visited the city of Servetus' execution and saw 
there the new monument to him erected by Calvin's 
friends as a partial atonement for their leader's error. 
It declares that they deplore the error and repudiate the 
crime as dishonoring to God and man. We thank God 

R5110 : page 311 

that the world is progressing in the spirit of the Truth, 
even though more slowly in the letter of it. 

Our public meeting in Victoria Hall was well attended 
(about 1500), notwithstanding that it was out of season, 
we were told. (Calvin's Cathedral had only about 300 
the same day.) The attention was excellent. We will 
hope for results later on. The Society's office for France 
and Switzerland will hereafter be at Geneva. It is a good 
centre for whatever of the old Huguenot Protestant influence 
yet remains in France and Switzerland. 

Mulhausen, Als., came next in our journey. Although 
it rained incessantly the large hall was crowded and hundreds 
were turned away. The audience was exceptionally 
intelligent and gave closest attention. Some fruitage has 
already appeared. More will follow, we trust. 

Basle came next in our itinerary. Here also we had the 
best hall and many standing and hundreds turned away. 

This same report fits to the succeeding places— Zurich, 
St. Gallen, Munich, Reichenbach and Dresden. Splendid 
interest was manifested both before and after the meetings. 



The brethren, after follow-up meetings, assure us 
that an awakening of thought has stirred the people as 
they never were stirred by religion before. 

DRESDEN'S WELCOME IN VERSE 

Our welcome everywhere was with deepest manifestations 
of Christian love. This at Dresden was emphasized 
by its poetic form, so feelingly expressed that it brought 
tears to the eyes of those who understood the German. 
Later we obtained a copy of the address in German and 
also an English translation, which herewith we present: 

(Translated from the German.) 

[Dedicated in loving remembrance to our Dear Brother Russell on 
the occasion of his visit to Dresden, August 17th, 1912, by the Class 
at Dresden.] 

Child of God, wait patiently and calmly, tho' steeper grows 

thy path, 
Committed to His care whose grace thus far hath kept thee; 
And tho' the night of trouble draweth on, with clouds both 

black and dense, 
Follow faithfully the Lamb; the morrow will be light! 

Child of God, rest fearlessly in Him whose arm securely 

holds; 
Thou mayst trust Him as a child doth trust, because thou 

art His own. 
And tho' the night be very long, thou art His child, be not 

dismayed, 
Confiding in His Word, for it proclaims the light of morn. 

Child of God, does His commission send thee out in all the 

world? 
Thou shalt feel, yea, very surely, how He in His love upholds. 
Proclaim in North, South, East and West the Kingdom now 

in sight, 
And gather in what still remains of children of the Light. 

Child of God, pursue thy journey, as doth a star; 

And when thy plea to Heaven ascends, let us remembered be; 

With thee, relying on His might, we come before His face; 

No fear can trouble in the night, through which we pass to light. 

The Berlin meeting for the interested (like the one at 
Dresden) showed a considerable gathering of the dear 
friends from the surrounding country— two from Russia. 
The hall for the public gathering held 2000, but it is estimated 
that 5000 were turned away. The acoustics of the 
hall were not the best, but a grand witness to the Truth 
went forth. Some of the hearers manifested great 
interest. 

Next came Elberfeld. We had the City Hall. Every 
seat was filled, about 200 stood and crowds were turned 



away. The audience here was one of the best, if we may 
judge from their intelligent appearance and close attention. 
The Barmen-Elberfeld region is one of the most 
religious in Germany. And, by the way, we learn that 
higher criticism and the evolution theory have made great 
havoc with Christian faith in Germany. We have it from 
several that not one person in ten believes in the Bible as 
a Divine revelation; and our informants thought that 
even a personal, intelligent Creator is not believed in. If 
it is really half so bad it is terrible— "Without God and 
having no hope in the world." 

Copenhagen, Denmark, was our next stop. Here we 
had fresh evidences of the warmth of the Danish sentiment. 
Our friends assembled in goodly numbers to our 
mutual joy. And the public meeting was a repetition of 
those of Germany. A crowded hall— hundreds turned 
away— intelligent and deep interest. 

In Finland, a part of Russia, was our next appointment 
—at Helsingfors. Our first visit to the Finnish people 
was encouraging. We liked the people. Their humiliation 
at losing their liberty to Russia may be a blessing- 
working in them meekness and preparing some of them 
for the Truth. 

Two Finnish brothers have been specially active for 
two years to serve the Truth to all the Truth-hungry. 
They have translated three volumes of the SCRIPTURE 
STUDIES and EVERYBODY'S PAPER for free circulation, at 
their own expense. Now about fifteen Colporteurs are 
carrying the Truth to every nook and corner of the land. 

The public meeting was crowded to the capacity of 
the hall— 1000— many standing; some almost in tears because 
they could not gain admission. Certain seats were 
reserved for some of the elite of the city, but the crowd 
climbed through the windows, etc., and no seats could be 
kept; and those who had tickets for reserved seats could 
not get near the doors long before the time for beginning 
the lecture. 

Here we were interpreted first in Swedish and afterward 
in Finnish, because the population is mixed. The 
evidence is that God has some true children in Finland 
to whom his Harvest Message is now due. 

SUMMARY OF THE HARVEST-WORK IN FINLAND 

The work in Finland is quite new. It seems to make 
excellent progress. The number of Colporteurs engaged, 
and the fact that it is self-sustaining, speak well for the 
depth of interest. The following report will prove interesting: 

NOVEMBER 1, 1911, TO AUGUST 1, 1912.

Stockholm, Sweden, was one of our very interesting 
appointments. We addressed about 300 of the friends 
four times with great pleasure and, we trust, with profit. 
We also had a grand opportunity for a public witness, in 
the "Circus." About 1,500 were present notwithstanding 
it was a rainy forenoon. May God grant His blessing! 

On our journey back to London we stopped at Kiel, Germany, 
where we had a repetition of our previous experiences— 
an earnest class of Bible students numbering about 
30; a great crowd, and deep interest at the public meeting, 
and many turned from the doors with reading matter. 

London got the evening before our start for Liverpool 
and Brooklyn. We had first a social meeting with the Elders 
and Deacons, and then a general meeting with the 
Tabernacle congregation, which was well represented. We 
concluded with a farewell; and, asked when we could return, 
we promised— "Soon as the Lord seems to indicate- 
possibly within six months!" 

Arrived at our boat's wharf in Liverpool, we found 
about forty of the dear Liverpool friends waiting for us. 
They sang for us, "Blest be the tie that binds," and as we 
started— "God be with you till we meet again." 

Some of the passengers afterward remarked to us the 
sweetness of the Farewell song ! It reminded them of God 
and His protective power, and of human dependence on 
Him, especially on the mighty deep. 

Our home-coming was equally pleasant. About twelve 
of the Brooklyn Elders met us at the pier as representatives 
of the class and especially of the family. And on our 
arrival at Bethel we had mutual felicitations, a hymn of 
praise to our God and a prayer of grateful thanks to Him 
whose mercy endureth forever. 



Nothing else, perhaps, better shows that we have the 
Truth than does the fact that it produces the same spirit 
wherever it goes. From Maine to California, from Canada 
to Texas, from Great Britain to Japan— the spirit 
of God's people is the same. Why? Because ye were 
all baptized by one spirit into one Body— Christ.

A SIGN FROM HEAVEN 

--NOVEMBER 3.-MARK 8:11-26.- 

"Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the Light of the world; 
he that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have 
the light of life. "-John 8:12. 

THE SCRIBES AND PHARISEES-the leading 
religionists and teachers of Jesus' day- 
were perplexed and troubled by His success 
in reaching the people. True, those who 
heard Him gladly were chiefly of the common 
people, whom the Jewish teachers had 
come to despise, terming them "publicans 
and sinners," and refusing to recognize 
them as brethren. They considered Jesus a 
competitor and a successful one, and feared, 
not without a cause, that their own reputations as teachers 
were becoming tarnished because of the superiority of 
Jesus as a Teacher, whose "Wonderful Words of Life" 
touched the hearts of many. 

These Pharisees came specially to find fault— "tempting" 
Jesus. They asked Him for "a sign from heaven." 
Their real purpose was to belittle the many signs He was 
giving the people, in the healing of the sick, etc. Ignoring 
all these, they said, What sign can you give us from 
heaven? We want a heavenly sign; give us that and we 
will believe on you. 

In order to be able to sympathize to some extent with 
the chief rulers of the Jews at that time, we must remember 
how different were the things which Jesus was doing 
in proof of His Messiahship from the things which they 
had supposed He would do. The prophecies told many 
things of Messiah, but they in reading them had given 
special heed to those which spoke of His glory and of 
the power that would come to the Jewish nation, and of 
the blessing which the Jewish nation would ultimately bestow 
upon all nations, for the blessing of the world during 
Messiah's Kingdom. They overlooked, and did not study 
carefully enough or deeply enough other Scriptures of 
a totally different kind. 

These other Scriptures tell of how Messiah would "be 
led as a Lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her 
shearers is dumb, so He would open not His mouth." 
(He would be "dumb" in the sense that He would not open 
His mouth to prevent His condemnation and death.) 
They told of how He would "preach deliverance to the 
captives," and the opening of the eyes of the blind, but 
these they associated with the glorious Kingdom rather 
than with the period of Messiah's being "despised and rejected 
of men," and of their hiding their faces from Him 



in shame, in disesteem. 

True, they should have studied the Scriptures properly. 
It might be said that they were not at fault in making 
this mistake; in one sense that might be true. On the 
other hand, however, we are to remember that their difficulty 
really was pride of heart, and a know-it-all spirit. 
They lacked humility, and therefore were not teachable. 
The "Israelites indeed," who did accept Jesus' Message, 
doubtless had similar misunderstandings of the prophecies, 
but they were open to conviction and ready to be led and 
guided, and to these the Master's teachings were attractive, 
blessed, wonderful. They were guided gradually 
to the correct understanding of each feature of the Divine 
Plan as it became due, and thus they became ready for the 
Pentecostal blessing in due time, and manifested themselves 
as part of the Elect, which God was choosing to 
be the Bride of Messiah, and joint-heir in His Kingdom. 

NO SIGN BUT THAT OF JONAH 

Our lesson tells that Jesus sighed deeply and said, 
"Why doth this generation seek after a sign?" and refused 
to give them a sign, and departed for the other side of the 
Lake. Saint Matthew (16: 1-4) gives a more detailed 
account of this question and its answer. Jesus called the 
attention of the Pharisees to the signs that He was giving 
in abundance to them, and then said that there would be 
one great sign given that nation; but it was not given 
until Calvary. That "sign" did have a great effect upon 
thousands of Jews, as is evidenced by the account in 
Acts of the thousands who were baptized on Pentecost 

R5111 : page 313 

Day, and subsequently, upon hearing Saint Peter's preaching 
respecting the death of Jesus, His three days in the 
tomb and His resurrection on the third day. 

Jesus cited the sign of Jonah, that as he was (portions 
of) three days and nights in the belly of the fish, so the 
Son of Man would be a similar period in the earth, and 
as Jonah came forth, so the Son of Man would come forth. 

We leave it for Higher Critics to fight out amongst 
themselves the proposition they raise in opposition to our 
Lord's statement. According to Higher Critics, Jesus and 
the Apostles were badly deceived, in every sense of the 
word; but according to Jesus and the Apostles, the Higher 
Critics are badly deceived. We prefer to stand by the 
Word of God, let who will take the "wisdom of men." 

THE LEAVEN OF THE PHARISEES 

After entering the boat Jesus cautioned His disciples 
against the doctrine of the Pharisees— He likened it to 
leaven— yeast. Leaven is a ferment, which spreads, especially 
in dough for bread. God's Word is Truth, the 
bread upon which His people are to feed. But they are to 



use the unleavened bread— pure bread, pure Truth, unmixed 
with the leaven of human philosophy. 

This caution was necessary because the Pharisees 
were apparently and really the most holy sect or party 
amongst the Jews. The most earnest and most zealous 
and most gifted Jews would therefore naturally be attracted 
to that sect. Its claimed association with the highest 
and best things made the sect and its teachings the 
more dangerous, because its bread, its truth, was intermingled 
with human traditions which would make sick 
and dyspeptic, and to that extent poison all the minds 
which received it. 

The same lesson is applicable to us today; no matter 
how holy any denomination of Christians may claim to 
be and seem to be, we are to remember to beware of their 
"leaven," their false doctrine— to be on the lookout for 
it, to avoid it. It is the pure Truth of God's Word that is 
able to make us "wise unto salvation" and which, the 
Apostle says, "is sufficient, that the man of God may be 
thoroughly furnished unto every good work." 

Let us all, then, as Christians of all denominations, 
unite our hearts and minds in full consecration to our 
Lord and Redeemer to do the Heavenly Father's will; and 
let us stand free and clear from all the "leaven" in all the 
various creeds, which in the past have done so much to 
separate the people of the Lord into six hundred denominations. 
We deprecate this division as more and more 
bearing in upon God's people everywhere, and more and 
more we desire to unite the earnest hearts under one 
Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God and Father over 
all, and one "Church of the First-born, whose names are 
written in heaven." 

"PERCEIVE YE NOT YET?" 

The disciples very stupidly missed the point of Jesus' 
parabolic statement about the leaven of the Pharisees. 
They at once thought of literal leaven and literal bread, 
and noted that they had only one loaf with them and supposed 
that the Master was upbraiding them. Their mental 
eyes, their eyes of understanding, were not very widely 
open, and Jesus promptly and very plainly told them so, 
and apparently with a measure of chagrin, that after all 
the teaching He had given them they should be so slow 
to perceive the spirit of His words. 

He reminded them of the miracle of the five thousand 
fed with the five loaves, and asked them how many basketfuls 
of fragments they collected. They answered, 
"Twelve." He reminded them of the other feeding of 
the four thousand with seven loaves, and asked them how 
many baskets were taken up. They answered, "Seven." 
He said, How, then, do you not understand that I was not 
finding fault with you for having only one loaf; surely, if 
I had the power to produce bread before, I have still that 
power, and could not have referred to your lack of bread. 

The same thing is noticeable today amongst the Lord's 



people in Bible Study frequently; the spirit of our Lord's 
teachings is often missed altogether by some whose minds 
center merely around some little incidental. The remedy 
for this is a closer walk with God; a more careful study of 
the Divine Word, entering into the spirit of the Master 
and His work, as footstep followers. In this connection 
let us not forget the difficult "thorns" which another parable 
tells us so frequently infest the hearts and minds of 
God's people and hinder the Word of Truth from bringing 
forth its proper fruitage. The "thorns" are "the cares 
of this life and the deceitfulness of riches," Jesus said. 

Arriving at Bethsaida a blind man was brought to Him 
with a desire that He would heal him. Jesus took him by 
the hand and led him out beyond the village. He spat 
upon his eyes and put His hands upon him and asked him 
if he saw anything. He looked up and said that he saw 
something that looked like trees moving about which he 
supposed to be men. Again Jesus put His hands upon his 
eyes and bade him look once more. He did so and saw 
clearly. The object in employing this method is not clear 
to us, but quite probably the man himself lacked faith and 
Jesus was gradually developing it in him. This thought 
is borne out by the final statement that the man looked 
steadily, and kept looking for some time, and then declared 
that he could see everything clearly. Apparently 
the Lord required the man to exercise his full power of 
will and to strive to see things.

"COME AND LET US RETURN" 

--NOVEMBER 10.-ISAIAH 5:7-16.- 

"Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may 
follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine 
inflame."— Vs. 1 1. 

TODAY'S LESSON had its primary force in 
connection with the affairs of Natural Israel 
in the days of the Prophet. But when we 
remember that Natural Israel types Christendom 
we find a value in this lesson very 
pertinent to our time. As the Lord called 
Israel His vineyard so did He with Christendom. 
"And He looked for judgment 
[justice], but, behold, oppression; for 
righteousness [equity] and, behold, a cry" 
of distress. As to the national cry and the reason for it, 
see verse eight, which reads: 

"Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay 
field to field, till there be no place, that they may be 
placed alone in the midst of the earth!" Here we perceive 
that a spirit of selfishness prevailed in Isaiah's 



day, as it does today; as then property was disposed to 
accumulate in the hands of the more successful, so it is 
today. As then landlordism took possession of vast areas, 
neglectful of the fact that "the earth hath the Lord given 
unto the children of men," and not merely to a few of 
them, so is it today. 

Only by the most strenuous laws, and in some cases 
revolution, have the people maintained a hold of considerable 

R5112: page 314 

portions of the earth. The French Revolution 
broke up the large holdings there; special laws have 
thrown open the lands of Ireland. In the United States 
large corporations have grasped immense bodies of land, 
some of which unlawfully seized have been restored to the 
people for a more equitable distribution. As in Isaiah's 
day, many of the wealthy seemed to ignore the rights of 
the people and to be indifferent to their necessities, so it 
is today. We are not to overlook the fact that there are 
many noble, generous souls amongst the rich, as well as 
amongst the poor; we are merely calling attention to the 
parallelism between the conditions in Israel and the conditions 
here in our day. 

THEN A TIME OF TROUBLE 

Divine disapproval of human hard-heartedness, selfishness 
and neglect of poorer brethren, and the forgetfulness 
of the fact that we are all children of one blood 
and amenable to the laws of the same Creator, brought 
upon the Israelites the Divine chastisements, judgments. 
We believe that the Scriptures with equal clearness tell 
of a great "time of trouble" now impending over the 
world, but especially over Christendom— a time particularly 
mentioned by Saint James, saying, "Go to now, ye 
rich men, weep and howl for the misery that shall come 
upon you."— James 5:1. 

This trouble is mentioned in today's study, verse 9: 
"The Lord of Hosts said in my hearing, Of a truth many 
houses shall be desolate, even great and fair [houses and 
families], without inhabitant." If we rightly appreciate 
what the Scriptures foresaw respecting times not far 
ahead of us, we will see that many of the great and 
rich will be in a sad plight in their country-side homes, 
as will be some of the poorer in the congested cities, for 
the time of trouble, it is declared, will be upon all. The 
Prophet proceeds to indicate that shortage of crops will 
have much to do with the trouble: "Yea, ten acres of 
vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer 
shall yield an ephah." 

Never before has the world been so amply fortified 
against all peculiarities of conditions. Drouth and famine 
in one part may be relieved by the surplus of another part; 
nevertheless, we are to remember that the entire situation 
is in the Divine hand, and that if a shortage of food 



supply should now come to pass it would indicate a Divine 
intention in the matter, more than at any time in the 
world's history. 

MUSIC, REVELRY, INTOXICATION 

The text given us for today's lesson comes next in our 
study. It implies that in the days of Isaiah's prophecy 
many of the rich indulged themselves in intoxicating 
liquors, music, revelry, etc., to their own injury as well 
as to the neglect of their responsibilities to God. They 
asked, "Am I my brother's keeper?" even as Cain asked 
this question. By their accumulated wealth they had more 
than heart could wish, while others had insufficient and 
were needy. Their brilliancy of intellect and good fortune 
in life enabled them to triumph over the curse, which 
reads: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, 
until thou return unto the ground, for out of it wast thou 
taken."— Gen. 3:19. 

But this victory gave them time, for which they were 
also responsible. Instead of using that time for the general 
blessing of their fellowmen, and their money for the 
general uplift of humanity, they accumulated houses and 
lands, etc., and drank constantly and excessively to their 
injury. Could they wonder that such a course would not 
have Divine approval? Could they wonder that all these 
things would bring upon them some disaster? 

And how about today? is it the same? We answer, 
Yes and No. With many it is the same exactly, 
but with a considerable number of the wealthy 
of our day it is very different, we are glad 
to say. Continually we have evidences of the noble rich, 
as well as of the noble poor. Continually we have evidences 
that some of the wealthy consider their possessions 
as a trust from the Almighty to be used in His service, to 
be used for the sake of humanity, for its uplift, its comfort. 
Nearly every quarter of Christendom can boast of 
some such characters, but alas, they are comparatively 
few. The majority of the rich, like the majority of the 
poor, are selfish to the core. 

It is in this direction that we are to look for the danger 
which the Scriptures declare to be imminent. When 
the selfish rich and the selfish poor shall join issue in a 
great struggle, as the Bible clearly declares they will do, 
then the world will see the time of trouble prophesied 
—"such as never was since there was a nation"— a time 
of trouble which Jesus declares will never be again, because 
following that great trouble, upon the ashes of the 
present civilization, Immanuel, Messiah, the Son of the 
Highest, will establish the Kingdom of God, the rule of 
righteousness under the whole heavens, for the blessing 
of all the families of the earth, the rich, the poor. 

THE OPERATION OF GOD'S HANDS 

God's complaint in verse 12 is that the rich in their 



feasting and music and selfish aggregation of wealth regarded 
not the work of the Lord, neither considered the 
operation of His hands. In applying this to our day, let 
it not be thought that we are objecting that the wealthy 
do not contribute sufficiently for the maintenance of the 
various denominations of Christendom. 

The thought we gather is that God would have the 
prosperous people of our day take a broad view of His 
work, of humanity in general. He would have them concentrate 
their mental powers and force of character, not 
upon the personal aggregation of wealth, but upon generous 
schemes for the blessing and uplifting of the entire 
race. "The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof"; 
"He hath given it to the children of men." Ultimately, 
according to the Scriptures, He intends that the world 
as a whole is to share, upon a basis of equality, all of 
earth's advantages. 

Thus Socialism, according to the Bible, will be the 
ultimate condition of the earth in which all mankind will 
receive a blessing. Socialists, not aware of this teaching 
of God's Word, these promises of the future, or if aware 
of them doubting them, propose to take over in the interest 
of all mankind the great blessings which are now in the 
hands of the comparatively few. To us their schemes appear 
dangerous, impracticable. To us it appears, as the 
Scriptures indicate, that failing to accomplish their benevolent 
designs, Socialists will become bitter anarchists, 
and plunge themselves and the whole world into the most 
awful trouble ever known. 

But what an opportunity is now slipping through the 
fingers of some of the very wealthy— an opportunity to 
join in with the noblest and best of the Socialists and help 
to lead the masses of the people, not toward anarchy, but 
away from it— toward the conditions which God's Word 
and the principles of Justice and righteousness set before 
us as the proper conditions— the ideal conditions ! 

Among the many wealthy people of our day are some 
multi-millionaires, who could accomplish much for mankind, 
and who, indeed, have already accomplished much, 
and who have the wealth necessary and those hearts, we 
believe, are longing for an opportunity to do good; but 

R5112: page 315 

doubtless the opportunity will pass unimproved; the time 
of trouble foretold will fall upon the race. 

We must admit, in any event, that even if Socialism 
were established in the world it could not be maintained 
in any degree of perfection except by men thoroughly 
converted to God— men who would feel their responsibility 
to God and to men. In other words, what we need is 
the conversion of the world, not merely to an outward 
bowing of the knee, but to a heart-harmony with God and 
the principles of His righteousness. 

Will this ever come? Ah, yes! The mouth of the 
Lord hath spoken it! But it cannot come through any 



power of ours. We can favor it, advocate it, and point 
toward it, but, individually, those who love righteousness 
and who see the way of the Lord are so insignificant that 
they cannot accomplish what they would for their fellows. 
"Wait ye upon Me, saith the Lord, until that day!" "For 
then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they 
may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve Him with 
one consent."— Zeph. 3:8,9. 

R5113 : page 315 

In His own time, following the great time of trouble, 
God will humble the world. Meantime the Elect saints 
will be glorified, and with Messiah, as His Bride, constitute 
the long-promised Kingdom of God for the blessing 
of humanity. Then Satan shall be bound and all the good 
influences of righteousness and truth and knowledge shall 
be let loose for the blessing of the world. 

"HELL HATH ENLARGED HERSELF" 

The Lord tells us that because of these conditions His 
people are in captivity, not knowing how to help themselves, 
lacking knowledge, and their honorable men are 
famished, weak, perplexed, ignorant of the proper course; 
and the multitude who rely upon them are also thirsty. 
This is the famine elsewhere mentioned, not for bread, 
nor for water, but for a hearing of the Message of the 
Lord, the Gospel of Messiah's Kingdom, which is the very 
Message that all need to hear. 

On account of the same conditions, "Hell hath enlarged 
herself and opened her mouth without measure; 
and their glory and their multitude and their pomp, and he 
that rejoiceth shall descend into it." Not the hell of eternal 
torment taught in our various creeds is here meant, 
but the Bible hell, the grave, the state of death. The 
time of trouble approaching will mean the loss of much 
life; as Jesus said, "Unless those days should be shortened, 
there should no flesh be saved."— Matt. 24:22. 



R5113 : page 315 

THE WHITE STONE GIVEN THE OVERCOMERS 

"To him that overcometh will I give. ..a white stone, and 
in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth 
save he that receiveth it."— Rev. 2:17. 

IN ANCIENT TIMES the Greeks and the 
Romans had a custom of noting and perpetuating 
friendship by means of a white 
stone. This stone was divided into halves, 
and each person inscribed his name on the 
flat surface, after which the parts of the 



stone were exchanged. The production of 

either half was sufficient to insure friendly 

aid, even from the descendants of those who 

first divided the stone. A similar custom 

was sometimes observed by a king, who would break a 

white stone into two parts, one of which he would retain 

and the other part give to a special ambassador. That 

part could be sent to the king at any time and would insure 

aid. Thus the divided stone became a mark of 

identification. 

Rev. 2:17 seems to refer to this ancient custom. The 
white stone signifies a precious token of the Lord's love, 
and the new name written in the stone suggests the Bridegroom's 
name. The statement indicates a special acquaintance 
with the great King of kings, secret between 
Himself and the individual. The overcomers are not to 
be recognized merely as a class— the Bride class— but 
each will have the personal favor of the Lord. Of this 
no one will know save himself and the King. There is 
an individual and personal relationship between the Lord 
and the overcomers, who may be said to receive the mark 
of identification— the antitypical white stone— now, in this 
life. 

This mark is the sealing of the Holy Spirit by which 
the Lord identifies the overcomers. While this is said 
to be a part of the final reward of the Church, yet from 
the very beginning of our experience we have this personal 
acquaintance with the Lord. The full seal of the 
Holy Spirit will be given in the Resurrection, when we 
receive the new body. Then we shall have the complete 
knowledge of the name by which we shall be known to the 
Lord and He to us forever. 



"THE GOOD FIGHT OF FAITH" 

I came and saw, and hoped to conquer, 
As the great Roman once had done; 

His was the one hour's torrent shock of battle, 
My field was harder to be won. 

I came and saw, but did not conquer, 

The foes were fierce, their weapons strong; 

I came and saw, but yet I did not conquer, 
For me the fight was sore and long. 

They said the war was brief and easy, 

A word, a look, would crush the throng; 

To some it may have been a moment's conflict, 
To me it has been sore and long. 

They said the threats were coward bluster, 
To brave men they could work no wrong; 

So some may boast of swift and easy battle, 
To me it has been sore and long. 



And yet I know that I shall conquer, 

Though sore and hard the fight may be; 

I know, I know I shall be more than victor 
Through Him who won the fight for me. 

I fight, not fearful of the issue, 

My victory is sure and near; 
Yet not the less with hand and eye all watchful, 

Grasp I my buckler and my spear. 

For I must fight, if I would conquer, 
'Tis not by flight that fields are won; 

And I must conquer, if I would inherit 
The victor's joy and crown and throne. 
HORATIUS BONAR.

SELF-ESTEEM'S ADVANTAGES AND DRAWBACKS 

WHOEVER WILL CAREFULLY study the 

matter we believe will agree that a moderate 

amount of self-esteem is a great aid to success 

in the present life. It gives a self-confidence 

in respect to all of life's affairs, 

great and small. It impels its possessor to 

do and to dare to the full extent of his 

ability— if caution be lacking it may lead 

on to disastrous folly. But the lack of self-confidence, 

self-esteem, has held back thousands 

who otherwise might have been brilliant leaders in 



the path of progress. 

Having pointed out some of the advantages of reasonable 
self-confidence we should point out some of the disadvantages 
of over-confidence— too great self-esteem. Its 
arrogance, its pride, its snobbishness, are disgusting and 
continually interfere with the progress of the unfortunate 
possessor. He never learns except by bitter experiences, 
because he always thinks he knows, and exposes 
his ignorance. 

Some of the best people, the saintly, have small self-esteem, 
depreciate their own talents and exaggerate 
their own blemishes. Their humbleness of mind is a 
blessing when it leads them to God— to the Throne of 
Heavenly grace for forgiveness and for grace to help in 
every time of need. As between too much and too little 
self-esteem, therefore, our choice should be the latter. 

"LET A MAN THINK SOBERLY" 

Whether born with too much or with too little self-esteem, 
those who come into God's family are put into 
the School of Christ to be taught, corrected— made right, 
in harmony with Divine standards. Those naturally self-conceited 
must learn meekness— by instructions if they 
will— otherwise by experiences. And they should learn to 
rejoice even in humiliating experiences. They are evidences 
that God's providence is supervising their affairs 
and preparing them for the Kingdom; for without meekness 
and humility none will be fit for it. 

As the self-conceited must learn humbly to trust God 
and not rely on themselves and thus secure balance, so 
the naturally self-depreciative must learn a lesson of confidence. 
Not self-confidence, not self-reliance is the most 
desirable, but rather confidence in God and reliance upon 
His promised "grace to help in every time of need." 
This maintains the desirable humility and meekness, yet 
gives the courage and force suggested by the Apostle's 
words: "I can do all things through Christ, which 
strengtheneth me." (Phil. 4:13.) As St. Paul again declares, 
"Our sufficiency is of God!" 

Thus inspired by faith in God and in His promises 
those "taught of God" become marvelously "strong in the 
Lord, and in the power of His might." (Eph. 6:10.) The 
righteous is strong as a lion, saying, "I will not fear what 
man may do unto me." (Psa. 118:6.) I will not heed 
what man may say of me or do to me. So long as I have 
the Almighty Creator for my Father and the Redeemer 
for my elder Brother I shall be content, relying on their 
"exceeding great and precious promises." 

Thus, whether by nature self-conceited or humble, 
God's Word and providences in Christ tend to bring all 
followers of Christ to oneness of heart and mind. The 
one is humbled, the other exalted. Both learn not to trust 

R5114: page 319 



in self or the arm of flesh, but in Him who is able to do 
for them exceedingly, abundantly, more than they could 
ask or think, according to the riches of His grace in 
Christ Jesus our Lord. 

Here note the Apostle's exhortation that a man "think 
of himself not more highly than he ought, but think 
soberly," according to the measure of God's grace bestowed 
on him. (Rom. 12:3.) If any man has received 
none of God's grace, favor, mercy, forgiveness, surely 
it is not because he did not need it. Let him therefore 
feel his poverty without it. If any man has received 
much of God's grace it was because he needed it. He 
therefore may boast, but not of himself. His boast may 
well be in God who is thus working in him "to will and 
to do of His good pleasure."— Phil. 2:13. 

LACK OF SELF-APPRECIATION 

This deficiency operates in many ways not generally 
suspected. Many a man is a beggar or a thief simply 
because of a lack of self-appreciation. He thinks, I am 
nobody— and everybody knows it. He hangs his head in 
self-shame. He has a guilty look without having committed 
crime. He is treated according to his estimate 
of himself as expressed in his acts and looks, all of which 
reflect unconsciously his mental picture of himself. 

When some, measuring him by his looks, declare: You 
are a mean man, a rascal, a thief, a scoundrel; I can see 
it— I can read you through and through! the effect is to 
thoroughly discourage him. Accepting the rating of his 
own brain and its reflection in the words of others he 
becomes rascal, scoundrel, thief. Few there are of 
benevolent heart to see the trouble of this class and 
sympathetically to give an encouraging word— to turn the 
scale and help bring forward the better qualities of the 
mind and heart. 

It is here that the Gospel of Jesus does for such what 
nothing else could do. The Master's voice rings out in 

R5114: page 320 

contrast with all other voices saying: Come unto Me, all 
ye that labor and are heavy laden and discouraged; I will 
give you rest. Ye shall find rest unto your souls! 

Ah, the change! The discouraged one says, Then I 
am not beyond hope; not so mean, not so degraded that 
Jesus would pass me by. The very suggestion inspires 
new hope. If followed, it leads on and on to the riches 
of God's grace provided in Christ for the penitent, the 
willing, the obedient. 

By the time such a man receives the begetting of the 
Holy Spirit and is able to cry, "Abba, Father!" old things 
pass away and all things become new. However, his 
fleshly weaknesses and unworthiness may still continually 
cry, You are unworthy; however, still in humility, he may 
acknowledge this with groans and tears, he is not cast 



down! He has God's assurance that he is a New Creature 
in Christ, whose perfect spirit body awaits him in the 
First Resurrection. He has the assurance that God 
knows of his fleshly weaknesses, and has made provision 
for his forgiveness through Christ, the Advocate. He 
has the assurance that it is not the flesh that God expects 
to perfect, but the New Creature, the heart, the will. 
He has the assurance that he is a son of God and a joint-heir 
with Christ in His great Messianic Kingdom, which 
soon is to bless the world. He has the assurance that all 
present trials of faith and patience and loyalty to God, to 
the Truth and to the brethren are permitted to test his 
heart-loyalty, without which he could not be a joint-heir 
in Messiah's Kingdom. These Divine assurances make 
strong the weak and give courage not only in respect to 
the future life, but also in the affairs of the present. No 
wonder the Bible speaks of the followers of Christ as 
transformed and mind-renewed!— Rom. 12:2. 

IN RESPECT TO PHYSICAL HEALTH 

It may surprise some to learn that lack of self-confidence 
affects physical health as well as morals. Physiologists 
are agreed that the mind has much to do with 
the operation of all the human functions. The man deficient 
in self-esteem not only feels mean in respect to 
other affairs of life, but he lacks physical tone, snap, 
energy, so necessary to our best success in any avenue of 
life. How hope, joy, peace, content can affect the liver, 
spleen and stomach none can explain; but the fact is conceded. 
How despair and hopelessness can and do affect 
not only the various functions of the brain but the heart, 
stomach, liver, gall, etc., we cannot explain; but the fact 
is conceded. 

The person lacking self-esteem is disgusted with himself 
and ready to imagine any disease, and is proportionately 
predisposed to diseases. 

Wisely, therefore, physicians and philosophers are advising 
people to hold up their heads; not to become discouraged; 
not to imagine every sensation a symptom of a 
dangerous disease. This salutary advice is good for such: 
to look on the brighter side of life; to think of being 
strong— to imagine themselves strong, healthy, happy, 
and to feel and to be as nearly perfect as their imperfect 
minds and bodies will permit. This anti-bilious view of 
life is sure to bring encouragement and blessing to some. 

But nothing will so thoroughly offset the burdens of 
life as the grace of God. Whoever receives the "wedding 
garment" no longer is so overwhelmed by the appearance 
of the filthy rags of his own unrighteousness. Whoever 
realizes that as a son of God and follower of the 
Savior he is an ambassador for God has no time specially 
to pamper and coddle his flesh, nor to make its care his 
paramount thought. He must be about his Heavenly 
Father's business! He must make use of his ambassadorship! 
He must "show forth the praises of Him who called 



us out of darkness into His marvelous light!" 

The effect of these new ambitions, hopes, aims, upon 
his physical health is often marvelous. It serves as a 
spiritual nerve-tonic. It stimulates the mortal to service 
Divine. The new mind does not suggest carelessness of 
the mortal body— nor yet carefulness, except to the extent 
that necessary care may obtain the larger results to God's 
glory from the consumption of the human energies. 
Hence, as St. Paul says, "Godliness is profitable unto all 
things, having the promise of the life that now is as well 
as of that which is to come."— I Tim. 4:8. 



R5114: page 320 

THE DEVELOPMENT OF FAITH THROUGH FIERY TRIALS 

"That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of 
gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found 
unto praise and honor and glory at the 
appearing of Jesus Christ."— 1 Pet. 1:7. 

FAITH MAY BE said to have in it the two elements 

of intellectual assurance and heart-reliance. 

Both the head and the heart— the 

intellect and the affections— are necessary 

to the faith without which it is impossible 

to please God. With some, faith is all emotion; 

with others, it is all intellectuality. 

But neither of these elements alone can 

withstand the fiery tests to which faith is 

subjected. Both must be present and remain, 

if our faith be that which will endure to the end and 

be found unto praise, honor and glory at the appearing of 

our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 

The trial of our faith to which our Lord and the 
Apostles refer is a trial, not only of our intellectual knowledge 
of Divine Truth, but also of our heart-reliance upon 
God. In both respects, the true child of God will find 
himself severely tried. Let him see to it that he has a 
"Thus saith the Lord" for every item of his belief. Let 
him study the doctrine and get a clear understanding of 
every element of the Truth. Let him become rooted, 
grounded, settled and established in the doctrines of God, 
and give earnest heed lest at any time he let them slip. 
-Heb. 2:1. 

When he has his faith well grounded in the fundamental 
principles of Divine Truth, let every consecrated child 
of God see to it that he also continue to cultivate heart-reliance 
in the "great and precious promises." St. Peter 
tells us that a faith which has stood the tests of fiery ordeal 
and has come off victorious is very precious in the 
sight of the Heavenly Father. Whenever we pass 
through a fiery trial and still retain, not only our faith in 
the doctrines, but also our confidence in God, our reliance 



in His promises, our integrity of heart and purpose, and 
our zeal for Truth and righteousness, then our characters 
have grown more Christ-like and hence more pleasing 
to God, who subjects us to discipline for this very 
purpose. 

St. Peter intimates in our text that the faith of those 
called throughout the Gospel Age will receive a severe 
testing. He says, "That the trial of your faith, being 
much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it 
be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor 
and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ." In the present 

R5115 : page 321 

time, when gold is comparatively a rare metal, it has a 
special value. Therefore, the Apostle compares it to the 
faith of the Little Flock, to whom alone, of all humanity, 
will be given the glory, honor and immortality promised 
to those who overcome. 

Hence the trial of the faith of this class is very 
important. None will be admitted to membership in the 
Body of Christ who has not been tested and proved by the 
Lord. But let us remember that our testing is not to see 
whether we are perfect according to the flesh. On the 
contrary, God knows our frame; He remembers that we 
are dust.-Psa. 103:14. 

What God is seeking in us is the development and 
perfection of faith. We are tested to see whether we 
believe in Him as a faithful, wise, loving and true God; 
and in His Son as our Redeemer, who purchased us with 
His own precious blood, and as our Advocate, who now 
covers our blemishes, past, present and future, with the 
Robe of His imputed Righteousness. These are the elements 
of faith which He will test thoroughly and which 
must grow stronger as time goes by. Without strong, 
well-tested faith in God and His promises, we cannot 
please Him and become members of the Elect class which 
He is now selecting. 

THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH FAITH IS TRIED 

The trial of our faith is not left to chance. It is 
supervised by our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, who is represented 
by the Prophet Malachi as a refiner and purifier 
of gold and of silver, that He may purify the antitypical 
House of Levi, and separate the dross from the precious 
metal. (Mai. 3:3.) In one sense of the word, He came 
as that refiner at the First Advent. During the entire 
Gospel Age, He has been doing the refining work in His 
people, that the offering to the Father might be an 
acceptable one. 

First of all, our Lord laid down His life in fulfilment 
of the types of the Law, thus demonstrating His absolute 
trust, loyalty, and faith in God. The Church of Christ 
must be similarly tested and proved in respect to their 
obedience, trust, loyalty to the Father. They must be 



willing, not only to trust God when things are favorable, 
but to trust in His providences when they cannot see the 
outcome. To attain this degree of faith, they must pass 
through manifold trials and testings, that they may 
demonstrate their faith and loyalty. 

During the Gospel Age a peculiar, special and called-out 
class is being dealt with. We can see that God is 
not dealing with the world, but allows it to "lie in the 
Wicked One." (I John 5:19, Diaglott.) St. Paul tells us 
that during those times when the people were in ignorance, 
God paid no particular attention to their conduct, 
except when it went to an extreme. (Acts 17:30.) But 
during the next Age, whoever does not repent when he 
hears the Gospel will make no advancement; but will, in 
conjunction with the Divine Plan, have punishments, 
stripes, for anything that he knowingly does that is wrong. 
This Gospel Age, however, is for the development of a 
specially called-out class— a people for a purpose— the 
Church of Christ. 

The question naturally arises, Why should God test 
faith rather than works? The answer is that all kinds of 
works are dependent upon the ability of the worker, and 
that the whole race of Adam has become unable to do 
perfect works, on account of the fall of their first parents. 
None can be perfectly just, perfectly wise, perfectly 
loving; to be so in our present imperfect condition 
is impossible. 

Therefore, in His Wisdom and Love, God avoids 
making His test along those lines in which we are absolutely 
incompetent, and makes it along the line of faith 
—in His Wisdom, His Love and His promises. To doubt 
any of these would be to weaken the basis of our hope. 
We realize that we are in a fallen condition, that we are 
dying like the remainder of the race. We have heard 
through the Word of God that He has provided a Savior, 
but we see that things continue much as they were, despite 
all that God and Christ have done. Our faith, however, 
assures us that God, who knows the end from the beginning, 
is working all things according to the counsel of 
His own will and that in due time He will establish 
righteousness in the earth.— Eph. 1:11; Psa. 72:1-7. 

The language of one without faith would be, "I cannot 
see that God or Christ is accomplishing anything for 
the world. Man now learns to control himself better than 
did his ancestors and so he does not fight as did the savages 
of old, but uses more modern weapons. He builds 
hospitals and insane asylums; in this way he gets the sick 
and the insane off his hands and so has more time to 
devote to business." Present conditions have a strong influence 
upon the world. Very much depends upon how 
we look at a matter. 

TRUTH AND RIGHTEOUSNESS INTEGRAL PARTS OF 
CHARACTER 

From the standpoint of faith we see that Christ has 



come into the world and during the Gospel Age has been 
carrying on the work of selecting the Church, which is 
His Body, and that from these a light has shone out into 
the surrounding darkness, which has been more or less 
dispelled by it. The light of the Holy Spirit, shed abroad 
by the example of many Christian lives, exerts an influence 
today, and many have a veneer of politeness which 
may be mistaken for the fruits of the Spirit of God. But 
the outward conduct alone is not evidence of acceptable 
heart condition. God desires that truth and righteousness 
shall become integral parts of our characters and that 
the principle of Love shall dominate in everything. This 
development of character we do not find among all who 
profess the name of Christ. 

Our faith, looking out into the world, asks of the 
Lord, "When will the promised time come in which Thy 
will shall be done on earth as in heaven?" The Scriptures 
reply that the glorious time for the blessing of the 
world will not come until the Church shall have passed 
into glory; that Messiah will then reign for a thousand 
years in order to put down sin and opposition to Divine 
arrangements and to uplift those who desire to come into 
harmony with God; and that in order to accomplish this 
work He will establish a government based upon the principles 
of righteousness. By faith we accept this answer, 
and await God's due time for the blessing of all mankind. 

Meantime, we will not permit ourselves to drift into 
unbelief while we delude ourselves with the thought that 
we or others are accomplishing something through 
"social uplift." We are glad to see efforts put forth to 
help the unfortunate; but we perceive that there is a force 
at work in the world that prevents success along this line. 
Present methods will not eradicate selfishness from the 
human heart; and until this is accomplished, God's will 
cannot be done on earth as it is in Heaven. 

To bring about this desired result, the Kingdom of 
Heaven is soon to be established, according to the Word 
of God. If, while waiting for His due time to arrive, we 
participate in worldly ambitions and endeavors, our faith 
will become vague and perhaps die. Although the good 
that we may do will be in conflict with the darkness 
around us, nevertheless, it should always be shining forth 

R5115 : page 322 

in our words and in our conduct as the result of the 
glorious hopes that inspire our lives. 

Faith is a quality possessed by all whom God is calling 
to membership in the Body of Christ, and the appeal of 
the Scriptures is only to those who have some faith and 
who are determined to increase it. When we begin our 
course as Christians, we have comparatively little faith, 
and it must be developed; our Christian experience is for 
the purpose of faith development. As St. Peter suggests, 
our faith, which is on trial, is much more precious than 
gold, although the gold be tried by fire. The exercise of 



faith tends to its development, and so our Father gives us 
numerous trials to test its strength. 

THE FAITH OF THE ANGELS SEVERELY TESTED 

God purposely permits us to be subject to manifold 
temptations for the testing of our faith, which is necessary 
because of the outcome of the trial. We may suppose 
that prior to the existence of man the angels had no 
such trials of faith and patience as the Church has had, 
for the angels saw God and knew of His works. Nevertheless, 
God has been pleased to give them a test of faith, 
which has continued during all of man's experience. 

The primary cause of Satan's deflection, which resulted 
in his rebellion, was that he lost his faith in God. 
He formed the idea that he could manage the Universe 
better than could the Almighty, and thought to secure to 
himself a little corner where he could show how affairs 
should be carried on. He succeeded in getting control of 
our first parents, only to find that, instead of bringing a 
blessing, he had brought upon the human family the curse 
of death— the penalty of sin— and all the misery and 
crime now on the pages of history. 

Satan's career became a very important test to the 
angels. Believing that God had all power, they did not 
understand why He would permit Satan to pursue so evil 
a course. They would have restrained the Adversary 
altogether. So when they saw evil going on unrestrained 
for centuries, some of them also evidently lost their faith. 
Thus came about the conditions mentioned in the sixth 
chapter of Genesis, when some of the angels preferred to 
materialize and live in human conditions. This was in 
violation of the Divine arrangement, and was the result 
of their loss of faith in God's Wisdom and Power. They 
had seen what Satan had done, although he had not succeeded 
in doing anything great; and their sentiment was, 
"Apparently God does not control affairs so completely 
as we have thought."— Gen. 6:1-4; 2 Pet. 2:4,5; Jude 6,7. 

Thus we see that God tested the faith of the holy 
angels, especially when we understand that the evil conditions 

R5116 : page 322 

prevailing before the flood have continued to some 
extent. The holy angels had occasion to doubt, to fear 
respecting God's Wisdom, Love and Power. Thus they 
were all thoroughly tested— more so than humanity; 
for they saw all that there was to be seen. We admit 
that there are a great many things that we do not know 
and cannot see, but the angels have apparently a much 
wider scope of knowledge. Thus the test of their faith 
was much greater than is ours. 

God tested the faith of the angels because He wished 
to know which of them had that absolute confidence 
which would enable them to trust Him, whether it seemed 
that He had or had not the power to control affairs. The 



lesson of the exceeding sinfulness of sin was both wise 
and necessary. Had the fall of man resulted in the everlasting 
torture of even a small proportion of the human 
family, we could not think that God was either wise or 
just in permitting this test to come upon His creatures. 

For more than four thousand years God permitted 
mankind to go down into death. Then came a manifestation 
of His Love when He provided for their redemption; 
and a still further manifestation of His Power will be 
given in the next Age, when they will be raised from the 
dead. Furthermore, in the Bride class He is making a 
special illustration, both to angels and to men, of His 
Love for those who manifest heart-loyalty to Him, and 
of His willingness to lift those faithful few far above the 
angels and even to make them "partakers of the Divine 
nature." We see, then, that in God's dealings with the 
angels He had respect to their faith. 

FAITH PROPORTIONATE TO KNOWLEDGE OF GOD'S 
CHARACTER 

The Scriptures say that "without faith it is impossible 
to please God." (Heb. 1 1:6.) If one lose his faith, 
there is no telling whither he may wander. The Apostle 
Peter's argument is that this special class who are being 
selected for exaltation to the Divine nature, must expect 
to have their faith tested, and that this testing is most 
important from the Divine point of view. If they have 
faith, it will control all of their affairs.— Compare 
Heb. 11:1,6. 

Our faith will be in proportion to our knowledge of 
the character of God. We shall find, upon observation, 
that in proportion to our faith we can endure hardness 
as good soldiers of Jesus Christ. Since our test is for so 
brief a time— a few years— it must of necessity be a very 
severe, a crucial one. God is subjecting our faith to a 
great heat in order to separate the dross. If we had not 
the faith, we might fear to take the steps which would 
bring us into this crucial position. Fear would lead us to 
decline to take the course that God indicates to be His 
will. Without faith we would shrink from the fiery 
trials, the heated furnace. If we have not the faith to 
stand the trials, then we are not of the kind for whom 
God is at the present time looking. 

If we appreciate this matter, we shall see that "without 
faith it is impossible to please God"; and that confidence 
in Him will lead us to weigh His words of precious 
promise. These promises will make clear to us the reason 
why these testings are upon us, and will enable us to 
appreciate our testings as marks of His love for us. The 
Lord would have us be "a peculiar people," tried and 
tested, "zealous of good works," a people for a purpose; 
and so He develops us through suffering. 

When the world is on trial during the Millennial Age, 
knowledge will have come in, and there will be less opportunity 
for the exercise of faith. Mankind will be in 



much the same condition as that in which the angels now 
are. For a thousand years, the world will be assisted 
upward, and at the same time they will have opportunities 
of cultivating faith— heart-reliance— in God. What 
we now see by faith, they will actually know— that the 
permission of sin has been working out a great Divine 
test for both men and angels. Thus gradually, throughout 
the thousand years, their faith will be established in 
practically the same way that the faith of the angels is 
now being established. They will see and will walk by 
sight, while we believe the promises and so walk by faith. 

There is a difference between intellectual belief and 
heart-reliance. The person who knows God best will 
trust Him most. Our Lord Jesus in His glorified position 
trusts the Father most perfectly at all times. But with 
us, whose trust is imperfect, it is different. Not until 
the First Resurrection shall we have perfect trust. The 
greater the knowledge of God's character, the greater 
will be the heart-reliance upon Him. 

During the Millennium, as intellectual belief gives 

R5116 : page 323 

place to knowledge, the heart-reliance of those who are 

loyal to the principles of righteousness will increase proportionately. 

It will always be in order to trust in God. 

The Great Creator is the Great Upholder of the Universe; 

and all of His creatures will ever be recipients of 

His bounty. If we understand the Scriptures, the only 

ones who will have deathlessness will be the Lord Jesus 

and the Church, which is His Body. (I Cor. 15:53.) All 

others will have dependent lives, and so will be objects of 

Divine care. In order to have everlasting life, they will 

need to have a heart-reliance upon their Creator. The 

more they learn of the unchangeableness of the Divine 

promises and character, the greater will be their trust. 

The faith of the Church will be of a higher character 
than is that of the angels or than will be that of the 
world restored. The faith of the Church will have been 
wrought out amidst the darkness and obscurity of this 
Age, which are being permitted for the very purpose of 
developing that faith; for the Church is called to occupy 
a place much higher than that of angels or men- 
called to be partakers of the Divine nature.— 2 Pet. 1:3,4. 

When, during the Millennial Age, the world shall have 
learned their lessons along the lines of knowledge, God 
does not purpose to receive them everlastingly without a 
thorough test of their heart-reliance. In Rev. 20:3,7-10, 
we read that at the close of the thousand years, Satan 
shall be loosed for a little season. Mankind will then 
know what is right and what is wrong, for the principles 
of righteousness will have been implanted in their hearts. 
The experience with Satan will be a test of heart-reliance, 
of loyalty, in that God will apparently not be in 
control. 

Then all those not in the fullest sympathy with God 



and His Divine Plan will be misled by this test of faith. 
Thus they will demonstrate their true character. Those 
who prove disobedient will be destroyed in the Second 
Death. God tells us that in the consummation every knee 
shall bow and every tongue confess to the glory of His 
Name, and that every creature in Heaven and in earth 
shall give honor and praise to the Son.— Rev. 5:13. 



R5116 : page 323 

PERSECUTION AND FIERY TRIALS THE CHRISTIAN'S EXPERIENCE 

"All that will live godly in Christ Jesus 
shall suffer persecution."— 2 Tim. 3:12. 

GODLINESS IMPLIES a character which is 

actuated by principles of righteousness. In 

all our dealings we are either just or unjust, 

kind or unkind, not according to what 

some people may think of us, but according 

to the standard of righteousness found 

in the Scriptures. Therefore, in order to 

develop that character which is pleasing to 

God, we should in every detail of life consider 

carefully what is right and what is 

wrong, according to that standard. This course is Scripturally 

termed meditating in God's Law. When we reach 

that development of character in which thought, word and 

deed are measured by the principles of righteousness, we 

shall have attained godlikeness.— Psa. 1 19:97. 

What the Lord desires to see in His people is not 
merely an outward manifestation of devotion to Him and 
to His brethren, but a development of love in our hearts 
and our dispositions. If we profess to love one another 
and yet pursue a course of self-seeking, wherein do we 
manifest love? So St. John admonishes to love not in 
word only, but in deed and in truth.— I John 3:18. 

Primarily, the godly are those who are in Christ 
Jesus, members of His Mystical Body, having presented 
their human bodies living sacrifices, holy and acceptable 
to God through the merit of the great Advocate. Secondly, 
the term godly includes those who live righteously, 
in sympathy with Christ Jesus, even though they may not 
live up to the full standard which the Lord has set, because 
they shrink from the suffering that results from godly 
living. Thirdly, the term godly includes some in the 
remote past, who, believing in the promise of the Lord 
that the "Seed" should some day come, separated themselves 
from the rest of the world and, having obtained 
new aims, new ideas, were out of touch with the remainder 
of the race because of having a different standard.— 
Heb. 11:13-16. 

The Ancient Worthies composed this third class, who 
had a share in the suffering of the godly and a participation 



also in the blessing. Moses, for example, preferred 
to suffer affliction with the people of God, rather than to 
participate in the honors of the Egyptian Government. 
Although adopted into the family of Pharaoh, he had 

R5117 : page 323 

respect to the promise that the Messiah would come. 
Hence he suffered on account of his faith in the promise. 
So all the patriarchs desired to be in harmony with God, 
in accordance with His promise made to Abraham, and 
because of belief in that promise they suffered more or 
less persecution.— Heb. ll:24-26;36-38. 

Some one may ask, "Why should the godly suffer?" 
The Bible answers that sin has brought the world into 
opposition to God. Whoever, then, would have all men 
speak in commendation of him would not be in harmony 
with the Divine arrangement, for the masses of the world 
are pursuing a course that the Lord does not approve. 
We are not saying that everything which the world does 
is sinful, but that the standards of God are so high that 
because of their fallen condition the masses of the world 
are not subject to the Law of God, neither, indeed, can 
they be, for they are carnal, sold under sin. (Rom. 8:7; 7:14,15.) 
Those who wish to have influence with the 
world must cater to popular prejudices. On the contrary, 
those who would be God's people must be loyal to the 
principles of righteousness and consequently must go in 
the opposite direction to that of the world. Hence they 
are opposed by the world. 

From the standpoint of God the course of the world 
is sinful. There is a tendency in our flesh to go with 
the world, who are laboring under false views of various 
kinds, because that course is in sympathy with the desires 
of our own fallen flesh. Hence to live godly is to live in 
opposition to the course of the world and of our own 
flesh. This would include not only living uprightly and 
avoiding sin, etc., but also the making of sacrifices as 
well, where principles are not involved. We are to beware, 
however, lest we be deceived along this line. Not 
only are we contending with the world, but we are 
wrestling with wicked spirits in high positions.— 
Eph. 6:12. 

ILLUSTRATION OF SATAN'S DEVICES 

Sometimes Satan's arts seem to be employed to get 
those who are trying to live godly into contention with 
each other. One of his devices is to make unimportant 
things seem important, and in this way to make people 
think that they are contending for righteousness' sake, 
and that the sufferings that they bring on themselves in 
this manner are for righteousness' sake. Another device 
is to deceive people into "busy-bodying in other men's 

R5117 : page 324 



matters." (I Peter 4:15.) It behooves us, therefore, as 
the Lord's people, not to try to straighten out all the 
affairs of the Church or of the world, and not to get into 
conflict with the brethren. They, like ourselves, are laboring 
to counteract the influences of the world, the flesh and 
the Devil. 

Our influence upon each other should be uplifting; 
we should not cause others to grieve, except where suffering 
is absolutely necessary. Hence the Lord's people 
should cultivate the fruits of the Spirit increasingly— 
meekness, gentleness, patience, brotherly kindness, love. 
The cultivation of these fruits of the Spirit is a law in 
respect to the Lord's people. All who would live godly 
in Christ Jesus are to see to it that they are not the 
cause of suffering to others— especially to those of the 
household of faith. 

SUFFERING AS A CHRISTIAN 

While it is true that all who will live godly in this 
world will suffer to the extent to which they are out of 
harmony with the present evil conditions, yet the promised 
blessings of the Scriptures are to those who live 
godly in Christ Jesus, those who are Christians. Of these 
St. Peter says, "If any man suffer as a Christian, let him 
not be ashamed."— I Peter 4:16. 

A Christian is a follower of Christ, one who has cast 
in his lot to suffer with Christ, that He may be also 
glorified with the Lord. (2 Tim. 2:12.) From the 
Apostle's standpoint, therefore, no one could suffer as a 
Christian unless he had become a Christian. 

Every painful experience which our Lord had was suffering 
for righteousness' sake— not only the great sufferings, 
not only the great fight against sin, but also all 
the little, unpleasant experiences common to the world. 
Being "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners" 
(Heb. 7:26), there was no reason why He should suffer. 
We do not understand that the Heavenly Father has provided 
sufferings, trials and difficulties for the angels who 
are in harmony with Him. Nor do we think that Jesus, 
being a Son in full accord with the Father, would have 
suffered were it not for His Covenant of self-sacrifice. 
All of His sufferings were because He had come into the 
world to be man's Redeemer. They were all parts of His 
necessary experience. 

The sufferings which our Lord endured were the result 
of His activity in the service of the Father. These were 
His weariness, His weakness after giving out His vitality 
to heal others, His bloody sweat, His ignominious buffetings, 
and all the reproaches, the sneers and the bitter 
words incurred on account of His faithfulness, to all of 
which He meekly and quietly submitted until His sufferings 
on Calvary terminated His human existence. 

SUFFERINGS RESULTING FROM HEREDITY, NOT SUFFERINGS 



OF CHRIST 

There is no question that suffering in general is not 
suffering with Christ, but with Adam. Our physical infirmities 
which are of heredity, are not sufferings of 
Christ. Rather we should speak of the sufferings of 
Christ as being voluntary and not involuntary. When the 
Apostle says that if we suffer with the Lord we shall also 
reign with Him (2 Tim. 2:12), he means the suffering 
which we bring on ourselves through faithfulness to our 
Covenant. St. Paul speaks of filling up that which is 
behind of the afflictions of Christ for His Body's sake, 
which is the Church. (Col. 1:24.) These experiences 
are not for Adam's sake. 

In St. Paul's own case he had, we believe, weak eyes 
as a result of his wrong course in persecuting the Church; 
and that wrong course was, no doubt, largely the result of 
heredity. When the Apostle speaks of the sufferings he 
endured on account of his eyes, he does not speak of them 
as the sufferings of Christ, but says that his affliction was 
a messenger of Satan to buffet him. (2 Cor. 12:7.) We 
might then say that all physical sufferings resulting from 
heredity are ministers of Satan opposing us, causing us 
much difficulty. However, we believe that the Lord is 
pleased with us if we resist these ministers of Satan. 

If we should think of all our physical pains and aches 
as sufferings for Christ, then we should be obliged to think 
of our mental defects also as sufferings for Christ. For 
instance, a man who had a disabled hand might have a 
comparatively even temper; another might have a perverse 
temper, leading him into trouble, leading him to 
busybody in other men's matters, etc. Thus his disposition 
causes him to suffer as a busybody and not for 
Christ. St. Paul tells us that our defects in character are 
works of the fallen flesh. (Gal. 5:19-21.) If the sufferings 
that come to us because of imperfect mental conditions 
are sufferings of heredity, the physical sufferings 
which result from imperfect physical conditions, cannot be 
counted as sufferings for Christ. 

In the case of a Christian, inherited weaknesses and 
those brought upon himself by the violation of the laws of 
God previous to his entrance into the family of God as a 
son, while not sufferings with Christ, will be made advantageous 
to him. These weaknesses our Father sees fit 
to leave with us, but assures us that His grace will be 
sufficient for us. (2 Cor. 12:9.) While the realization of 
such care for our interests is humiliating in that it forces 
conviction of our weakness, yet it is refreshing and inspiring 
in that it proves our Father's love for us. "The 
Father Himself loveth you."— John 16:27. 

SUFFERING TURNED TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW 
CREATURE 

But when one has undertaken to follow in the footsteps 
of Christ and has been begotten as a New Creature, 



whatever affliction that New Creature undergoes because 
of following the Lord, is suffering as a Christian; and 
whatever our experiences in suffering may be, these 
are not necessarily the portion of the sons of God, for the 
angels do not suffer; but He permits the Church to have 
them in order to develop and crystallize character. If 
we rejoice that we are found worthy to share in the sufferings 
of the present time, every trial will be turned to 
advantage as a part of our Christian experience. "They 
are not of the world." (John 17:16.) Therefore all of 
our experiences must be regarded as Christian, for correction 
in righteousness and for educational purposes. 

But this is taking a broader, deeper view than ordinary. 
Certainly a Christian is not to be ashamed of what 
he may suffer because of his loyalty to the Lord, to the 
Truth and to the brethren. In these sufferings he is to 
glorify God and to be thankful for them. He is to be 
glad for the opportunity of enduring something, to show 
not only the Lord, but himself also that he has endured 
something for Christ's sake. Every sacrifice that we 
make is for the purpose of suffering as a Christian, and 
we are not to be ashamed so to suffer.— I Peter 4:16. 

SUFFERING FOR CONSCIENCE NOT ALWAYS SUFFERING 
FOR CHRIST 

There are others who suffer more or less as Christians 
suffer, but they are suffering from a worldly standpoint. 
People sometimes say, "This worldly man has his trials 
and sufferings, and shows such patience, such resignation, 
that surely he is suffering as a Christian." But we do not 

R5118 : page 325 

understand that anyone can suffer as a Christian unless 
he takes the steps necessary to make him a Christian. 
We are to view matters from God's standpoint. Doubtless 
many have suffered as Christians from a human viewpoint 
who were not Christians. In the Dark Ages many were 
put to death for the sake of principle. In our own day 
there are people who give no evidence of being Christians, 
but who would rather die than have the Bible taken out 
of the public schools. Although they do not understand 
the Bible, yet if these were times of persecution, many 
would die at the stake in order to keep the Bible in the 
public schools. 

We cannot always tell whether suffering is for Christ's 
sake. But where people have suffered for conscience' 
sake, they have thus cultivated character, and will get a 
blessing in the next Age for that suffering. At present 
there is only the one door into membership in the Body 
of Christ— obedience even unto death. Suffering with 
Christ, as we have seen, is not the ordinary suffering 
common to all in the fallen state, but only such experiences 
as are the result, more directly, of following Christ's 
example in advocating unpopular truths and in exposing 



popular errors. Such were the causes of the sufferings 

of Christ; and such will be the causes of suffering, persecution 

and loss to all who follow in His footsteps. Such 

will have fellowship in His sufferings now, and in the 

end will be counted worthy to share in the reward given 

for faithfulness to principle. 

Throughout the Gospel Age this course has meant 
self-sacrificing labor and endurance of reproach in the 
sowing and watering of Christ's doctrines. Now, in the 
end of the Age, it means a similar fidelity and endurance 
in the Harvest work now in progress— faithfulness even 
to the laying down of life itself, whether it be required 
by the gradual process of working it out in the Master's 
service, a dying daily, or by being brought more abruptly 
to a martyr's death. 

SHRINKING BACK FROM SUFFERING 

Our Lord forewarns us that in the end of the Gospel 
Age, many who have a love for Christ will allow their 
love to grow cold because of the iniquity and sin in the 
world. (Matt. 24: 12.) It will be a test for such to 
decide whether they will follow the Lord in self-sacrifice 
as His disciples or whether they will partake of the 
worldly spirit. We see this test in operation now. A 
great many people who name the name of Christ, who 
really love the Lord, who appreciate much of His character, 
who would like to see the right prosper, nevertheless 
have no thought of making a spectacle of themselves 
before men. They would like to do right, to walk honorably, 
and to have the favor of men as good citizens. 
But as to being warm and faithful followers of the Lord 
—through "evil report and good report" (2 Cor. 6:8)— 
their faith and zeal are not sufficient to endure the test. 

The Lord Jesus gives us the invitation to become 
joint-heirs with Him. He has very clearly informed us 
that to follow in His steps will mean trials and difficulties 
in the flesh. He says, "In the world ye shall have 
tribulation." (John 16:33.) St. Paul repeats the sentiment, 
saying, "We must through much tribulation enter 
into the Kingdom of God"; and again in our text he 
emphasizes the thought, saying, "Yea, and all that will 
live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." (Acts 14:22; 
2 Tim. 3:12.) There is no other way to enter 
the Kingdom than by self-sacrifice, deadening of the 
flesh, mortifying it. In proportion as the New Creature 
grows, the old creature perishes, until the sacrifice shall 
have been completed in death. 

The Lord's people should thoroughly understand the 
terms and conditions upon which they have been called. 
They should therefore not think it strange when trials 
come upon them, no matter how fiery, no matter how 
severe. The Apostle Peter lovingly counsels the Church: 
"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial 
which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened 
unto you; but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers 



of Christ's sufferings; that when His glory shall 
be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. 
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are 
ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you; 
on their part He is evil spoken of, but on your part He is 
glorified." (I Peter 4:12-14.) The Lord is to be not 
only the Instructor, but also the Refiner to purge out the 
dross, that we may be made ready to share with Christ 
in the Kingdom of "glory, honor and immortality."— 
Rom. 2:7. 

TRIALS FROM FALSE BRETHREN 

The Scriptures plainly teach that special trials may be 
expected in the Church, amongst the brethren. And we 
find it to be true that our severest trials come not from 
without, but, as the Apostle in substance says, "From 
among yourselves shall arise false brethren," to injure the 
flock in general through personal ambition. (Acts 20:30.) 
This becomes a test not only to the Church, but to all 
those who are in contact with us, for if one member 
suffer, all the members suffer with it— I Cor. 12:26. 

We are not, therefore, to think it strange if there 
are trials and difficulties, and if more or less dispute arise 
in the Church. We are to cultivate gentleness, meekness, 
patience, loving-kindness toward all. Nevertheless, if a 
dispute arise amongst the Lord's people, we are to recognize 
that such things are unavoidable amongst those who 
have the Truth. Our heads are imperfect, and consequently 
it requires some time to come into line with the 
teachings of the Lord's Word. Even disputation makes 
life an activity, and is better than a dead condition— not 
to care what is spoken or not spoken. Nevertheless, 
those who have zeal should be careful that they manifest 
the Spirit of the Lord, as above indicated— gentleness, 
patience, meekness, brotherly kindness, love, humility. 

Think it not strange that there are fiery trials amongst 
yourselves, arising from one cause or another, that will 
make it particularly severe for you. Those among 
whom you are thrown in contact will cause you suffering, 
because of your zeal and their misunderstanding, their 
imperfection, etc. Similarly, you may be a cause of trial 
to others. All of these fiery trials will work out good 
for you. It is far better to be amongst those who are 
fervent in spirit than to take a place amongst those who 
are lukewarm and thus lose the privilege of being one 
of those who are footstep followers of Christ. Perhaps 
those who are lukewarm will, in the Time of Trouble, 
learn a lesson. But the Little Flock are to learn their 
lesson in the present time— allowing the experiences of 
life to work out for them a far more exceeding and 
eternal weight of glory.— 2 Cor. 4:17. 

Our knowledge of God is limited; yet it is only what 
we should expect of the Heavenly Father, that any 
whom He accepts as His children will have Divine love 
and care in the supervision of their affairs, which will 



make all things work for good to them. Since the Lord 
is our Shepherd, no one is able to pluck us out of His 
hands. (John 10:28,29.) We are as dear to Him as the 
apple of His eye. He that began a good work in us is 
able to complete it is in the day of Jesus Christ. (Phil. 1:6.) 
So the more faith we have the more we appreciate 

R5118 : page 326 

the text, "We know that all things work together for good 

to them that love God, to them that are the called according 

to His purpose." (Rom. 8:28.) This includes even 

the things that seem to be very contrary, very evil, very 

disadvantageous. 

Our Lord said, "And this is life eternal, that they 
might know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ 
whom Thou has sent." (John 17:3.) To know the 
Father means to be in fellowship with Him, to have an 
intimate acquaintance with Him. Experience corroborates 
this fact. The more obedient we are as children 
the more intimate is our acquaintance with Him. And 
if we are unfaithful, even for a little space, we shall fail 
to make development along spiritual lines. But in proportion 
as we are seeking to walk in His ways, we become 
intimate with Him in the particular sense in which a child 
knows his father. This knowledge gives us the trust that 
He cares for us as His children, and makes all things 
work together for good to us.— Rom. 8:28; I John 1:6,7. 

CO-OPERATION WITH GOD TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY 

We note, however, that St. Paul says that all things 
work together for good, not for best. God has something 
to do in the way of His choice of His reward and 
of our possibilities. The angels of God, however obedient 
to Him, could not become archangels nor cherubim. 
Their obedience brings their highest welfare on their own 
plane. So with us. We cannot get the best for the reason 
that He has already given it to Jesus Christ, whom 
He has set next to Himself at His right hand in power 
and glory and honor.— I Peter 3:22. 

Again, this promise is not a guarantee that all things 
in life will work together for the very best to us as though 
we had neither will nor choice in the matter. We should 
not say, "I positively resign myself; the Lord has said 
that all things will work together for the best, and if I 
miss opportunities in the service I shall say, 'Oh, well, it 
is all for the best.'" Thus to think would be a mistake, 
for it is evidently not at all the thought. 

After we have become New Creatures in Christ and 
children of God, He leaves us with a certain amount of 
choice. It is very largely in our own control what we 
shall do, whether we shall make progress or stand still 
or go backward. We cannot say that if one had lost 
the High Calling his experiences would be the very best 
possible; and that if he went into the Second Death, his 



fate was the best. But we can say that this Scripture 
means that God stands ready to give us the best that He 
may have under the terms and conditions of the Covenant 
which He has made with us. 

Ours is a Covenant of sacrifice. There are certain 
laws and principles which are not to be broken. Along 
these lines the Lord Jesus tells us that the Father will 
appoint those next to the Lord who have demonstrated 
most of the Spirit of the Redeemer. He will not put 
anyone in such a position or into the Kingdom arbitrarily. 
His Character, His Words, stand pledged that He will 

R5119 : page 326 

make the best of us that He is able to do, while at the 
same time recognizing our wills as paramount. 

Jehovah does not seek those as His children who need 
to be forced. Our Lord said that the Father seeketh such 
to worship Him as worship Him in spirit and in truth. 
(John 4:23.) We are to work to the best of our ability. 
But with all of our stumbling the Lord stands pledged 
that He will not leave us if we are faithful, and that He 
will make even our stumbling work out for good to us. 
Those who lose the crown may come up through great 
tribulation with the Great Company class. This is the 
best thing possible for them under the Divine arrangement. 
For those who go into the Second Death, their 
fate will not be the best for them; but it will be best for 
the entire universe that those should be blotted out of 
existence who are out of harmony with righteousness.

SPARED IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE 

"They shall be Mine, saith the Lord of Hosts, in that day when 
I make up My jewels; and I will spare them as a man spareth 
his only son that serveth him."— Mai. 3:17. 

LIKE MANY OTHER prophecies, the words 

of the Prophet Malachi seem to have a general 

application throughout the Gospel Age 

and a particular one at the close of the Age. 

Eighteen hundred years ago the Lord Jehovah 

began to make up His jewels. The 

first of these jewels was our Lord Jesus 

Christ, who was polished, perfected and 

taken up on high. Jehovah did not cease 

His work with the perfection of His Son, 

our Lord. He has arranged that other jewels be cut and 

polished after the similitude of His Son, that they may 

shine with Him in the heavenly glory and Kingdom; as 

it is written, "We are His workmanship, created in Christ 

Jesus unto good works."— Eph. 2:10. 



These gems must all be found by God, who is making 
up these jewels. But having been found of Him, they 
are placed in the hands of the great Lapidarist, our Lord 
Jesus, that He may cut, polish and fit them for the glorious 
work of shining with Him in the Kingdom. Our 
Heavenly Father has appointed our Lord to be the great 
Master Workman in the preparation of the jewels. 

In our text, the Lord Jehovah says that in that day of 
preparation of the jewels He will spare this class as a man 
spares his only son that serves him. He has not spared 
this class in the sense of relieving them from all suffering, 
for if they were thus spared they could not share the 
glory to follow this trial time. He did not spare Jesus, 
the Head over the Church, which is His Body. But He 
will not permit them to be tempted above what they are 
able to bear. (I Cor. 10:13.) He has an interest in them 
and a sympathy for them, and delivers them from those 
things which would prove too weighty for them. 

THE MOUNTING OF THE JEWELS GOING ON 

In a certain sense, then, God has been making up His 
jewels for more than eighteen hundred years— in the 
sense of preparing them. But there is still a final gathering, 
or assembling, of this class, which has not yet been 
completed. The gathering of these jewels must include 
the resurrection, not merely of those who have been 
sleeping as members of the Body of Christ, but also of 
those who are alive and remain to the end of the Age. 
These all experience a change from animal to spirit conditions 
—"changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an 
eye." (I Cor. 15:51,52.) In the assembling of this class 
—the mounting of the jewels, as it were— the Lord will 
show His own workmanship, what He has selected out 
of the filth and mire of the sinful race of mankind, and 
what He has made of them. 

This gathering of the jewels is that to which the 
Prophet Malachi refers in the following quotation: "Behold, 
I will send My Messenger, and he shall prepare the 
way before Me; and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly 
come to His temple, even the Messenger of the 
Covenant, whom ye delight in; behold, He shall come, 

R5119 : page 327 

saith the Lord of Hosts. But who may abide the day of 
His coming? and who shall stand when He appeareth? 
for He is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap; and 
He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and He shall 
purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, 
that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.' 
-Mai. 3:1-3. 

The Messenger of the Covenant is, primarily, our 
Lord Jesus, who came more than eighteen hundred years 
ago and presented Himself to those who were heirs of the 
New Covenant— the Jews. The Apostle points out that 



this new arrangement meant, not only a new Mediator 
for them, but also better sacrifices and a new priesthood, 
who would be able to effect a satisfaction for the sins of 
the people, so that it would not be necessary to render 
the typical sacrifices thereafter year by year.— 
Heb. 9:11-15. 

This Messenger of the Covenant came unto His own, 
but His own received Him not, "But as many as received 
Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of 
God"— to become associated with Himself, to become identified 
with Himself, as members of His Body. They are 
begotten to a new nature, not of the will of the flesh, but 
only of God.— John 1:11-13. 

THE LORD'S WORDS A REFINING FIRE 

In this sense of the word, our Lord sat as a refiner of 
gold and silver— discriminating, purifying. The words 
which He spoke were not only words of grace, of eternal 
life, but also words of purification, likened elsewhere to a 
sharp, two-edged sword. (Heb. 4:12.) The Prophet 
Malachi compares them to fullers' soap, which would take 
out all stains and leave the garment pure and white; and 
he also says that our Lord will sit as a refiner of gold 
and silver, that the Levite class may offer to the Lord 
an acceptable sacrifice. 

This prophecy refers, as we see, to the antitypical 
priesthood and includes both the Royal Priests and the 
Great Company. The work of this great Refiner is to 
purify the members of the Church class— not only the 
Little Flock, but the Great Company as well. 

This refining process takes place all through the Gospel 
Age. As the individual members of the Body of 
Christ grow in grace, they are put through not only the 
preliminary processes of the refining, but also the more 
trying ones. Gold represents the Divine or higher order 
of spirit nature, and silver, the lower order. The gold 
represents the Little Flock, and the Silver the Great 
Company. 

None of these would be able to make an acceptable 
sacrifice of himself; but the great Advocate imputes His 
merit to each who offers himself in sacrifice and thus 
enables him to become such. The Father permits the 
Advocate to make of these acceptable sacrifices. They 
are His sacrifices, not their own. Then they are begotten 
to the new nature and adopted into the Body of Christ. 
By this offering, our Lord, as the great Mediator, is getting 
ready for the institution of the New Covenant. 

THE PRESENT A WONDERFUL TIME 

The closing scenes of the Gospel Age will be the most 
remarkable of the world's history. The Church will then 
be completed. We are not at liberty to guess when the 
end of the trouble will be. Whether all of the trouble will 
come in the next two or three years we do not know. 



But we think that the most serious part of the trouble 
will occupy a very short time. 

Let us remember that we are living in most wonderful 
times. More can be accomplished in one month now than 
could have been done in years some time ago— more in 
one hour than in days formerly. We are still in the waiting 
attitude, so that the Lord can indicate His will in the 
matter to us. We believe that the year 1915 will be even 
more wonderful than the present. We fully believe that 
the year 1914 will see the end of the Gentile Times, for 
we cannot find even one flaw in our Bible chronology. 
But we do not claim infallibility. To err is human. If, 
therefore, the Father permits us to blunder in respect to 
His Word in this matter, nevertheless, He will undoubtedly 
have a great blessing for us. And if it should be that the 
year 1914 should not mark the close of the Gentile Times, 
we would still believe that the time could not be very far 
distant; for the nearer we come to that time, the nearer 
we see the fulfilment of the things which the Scriptures 
indicate will then occur. 

In a short time the Lord will spare His people— not 
from the trouble altogether, but from any unnecessary 
experience. We cannot expect that He will spare them 
as jewels any more than He did His Only Begotten Son. 
He allowed that Son to be put to death— even the death of 
the cross. Yet He protected our Lord and did not permit 
any of the things which He suffered to work to His detriment. 
And so the Lord will spare us as New Creatures. 
He is preparing for us the glorious things which He has 
in reservation for the faithful.

THE GREAT QUESTION 

-NOVEMBER 17. -MARK 8:27-9:1.- 

"Thou art The Christ, the Son of 
the Living God. "-Matt. 16:16. 

FOR A CONSIDERABLE period of His ministry 

our Lord did not declare Himself, 

even to His disciples, to be the Messiah. 

Undoubtedly He chose the wiser course. 

As the Great Teacher He instructed the 

people, until they said, "Never man spake 

like this man"; He healed the people, until 

they said, "Could Messiah do more than 

this?" It was better, undoubtedly, that the 

thought should gradually come upon the 

minds of His followers than that He should have started 

in with making that claim— better that the people should 

claim it for Him than that He claim the honor for 

Himself. 



He did, however, wish His disciples to know, and He 
approached the question by asking, "Who do men say 
that I am?" He got a reply, that some thought Him John 
the Baptist risen from the dead; that others considered 
Him to be Elijah risen from the dead, and others thought 
of Him as being perhaps one of the other Prophets. 

Then came the point of the question: "But who say ye 
that I am?" St. Peter answered and said, "Thou art 
The Christ, the Son of the Living God." Jesus admitted 
the correctness of this, saying, "Blessed art thou, Simon, 
son of Jonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed this 
unto thee, but My Father which is in Heaven." 

Forthwith Jesus began to explain to the beloved 
Twelve the experiences that lay before Him— how the 
Kingdom would be formally proffered to the Jews, and 
how through their representatives, the Elders, the chief 
priests, they would reject Him; how He would be killed, 
and after three days rise again. 

R5120 : page 328 

He made the statement about His death very emphatic, 
and the disciples clearly understood it. Judas, angrily 
disappointed, considered it a disgrace upon our Lord for 
Him to take such a view of the future, and a disgrace 
also upon the Apostles, because if Jesus had such expectations 
it would modify and regulate His course, and soon 
disaster would come to Him, and the dashing of all their 
hopes which He had inculcated— hopes of sitting with 
Him in His Throne, etc. 

Doubtless all of the Apostles were disappointed, but 
only St. Peter had the courage to express himself, saying, 
"Be it far from Thee, Lord; this shall not happen." You 
will, we all know, as the Messiah, attain the Throne of 
Israel and thus eventually the Throne of the world, and 
bring blessing to the whole human race; and as you have 
promised, we shall be with You in Your Throne. 

"GET THEE BEHIND ME, SATAN!" 

In this course St. Peter was opposing the Divine will 
and plan, of which the death of Jesus was the very center 
or hub, from which would radiate all the fulfilments of 
all the various promises— to the Church first, to Israel 
next, and finally to all nations, peoples, kindreds and 
tongues. Jesus perceived that these influences were striving 
to hinder His consummation of His sacrifice, even as 
Satan tried to do in the beginning of His consecration. 

To make the matter very emphatic He said to St. 
Peter, "Get thee behind Me, adversary," thy words savor 
not of the things of God's plan, but of the things of 
human judgment and preference. Then He began to 
make clear to His followers what had not been "meat in 
due season" to give them before, in such plain terms, 
namely, that whoever desired to be counted in with Him 
in any part of His work must realize that it would cost 



him all that he possessed of an earthly kind; he must 
deny himself, take up his cross and follow in the footsteps 
of the Redeemer. 

Anyone solicitous of maintaining his rights and holding 
on to the present life, and unwilling to sacrifice all, 
will lose the great "prize" of the Divine nature, which 
will be given to those who do take up the cross and make 
a full sacrifice of earthly interests. And on the other 
hand, he who will faithfully lose his life for Jesus' sake 
will save it— will gain the reward of life on the spirit 
plane. 

Moreover, the same principle that now thus operates 
will always operate, namely, that whoever is simply selfish, 
loving his own life and his own interests, will not 
be accounted worthy of everlasting life; but those who 
will sacrifice, if need be, in the interests of the Lord's 
cause will be the ones accounted worthy in character for 
eternal life. 

"WHAT SHALL IT PROFIT A MAN?" 

God has provided a future life for every soul of man 
through the redemption accomplished by Jesus, but only the 
noble of heart, of character, of life, who will accept this 
great blessing through the Divinely appointed way will get 
it. If they selfishly seek for the whole world, the selfishness 
thus developed will make them unfit for the eternal life. 
For what would a man take in exchange for the loss of 
his life? Would he consider wealth or fame or name 
for a few years in the present time worthy of exchange 
at profit, if it were to cost him eternal glory and eternal 
life? Surely not. We are therefore to have in mind 
that character-building is absolutely essential to our attaining 
eternal life upon any plane, by the proposition 
that God has made us through His Son. 

Whoever becomes a follower of the Lord and hopes 
to gain the prize of everlasting life and glory on the spirit 
plane must do so whole-heartedly, and not in an underhanded 
or secret manner. He must come out fully and 
courageously and properly acknowledge Jesus and acknowledge 
His words. And Jesus puts Himself and His 
words on a parity— "whoever is ashamed of Me and of 
My words." Jesus' words are Jesus' doctrines or teachings. 
To be ashamed of the Truth, to be ashamed of the 
Divine Plan, to be ashamed of what we find to be the 
teachings of God's Word, because they are unpopular with 
men, is to offend the Lord and to prove ourselves unworthy 
of His favor. 

All who are of His Church will need Christ continually 
as their Advocate, down to the very last, when He 
shall present them blameless and unreproveable before the 
Father in love. (Col. 1:22.) And if they would maintain 
Him as their Advocate, they must also be advocating 
His cause amongst men, not ashamed of Him and not 
ashamed of His doctrine, His words. 

That the Lord addressed His words especially to the 



disciples is shown by His reference to others of that 
nation who had not made such a consecration as all of 
His disciples must make. The others were called "an 
adulterous and sinful generation." The followers of 
Christ must hold up the Light of Truth before the world, 
and so doing faithfully they will be acknowledged by the 
Lord Jesus in due time, when He comes in the glory of 
His Father with the holy angels. He will not be ashamed 
to acknowledge them; He will present them to the Father 
and to the holy angels. 

THE GREAT QUESTION 

The great question of eighteen centuries ago is the 
great question of today! Who is Jesus? If, as some 
claim, He was merely a good man, a most able Teacher, 
then He was not The Christ, for The Christ, although the 
embodiment of all these qualities, was more, much more. 
To be The Christ, He must have been "the Man Christ 
Jesus," who gave Himself a Ransom-price for all, to be 
testified in due time. (I Tim. 2:5,6.) And this signifies 
that He must have been, not of ordinary birth, but 
extraordinary, born from above, because if born in the 
ordinary course of nature He would be like others of 
Adam's sons, subject to the sentence of death, and hence 
unable to save either Himself or others. But if He was 
The Christ, the Sent of God, who left the glory of the 
Father and was made flesh that He might "taste death 
for every man," then we behold Him as the great Redeemer 
of the world, whose death was necessary as a 
Ransom, or corresponding price, to secure the release of 
mankind from the death sentence and to make possible the 
resurrection of Adam and his race. 

More than this, the word Christ signifies The 
Anointed. The Bible declares that the Anointed Lord 
shall be the Great King, Prophet and Priest, whose Kingdom 
shall be under the whole heavens— a Kingdom 
which shall last for a thousand years; and shall destroy 
sin and all who love sin; and which shall lift up all 
humanity willing to return into harmony with God. According 
to the Scriptures, this Jesus is— the Messiah. And 
His present work is the gathering of a Bride class, to be 
His joint-heir in His glorious Kingdom, which will be 
set up soon after the Elect Church shall have been completed 
by the glorious change of the First Resurrection. 

What think ye of Messiah? What think ye of His 
invitation to become His associates in His glory and Kingdom? 
What think ye of the cost of self-denial, self-sacrifice? 
What think ye of the great reward? Let 
those who have made the consecration review the terms; 
let those who have not made this consecration do as Jesus 

R5120 : page 329 

said: "Sit down and count the cost," before making a 
decision, so that if they become His disciples they will 



do so intelligently, and be loyal and faithful in their 
course. 

Only those who appreciate the "High Calling of God 
in Christ," "The Heavenly calling"— only such will have 
the necessary incentive to run with patience the race 
upon which they started when making a consecration; 
and only those who run the race faithfully will win the 
prize; and only by the assistance of the Great Advocate 
can any hope to come off conqueror and "more than 
conqueror," through His precious Blood.

THE KINGDOM IN TABLEAU 

-NOVEMBER 24.-MARK 9:2-13.- 

"A voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved 
Son; hear ye Him. And when the voice was past, Jesus was 
found alone."— Luke 9:35. 

OUR STUDIES continue to appertain to Messiah's 

Kingdom of glory. Today's lesson 

tells of a tableau illustration given to His 

disciples respecting it. The lesson deeply 

impressed the three Apostles who witnessed 

the vision, namely, Peter, James and John. 

St. Peter referred to it afterward in his 

Epistle (2 Pet. 1:16-19), saying, "We have 

not followed cunningly devised fables when 

we made known unto you the power and 

coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye witnesses 

of His Majesty. ..when we were with Him in the holy 

mount." 

Jesus prepared His disciples for the transfiguration 
vision, saying, "There be some of them that stand here 
which shall not taste of death until they see God's Royal 
Majesty having come with power." The occasion will be 
remembered. Jesus had foretold His death, quite contrary 
to the previous expectations of the Apostles, and now He 
sought to draw their minds gradually to a realization that 
His death would not mean a repudiation of the promise 
of the Kingdom and its glory but a fulfilment of their 
expectations on a higher plane. Jesus would formally 
offer Himself to Israel as King riding upon the ass five 
days before His crucifixion; He would be despised and 
rejected and crucified; but His kingly office and work 
would thereby only be confirmed. His authority to be 
King of the earth, His authority to release mankind from 
the power of sin and death, His authority to uplift 
humanity and to bring the earth in general to Paradise 
conditions, would all be founded upon His sacrificial 
death at Calvary. 

All this was presented to the three chosen disciples 



six days later. Jesus took them to the mountain-top and 
was transfigured before them. His flesh and His garments 
shone and glistened white, after the manner of 
angels, the vision thus representing the Lord after having 
experienced His resurrection change from earthly to 
heavenly conditions. Then with Him "talked two men," 
says St. Luke, "who appeared in glory"— radiant, but less 
so than Jesus. 

In some manner they recognized these two men of the 
vision as Moses and Elijah. They heard these discourse 
with Jesus respecting His decease, "which He was about 
to accomplish at Jerusalem," says St. Luke. How long 
the vision lasted we are not told, but St. Peter, thinking 
that he should make some comment on the situation, and 
not knowing what to say, suggested the building of three 
tabernacles, one for Jesus, one for Moses, one for Elijah. 
He evidently thought that the Master would be rejoiced 
at such blessed fellowship, and he was willing to do 
anything for His aid. 

"THIS IS MY BELOVED SON" 

Then came a voice from the overshadowing cloud, 
saying, "This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him!" And 
suddenly the vision vanished, and they saw only Jesus 
with them, and He no longer with radiant appearance. 
What could it all mean? It may be that several good lessons 
came out of this: (1) During the six days following 
the announcement of the Master's coming suffering, 
ignominy and death, we may assume that the Apostles 
were sad-hearted, bewildered. In this condition it 
would be a great refreshment, and be strengthening to 
their faith to witness this vision which testified of Jesus 
they knew not what, but which showed them that the 
death He had foretold was a certainty and known of God 
and of Divine approval. 

(2) The voice from the cloud would be a fresh encouragement 
to their faith. They had believed that Jesus 
was all that He claimed to be— the Son of the Highest. 
They had believed that He was not an ordinary member 
of the human family, born in sin, but that He had been 
particularly and specially born from above by Divine 
power. They had believed His own testimony that He 
proceeded forth and came from God and that He would 
return to the Father, but now their faith was corroborated; 
God Himself had testified in this miraculous manner 
that Jesus was His Son, His Well-Beloved, His Only 
One. 

"TELL NO MAN THE VISION" 

As the Apostles were coming down the mountainside 
with Jesus, wondering about the meaning of the 
vision they had seen, Jesus said to them, "See that ye tell 
no man the vision until after the Son of Man is risen 
from the dead." (Matt. 17:9.) So "they kept the saying 



with themselves, questioning one with another what the 
Lord meant by the rising again from the dead." Thus, 
little by little, the Great Teacher impressed upon His 
true disciples great truths which they could not otherwise 
have learned, seeing that they had not yet been begotten 
of the Holy Spirit; for the Holy Spirit was not yet 
given, the Pentecost blessing had not yet come, because 
Jesus had not yet suffered nor risen from the dead, nor 
ascended into the presence of God to make Sin-Atonement 
on their behalf. 

The fact that Moses and Elijah appeared as real to 
the Apostles as though they were in life does not contradict 
the words of Jesus that what they saw was a 
vision. We are to remember the many visions given 
later on to one of these Apostles, St. John, recorded in 
the Book of Revelation. In those visions St. John saw 
angels and men, horsemen, beasts, crowns, etc., and heard 
voices and singing and talking, etc., just as in this vision. 

THE MEANING OF THE VISION 

We have St. Peter's words (2 Pet. 1:16) in corroboration 
of the text here, that what they saw on the mountain 
represented the Royal Majesty of Messiah— the 
Kingdom of Messiah. Moses represented the faithful of 
Natural Israel, the "House of Servants"; "Moses as a 
servant, was faithful over all his House." Elijah represented 
The Christ in the flesh, the House of Sons, which 
has been in process of development throughout this Gospel 

R5121 : page 330 

Age. All of the consecrated, spirit-begotten people 
of God, during this Age, are represented by Elijah, who, 
God promised, should come before Messiah would set up 
His Kingdom. In other words, the Elijah class is composed 
of Jesus and all of His footstep followers throughout 
this Gospel Age— in their earthly or fleshly condition, 
spirit-begotten, but not yet spirit-born. 

This Elijah company as a whole must be developed 
and must do a work in the world before the real Kingdom 
of Messiah can be established. The glorification of Jesus, 
following His death and resurrection, was due, but as 
the glorified One He stood between the Moses class, 
called previously, and the Elijah class, which had just 
begun to be called to be His joint-heirs in the Kingdom. 
He was thus in their midst, and the crucifixion at 
Jerusalem was about to fulfil all the conditions necessary 
to the bringing about of the Messianic reign. 

But the glorification of Jesus was not the only 
thing necessary; the entire Church, the Body, must suffer 
with Him and be completed and then be joined with Him 
beyond the veil before the Kingdom glory can be fully 
established. This work of calling and preparing an 
Elijah class has been in progress for more than eighteen 
centuries and we believe is now nearly completed. As 



John the Baptist was the forerunner of Jesus in the flesh, 
so this greater Elijah, the Church in the flesh, is the 
Forerunner of the great Messiah on the spirit plane. We 
must suffer with Him if we would share in His resurrection 
and share in His glory. This was the lesson of 
the transfiguration vision. 

The disciples wondered and queried, saying, "Why do 
the Pharisees and Scribes tell us," according to the Scriptures, 
"that Elijah must first come." Jesus answered 
that, in a sense, to those who could receive it, John the 
Baptist had thus come, and had introduced Jesus as the 
Messiah, and that John the Baptist had in a sense fulfilled 
this prophecy when He introduced the Redeemer-King. 

St. Peter's words, already referred to, fully satisfy us 
that the transfiguration scene was a vision of the coming 
glory of Christ— "We were eye-witnesses of His Majesty, 
that the promised Kingdom will eventually come. 
The vision on the mount confirms this to us. However, 
the prophecies of old, which foretold Messiah's 
coming and reign, are still more authentic, "more sure," 
they cannot fail; the Kingdom merely awaits the sufferings 
of those who will be the members of the Body of 
Christ. Then, at the Second Coming of Jesus, these will 
be blessed and glorified, and the class represented by 
Moses will also be blessed and used as instruments of the 
Kingdom. Thus in the vision the entire Kingdom was represented: 
first of all, by Jesus Himself, second by Elijah, 
who represented the Church class, and third by Moses, 
who represented the faithful on the earthly plane, through 
whom the Heavenly blessings will pour out upon 
humanity.

O, Master, it is good to be 

Entranced, enrapt, alone with Thee, 
Till we, too, changed from grace to grace, 

Gaze on Thine own transfigured face.

INTERESTING LETTERS 
QUESTIONS RESPECTING CLASS DISCIPLINE 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

Some of us desire your further advice on two points: 

(1) What attitude should we take toward brethren who 
hold little meetings not authorized or appointed by the 
Class with which they are connected? 

(2) We note your recommendation concerning testimony 
meetings and their helpfulness in character-development. 
What should we do in a case where Elders oppose such 
meetings, but where the Class desire to have them? 



THE EDITOR'S REPLY 

We think it rather unwise for a brother claiming to be 
a member of the Class to entirely ignore that Class in the 
matter of holding meetings. For him to inaugurate meetings, 
advertise them, hold them during the regular hours 
of the meetings of the Class, etc., would seem to be in the 
nature of ignoring the Class; and to hold meetings at the 
same hour might be considered an opposition. However, 
even though all this were done, it would not constitute a 
cause of offense or of excommunication. The Class should 
rejoice to know that the Gospel of the Kingdom is being 
preached, even though it were preached in a strifeful and 
contentious manner, as St. Paul suggests. (Phil. 1:15-18.) 
A Class would have no more right to think or speak evil of such 
a brother and of his effort than to think or speak evil of 
any Christian minister of any denomination and of his effort. 

If, however, a brother were invited to give a little talk 
in a private or a semi-public manner to a few, not as a 
regular Class, nor as an opposition meeting, nor at a conflicting 
hour, there would seem to be no ground whatever for 
reproof. On the contrary, we should all commend his love 
and zeal and, thanking the Lord for the brother's privileges, 
seek as good for ourselves. 

We are to keep strictly in mind that the Lord has not 
given any of us a right to supervise His work nor to forbid 
another to preach the Gospel. The disciples of old did this 
on one occasion and Jesus rebuked them, saying, "Forbid him 
not; for there is no man that shall do a miracle in My name, 
that can lightly speak evil of Me." (Mark 9:38-40.) Again 
He said, "Where two or three are gathered together in My 
name, there am I in the midst of them." (Matt. 18:20.) He 
did not say that the two or three must be authorized, commissioned, 
or in any manner privileged of men. Hence, whatever 
there is of co-operation in the Church should be merely 
of love, of wisdom, of estimation of the Divine will and the 
oneness of the Church. 

We are surprised to learn that there are any in opposition 
to the weekly testimony meetings which we have so strongly 
urged. In our experience this class of meeting is one of 
the most spiritually helpful. In many places if it were necessary 
to have but one meeting, the Classes undoubtedly would 
hold on to the weekly testimony meeting as the best and 
most helpful of all. We commend Wednesday night as being 
a most suitable occasion for this kind of meeting. We have 
already recommended that the weekly topic be the Manna 
text of the preceding Thursday. Observing this rule, the 
Lord's people all over the world can study and think much 
along the same lines and, looking for experiences in the same 
direction, obtain corresponding blessings. 

We recommend a trial of this method to all of the Classes 
everywhere. They will have plenty to testify about if once 
they acquire the habit of looking for the Lord's providences 
in the affairs of life, noting experiences and lessons and comparing 
them with the instructions of the Divine Word. Those 



who are following this course are often surprised to note how 
much more every day is worth to them than formerly. 

With many, life is a business routine or a dream. As 
New Creatures we desire to have every day full of Christian 
experiences and intelligent thought directed and moulded by 
the Divine Word. This blessed condition is attained largely 
by the method we have indicated. Our growth in grace depends 
not so much on the number of chapters or verses which 
we read, as upon the exercise of our minds, hearts and wills 
in connection with what we already know and what we daily 
learn of the will of God. 

It is not for the Elders, but for the Class to determine 
what meetings it wishes to hold. When the Class decides, 
the Elders, of course, still have their privilege of resigning. 
Indeed, it would certainly be advantageous, both for the 
Elder and the Class, to have such Elders resign as desire to 
rule the Lord's household, instead of desiring to serve it. 

However, our experience teaches that frequently supposed 
oppositions are merely misunderstandings. We advise a careful 
study afresh of STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES, Vol. VI. 
Indeed, we remind the dear friends how leaky are all our 
memories, and of the wisdom, therefore, of the course being 
followed by a great many— the reading of the entire six volumes 
of STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES every year-twelve pages 
or more every day. Those who are following this course 
report great blessing and give evidence of great clearness in 
the Truth.

DEAREST BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

Inclosed find report for the week. The work goes forward 
gloriously and with greatly increasing momentum. The week 
has been chock full of the hardest kind of work, and the blessing 
and presence of the Lord never seemed half so bountiful. 
But the necessity for rapid and continuous work can hardly 
be exaggerated. It seems to me, with some exceptions, one 
day at most places is what is required. 

There are some things, however, that make us very sad. 
It is to see some substituting petty whims of their own for 
the Lord's precious Truth and "the spirit of a Sound Mind." 
In some instances these are surmising evil, making efforts 
to prop themselves up and appear wise. In some instances 
their efforts to hold on to responsibilities in the church for 
which they are poorly suited lead them to not only discard 
the help of some superior fellow-members of the Body, but to 
speak evil of them. 

That there is a separation now rapidly going on is plain 
as day. It is so distinct and extensive as to be alarming. 
Surely it does behoove everyone of the consecrated to be on 
guard as never before. The temptations to neglect bodily discipline 
and indulge the human desires are so subtle and powerful 
as to prove destructive before they are realized. 

In much love to yourself and all the dear ones at Bethel 



and everywhere, I am faithfully yours in the Master's 
Service, O. L. SULLIVAN. 



DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

Grace, mercy and peace from God our Father and from 
Jesus Christ our Lord be unto you! 

We were delighted to see and hear you again both at 
Glasgow and at London. I think the London Convention has 
proven a great blessing to the Church in Nottingham. Two-thirds 
of our number attended and we have had such an impetus 
given to us that we are now able to have public meetings 
at any time. 

I am sure you will be delighted to know that at our meeting 
last Monday it was agreed to take larger premises, and 
although the expenses will be heavy, yet the friends have 
decided to sacrifice more than ever, in order that a good 
witness may be given in this place. 

Dear Brother, it is a great joy to me that at last such an 
awakening is come, for a short time ago I almost felt like 
despairing of arousing interest. You, however, under the 
Lord's guidance, were permitted to do so, and it is a great 
cause for thankfulness. 

The suggestion that "What shall I render unto the Lord 
for all His benefits toward me?" be said every morning has 
been carried out by quite a number of the friends and it has 
had a good effect, hence they are desirous of doing more. 

Certainly we have not done as much as we might have 
done in the past, but now we trust there will be a good witness 
given. 

Dear Brother, you are always remembered in every prayer 
of ours that our dear, loving Heavenly Father may grant 
you more and more of His Spirit, so that you may continue 
to give us "meat in due season"; and as for myself I feel 
day by day that it is a great and mighty privilege given me 
to bear witness to the Truth. 

Certainly I get more tired in this work than I did in my 
scholastic work, but that is all the more to rejoice in, and 
from my heart I praise God for the privilege! 

Many, many thanks, dear Brother, for the "Poems of 
Dawn" sent from the British Branch. The more we think 
of your loving consideration for all of us the more we love 
you and desire to follow you, as you follow the Master. 

Quite a number of times have I been told I have great 
zeal, but it is for a man and not for God. This is because 
I have said, "Let us see what Brother Russell says upon 
the matter." 

We should be delighted, dear Brother, if you could give 
us a visit in Nottingham again the next time you visit this 
country. 

Several have joined us since your last visit, and we praise 
God for it; two are most earnest members. 

And now, dear Brother, our prayer is that the peace of 
God which passeth all human understanding may rest and 
abide upon you. Love from us both. 



Yours in our dear Redeemer, 

J. AND C. HODSON.-England.

SERMONS IN THE NEWSPAPERS. 

Under God's providence a great work is being carried on 
through the newspapers; and the Gospel is being presented 
to millions who never attend meetings for Divine worship. 
Some of these are discouraged Christians who lost their faith 
in human creeds and systems of men and found no footing 
for their faith in the Bible because they did not understand 
it. How blessed that God has such an arrangement by which 
the good tidings may reach those otherwise outside any general 
opportunity for hearing it! 

But alas, some Christians have a bitter and sectarian 
spirit! The fact that many of the Churches have smaller 
congregations as a result of loss of faith years ago makes their 
votaries angry that the Message should be heard outside the 
Churches. Some of these unreasonable zealots are doing all 
they know how to do to hinder the Message from going to the 
outsiders through the newspapers. Oh, why do they not rejoice 
that the Gospel is being preached to the poor, to the 
outsiders, to the publicans and sinners! 

Under these circumstances it behooves all of us to encourage 
the editors of the newspapers publishing the sermons. 
They should know that their work is appreciated. Letters 
sent to them should be moderate and kind. They are not publishing 
the sermons because of any personal interest in them, 
but merely because the public are reading them. Let us hold 
up their hands, not only encouraging them with postcards, 
assuring them of appreciation of the sermons and of the good 
work they thereby assist in, but let us also give to such papers 
a financial encouragement through subscriptions. 

The WATCH TOWER Office frequently has special agents' 
rates for newspapers. In any event it knows quite well which 
papers would most need a little encouragement in the way of 
new subscriptions. Subscriptions sent to us will be wisely 
used. Many of our readers doubtless can afford to take several 
papers, and, after reading these, to mark the sermons and 
to use them as tracts amongst their friends and neighbors. Do 
it now before you forget it!

CHOICE MOTTO CARDS-1912-1913. 

Orders for motto cards for Christmas time should be in our 
hands not later than December 1 —preferably before. We have 
this season some very choice sorts. These cards are made in 
Europe, hence subject to heavy expenses for freight and duty. 
Nevertheless, we can supply them in the United States and 
Canada at less than retail European prices because we supply 
them at about cost price— that is to say, about one-half the 
usual American prices. Besides this we prepay postage or express 
charges. Our object is to encourage the embellishment 
of the homes of the Lord's people with faith-stimulating and 
courage-inspiring texts tastefully prepared. To facilitate the 
handling of these motto cards we assort them in packets, carefully 
packed, at the following prepaid rates:— 

No. Mz.— Fifteen small cards, different texts, 50c. pk. 

No. Mv.— Eight small and three larger-sized, 50c. pk. 

No. Ma.— Fifteen small and six a little larger, $1.00 pk. 

No. Mb.— Six small, six a little larger, and three medium-sized 
mottoes, $1.00 pk. 

No. Mc— Six small and six medium-sized mottoes, $1.00 pk. 

No. Md.— Six small, six a little larger, and three large 
mottoes, $1.00 pk. 

No. Me.— Four large mottoes, $1.00 pk. 

Where a Class or several individuals choose to order together 
to one address we can save a little in the expressage, 
justifying the offer of five of the One Dollar packets and one 
of the Fifty-cent packets for Five Dollars, or more at the same 
rate, assorted, as you please. 

Make your selections carefully, write out your order plainly, 
stating exactly what is wanted, have money order or check 
accompany order and be sure to clearly indicate the address 
to which you desire shipment to be made.

EVIL SPEAKING AND EVIL SURMISING 

MANY ARE THE peculiar subterfuges which 
the fallen nature uses in its attempt to stifle 
the voice of Conscience. We have known people 
who took cognizance of the Scriptural 
injunction against slander, evil speaking and 
evil surmising, and yet who were so confused 
on the subject and so unaccustomed 
to scrutinizing their own conduct that they 
would utter slander in the very breath in 
which they expressed their strong disapproval 
of evil speaking. In order to avoid such a condition 
of confusion it is well to have in mind a clear definition 
of these terms. 



SLANDER A FACTOR IN ANARCHY 

A slander is anything uttered with the intention of 
injury to another, whether the statement be true or false. 
Both the Law of God and the laws of men agree that 
such injury is wrong. True, many slanderers are never 
prosecuted; true that even newspapers have times without 
number escaped heavy damages for libelous slander, 
on the plea that they published the defamation as news 
which properly belonged to the people. Public men 
consider it good policy to let ordinary slander go unnoticed, 
realizing that many of the false statements made 
by the opposition press will properly be credited as 
falsehood. 

The effect of public slander is very injurious, and 
brings about a gradual growth of slander among the 
people. This condition is sure to work evil to themselves 
and to their institutions. Government officials and other 
men thus slandered lose their influence for good over the 
lower classes, who are thus being helped along day by 
day to greater lawlessness, and are being thus prepared 
for the period of anarchy which the Scriptures tell us is 
near. 

EVIL SPEAKING INDICATIVE OF UNGODLINESS 

Evil speaking includes all defamatory or injurious 
remarks against others— words of hatred, malice, envy 
or strife— everything which would injure another to any 
degree. Even an uncomplimentary remark respecting 
another, injuring his reputation, is evil speaking, although 
the uncomplimentary statement be true. 

All of our words are taken by the Lord as an index of 
the heart. If our words are flippant, frivolous, unkind, 
unthankful, rebellious or disloyal, He judges the heart 
accordingly, on the principle that "Out of the abundance 
of the heart the mouth speaketh." (Matt. 12:34.) Thus 
in all the varied circumstances of daily life, our words 
are continually bearing testimony before God of the 
condition of our hearts. 

Godlikeness certainly cannot include any harmful 
gossip, any unclean or unholy conversation, any disloyal 
or rebellious words. Let all such things be put far away 
from those who name the name of Christ in sincerity 
and in truth. 

The tongue is the most powerful member of the human 
body. As the Scriptures say, with it we may praise 
God or injure men. Not only may we injure those within 
reach of our tongue, but our words might extend their 
influence throughout the world and from generation to 
generation. Our tongues are the most wonderful power 
that God has given us. It has been said that all of life's 
experiences deepen when presented in language. When 
uttered, thoughts impress themselves deeply upon the 
mind. We should certainly take heed to our tongues.— 



James 3:9,10. 
EVIL SURMISING INDICATIVE OF AN IMPURE HEART 

Evil surmising consists in imagining evil motives to be 
behind the words and the acts of others. Proceeding out 
of the heart not fully consecrated, evil surmising will 
attribute some selfish or evil motive to every good deed. 
This form of sin is ranked by the Apostle Paul as contrary 
to the words of our Lord Jesus, opposed to godliness, 
and of the same spirit as envy and strife— works 
of the flesh and of the Devil. -I Tim. 6:3-5; Gal. 5:19-21. 

Those who have cultivated that spirit of love which 
"thinketh no evil" have developed their characters and 
have become of "quick understanding in the fear of the 

R5123 : page 335 

Lord." (Isa. 11:3.) They will be cautious where there 
is even the appearance of evil, while at the same time 
they will avoid the imputation of evil intentions until 
forced to concede them by indisputable evidence. It is 
far better to take some slight risks and to suffer some 
trifling losses than to accuse even one innocent person. 
The Lord, who has directed our course in matters of this 
kind, is abundantly able to compensate us for any losses 
experienced in following His counsel. 

TO IMPUTE GOOD MOTIVES IS CHARITABLE 

The true Christian will cultivate the disposition to 
think charitably of the words and actions of others, and 
to suppose that their intentions are good, until he has 
positive evidence to the contrary. Even then he will go 
to the offender alone, according to Matt. 18:15, and if occasion 
require, will take the subsequent steps, as directed 
by the Lord. -Matt. 18:15-17. 

From their high standard of the appreciation of the 

R5123 : page 336 

Divine Law, advanced Christians see that in the Lord's 
sight hatred is murder, slander is assassination, and the 
destruction of a neighbor's good name is robbery. Any 
of these things done in the Church among the professed 
people of God is doubly evil— the robbery or the murder 
of a brother.— I John 3:15. 

Verily, with force do the Scriptures declare that the 
natural heart is "deceitful above all things and desperately 
wicked." (Jer. 17:9.) Those who practice evil speaking 
and evil surmising and who attempt to justify their 
conduct have either never entered the School of Christ 
or else are only in the infant class, for they seem not to 
know that theirs is not the spirit of brotherly love. 

DIFFERENT WAYS OF MISREPRESENTING OTHERS 



False witness applies not only to the utterance of falsehood, 
but also to any form of misrepresentation, whether 
by direct statement or by such indirect statement that a 
wrong inference may be drawn. One may bear false witness 
by a nod of the head, by a shrug of the shoulder or 
even by silence when he should speak. 

One of the hardest lessons, apparently, for Christians 
to learn thoroughly is the Master's command that if 
they have anything unpleasant to say respecting a brother 
or a sister, any criticism to offer concerning the private 
life of another, they should go to the person alone. 
(Matt. 18:15-17.) Perhaps in no other way does the 
Adversary succeed so well in planting roots of bitterness, 
producing misunderstandings, anger, malice, hatred, 
strife, and other works of the flesh and the Devil, as in 
deterring the Lord's people from obedience to this command. 
Let us permit love to do her perfect work in our 
relationship to others. 

LOVE A PREVENTIVE OF EVIL THOUGHTS 

The Law of Love forbids the Lord's people to follow 
the pernicious example of the world. That Law commands 
silence to all who acknowledge the great Law-Giver, 
saying, "Speak evil of no man." (Titus 3:2.) 
Further than this, it declares against evil thoughts, evil 
suspicions and evil surmisings: Love "thinketh no 
evil." (I Cor. 13:5.) Love filling our hearts will not 
only hinder evil conduct and injurious words, but will 
prevent evil thoughts. 

Indeed, to impress the importance of this subject, the 
Great Teacher declares to the pupils in His School, "With 
what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged." (Matt. 7:2.) 
Again He instructs them to pray, "Forgive us 
our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against 
us." (Matt. 6:12,14,15.) Again He declares, "If 
ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother 
their trespasses, so likewise shall My Heavenly Father 
do also unto you." (Matt. 18:35.) If at heart we treasure 
up resentment against others, the Heavenly Father 
will not forgive us. 

PURITY OF HEART AN ADVANCED STAGE OF DISCIPLESHIP 

Those Christians who are Elders in the School of 
Christ and who are therefore qualified to teach others, 
are not only outwardly clean, but inwardly also. They 
are washed by the water of the Word from the meanness, 
the filthiness of the flesh. No longer the slaves of sin, 
they are not controlled by the desires and the weaknesses 
of the fallen flesh and the spirit of the world. They do 
not bear the fruits of unrighteousness— anger, malice, 
hatred, strife, slander, evil speaking, evil surmising.— 
2 Cor. 7:1. 

A pure heart signifies purity of will, of intention, or 



purpose, which like the needle to the pole, always turns 

toward righteousness. Though some sudden or strong 

temptation may for an instant, through the weakness of 

the flesh, draw it to the right or to the left, yet it quickly 

recovers its normal position, which is loyalty to truth and 

righteousness. A pure heart loves righteousness and 

hates iniquity. It loves purity and despises impurity and 

unrighteousness. It loves cleanliness of person, of clothing, 

of language and of habits. It delights in the society 

of the pure and shuns all others, knowing that "Evil communications 

corrupt good manners."— I Cor. 15:33. 

We should distinguish sharply between purity of 
heart, will, intention, and absolute purity of every act, 
word and thought; for while the former is possible, the 
latter is impossible so long as we have our mortal bodies 
and are surrounded by our present unfavorable conditions. 
The standard set before us is, "Be ye perfect, even 
as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect." (Matt. 5:48.) 
By this standard we are to measure ourselves 
continually, and not by one another; and to this standard 
we are to seek to bring all the conduct of our lives as 
well as the meditations of our hearts.— 2 Cor. 10:12; 
Psa. 19:14. 

But only our wills (hearts) have yet been transformed 
and renewed. Our imperfect earthen vessels in which 
we have this treasure will not be "changed" until our 
resurrection. Not until then shall we be perfected in the 
Divine likeness. But now, nothing short of purity of 
heart, will, intention, can be acceptable to God and bring 
us a blessing. -2 Cor. 4:7; I Cor. 15:52. 

HOW TO MAINTAIN PURITY OF HEART 

Those who have made a full consecration of heart to 
the Lord constitute the pure in heart under the Law of 
Love. But notwithstanding the purity of their hearts, 
their intentions, their wills, to fulfil the royal Law of 
Love, these have a battle to wage. The law of their 
members, depraved through inherited sin, is the strong 
law of selfishness, in opposition to the new Law to which 
they have pledged themselves— the Law of Love.— Rom. 13:10; 
James 2:8. 

Yet their inability to live up to the requirements of 
that new Law must be through no lack of will, no lack 
of intention of the pure, loyal heart. Whatever failure 
they make, however short they may come at times of 
obtaining the victory, it must be solely because of weakness 
of the flesh and the besetments of the Adversary, 
which their pure hearts failed to resist. 

Here the Lord's promises are helpful, assuring them 
that He knows their weaknesses and frailties, as well as 
the wiles of the Devil and the influence of the spirit of 
the world, which are contrary to the spirit of Love. He 
tells them that they may go freely to the Throne of 
Heavenly grace, there to obtain mercy in respect to their 
failures to live up to the high standard which their hearts 



acknowledge and to which they strive to conform. He 
also assures them that they may find grace to help in 
every time of need.— Heb. 4:16; Eph. 6:12. 

Availing themselves of these mercies and privileges 
provided through our Great High Priest they are enabled 
to fight a good fight against sin, to repulse its attacks 
upon their hearts, and to drive it off, if it has succeeded 
in invading their flesh. 

Thus, and only thus, may the Christian keep himself 
pure in heart and maintain his stand as a fighter of the 
good fight, one of the overcomers of the world and its 
spirit. 

SELF-DECEPTION OF AN IMPURE HEART 

The mind of the flesh will seek to enter into partnership 
with the new mind, and will be very ready to accept 

R5123 : page 337 

love as the rule of life, under certain conditions. The 
mind of the flesh would prefer to recognize love in words, 
in profession, in manners only— a form of godliness 
without its power.— 2 Tim. 3:5. 

Gentle manners, such as love would manifest, may be 
exercised by a selfish heart, deceiving itself and seeking 
to deceive others. On the lip may be the smile, the word 
of praise, of kindness, of gentleness, while in the heart 
may be feelings of selfishness, of grudge, of bitterness, 
of animosity. Under favorable conditions these 
hidden motions of sin in the flesh may manifest themselves 
in more or less carefully worded slander or backbiting 
or reproach. Or these, continuing to rankle in the 
heart, may when opportunity affords bring forth anger, 
hatred, malice, strife and other wicked works of the 
flesh and the Devil, wholly contrary to the course of a 
pure heart and at variance with the commandment of the 
Law of the New Creation— Love.— 2 Tim. 3:13; Rom. 7:5; 
Gal. 5:19-21. 

We are to have clearly before our minds the fact that 
the ultimate object of all the Divine dealings with us and 
for us, and the ultimate signification of all the Divine 
promises made to us, is the development of love, which 
is godlikeness, for God is love. That this love may be 
developed in us in the sense and to the degree intended 
by the Lord, it must come from a pure heart, in full 
accord with the Lord and His Law of Love, but wholly 
antagonistic to the Adversary and his law of unholy pride, 
jealousy and selfishness.— I Tim. 1:5. 

LOVE DEVELOPED BY THE PRINCIPLES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS 

To have this kind of love in its proper development 
there must be a good conscience, well regulated by the 
Scriptures; therefore the study of God's Word is very 
important. Meditation upon God's Law is also necessary. 



We must recognize the fact that there are Divine commands 
with principles behind them and that these principles 

R5124: page 337 

are to be incorporated into our characters. In 

other words, we are to have the mind of Christ. (I Cor. 2:16.) 

As the Apostle says, "Walk in the Spirit and ye 

shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh."-Gal. 5:16. 

This admonition means that we should guard all the 
actions of life, as well as all our words; for these are a 
source of either blessing or ill to others and to ourselves. 
"As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he." 
(Prov. 23:7.) Some may deceive others for a time, but 
the Lord knows whether we are seeking to please Him. 

We are to endeavor to please the Lord in all things 
and to watch the outward conduct so that our walk in 
life may be circumspect. Even though we know that 
the world will take our very best thoughts and endeavors 
for hypocrisy, nevertheless, our way is clearly marked 
out— the way of the Lord— the way of Wisdom.

THE KINDNESS, HUMILITY AND PATIENCE OF LOVE 

"God is Love."— 1 John 4:8. 

IN THE SCRIPTURES the word love is used 
to express the complete whole of the grand 
and glorious qualities which make up the 
perfection of Jehovah. God is the personification 
of Love. To whatever extent any 
one possesses this quality of Love to that 
extent he has character-likeness to God. 
Whoever is fully in God's likeness may be 
said to be Love; for Love is the great 
principle which represents most fully the 
Divine character. 

"God is Love," our Lord Jesus is Love; and when the 
Church is perfect, each member of the Body will also be 
Love. This great principle will have full control of all 
that we do and say, even as now it has control in the 
hearts of the Lord's people, despite the weaknesses of the 
flesh, which prevent its full expression. When all the 
imperfection is taken away, those who attain the prize of 
our glorious high calling will have the image of God, the 
image of the Lord. The hope of attaining the likeness of 
the Divine character is the great ambition which inspires 
us to faithfulness of endeavor. 

Incidentally, it may be remarked that faith, hope and 
love are fruits of the Holy Spirit. Although every good 
and perfect gift comes from the Father (James 1:17), 
nevertheless, there is a difference between a "gift" and 



a "fruit." Possession of a gift may be acquired immediately, 
but a fruit requires time in which to develop. So 
with the fruits of the Holy Spirit. 

Here we see displayed the Wisdom of God. Development 
is a gradual work. With those who have that 
earnest desire and determined zeal for righteousness 
which God wishes them to have, every word and every 
act has something to do with the development of this 
quality of Love. Our Heavenly Father does not expect us 
to acquire perfection of love in the flesh, for its weaknesses 
and imperfections will not permit us to do so; but 
He expects to find in those who will be members of the 
Body of Christ that earnestness of spirit and faithful 
endeavor which demonstrate that if they had perfect 
bodies they would always manifest love. 

In order to reach this degree of development of character, 
we must not live after the flesh, the old creature, 
but must train our minds to desire only those things which 
are true, pure, loving and good. In this sense of the word 
we are to be copies of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

KINDNESS NOT ALWAYS LOVE 

The followers of Christ have consecrated their own 
wills and have been begotten of the Holy Spirit, which is 
the Spirit of Love; for it is the Spirit of God, who is 
Love. Therefore their sentiment toward one another 
must be one of loving interest. Perhaps they are not 
always wise in knowing how to exercise loving-kindness; 
sometimes their fallen nature may lead them to think that 
a certain course of action would be the loving one, when 
it is the very reverse— the wrong course. Hence we need 
to be on the alert to perceive to what extent we are using 
the spirit of a sound mind in our conduct and in our 
dealings with one another. 

A person might manifest kindness in word and act 
without having the right motive. Sometimes kindness is 
prompted by motives other than love. It might be for 
selfish reasons, or for the purpose of entrapping another 
to his disadvantage. This form of fraud has become so 
common as to cause no particular comment. 

The Christian's experience is a continual schooling. 
Daily we are learning more and more about ourselves and 
about the Wisdom and Justice of God. As we learn these 
lessons day by day, we are learning more to reprobate 
and correct in ourselves. In thus discovering our own 
imperfections, we should learn, as a matter of course, not 
to expect perfection in others; and we should give them 
credit for doing their best to exemplify the highest ideals 

R5124: page 338 

which they have in respect to the unity and perfection 
required for membership in the Body of Christ. 

Love is always kind; Love cannot wilfully injure another. 
The parent who loves his child will not do anything 



to harm that child. He might sometimes make a 
mistake and punish the child unjustly, but the motive 
behind a loving parent's action will always be kind and 
true. 

Love might sometimes be regarded as unkind, for the 
principles governing the actions of the individual might 
be misunderstood. When our Heavenly Father forbade 
Adam and Eve to partake of the fruit of the Tree of 
Knowledge, He had a wise reason for so doing. No 
doubt He would have eventually permitted them to partake 
of that fruit; but it was kindness on His part to 
keep them in ignorance of that fact. Thinking God to be 
unkind, ungenerous toward them, Eve thought to obtain 
her rights. So with us. If our Heavenly Father's kindness 
is not always understood, we may not be surprised 
if we have a similar experience. Although our spirit, or 
motive, may be right, yet we may not always have the 
ability to manifest it; and so we must make due allowance 
when others misunderstand us. 

THE POWER OF INDWELLING LOVE 

Man was originally made in the image of God (Gen. 1:26,27); 
but by reason of the fall of Adam, his balance 
of mind has been destroyed. Those who have the mind, 
or will of Christ are able to overcome some of the 
inequalities of their natural disposition and to think 
soberly of their own knowledge and ignorance and of 
that of others. This ability to appreciate the true state 
of affairs is the secret of much of our blessing in the 
Lord. 

When we see others who have a smaller appreciation 
of justice than we have and who do things contrary to the 
principles of righteousness, we rejoice that we know better 
and are able to do better than they. The spirit of a 
sound mind shows us that we have more ability along 
some lines than have some others, and that others have 
more ability along some lines than we. Because of the 
fall of man, all are weak in one direction or another. 
The knowledge of the imperfect condition of humanity 
should humble us rather than puff us up. 

Humility of mind comes only after the attainment of 
considerable knowledge of Christ. Knowledge puffs up 
because of selfishness of heart, because we are more likely 
to be conscious of our own good qualities than of those 
of others. Hence those born with less selfishness have 
less to contend with, and those born with more of it have 
more to contend with; and in proportion as we have the 
Spirit of Christ, we are able to overcome the tendency to 
be puffed up with what little knowledge we possess. 
Indwelling love has the power to build up, to strengthen 
character, and to counteract the wrong effect of the fallen 
human nature. 

PROPER AND IMPROPER CAUSES OF PROVOCATION 



The whole world has a tendency to recognize the principles 
of Justice. Even those whose conduct toward 
others is far from just, seem to crave an opportunity to 
fight against injustice, provided that the case is not one 
with which they are identified. This inclination often 
manifests itself in acts of violence, as when mobs vent 
their anger against some poor sinner who has done something 
to provoke their wrath. The least virulent amongst 
them have perhaps done wrong also, yet they seize the 
opportunity to show their indignation against wrongdoing 
and seem to take delight in punishing the offender. 

The Lord's people should not possess this spirit of 
intolerance. We should have patience, sympathy and endurance 
when things go wrong, and should make due 
allowance for those who are transgressors. The more we 
possess of the spirit of patience, the more we have of the 
spirit of forbearance and the more difficult it is to arouse 
us to anger. Wherever the spirit of love prevails, its 
possessor is not easily moved to do or say anything 
unkind or unjust. Love makes us very patient with those 
with whom we are associated; it is anxious to throw the 
mantle of charity over everything that seems to be wrong. 

Love would have us remember that while another may 
be in error, it does not follow that he is at fault. He 
may not have understood a matter correctly or his judgment 
may not have been the best, owing to inherited 
weakness over which he has no control. Before condemning 
any one we should make sure that he is at fault. 
Justice demands that we do no less than investigate before 
we condemn. Love urges us to be as merciful in 
the case as is possible. 

God is the very personification of Love, yet the 
Scriptures tell us that He has been provoked at different 

R5125 : page 338 

times. While passing through the wilderness, the children 
of Israel aroused His indignation repeatedly. (Psa. 78:40,56; 
95:7-1 1.) The idolatrous tendencies of that 
nation brought Divine wrath upon them and sent them 
into captivity to Babylon. (Jer. 7:17-20.) Finally, their 
rejection and crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ brought 
upon them "wrath to the uttermost" and caused their 
dispersion into all parts of the earth. 

RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION A PROPER FEELING 

The Lord's people are not to be of that immovable 
kind that cannot feel any resentment of injustice. Lack 
of ability to have just indignation would imply lack of 
morals and of harmony with God. Of our Lord Jesus it 
is written that when He beheld the unrighteous condition 
of the rulers of His people, and saw the injustice of 
their conduct, He "looked round about on them with 
anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts." 
(Mark 3:5.) Like Him, we should be wholly out of 



sympathy with everything not in harmony with God. 

We are to love righteousness and hate iniquity. This 
word iniquity, which means the very opposite of Love, is 
a strong expression. A person who is indifferent to matters 
of right and wrong is indifferent to the character of 
God, who is in opposition to all forms of iniquity. Of 
our Lord, the Scriptures say, "Thou lovest righteousness, 
and hatest wickedness; therefore God, Thy God, hath 
anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows." 
(Psa. 45:7.) All who are cultivating character 
pleasing to God, all who are endeavoring to become exact 
copies of His dear Son, should put away every impurity, 
everything not right. Whatever is wrong should always 
be opposed by our new minds. 

On the other hand, if we have Love as the Lord has 
it, we shall hate the wrong, but not the individual who 
does wrong. In proportion as love controls our minds 
and hearts, we shall feel sympathy for those who are in 
iniquity, for we remember that the race of mankind are 
fallen from their original perfection. We should think 
that to do evil is not their intention, their will, but that 
they are suffering from an iniquitous disease. Love is 
patient and tries to find extenuating circumstances and 
conditions. It seeks to help the evil-doer and is not 
easily provoked to anger. 

But the word "provoke" signifies to incite to; in 
another place the Apostle says, "Provoke one another to 
Love and good works." (Heb. 10:24.) Love should say 
and do those things that will incite to loving words rather 

R5125 : page 339 

than stir up bitterness, which leads to anger, wrath, 
malice, strife and evil-speaking." (Eph. 4:31,32.) In 
other words, it is much better to be a peacemaker than a 
strife-maker. Yet we are not to have peace at any price; 
rather we should have peace, if possible, where principle 
is not involved. We should stir up strife only where some 
good is sure to result. 

The degree of love, the strength of love, may be determined 
by the ease with which it may be swerved and 
aroused to opposition or to impatience and anger. We 
have already seen that there may be times when patience 
might stand in the way of the real interests of the case 
and where Love would take steps to correct what seemed 
to be an apparent evil; but we must remember that balance 
of mind, or judgment, is not ours by nature. Perfection 
of decision is a quality belonging only to our 
Heavenly Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. 

"Let patience have her perfect work." (James 1:4.) 
The Father would not be provoked to anger with anything 
trivial. With us, however, our balance of judgment is so 
poor that generally we are too hasty. Very few of us 
take in the full circumstances surrounding ourselves and 
those with whom we have to do; therefore growth in 
grace and growth in knowledge will have to do with the 



degree of love exhibited by each one. 
GENEROSITY AND SYMPATHY TO BE CULTIVATED 

We are in the School of Christ, the Great Teacher. 
We have the words of the Heavenly Father, of our Lord 
Jesus and of the Apostles recorded in the Bible; therefore 
we should know the difference between right and 
wrong. On the other hand, we see that sin exists in the 
world. Mankind are imperfect in mind and morals. This 
condition is hereditary— the result of Adam's transgression, 
more than six thousand years ago. Yet with all our 
advantages of knowledge, we "cannot do the things that 
we would"; consequently, we feel a measure of sympathy 
for ourselves, and we should extend the same measure to 
others. Indeed, we should be more critical of ourselves 
than of others, although the Lord's Word says that we 
are not to judge either ourselves or others. We cannot 
read the hearts of those around us and therefore are not 
competent to decide what motives prompt their actions 
nor what degree of punishment should be meted out to 
them. 

Nevertheless, we are to observe right and wrong conduct 
among our neighbors. We may know that they 
have, figuratively speaking, a bad tree and therefore bring 
forth bad fruit; and we should consider why they have a 
tree that produces such fruitage. Perhaps they were less 
favorably born than we. Perhaps they have never been 
in the School of Christ and have never heard the Great 
Teacher or the Apostles. If so, our sympathy should go 
out to them and our attitude of mind toward them should 
be such that we will not be provoked by their shortcomings, 
but should manifest generosity of heart toward 
them. 

To attain this sympathy and generosity is a part of our 
instruction in the School of Christ, but we do not learn 
all pertaining to the subject in a day or a week. We get 
"here a little, there a little" (Isa. 28: 10); and if we are 
following on to know the Lord, our mental discernment 
will become clearer and our minds will broaden in sympathy 
for others. Thus we shall become more like our 
Father in Heaven, for He is kind to the unthankful and 
just to the unjust, as our Lord pointed out.— Matt. 5:44-48. 

PRIDE A CAUSE OF MUCH IRRITABILITY 

Undoubtedly the causes for irritability and for being 
provoked vary in different persons. With some, it is because 
of a nervous condition of health, which renders 
them less easily able to control themselves according to 
the standards which they themselves recognize. With 
others, the cause of irritability is pride. In fact, pride 
is connected with nearly everything that is injurious to 
the people of God. Wherever pride exists, the person is 
susceptible to evil influences from every quarter. 

Pride manifests itself in various ways. Sometimes it 



exhibits itself as self-esteem, leading one to think too 
highly of himself and too lightly of others, even to the 
extent of imagining himself to be their superior. At 
other times, pride manifests itself as approbativeness: 
anything that conflicts with the desire to appear well 
before others touches a tender spot. 

We are not to be indifferent to these things. If we 
have pride or approbativeness, we are to seek to control 
it with the spirit of love and sympathy for others, instead 
of letting the wrong spirit control us. The best way to 
do this is to practise generosity and to provoke others to 
love and good works instead of to anger. Let us remember 
that humility is one of the great lessons to be learned 
in the School of Christ; obedience to the instructions of 
the Teacher along this line has very much to do with our 
ever getting into the Kingdom. 

One of the best aids to the learning of this important 
lesson is to learn to judge ourselves— to scrutinize our 
own motives. If we find that we have acted unjustly 
toward another, we should go and make amends to the 
best of our ability; we should properly scourge our own 
minds, and seek to make matters right with the one we 
have wronged. For a person who is proud or who is sensitive 
to the good opinion of others, it is very difficult to 
apologize; but the best thing to do is to set the matter 
right as speedily as possible, and repeatedly, if necessary. 
Thus we may have help along the line where we should 
have it, by overcoming our pride and vanity. 

The members of the Body of Christ are all to be 
copies of God's dear Son. This does not mean that God's 
dear people will be able always to control their looks and 
actions and words, but that the heart must recognize this 
standard and strive to attain to it. Every time a person 
who has some weakness along this line of pride or vanity 
will apologize for a wrong done he will by that act show 
both God and man that his heart recognizes the right 
principle. A great blessing will come to him because of 
his following very strictly the Divine Word; thus he will 
gradually overcome his weakness and strengthen his 
character.

CALMNESS OF TRUTH 

All Truth is calm, 

Refuge and Rock and Tower; 
The more of Truth the more of calm, 

Its calmness is its power. 
Truth is not strife, 

Nor is to strife allied; 
It is the error that is bred 

Of storm, by rage and pride. 
Calmness is Truth, 



And Truth is calmness still; 
Truth lifts its forehead to the storm, 
Like some eternal hill.

GOD'S WILL CONCERNING THE CHURCH 

"This is the will of God [concerning you], 
even your sanctification."— 1 Thess. 4:3. 

IN OUR TEXT the expression, "This is the 

will of God," is in the nature of advice 

rather than command. Considering the 

class to whom this advice is given, we find 

them to be those who desire to draw near 

to God and to have Him draw near to them. 

God has promised a great reward for submission 

to His will in every particular; and 

the Apostle Paul is stating what the will of 

God is concerning those who desire to live 

in nearness to Him. He tells them that it is God's will 

that they be fully set apart to His service; that they lay 

down their lives in His work; that in all the affairs of 

life their hearts should be set to know and to do His will. 

In words of loving entreaty the Apostle elsewhere addresses 
this class, saying, "I beseech you, brethren, by 
the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living 
sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable 
service." (Rom. 12:1.) The phrase, "Present 
your bodies," includes not only the primary presentation, 
but the continuation of the living sacrifice to the completion 
of the work. In other words, the Gospel Age is the 
acceptable time when God is willing to receive those who 
come unto Him through Christ. It is the time for His 
drawing, calling, those who are to become members of the 
Elect Church. 

God's will for His believing people, justified by faith 
in the Ransom and consecrated to His service, has always 
been the same as the Apostle stated, namely, "This is the 
will of God [concerning you], even your sanctification." 
To produce this sanctification in believers God has given 
unto us "exceeding great and precious promises," and declares 
that the truth of His Word will produce the sanctification 
of character acceptable to Him— conformity to the 
image of His dear Son, our Redeemer. 

Sanctification does not mean human perfection. It is 
the consecration, or devotion of the will, which through 
Christ is accepted of the Father as perfect; it is a consecration 
of the body to sacrifice— even unto death. As 
we have seen, that body is not made actually perfect 
through justification by faith, but merely reckonedly perfect, 
according to our will, our heart, our intention. The 



new will should seek to bring every power, every talent, 
every endowment of its body, into full accord with the 
Lord, and should seek to exercise an influence in the 
same direction upon all with whom it comes in contact. 

This does not mean, however, that in the few short 
years of the present life it will be able to bring its poor, 
imperfect body to perfection. On the contrary, the 
Apostle assures us in connection with the Church, that in 
death it is sown in corruption, sown in weakness, sown in 
dishonor, sown a [an imperfect] natural body (I Cor. 15:42-44); 
and that not until in the Resurrection we are 
given new bodies, strong, perfect, glorious, immortal, shall 
we have attained the perfection which we seek and which 
the Lord promises shall be ours eventually, if in the present 
time of weakness and imperfection we manifest to 
Him the loyalty of our hearts. 

R5127 : page 340 

Our text, as well as many other portions of the Scriptures, 
teaches us that the great work which God asks of 
us is not for others, but is a work in ourselves, subduing, 
conquering, ruling self. Everything else, therefore, our 
doing service to the household of faith, our doing good 
unto all men, by home or foreign missions, etc., is subservient 
to this most important work within. For, as the 
Apostle by inspiration declares, though we should preach 
the Gospel eloquently to others, and though we should 
give all our goods to feed the poor, or become martyrs 
for a good cause, we should be nothing from the Divine 
viewpoint, without love— the Spirit of Christ and of the 
Father— developed in us as the ruling principle of life. 
(I Cor. 13:3.) But before we can "put on love— the bond 
of perfectness"— and have its rule established, we have 
many enemies to put out. 

OUR THREE GREAT FOES 

The heart is the battleground on which the Holy 
Spirit helps us to wage warfare against the enemies which 
since the Adamic fall have taken possession of the human 
mind. Our battle is to be against Sin, the great taskmaster, 
which captured our race more than six thousand 
years ago. Satan, the great master or general of Sin, is 
our enemy, and has largely to do with the various influences 
against which we must contend. We are not, 
however, to battle directly with Satan, though we are to 
"resist" him; that is, we are to resist his influence, his 
deceptions, and his endeavors to lead us into error and 
into sin. We should be powerless against this great enemy 
were it not that our Lord Jesus has conquered Sin, and 
that He is on our part, so that we can confidently say, 
Greater is He that is on our part than all they that be 
against us. 

Again, our battle is with the world. By this we do 
not mean with our fellow-creatures; for, blinded by the 



Adversary, they are little, if at all, accountable for their 
course. We are to do battle with "the spirit of the 
world" and its influences. The disposition of the world, 
the mind of the world, the motives which actuate the 
world, the ambitions of the world, the pride of life and 
the deceitfulness of riches— the wrong views of matters 
as seen from the worldly standpoint— we are to resist, to 
fight against. And it is a daily battle. 

Finally, our battle is with the flesh— our own flesh. 
Ever since Sin captured our race, its slavery has been 
conducive to mental, moral and physical degradation. Its 
every tendency has been toward evil, and that continually; 
and although our Lord Jesus had compassion on us and 
redeemed us from slavery to Sin, with His own precious 
blood, yet we have in our bodies the motions, the tendencies 
toward sin. 

So, although we are now free, and are with the mind 
serving the Law of Christ, and although we have covenanted 
to battle for righteousness, truth, goodness and 
purity, we find our new selves harassed by the old, perverted 
tastes and inclinations of our own flesh toward the 
service of the old taskmaster. Not the least of our battles, 
therefore, is against these perverted tendencies of 
our flesh; and the battle with these is also a daily battle. 
With the great Apostle Paul we should be able to say, 
"I keep my body [my flesh and its desires] under"— in 
subjection to my new will, the New Creature. 

From the moment we make a full consecration of ourselves 
unto death in the service of the Lord, He reckons 
our flesh as dead, and begets us as New Creatures. Our 
new minds are alive toward God with a newness of life. 
Hence those motions of sin which we are seeking to bring 
into absolute subjection to the will of God in Christ are 
not recognized by the Lord as the will or the motions of 
the New Creature enlisted in His service, but merely as 
a part of the general enemy, Sin, pursuing after and 
battling with us. These we are pledged to resist, and to 
war against; and to overcome these He promises sufficient 
grace and help. 

OUR DAILY BATTLE WITH SELF 

These enemies in our own flesh cause us the greatest 
difficulties. To these Satan appeals; these he seeks to encourage 
in the warfare against the new spirit of our 

R5127 : page 341 

minds; through these the spirit of the world gains closest 
approach to us, and seeks to capture us and lead us back 
as captives to Sin. So to speak, the "New Creature in 
Christ" is beset, surrounded on every hand with enemies 
seeking its disaster and re-enslavement. We must battle 
for ourselves, for our own liberty, for victory over our 
own weaknesses; we must battle against the spirit of the 
world, against delusions and snares of the Adversary by 



which he would make evil things appear good, and right 
to appear undesirable. No wonder that the child of God is 
urged to be continually watchful; that he is urged to "put 
on the whole armor of God"; that he is cautioned in respect 
to his various wily foes and especially against those 
of his own flesh; that he is urged to faithfulness and 
loyalty of heart! 

Heart-loyalty to the Lord means continual effort to 
bring all the conduct of our lives, yea, the very thoughts 
and intents of our hearts, into subjection to the Divine 
will. (2 Cor. 10:4,5.) This is our first duty, our continual 
duty, and will be the end of our duty; for "This is 
the will of God, even your sanctification." "Be ye holy; 
for I [the Lord] am holy."— I Peter 1:16. 

Absolute holiness is to be the standard which our minds 
can gladly and fully indorse and live up to, but to which 
we can never attain actually and physically so long as we 
are subject to the frailties of our fallen natures and the 
besetments of the world and the Adversary. But day 
by day we are taught of God; and as we come to a fuller 
knowledge of His glorious character, and as the appreciation 
of it more and more fills our hearts, the new mind 
will more and more gain influence, strength, power, over 
the weaknesses of the flesh, whatever they may be— and 
these weaknesses vary with the different members of the 
Body. 

If we be sanctified to God by the Truth, if our wills be 
dead and the Lord's will be fully accepted as ours, in 
thought, word and deed, then we have attained the will 
of God, and shall win the prize as "overcomers" even if 
we have never had opportunity to preach, to give to the 
poor, or to suffer as martyrs for the Truth's sake. Let us 
all note well this point: "This is the Lord's will [concerning 
you], even your sanctification." Let nothing becloud 
or obscure this truth; but let it dominate our course in life. 
Then if God's will is really our will, we have a clearly 
marked pathway before us. 

But without doubt, before all such God will open opportunities 
to serve the Truth to others, to let their light 

shine to the glory of the Father and the blessing of fellow-creatures; 
for this is His command to us, and we may 
be sure He gives us no commands impossible to be obeyed. 
If you have been seeking opportunities of service and 
have found none, there must be something wrong; you 
may have been seeking some special service of your own 
preference (your old will meddling with your newly 
adopted will— the Lord's). 

Possibly the great Teacher sees in you pride, which 
you would have been prompt to crush had you recognized 
it, but which hid itself from you under the cloak of "self-respect." 
Possibly the great Teacher by His providence 
and His Word is saying to you, "Whatsoever thy hand 
findeth to do, do it with thy might." (Eccl. 9:10.) Possibly 
He sees that you would be spoiled were He to give 
you a more important service for others, before you have 
learned the lesson of humility— all important in God's 



sight. Act quickly, therefore; the time is short. "Humble 
yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God 
[to do whatever service His providence has made possible 
to you], that He may exalt you in due time."— I Peter 5:6. 

SANCTIFICATION THE RESULT OF LOVE OF GOD 

True sanctification of the heart to the Lord means diligence 
in His service; a declaration of the good tidings 
to others; the building up of one another in the most holy 
faith. It also means that we do good unto all men as we 
have opportunity, especially unto the household of faith; 
that in these various ways our lives, consecrated to the 
Lord, shall be laid down for the brethren day by day, 
opportunity by opportunity, as they shall come to us; 
that our love for the Lord, for the brethren, for our 
families and sympathetically for the world of mankind, 
will increasingly fill our hearts as we grow in grace, 
knowledge and obedience to the Divine Word and example. 
-Gal. 6:10; I John 3:16. 

Nevertheless, all this exercising of our energies for 
others is merely one of the many ways in which by the 
Lord's providence our own sanctification may be accomplished. 
As iron sharpeneth iron, so our energies in behalf 
of others bring blessings to ourselves. Additionally, 
while we should more and more come to the condition 
of loving our neighbors as ourselves— especially the household 
of faith— yet the mainspring back of all this should 
be our supreme love for our Creator and Redeemer, and 
our desire to be and to do what would please Him. Our 
sanctification, therefore, must be primarily toward God 
and first affect our own hearts and wills and, as a result 
of such devotion to God, find its exercise in the interest 
of the brethren and of all men.

ST. PAUL'S GREAT MISSION 

"For Christ sentme...to preach the Gospel."— 1 Cor. 1:17. 

LEARNING HAS always been very properly 
held in high esteem, and those who have it 
usually appreciate this fact as well as do 
those who have it not. There is, therefore, 
on the part of the learned, or those who 
appear to be so, a tendency to do or say 
things or to discuss subjects that would make 
them shine before others. 

St. Paul had a good education. He had 
much advantage every way; consequently 
he had the greater temptation to display his knowledge. 
In his Epistle to the Corinthians, he was addressing a 
people who were familiar with Greek philosophy and who 



knew that the world valued this philosophy so highly that 
a person who did not manifest acquaintance with Greek 
learning was considered an ignoramus. 

The Apostle realized that his great mission was not 
that of making himself shine, but of preaching the Gospel 
—the "good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people." 
(Luke 2: 10.) As an ambassador of Christ, he had 
been given the privilege of becoming a sharer in His 
sufferings in the present Age and in the glories to follow 
in Christ's Kingdom. He saw clearly that his commission 
transcended anything and everything else in the world, 
and that from the Divine point of view all other philosophies 
are foolishness. He had wisely concluded that he 
would neither detract from his own mission to discuss 
these theories of man, nor would he quarrel with those 
who accepted them. 

Since those who would be blessed by hearing the Gospel 
would be those whom the Lord wished to gather, St. 
Paul determined to preach nothing but Christ. He would 
not mix the doctrines of Christ with those of Plato, although 
he knew that if he were to mention Plato and then 

R5126 : page 342 

to present Christ as a great philosopher, he would win 
the attention of the Greeks, who would say, "Here is another 
teacher of immortality and kindred themes," and 
then listen to St. Paul's discourse. 

St. Paul was well aware that the teaching of Christ 
is the very reverse of Plato's theory— that man has inherent 
immortality, that when he seems to die, he then 
really begins to live. Man has nothing that will commend 
him to God or give him everlasting life. But if he can 
come to a condition of harmony with God, he will have 
the blessing of everlasting life and happiness. The 
Apostle knew that while no fallen man can obtain this 
for himself, God has made provision for all, both through 
the redemption price laid down at Calvary and also 
through the restoration of all things by the Redeemer.— 
Acts 3:19-21. 

How wise St. Paul was! How sad that the early 
Church did not profit by his course! Long years after 
the Apostles fell asleep, the mixture of the Platonic 
philosophy and the Gospel of Christ wrought havoc in 
Christian faith, and built up the great anti -Christian system 
Scripturally called "Babylon." St. Paul was wise in 
that he would not discuss the topics usually taught by the 
Greek philosophers, but gave his whole time to the 
presentation of the philosophy of the Plan of the 
Ages. He preached Christ, able now to save "to 
the uttermost" all who come to the Father by Him 
(Heb. 7:25), all who have the appreciative ear, and able 
in His Kingdom to bring all mankind to a knowledge of 
God's goodness by opening their deaf ears to receive the 
Truth. He showed that the whole work of sin and of 
devastation through death, as it has been accomplished in 



the human family, will ultimately be undone. 

THE WEAK POINT IN MODERN PREACHING 

Many of St. Paul's hearers would have been glad to 
learn about Christ as the great Jewish Teacher and to 
admit that His philosophy was good. They would have been 
willing to hear that Christ will some day reign and uplift 
humanity. A great obstacle, however, stood in the way. 
This One who was being preached had not borne a good 
reputation. According to the testimony of His own nation, 
He had been crucified as a malefactor. 

A weaker man than St. Paul might have followed the 
policy of covering up the fact of the crucifixion of Christ. 
He might have said that the Jews did not appreciate what 
Christ was doing, that Christ was the Son of God, the 
mighty Logos; and then he might have glossed over the 
death of Christ on the cross. Thus the Gentiles might 
have regarded our Lord as a great Teacher and never have 
learned of the manner of His death until some Jew should 
tell them that their great Teacher had been a malefactor 
so wicked that He was not fit to live. Should they then 
have asked St. Paul whether this was true, he could have 
explained that it was a fact, but that the great mass of the 
Jewish people had not consented to this act of their rulers 
and therefore were not a party to it. 

This glossing over of truth is what is done today in all 
of the great pulpits of Christendom. If our Lord's death 
is mentioned at all, it is done in an apologetic manner. 
But St. Paul preached that Christ's death was necessary 
to redeem the human race, and that under the terms of 
the Law Covenant, He must die on the cross in order to 
redeem Israel from the curse of the Law.— Gal. 3:13. 

Thus the Apostle did not shun to declare the whole 
counsel of God in the strongest form. (Acts 20:27.) 
Crucifixion was the only way in which our Lord's death 
would be of full value and accomplish the purpose intended. 
Had He not died, the "Just for the unjust," He 
could not have been the Redeemer of the whole world. 
This Message was so great, so different from anything 
else in the world, that the Apostle concluded that he had 
no time for the discussion of any other topic. 

There might have been occasions when St. Paul could 
have discussed something else. Although he might have 
had the opportunity to say that he did not believe in the 
Platonic philosophy at all, yet he did not intend to display 
what he knew about worldly philosophies. So it is with 
us. We are to discuss the Truth rather than the error. 
If we should have occasion to mention the error, it should 
be only as a side-light to illuminate the Truth by contrast. 

There are many subjects in which there is a measure 
of truth— geology, astronomy, etc.— but to preach these 
would be to neglect, not only to set forth the great central 
Message that man is a sinner and can have no reconciliation 
with God except through the death of Christ, but to 
show what constitutes discipleship, what is to be its reward 



and what the result of the glorification of the Church 
with Christ. This Message of the Gospel is not preached 
today. On the contrary, much foolishness is set forth in 
the name of Christ and in churches dedicated to the 
service of the Lord. We are not to imitate this course 
and to strive for popularity in preaching. We are to follow 
in the footsteps of Jesus and His disciples. 

Observation has taught us that those consecrated ones 
who have permitted other themes than "this Gospel" to 
engross time and attention are in great danger of being 
led astray. We advise such to be very jealous in husbanding 
time and talent for the ministry of the Gospel. Let 
us leave all other subjects, no matter how interesting, to 
others. In the future, when all knowledge shall be ours, 
we can discuss them. Those who from any avoidable 
cause turn aside from the ministry of the true and only 
Gospel are quickly turned out of the way, or else are 
greatly hindered in their course toward "the prize of the 
high calling. "--Phil. 3:14. 



R5128 : page 342 

THE TWO PARTS OF THE WORK OF REDEMPTION 

THE STATEMENT of the Law is very positive- 

"The man that doeth these things shall 

live by them." Whoever keeps God's commands 

will live in them and will receive 

everlasting life as a reward for keeping 

them. (Lev. 18:5; Rom. 10:5.) In making 

the promise of life to the Jews, God did not 

tell them in what manner He would arrange 

for its fulfilment. As a matter of fact, although 

the Jews did not understand the 

types of the Law Covenant, God had showed how the 

keeping of that Covenant would give everlasting life; 

namely, through sacrifice. 

In His great Plan of the Ages God had already provided 
a Redeemer. (Eph. 1:4.) It was therefore in 
view of this provision of Divine grace that the promise of 
life through keeping the Law could be made. But in giving 
the Law Covenant, God did not omit the great Atonement 
sacrifice, which was the type of the work of 
Redemption. 

That our Lord had some understanding with the 
Heavenly Father before He was made flesh is self-evident; 
for His change of nature is represented as a voluntary 
act on His part. (Phil. 2:8.) He took not upon 
Himself the nature of angels, but that of the seed of Abraham. 
(Heb. 2:16.) He had an object in taking upon 

R5128 : page 343 

Himself the nature of Abraham's descendants. He did so 



"for the joy that was set before Him." (Heb. 12:2.) 
This expression implies that He had some knowledge of 
the nature of the work which He had come to accomplish. 

This knowledge which our Lord possessed in His pre-human 
condition did not include the understanding of all 
the various types of which He was to be the Antitype, 
but evidently He knew that this stooping from the heavenly 
to the earthly nature was a means to an end, which was to 
be accomplished when He became a man. In order to take 
this great step, it was necessary for Him to have absolute 
confidence that the Father would not wish Him to do 
anything which would be to His injury, but to the 
contrary, something which would do Him good. So great 
was His faith in the Father that He wished to do the 
Father's will at any cost. 

The first step toward the achievement of the Father's 
will was the taking of a nature lower than any on the 
spirit plane— the human. Then, being found in fashion 
as a man, He humbled Himself unto death, even the death 
of the cross. (Phil. 2:8.) He did not humble Himself 
before He became a man, but afterwards. As a boy He 
inquired of the Doctors of the Law what time would be 
appropriate for Him to enter upon His ministry. Evidently 
satisfied by His investigation that there was nothing 
to be done at that time, He returned to His home with His 
mother and her husband, and was subject to them until 
He was thirty years old.— Luke 2:51. 

At thirty years of age, Jesus offered Himself at Jordan, 
where He went for no other purpose than to make His 
consecration. He knew that He had come into the world 
to be man's Redeemer; that God's will concerning His 
work of redemption was written in the types and shadows 
of the Scriptures, and that this will was altogether outside 
of the moral part of the Law, for it was not obligatory 
on one who would keep the Law. He also knew that to do 
this work of redemption He must present Himself in sacrifice. 
(Psa. 50:5.) Gladly He offered Himself, saying, 
"Lo, I come. ..to do Thy will, O My God." 

ONLY ONE PART OF THE REDEMPTION WORK YET 
ACCOMPLISHED 

In the Atonement Day offering, our Lord's consecration 
is pictured by the High Priest when he smote the 
bullock and killed it. Here we have in the type a picture 
of our Lord, who was represented by both bullock and 
priest. The new mind, the new will, the New Creature, 
offered up the flesh. It was not that He offered up Himself 
as man's Redeemer; He presented Himself a sacrifice 
—not to mankind, not to Satan, not to the world, but 
unto God. He was so loyal that He was ready to sacrifice to 
the Father everything which He possessed; He was permitted 
to prove His loyalty and faithfulness even unto death. 

As a result of His obedience unto death, even the 
shameful death of the cross, our Lord was raised from 
the dead and given the very highest nature— the Divine. 



In due time He will be permitted to offer the merit of 
His sacrifice as a Ransom-price for the sins of the whole 
world, and thus He will become the world's Redeemer. 

This word Redeemer is quite broad. It signifies one 
who obtains control of something and brings it back to 
a former condition in a legal and satisfactory manner. 
Our Lord began to do this work. He has accomplished 
the first part, which in due time will become a satisfactory 
price for the sins of the world. He has already been 
highly exalted and thus qualified for the great office of 
Mediator between God and men. He is waiting merely 
until the members of His Body be joined to Him and 
made participators of His glory, and then the work of 
Restitution for mankind will begin. 

Our Lord will be a thousand years in doing the second 
part of this work of redeeming. At the close of the thousand 
years the work will have been finished. Now He is 
the Redeemer, the Restorer, not because He has done 
the work, but because He has the power and authority to 
do it. At the close of the thousand years He will be the 
One who will have accomplished this work of Restitution, 
and the name Redeemer will be His forever, even 
though the work of redeeming will be in the past. 

Nothing in the Scriptures indicates how clearly our 
Lord understood the terms and conditions upon which He 
would please the Father after coming into the world. 
We are, therefore, not to dogmatize on the subject. But 
it is probable that He did not know all the experiences 
through which He would pass while in the flesh, and that 
some of these were afterwards revealed to Him, as we 
read that when after His baptism He came up out of the 
water, the heavens— the higher things, the spiritual- 
were opened to Him. (Matt. 3:16.) Thenceforth He 
was able to appreciate the deeper features of God's Plan. 



R5129 : page 343 

"QUENCH NOT THE SPIRIT" 

-ITHESS. 5:19.- 

IN THE SCRIPTURES light is used as a 

symbol of the illuminating power of the 

Holy Spirit. The Spirit of God is symbolized, 

not only by the oil with which the 

priests were anointed and which represented 

the indwelling power of the Spirit, 

but also by the light of the golden candlestick 

which stood in the Holy. After we had 

been favored with the knowledge of the 

Truth and had consecrated ourselves, the 

Lord accepted our consecration and gave us the Holy 

Spirit, which became the illuminating power of our 

hearts. All down the Gospel Age the Church has been the 



light of the world. This our Lord intimated would be 
true when He said to His disciples on one occasion, "Ye 
are the light of the world."— Matt. 5:14. 

As there are various ways by which a light may be 
extinguished, so there are different means by which this 
light of the Holy Spirit may be quenched in us. A light 
will go out if the supply of oil or gas which feeds it be 
cut off, or if the oxygen of the air be shut off from it, 
whether because the supply is exhausted or because 
something is placed over the light to extinguish it. So it 
is with us. The light of the Spirit may be permitted to 
die out for want of replenishing, or it may be quenched 
by contact with some outside force. 

In order to have the Holy Spirit in large measure, we 
must keep near to the Lord; for if we get away from 
Him, the light will go out. If we neglect the privilege 
of prayer or of study of the Scriptures or of fellowship 
with the Lord through failure to think of Him, the illumination 
of the Spirit will grow dim. On the other hand, 
it will become brighter in proportion to our realization 
of our own imperfections and to the degree of our consecration 
to the Lord. This we manifest by the zeal with 
which we study His will as expressed in His Word, and 
with which we practice that will in the affairs of life. 
These are the means by which we may supply the oil to 
keep our light burning brightly. But while we are endeavoring 
to do this, we must see to it that we do not 

R5129 : page 344 

come into contact with anything which will tend to 
extinguish the flame of sacred love in our hearts. 

The world, the flesh and the Devil are all in opposition 
to the light of the Holy Spirit. To whatever extent 
they are brought into contact with the light, to that 
extent they smother it. If the spirit of worldliness come 
into our hearts, it will extinguish the light of the Holy 
Spirit. If the spirit of selfishness or of thoughtlessness 
enter our hearts, it will cause the light to grow dim and 
finally to die out. Weariness in well-doing will produce 
the same result. If we indulge in pleasures of the flesh, 
these will tend to quench the Spirit. Sinful pleasures 
should, of course, be shunned by everybody. But there 
are pleasures which are not sinful and which are proper 
enough for the natural man. Yet to whatever extent the 
consecrated indulge in these and thus gratify the longings 
of the flesh, proportionately the new nature will 
suffer. 

Christian fellowship is thought to be one of the very 
best aids to maintaining the light of the Spirit. Yet even 
in this there is a danger-line which is not always recognized 
and which, if crossed, will produce the opposite 
effect. A visit to the seashore and a bath in the ocean 
may in some cases be very profitable; but in others it 
may be carried to such an extent that it becomes dangerous 
to the new nature. Those who become weary in 



well-doing are usually those who have found something 
attractive in another direction to take their attention 
away from the things of the Spirit. 

ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLAN MOST ESSENTIAL 

Amongst the various arrangements which God has 
made for the New Creatures in Christ is the assembling 
of themselves together in order to maintain their light and 
to let it shine. The Apostle Paul exhorts the Church not 
to forget the assembling together wherever it is possible 
to do so. (Heb. 10:25.) Where the assembling is not 
possible, the Lord makes up for the lack in some other 
way; and so we sometimes find a dear brother or sister 
who has not had the opportunity to meet with others in 
the Truth, but who seems to be very clear and to have a 
deep appreciation of the Lord's Plan. Not having the 
privilege of fellowship with others, such a one has done 
so much the more reading and studying. 

Those who have this opportunity for fellowship and 
who do not appreciate it, seem to be in a very unsatisfactory 
condition. In such cases, the oil is not burning 
brightly, else that one would delight to be with fellow-pilgrims 
in the same way, marching toward the same goal. 

R5130 : page 344 

We should be as careful of our spiritual condition as of 
our physical. If we have a bad taste in our mouth and 
no appetite, we conclude that we are not well; and if we 
do not care to go to meetings, we may know that we are 
not in good spiritual health. When we find that we have 
not the desire to meet with others of "like precious faith," 
it is an indication that we should go to the Great 
Physician, that He may help us. 

In some cases, however, the individual would do better 
not to go to meeting at first, but to read and study for 
awhile. Many have been hindered in their spiritual 
growth by getting a smattering of the Truth and then attending 
meetings. Such become stumbling-stones to 
themselves and to others. If they have not the time to 
read as well as to attend meetings, it would be better to 
read until they have become established, and then to 
assemble with others of like precious faith. 

Many, even of those who are leading classes, are not 
so clear in the Truth as would be desirable. Some of 
these seem not to know what they are talking about, although 
they think that they do. There are various means 
by which one may redeem the time for study. One may 
take a book with him and read while on the car, going to 
and from his daily task. We know a dear brother who 
read the entire six volumes in this way. 

The right course is to exercise the spirit of a sound 
mind on this subject, as well as on others. Our first 
thought should be for the glory of God; our second, for 
our own profit; our third, for the benefit of others. In 



this matter we owe it to ourselves to put ourselves first; 
for if we fit ourselves for service, we then have larger 
opportunity for helping others. Here self comes first, 
by Divine command— "Seek ye first the Kingdom of God 
and His righteousness"; "This is the will of God [concerning 
you], even your sanctification."— Matt. 6:33; 
IThess. 4:3. 

As each one comes to know for himself after receiving 
the Holy Spirit, He is authorized to teach what he has 
learned for himself. So we may all be taught of God 
and be used in teaching others, in proportion as we learn 
the lessons and apply them to our own hearts. Each one's 
conscience should decide for him what is to the glory of 
God in respect to attending meetings. 

A flame might be revived, even after having been 
wholly extinguished. Many of us have seen a candle 
extinguished, and yet there was a bright, warm core 
which a quick breath of air might rekindle. So with us. 
There might be something in our lives to extinguish the 
flame, but the light would not go entirely out; the breath 
of the Lord might rekindle it. We have seen people who 
apparently had been zealous for the Lord, but who seemed 
to lose their love and zeal; but later it has been rekindled. 
In other cases, the light has seemed to die out altogether. 
We should ever be on guard lest we allow anything to 
dim or to extinguish our love for the Lord, for the Truth 
or for holiness and Christ-likeness. 



R5128 : page 344 

ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE 

-DECEMBER l.-MARK 9:14-29.- 

"And Jesus said unto Him, "If thou canst believe; all things 
are possible to him that believeth."— Mark 9:23. 

WHEN JESUS and the three favored Apostles 
came down from the Mount of Transfiguration, 
where they had been enjoying the 
vision of coming glory, they found the 
other nine Apostles at the foot of the mountain 
surrounded by a multitude. They had 
made several inefficacious attempts to cast 
out a demon from a boy whose father had 
brought him for the purpose. 

So it is with some of the Lord's people; 
occasionally by faith they go up into the mountain, 
into the Kingdom; by faith they see the glory of the 
Lord revealed, and hear afresh that they must suffer 
with the Lord if they would enter into His glory. Then, 
coming down from the exalted heights of contemplation 
of things glorious, they face the realities of the present 
time— the Adversary is in possession of the world still; 



many are his slaves and dupes; no earthly power seems 
sufficient to cast him out; they are back with the remainder 
of the Church. But if the Master be with them, 
victory will ultimately be achieved. 
This case was one of occasional obsession by an evil 

R5128 : page 345 

spirit, whereas many of the others were continuous. The 
evil spirit came into this boy at times, causing him to 
have a fit, to froth at the mouth, to wallow in the mire, 
sometimes striving to throw him into the fire or into the 
water, or otherwise destroy him. The parents had 
brought the child to Jesus for a cure; in His absence they 
sought the nine Apostles remaining, but their endeavors 
were fruitless; they could not cast out this spirit. 

The unsuccessful disciples were perplexed; never before 
had the Master's name failed to be respected by the 
demons. The Scribes also were harassing them with 
questions, when Jesus and the other three appeared coming 
down the mountain. The multitude hailed Jesus and 
flocked to Him, but He came promptly to the relief of 
the Apostles and inquired the nature of their trouble. 
The father interposed and explained: "I have brought my 
son, who is possessed of a dumb spirit; and whenever it 
takes hold upon him it dashes him down and he foameth 
and grindeth his teeth and pineth away; and I spake to 
Thy disciples that they should cast it out, and they were 
not able." 

And Jesus answered, "O faithless generation! How 
long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with 
you? Bring the boy to me." And they brought him, and 
immediately the spirit caused him to fall to the ground, 
wallowing and foaming. Jesus questioned how long he 
had been thus. The father answered, "From a child," 
and that often the spirit attempted to cast the boy into the 
fire or into the water to destroy him; "But if Thou 
canst do anything, have compassion on us and help us." 

"TO HIM THAT BELIEVETH" 

Jesus replied, "If thou canst believe; all things are 
possible to him that believeth." How great stress the 
Lord lays everywhere upon the exercise of faith in the 
Divine Power! "Without faith it is impossible to please 
God." Those who cannot exercise the faith cannot have 
the blessing which others may have who do exercise 
faith; and our blessings increase in proportion as we will 
exercise our faith. Thus the Lord puts a premium upon 
this element of character, and makes it essential to His 
favor. 

R5129 : page 345 

This does not imply that people who cannot now exercise 
faith will never get any blessing. On the contrary, 



while the Lord has given certain exceeding great and 
precious promises to those who can believe and who do 
believe, and who follow their belief with obedience to 
the extent of their ability, He has also promised that by 
and by, during Messiah's Kingdom, the way of faith and 
obedience will be made so plain, so simple, that all will 
be able to follow it and to gain a reward— but a lesser 
reward than that now extended to those who can and do 
exercise faith and obedience. 

The reason for this is manifest. God is now seeking 
a special class of specially faithful and obedient children, 
to be heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Jesus in His 
glorious Messianic Kingdom. He is now selecting the 
class which by and by He will use in bestowing His 
blessing world-wide; and He desires that in this class 
shall be only such as can exercise absolute faith in Him. 
Hence, now, God's rule for dealing with the Church is, 
"According to thy faith be it unto thee." 

And in this and other miracles the Lord required 
faith seemingly as the condition of the healing. He thus 
manifested forth His coming glory and the power of His 
Kingdom. During the Kingdom reign there will be such 
manifestations of Divine Power, and such assistance 
given to those willing to exercise faith, that all may profit 
thereby and experience the healings of their flesh and 
the casting out of every power of Satan and sin. 

The poor father realized from Jesus' words that the 
difficulty rested with him, that he must exercise faith else 
his son could not be recovered. With tears he cried out, 
"Lord, I do believe; Help Thou mine unbelief!" His 
faith got its reward. Jesus commanded the evil spirit to 
come out of the boy, and enter no more into him. This 
last was the special point of this cure. The evil spirit 
had frequently left the boy, but only to return. The 
Lord's command was that he should leave and never 
return. 

It may be wondered why the Master permitted the 
evil spirit to tear the boy and cause him pain, etc., in 
leaving him. If He had power to cast him out, He also 
undoubtedly had power to control the manner of his 
coming out. We can only surmise therefore that Jesus, 
on this and other occasions, allowed the evil spirit a 
measure of liberty in the method of leaving the victims, 
and that this was for the very purpose of demonstrating 
how malicious and evil the spirit was which had control; 
and thus the miracle was the more clearly seen, and thus 
the more would the Lord be praised by those interested. 

"MANY SAID, 'HE IS DEAD'" 

The boy was left in an apparently dead condition, but 
Jesus took him by the hand and raised him up. The lesson 
for us in this is that it is not only that the Adversary 
and his power be cast out of humanity and from control, 
which the poor world needs, but they need Divine aid, 
the hand of Divine Power, for their uplift out of the 



mire of sin and death. According to the Scriptures, we 
are near the time when Satan will be bound, when all the 
influences of evil amongst humanity will be restrained. 
According to the Scriptures, also, this binding of Satan 
will be accomplished in a great "time of trouble such as 
never was since there was a nation," and humanity will 
be left in an almost dead condition. The pride, the hopes, 
the ambition of men will perish in that awful trouble 
time, but the Master will be present in Kingdom power to 
uplift them. 

Messiah's Kingdom will not only bind the Adversary 
and forbid him to re-enter humanity and interfere with 
their affairs, but the power of the Kingdom will for a 
thousand years do an uplifting work amongst the fallen 
and degraded members of our race, lifting them up, up, 
up, until they will be fully up to the Divine standard, as 
represented in Father Adam— from which condition he 
originally fell through disobedience, and return to which 
condition has been secured for all through the merit of 
Jesus' sacrifice accomplished at Calvary. 

The disciples asked Jesus why they could not cast 
out this demon. And so God's people many a time have 
asked themselves, Why cannot we do more than we are 
doing in the way of opposing Satan and Sin, and their 
reign of evil? The answer of Jesus is applicable here 
as well as there: "This kind cometh not out save by fasting 
and prayer." Undoubtedly God's people could accomplish 
much more in their own conflicts with Sin and 
Satan, and in helping others to get free from the power 
of Sin, if we would always exercise full faith in the 
Lord, and if we would continually live more in the spirit 
and less according to the flesh. This would mean fasting, 
or self-denial, and prayer, or fellowship with God. To 
him who believeth, every blessing belongs which God has 
promised to His faithful ones, but we have the conditions 
expressed elsewhere by Jesus: "If ye abide in Me, 
and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, 
and it shall be done unto you."

GREATEST IN THE KINGDOM 

-DECEMBER 8.-MATTHEW 18:1-14. 

"In Heaven their angels do always 
behold the face of My Father."-V. 10. 

PERHAPS IT WAS the fact that Peter, 
James and John had been favored more 
than the others on several occasions that led 
to the query which opens today's study: 
"Who, then, is the greatest in the Kingdom 
of Heaven?" They knew, of course, as St. 



Paul declares, that the Heavenly Father is 

above all, and that next to Him is our Lord 

Jesus Christ. "To us there is one God, the 

Father, of whom are all things; and one 

Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by 

Him." What the disciples wished to know was, which 

of them would be greatest, most influential, in Messiah's 

Kingdom, next to Himself. 

Jesus, calling to Him a little child, set him in the 
midst of them and said, "Verily I say unto you, except 
ye turn [from this spirit of self-seeking which your 
question implies] and become as little children, ye shall 
in no wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven"— you will 
have no part in it, you will not be fit. Whoever would 
be greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven should therefore 
become as humble as this little child. 

A little child, unsophisticated, is ready to acknowledge 
its lack of wisdom. It asks questions, a thousand a day, 
perhaps as many as that in an hour; it seeks instruction; 
it does not profess and boast wisdom or knowledge— it is 
candid, it is truthful. It is in later years that it learns 
from its parents and others, untruthfulness, pride, bombast 
and various qualities which it did not possess at 
first. It may have possessed the disposition to pride and 
arrogance and haughtiness, etc., by heredity, but at first 
it was guileless, and "as a little child." 

The Master's lesson is that whoever would become a 
child of God and be taught of God, and be eventually developed 
as a child of God, for the glorious position in 
the Kingdom to which we were called, must become 
childlike— must turn away from all pride, from selfish 
ambitions and hypocrisies and pretentions. They must 
confess their littleness and ignorance, and go humbly to 
the Lord for the necessary instruction. 

Any who refuse to adopt this proper, childlike spirit 
will thus be refused the opportunities of the Kingdom, 
for God will have none others— none others can be 
taught of God, they will not learn the lessons necessary, 
under the arrangements of this present time. Here then 
is the standard of simplicity and artlessness which the 
Lord's people should adopt and should continue to allow 
to control them, regardless of their years and experiences. 
"Now we know in part"; we are dependent upon 
our Father and His instructions. We have entered the 
School of Christ, our Elder Brother; He is our Instructor; 
we must learn of Him, and to learn we must be 
in this proper, childlike attitude of mind. 

"ONE SUCH LITTLE CHILD" 

We are not to understand that little children, however 
guileless, are members of Christ's Kingdom class, nor that 
the dear little ones dying in infancy will be members 
thereof. The Lord is seeking for mature men and 
women, who have a childlikeness of mind, a readiness to 
receive the Heavenly Father's Message, and who in gladness 



and simplicity of heart accept it. "Whoso shall 
receive one such little child in My name, receiveth Me"; 
whoever are My disciples are privileged to be God's little 
children, and thus to be My younger brothers; whoever 
will receive one such will be receiving Me. "Whosoever 
shall offend," or injure, "one of these little ones 
that believe in Me, it were better for him if a millstone 
were hanged about his neck, and that he were sunk in the 
depths of the sea." 

If some one were thus drowned in the sea, it would 
indeed terminate his present life, but it would not at all 
endanger or influence his future life. A future life, by a 
Restitution awakening, is assured to Adam and every 
member of his race. Neither drowning nor any other 
form of death could possibly interfere with it. But he 
who would injure one of the Lord's little ones would 
thereby come under such a measure of Divine displeasure 
that it would affect his future interests beyond the grave, 
beyond his awakening. He would be held responsible for 
his deeds, even in the next life, in proportion as he 
realized what he was doing when he injured the Lord's 
saints. 

The Lord declares that His faithful ones are as 
precious to Him as the apple of His eye, and that all 
their interests are subject to Divine supervision. He 
will allow nothing to happen to these; troubles permitted 
to come upon them will be only such as the Lord has 
foreseen and is able to make work out some blessing in 
connection with their preparation for the Kingdom. But 
even this fact will not excuse wilfulness on the part of 
those who do evil to the members of the Body of Jesus. 

We remember the persecution of the saints by Saul of 
Tarsus. We remember Jesus said to him, "Saul, Saul, 
why persecutest thou Me?" He answered, "Who art 
Thou, Lord?" And Jesus replied, "I am Jesus, whom 
thou persecutest." In persecuting the saints Saul of Tarsus 
had been persecuting Jesus, but because he did it ignorantly 
God had mercy upon him. Doubtless many 
saints from Jesus' day down have been persecuted ignorantly, 
and the Lord will have mercy upon those persecutors; 
but some of the persecuters have had such light, 
such knowledge, as to make them responsible; and it is 
of this class that our lesson speaks. Our Lord added a 
warning: "Woe unto the world because of offenses! It 
must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man 
by whom the offense cometh." 

CUT OFF HAND OR FOOT 

Here the Master brought in a saying which has perplexed 
many. "If thy foot cause thee to stumble, cut it 
off, and cast it from thee; it is better to enter life 
maimed, or halt, than having two hands or two feet to be 
cast into everlasting fire. If thine eye offend thee, pluck 
it out, and cast it from thee; it is better to enter into life 
with one eye, than that having two eyes thou be cast 



into Gehenna fire." 

Those who fail to remember that Jesus spake to the 
people in parables, and never without a parable, will be 
liable to stumble over these words of His. His teaching 
is this: If you have anything in your make-up dear to 
you as a right hand or a foot or an eye, that is likely to 
cause you to stumble and fail to enter the Kingdom, you 
would better cut off that tendency, no matter what it 
costs, no matter how precious, no matter how great a hold 
it may have upon the very tendrils of your life. Would 
it not be better to enter into life than to go into Gehenna 
fire, that is, destruction, the Second Death? Surely this 
is true. Having put our hands to the plow, having even 
become followers of Jesus, we must either go on and be 
accepted as conquerors, or must perish. 

There will, of course, be none in the Kingdom with 
but one eye, but the illustration is the same. If it should 
cost us the cutting off of some of our members, it would 
surely pay us to gain the eternal life in glory, even thus 
maimed, rather than to take the consequences of the 

R5131 : page 347 

Second Death, utter extinction. The lesson is that having 
begun as followers of Christ, and entered upon the contract 
and received a part of the reward, the Holy Spirit, 
the Divine favor, we cannot back out of the contract; 
we must go on to everlasting life or to everlasting death. 

How careful the Lord's people should be not to 
stumble one another, even one of the least of the little 
ones who has accepted of Jesus and become His follower! 
—is the lesson. To illustrate it, Jesus suggested that any 
shepherd losing one of his sheep would leave all the 
others to go and seek that one; and he rejoices specially 
at its recovery. So we, the followers of Jesus, should be 
careful not to stumble each other, but rather to remember 
that we are all sheep under the great Shepherd, our 
Heavenly Father, and the great Under Shepherd, our 
Heavenly Lord, and that He has the spirit of loving interest 
and care which would go after the straying sheep, 
and that we should have this same spirit; and possessing 
this spirit, we would be very careful indeed not to stumble 
or hinder even the least of the Lord's followers. 

All the Lord's true followers are God's "little ones," 
and are subject to special Divine supervision, represented 
in our text as angel care. The messengers who have 
guarded over the lives of God's saintly few always have 
access to the Heavenly Father's presence, to make known 
the necessities of those whom they represent, for Divine 
Power is ever on the alert for the protection of these. 
Oh, how blessed the privilege of being children of God. 
Oh, how wise to continue so little, so humble, so childlike, 
as to abide in His love, and to be enabled to learn the 
necessary lessons, and be ultimately received with Messiah 
in His Kingdom honor and glory!

MORE ELDERS--MORE WORK 

Some of the Bible Students' Classes are doing excellent 
service in the Class Extension work and, as a matter of 
course, report regularly. Often the attendance at the Extension 
meetings is good. Frequently the first three meetings 
lead up to the succeeding three, and are then followed by the 
establishment of new Classes. We recommend that wherever 
possible these new Classes have their local meetings on some 
week night, and that they endeavor to congregate with the 
Central Class at least Sundays. 

We have been surprised that some large Classes containing 
numerous brethren well qualified for the work are doing 
little or nothing in Class Extension. We have been trying 
to think out the cause of this apparent lack of zeal in the 
Harvest work. Knowing the dear friends to be zealous, 
knowing that talent in their midst is lying dormant, we have 
been forced to the conclusion which we are about to present: 
that is, that the brethren who are capable of Class Extension 
work in such classes are too modest to suggest the work, 
lest it should seem that they are trying to have the Class 
elect them to the Eldership and authorize them to proceed 
with the Extension work. Modesty is always an excellent 
quality; but it must be especially hard for dear brethren of 
some ability to abstain from proclaiming the good tidings— to 
abstain from going out and starting little meetings themselves. 

There surely are Classes deficient in material for Class 
Extension— Classes which need all the brethren of any ability 
in their midst. But there are other Classes which need to 
wake up, to take note of brethren having some ability, and 
to encourage them to use their time and strength in the Class 
Extension work. We urge, therefore, that the Classes regard 
as valuable assets the material which they possess, and seek 
to glorify the Lord in the use of these assets. 

In cases where brethren possessed of ability to give Chart 
Talks see opportunities for Class Extension, and are financially 
able to manage the matter themselves, we advise that 
they proceed to hold meetings. We recommend, however, 
that they first mention the matter to the Class, so that, if 
possible, co-operation on the part of all may be secured, and 
that all may join in a good work and in the resultant joys 
and blessings.

ARMAGEDDON SERMON IN NEWSPAPERS 

We learn that Brother Russell's Armageddon sermon 
preached at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, November 3, 
has been published in a great many newspapers which do 
not publish the sermons regularly. We trust that such publishers 
will be encouraged to continue the service. We will 
be glad to receive sample copies of all such papers. Mark 
these "Special" on the wrapper. 

When your newspaper fails to print the sermons, the proper 
place to write your protest is to its Editor or Publisher or both. 

Brother Russell supplies the sermon regularly, and if they 



are not printed the Editor and Publishers are responsible. 

The only way the publishers have of certainly knowing 
whether a sufficient proportion of their readers really appreciate 
the sermons, is from letters of approval when the sermons 
are published; or prompt letters of regret when they are 
discontinued. 

The Fourth Volume of the STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES will 
hereafter be entitled The Battle of Armageddon. The Armageddon 
sermon will constitute an additional feature. The 
price is uniform with the other volumes, 35c. delivered.

R5135 : page 351 

MEAN CHRISTIANS AND NOBLE UNBELIEVERS 

"Ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men 
after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are 
called."-l Cor. 1:26. 

SURELY NONE will dispute the statement 
that there are noble characters amongst 



unbelievers as well as amongst Christians; 
neither will any one of experience dispute 
that there are mean people amongst Christians 
as well as amongst the worldly. But 
how shall we account for this? Should we 
not reasonably expect that the noble principles 
of true Christianity would attract all 
of the best minds of the world, and rather 
repel the meaner disposition? Should we not expect 
that the doctrines of Christ, the spirit of His teachings- 
meekness, gentleness, brotherly kindness, love— would 
attract all who have sympathy with these qualities, hence 
all of the nobleminded of the world? And should we not 
likewise expect that since the Scriptures and the Spirit 
of the Lord condemn all anger, malice, hatred, envy, 
strife, backbitings, evil speakings, impurities, etc., all 
those who have sympathy with such works of the flesh 
and of the Devil would be repelled by the Gospel of 
Christ? 

Whatever the tendency of our mental philosophy on 
the subject, the facts of the case prove to us that proportionately 
a larger number of the world's nobleminded 
children reject the Lord and His Gospel, and that a 
larger proportion of the world's ignoble children accept 
the Gospel of Christ. The still more interesting and perplexing 
question therefore is, How shall we account for 
this very peculiar condition which seems contrary to all 
and every expectation? 

We account for it along the lines of our Lord's statement, 
that He came not to call the righteous, but sinners 
to repentance. (Matt. 9:13.) True, "There is none 
righteous, no, not one. ..All have sinned and 
come short of the glory of God" (Rom. 3:10,23); the 
fall of Father Adam involved every one of his posterity; 
hence all are sinners and all need the grace of God in 
Christ for the forgiveness of their sins. But those who 
find themselves morally and intellectually less fallen than 
some of their neighbors are inclined to a self-righteous 
feeling, even though they would disclaim perfection. 
They are, therefore, less inclined to acknowledge themselves 
to be nothing, unworthy of Divine favor, to bow 
themselves in the dust at the foot of the cross, and to 
receive, as an unmerited gift of God, the boon of eternal 
life through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

THE NEED OF THE GOOD PHYSICIAN NOT REALIZED 

This class feel that some of the more degraded of the 
race need Divine pity and forgiveness, and are glad that 
God has compassion for these, and will help them; but 
somehow they feel that they do not need the imputed 
Robe of Christ's Righteousness to cover them; that they 
are so respectable that if God accepts any one to a future 
life, He will surely not exclude them. They look about 
them and compare themselves with Christians, and often 
with a large degree of complacency assure themselves 



that their ideas of right and wrong and of moral responsibility, 
and of benevolence, etc., are higher, nobler, 
better than those of professed Christians. They say to 
themselves, "God is just; and while I am not perfect, 
I am a great deal better than the majority of Christians, 
and I am sure, therefore, that God in justice will take as 
much care of me as He will of others, who I see are 
inferior to me in some of the good qualities of heart and 
mind." Like the Pharisee of old, they thank God that 
they are not as other men; and they neglect the only 
"name under heaven given among men, whereby we must 
be saved."— Acts 4:12. 

The class which we are describing is a numerous 
class, more numerous than many persons would suppose 
until they reflect upon the subject; and it includes many, 
far from hypocritical, who have never understood the 
Gospel. Several of the Presidents of the United States 
have been men of this class— reverent toward religion, 
moral in their course of life, just in their dealings; for 
instance, Lincoln and Grant, whom we mention merely 
as examples of a class. Besides, many properly of this 
class are either Church attendants or Church members. 
They appreciate the fact that directly or indirectly the 
moral uplift of civilization is associated with Christianity, 
and are pleased to take their stand on the moral and 
popular side, though they have never accepted, at the 
hands of Divine grace, the forgiveness of sins through 
faith in the precious blood of Christ. 

We see their difficulty; it is that they do not recognize 
that the Lord is dealing upon principles of strict justice 
and law. Divine Law and Justice declare that all imperfection 
is contrary to God, that God's work was perfect 
originally in Adam, and that He can never accept to 
harmony with Himself anything that is imperfect. They 
fail to see that under this Law, whoever is guilty in that 
which is least, is nevertheless, guilty; and comes under 

R5135 : page 352 

the same death penalty with him who is guilty of many 
and more serious offenses. 

Since, then, all men are imperfect— none absolutely 
righteous— the one sentence of death includes every member 
of the human family; and there is no door of escape 
from death, no door of entrance into life, except the one 
which God has provided— Christ Jesus, the Righteous, 
who became man's Redeemer by the sacrifice of Himself. 
He who fails to go through this door never attains to 
life, however much he may strive against sin, and however 
closely he may approach the door. Only passage 
through the door can gain an entrance into eternal life. 
"I am the door; by Me if any man enter in, he shall be 
saved." "He that believeth not the Son shall not see 
life, but the wrath of God [the sentence of death] abideth 
on him. "-John 10:9; 3:36. 

The same philosophy of the subject shows to us why 



it is that a proportionately larger number of the world's 
ignoble than of its noble children come to Christ. Only 
those who feel that they are sinners, who feel that they 
need relief from sin, appreciate the offer of forgiveness. 
Only the sick, who realize that they are sick, feel the 
need of the Great Physician. Many indeed seek the 
Lord's grace because they realize to some extent their 
own fallen, degraded condition, and that they are meaner 
people than others; only this seems to awaken them to a 
realization of their position; only this leads them to cry 
out, "Have mercy upon me, Thou Son of David." And 
this realization of personal unworthiness of the Divine 
favor is necessary to all who would accept the grace of 
God on the only conditions upon which it is offered. 

CONTINUANCE IN THE SCHOOL OF CHRIST CONDITIONAL 

Having thus found the philosophical basis of our subject, 
we proceed to inquire concerning the result. What 
is the legitimate result of acceptance of Christ? We 
answer, The inevitable result of a proper acceptance of 
Christ must be moral uplifting; for the condition upon 
which Christ receives any one is, that he desires not only 
to be forgiven the sins that are past, but also to forsake 
sin for the future. 

The lower one may be in the scale of morality, the 
more radical will the change eventually be; but the less 
proportionately will he realize at the beginning of his 
conversion all the steps of purification of word and 
thought and act, which lie before him in the Christian 
pathway. He will at first think of the reform of merely 
the grosser manifestations of sin; but step by step and 
lesson by lesson he will be instructed by the Great 
Teacher, and brought onward in knowledge and in appreciation 
and in character upbuilding, if he continue in 
the School of Christ. 

The requirement of the Great Teacher, through the 
Apostle, is that those who come unto Him, in full consecration, 
after being accepted on the ground of faith, 
must at once begin to "put away all filthiness of the flesh 
and of the spirit, perfecting holiness in the reverence of 
the Lord." (2 Cor. 7:1.) Whoever will not make the 
attempt to do this will not be continued in the School of 
Christ; for he has not Christ's Spirit, and not having His 
Spirit he is "none of His." "Whosoever practices sin 
[knowingly, willingly] is of the devil." (I John 3:8.) 
Nevertheless, it may require years of schooling and discipline 
under the Great Teacher before some of those 
who were deeply sunken in the mire of sin and selfishness, 
and many consequent meannesses of disposition, 
become even moderately or passably good, noble 
characters. 

Character is more like the oak than like the mushroom; 
it requires time for its development. Yet as the 
oak might be quickly killed with an axe, so even a strong 
character might be quickly undermined, prostrated, overthrown 



by sin. In other words, upward development is 
slow, but downward tendencies may take effect rapidly, 
if permitted. Consequently, many Christians can see that 
while the religion of Christ has done much to help them 
and their friends out of the miry clay of sin, and to put 
them on the Rock, Christ Jesus, and has cleansed them of 
many of the defilements of the flesh, and of its meannesses 
of disposition, yet perhaps after ten, twenty or 
forty years of such discipline and perseverance, they may 
with surprise behold some unbeliever whom they must 
acknowledge to be their equal in moral probity, uprightness 
or generosity. 

THE LAW OF HEREDITY INVOLVED 

The question arises, How is this? We answer, that 
as moral deflection affects the children to the third and 
fourth generation, so moral attainments may affect the 
children to several generations. Hence not only do parents 
who have been upright and God-fearing, who have 
endeavored to cultivate in themselves the graces of the 
Spirit, benefit themselves, and approach more nearly than 
at first to the grand standard of perfection, but their 
children will be born with better natural qualifications, 
as well as under conditions more favorable to righteousness 
and nobility of soul. For the heart attainments of 
the parents are reflected in the physical condition of their 
children. 

And this, by the way, proves conclusively that many 
professedly pious parents are less noble at heart than we 
could have hoped; for, if during the period of conception 
and gestation, parental thoughts, feelings, sentiments had 
been cultivated along the lines of nobility, purity, holiness, 
reverence, benevolence, justice and love, their children 
would show it; and results would be blessed both to 
the children and the parents. The natural qualities of 
the child were willed to it before its birth, chiefly by the 
mother; and the mother's ideals were considerably those 
of the father, if they were well mated. 

Christian parents should awake to their responsibilities 
in the exercise of their procreative powers entrusted 
to them by the Almighty. It is a disgrace to our civilization 
that so many in civilized lands are low-born, even 
amongst those who recognize the laws of heredity and 
who carefully guard the breeding of their cattle and 
sheep and dogs and horses. It must be that the influence 
of the parental mind upon posterity is not recognized. 
Let these thoughts not only guard parents in respect to 
future offspring, but also make them very patient and 
painstaking with young children, when attempting to 
train out of them blemishes of character which they 
helped to implant. The first duty of a parent to his child 
is to give him the most favorable start in life within his 
power. 

If children of Christian parents, favorably bred, also 
become Christians, and begin a warfare in their own 



hearts against moral uncleanness and sin, and against all 
the mean and selfish propensities of the fallen nature, 
they may, by the grace of God, attain to a moral position 
higher than that attained by their parents, through putting 
into practise the instructions of the Great Teacher. 

But here comes in another side of the question. God 
does not accept the children of believers on account of 
parental faith, beyond the period of their minority. As 
soon as years of accountability have been reached, a personal 
covenant with the Lord is required, if they would 
be His in any special sense; otherwise they are recognized 

R5135 : page 353 

as being of the world and under its condemnation, 
and not under the justification which extends only to 
believers and their minor children. (I Cor. 7:14.) God 
makes the entrance into His family and School an individual 
matter. 

And here we find the secret of how it comes that 
some of the noblest men of the world are not the Lord's 
people. They are the children of those whose feet have 
been lifted out of the miry clay of sin. They have inherited 
through their parents a share in the uplifting 
which the teaching of Christ brought into the world, 
amongst those who follow His teaching. Thus we see 
that Infidelity has nothing to boast of in its noblest sons, 
for what they have that is noble and great came generally 
through the belief, the faith, of their ancestors. 

On the contrary, the tendency of unbelief is toward 
sin and degradation. It may not come in one generation, 
or it may. The son of noble Christian parents, who has 
inherited a more noble mind than the masses, may maintain 
that mind to some extent through life; and if he take 
pride in his morality he may, at least on the surface, 
keep up a good appearance, and may transmit some of it 
to his posterity. But eventually selfishness will undermine 
and destroy nobility; and we may as surely expect 
a degradation in the posterity of such who do not receive 
Christ, as we may expect an advancement on the part of 
all who accept the Savior. 

ILLUSTRATED IN THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH 

The general operation of this law can be appreciated 
only as we look out over a grand scope of territory and 
over centuries of time. As we look back to the days of 
our Lord and the Apostles, we find that the Gospel was 
laid hold upon by the very class that we have here described 
—the publicans and sinners, the lower classes- 
while it was rejected by the worldly-wise, the hypocritical 
and the pharisaical, who were morally and intellectually 
the superior class, and who on this very account rejected 
Christ— not feeling their need of a Savior. Looking 
intently at the Gospel Church, with its lowly beginning, 
in the poorest class, we find that whoever entered the 



School of Christ and was taught of Him was uplifted by 
obedience to that Teacher. 

This higher teaching of the Master became the standard 
among His followers. They learned that, as the 
Lord's people, they should not only love one another, but 
should sympathetically love even those who hated them, 
who maligned them and who persecuted them, saying all 
manner of evil against them falsely for Christ's sake; 
and that Divine blessing rested upon the meek, the 
patient, the humble, the peacemakers; and that the sum 
of all the graces is love. We find the very same teaching 
coming from the humble fishermen and publicans who 
accepted Him, and whom He sent forth as the Apostles 
of His grace. 

For instance, we find the Apostle Peter saying, "Add 
to your faith knowledge, self-control, patience, godliness, 
brotherly kindness, love." (2 Pet. 1:5-8.) We find the 
Apostle John saying, "He that loveth not his brother, 
whom he hath seen, how can he love God, whom he hath 
not seen?" (I John 4:20.) We find the Apostle James 
saying that all who are taught of the Lord should "show 
out of a good conversation [life, conduct] his works 
with meekness of wisdom. But if ye have bitter envying 
and strife in your hearts, glory not." "Submit yourselves 
to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 
Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you." 
"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He will 
lift you up. Speak not evil one of another, brethren." 
"Hearken, my beloved brethren, hath not God chosen the 
poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom 
which He hath promised to them that love Him?"— 
James 3:13,14; 4:7,10,11; 2:5. 

We hear the Apostle Paul, who once was of the 
nobler, the Pharisee class, giving utterance to the same 
truth, and in all humility acknowledging that "there is 
none righteous, no, not one." (Rom. 3:10.) He explains 
that only as we accept Christ have we the forgiveness of 
sins or reconciliation with the Father; that, having put 
on Christ, we should be New Creatures in Him; that old 
things should be past and gone forever, and that we 
should walk henceforth in newness of life, not according 
to the will of the flesh, but according to the purpose 
of the Lord. Hear him exhorting those who have taken 
the name of Christ, assuring them that they must also 
take His Spirit, or disposition, and have the same mind 
[disposition] which was also in Christ Jesus, our Lord— 
a mind in opposition to sin and meanness and selfishness, 
but in harmony with truth, goodness, purity, benevolence 
and love. 

And the Apostle explains this, saying: "Love worketh 
no ill to his neighbor; love is the fulfilling of the Law"; 
"Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let 
us put on the armor of light. Let us walk honestly." 
"Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision 
for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof." "Recompense no 
man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of 



all men. If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live 
peaceably with all men. Avenge not yourselves, but 
rather give place unto wrath, for it is written, Vengeance 
is Mine, I will repay, saith the Lord. Therefore, if thine 
enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink."— 
Rom. 13:10,12-14; 12:17-20. 

St. Paul explained in particular the love which is the 
essence of the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and 
which all followers of the Lord must have if they would 
continue to be His, saying: "Love suffereth long and is 
kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself; is not 
puffed up; doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not 
her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth 
not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the Truth; beareth 
all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, 
endureth all things. Love never faileth."— I Cor. 13:4-8. 

"THE TESTIMONY OF THE LORD IS SURE, MAKING WISE 
THE SIMPLE" 

It would be impossible for any class of people, however 
mentally and morally degraded they might be, to 
receive such instructions into good and honest hearts, 
without being uplifted by them, made more noble, more 
Christlike, more Godlike. It does not surprise us, 
therefore, to find that even in the first century, the Lord's 
people became noted for their high principles and morality, 
insomuch that the masses of the people "took 
knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus and 
learned of Him."— Acts 4:13. 

Then we see how the Adversary corrupted the Truth 
from the simplicity in which it was presented by the Lord 
and the Apostles. We see forms and ceremonies, genuflections 
and masses, bondage to creeds and theories of 
men, taking the place of the pure Gospel of Christ; and 
we note the result, that in proportion as the teachings of 
Christ were ignored, in the same proportion superstition 
came in, and the Spirit of Christ was lacking. 

Nevertheless, with all the corruption which came into 
the world with the second century, there was a sufficiency 
of the true spirit intermixed with the error to work a 
vast reformation in the savages of Europe, and to bring 

R5135 : page 354 

them into a condition of civilization higher than that of 

the rest of the world. And when in the Divine providence 

the Reformation movement was inaugurated, it 

lifted the same class of people immeasurably higher in 

moral tone. It restored much of the primitive purity of 

Christianity and of the Spirit of Christ; and in proportion 

as the Word of God has been free amongst the 

people, and in proportion as they have received it gladly 

and have permitted its ennobling sentiments to germinate 

in their hearts and bring forth its fruitage, in this proportion 

we have seen the peoples which came under the 



direct influence of the Reformation lifted still higher 
than the remainder of the world. 

THE WASHED SOW STILL CRAVES THE MIRE 

In all of this we observe the principle at first set 
forth; namely, that the Spirit of Christ, the spirit of 
Truth, the spirit of righteousness from the Word of the 
Lord, is the civilizing, enlightening and ennobling influence 
which has wrought the marvelous changes of this 
Christian Era and especially of this last century. Papacy 
and sectarianism hindered, but could not thwart, its influence. 
It still continues to take hold on the lower 
classes of society, and lifts them up; and the tendency is 
still observable, that those who are already lifted up are 
the less likely to be appreciative of the Divine goodness. 
Thus it is that not many great, not many learned, not 
many wise, according to the course of this world, hath 
God chosen; but the poor of this world, rich in faith, to 
be heirs of the Kingdom. 

The broader and clearer our view of the situation, the 
more shall we be able to sympathize with those of our 
brethren in Christ who by nature are mean, ignoble, 
selfish, lacking in benevolence of thought, word and conduct. 
When we realize that God has accepted them— not 
because of their good and noble character, but because 
they admit its deficiencies and because they desire to become 
reformed— transformed, by the renewing of their 
minds— then all who have the Lord's mind or Spirit will 
likewise receive them. 

In proportion as we have the mind of Christ, the holy 
mind, we shall view others from the Divine standpoint 
of sympathy for their weaknesses and ignoble qualities; 
and instead of condemning them, spurning them, and cutting 
their acquaintance because they do not come up to 
the noblest standards, we shall desire all the more to help 
them up, and shall seek kindly to point out to them the 
matters which they do not clearly see. We shall be 
patient with them as we see them striving to overcome. 
We shall realize that they contend against a mental disease 
which they have to some extent inherited, and which 
can only gradually be eradicated. 

From this standpoint we shall learn to view them 
and to think of them, not according to their flesh, not 
according to their natural tendencies and dispositions, 
but according to the spirit, according to the intentions of 
their minds, according to their covenant with the Lord. 
Thus, as the Apostle declares, we know each other no 
longer after the flesh, but after the spirit— 2 Cor. 5:16. 

Each one who has accepted God's grace, and become 
a partaker of the spirit of holiness, and is striving 
against sin in all its forms— in thought and word and 
conduct— all such are striving for the grand perfection 
of character of which our dear Redeemer is the only 
perfect illustration. All such profess themselves imperfect 
copies of God's dear Son and seek to grow in His 



likeness. All such are seeking to put away all the works 
of the flesh and the devil— not only the grosser evils 
(murder, theft, etc.), but also the more common elements 
of an ignoble, perverted nature— anger, malice, 
hatred, strife, etc. And all these are seeking to put on 
more and more the complete armor of God, to resist sin, 
and to cultivate in themselves the same mind which was 
also in Christ Jesus— meekness, patience, long-suffering, 
brotherly kindness, love. 

"SEE THAT YE LOVE ONE ANOTHER" 

Let us (Christians), then, take a broader view of 
matters, and especially of all who have named the name 
of Christ, and who give any evidence of seeking to walk 
in His footsteps. Let our love for them cover, not only 
the little, trifling blemishes and differences from ourselves, 
but let it also cover a multitude of imperfections 
in the flesh, so long as we see that their hearts are loyal 
to the Lord, and that they are seeking to walk not after 
the flesh, but after the spirit; so long as they profess to 
be seeking to get rid of the meanness and selfishness and 
littleness of the fallen nature, and to cultivate in themselves 
the nobility of character which belongs to perfect 
manhood, the image of the Divine nature. 

And let each one who has taken the name of Christ 
be on the lookout to apprehend and eradicate every trace 
of the meanness, selfishness, rudeness, dishonesty, which 
still cling to us as members of the fallen race, and are 
become so much a part of us that we are often disposed 
to call them natural traits. Let us remember that, even 
if our Lord and our brethren in Christ overlook these 
blemishes (rightly distinguishing between the "New 
Creature in Christ" and these contrary elements of our 
old nature reckoned dead), yet the world cannot so distinguish 
and will charge to the cause of Christ all the 
faults and imperfections they see in His professed followers. 
Thus that Holy Name is profaned among the 
Gentiles, daily, by many. 

Let us remember too, that ill nature cannot be transformed 
into good nature in a day. Transformation of 
mind, speech and conduct requires patience and perseverance; 
but it can be accomplished by those who have been 
begotten of the Holy Spirit and who are obedient to the 
commands of the Great Teacher. "See that ye refuse 
not [obedience to] Him that speaketh" from Heaven. 
(Heb. 12:25.) Whoever neglects His teachings, neglects 
the great salvation offered during this Gospel Age; 
for none will be among the Elect except those who in 
their hearts at least are noble, true and good— conformed 
to the image of God's dear Son.— Rom. 8:29. 

If all could fully realize the influence of our minds 
over our own bodies, as well as their less direct influence 
over the minds and bodies of others, a great Thought 
Reform Movement would speedily begin in the world; 
and especially amongst God's consecrated people. Surely 



such should co-operate with the inspired prayer— "Create 
in me a clean heart [will], O God; and renew a right 
spirit [disposition] within me. ..Then will I teach 
transgressors Thy ways, and sinners shall be converted 
unto Thee."-Psa. 51:10,13. 

May the love of God be more and more shed abroad 
in our hearts, and our consciences be always tender, and 
may we ever abstain from the appearance of evil. May 
we be enabled at all times to be circumspect in our conversation, 
and to scrutinize our thoughts and words and 
doings, to the intent that we may ever be ready and able 
to serve our Heavenly Father and His dear flock, the 
"Feet" members of the Body of Christ! 

Grudge no loving word, my brother, 

As along through life you go, 
To the ones who journey with you; 

If you love them, tell them so.

IN DREAMLESS SLEEP DEAD AWAIT CHRIST'S RETURN 

"If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive 
you unto Myself, that where I am there ye may be also."— 
John 14:3. 

THE ERROR OF supposing that men are 

alive when they are dead lies close to the 

foundation of every theological error the 

world over. We have all erred in taking 

the guess of Plato instead of the Word of 

God, and we can get rid of our difficulties 

and theological entanglements only by retracing 

our steps. Notwithstanding all 

that we have said and written, calling attention 

to the words of the Scriptures, the question 

frequently arises, Do you mean to tell us that our 

friends do not go to Heaven immediately when they die? 

That is exactly what we are endeavoring to demonstrate 
to be the teaching of the Bible. The Bible alone, 
of all religious books, teaches that a dead man is dead, 
and knows nothing, and that his only hope is in the Divine 
arrangement through Christ, by a resurrection of the 
dead— "both of the just and of the unjust."— Acts 24:15. 

When we remember that, according to nearly all the 
religious creeds and theories of the world, 999 out of 
every thousand pass immediately at death into most horrible 
sufferings, one would think that all would be glad 
to promptly accept the Bible testimony, that death is a 
dreamless sleep until the resurrection awakening. Why 
anyone should prefer to think of his friends and neighbors 
and the heathen millions as suffering torture, rather 



R5132: page 355 

than to think of them as being asleep, is beyond our 
comprehension. 

The fact probably is that selfishness has such a hold 
upon the masses that they care and think little respecting 
others than their near relatives and friends; and the 
same selfishness inclines them, with infatuation, to believe 
that they and their relatives, though no better than 
the rest of mankind, are special favorites of Heaven, and 
will be granted the reward of the saints, however unsaintly 
their lives may have been. Some one has suggested 
that the ideal prayer for such is: 
"God bless me and my wife, 
My son John and his wife; 
Us four, and no more." 

In harmony with this we find that when death invades 
a family circle this selfish egotism assumes that the deceased 
is acceptable to God as a saint, and wafted immediately 
to heavenly bliss— regardless of how unsaintly 
had been the life and how little of the spirit of Christ 
was ever manifested. The deception is reinforced by the 
Christian minister called to conduct the funeral service. 
Whatever he may read from the Bible to the effect that, 
if there be no resurrection, they that have fallen asleep 
have perished, his sermon is sure to give the inference 
that the deceased needs no resurrection, because he has 
not died, but has merely been transferred from a lower 
plane of life to a higher one. 

Proof of this is not given and not asked. The proof 
is not given because there is no Scriptural proof to give. 
It is not asked because the people are not sufficiently 
intelligent on religious subjects to demand a reason and 
a proof for what is presented to them. The remedy for 
all this will come when we become more intelligent, 
more reasoning. No minister of Christ should be abashed 
to be asked the reason for his faith. St. Peter exhorted 
that every Christian should be so thoroughly informed 
respecting the Divine Message as to be able to give a 
reason to whoever would ask concerning his own faith 
and his presentations to others. 

Here note our text. In it the Master says not a word 
about our going to Him, but quite the contrary— that he 
will come again and receive us unto Himself. This is 
in full accord with the teachings of the Apostles. Do 
they not tell that at the second coming of Christ the resurrection 
of the Church will be the first item in order; 
that then that which was sown in weakness will be raised 
in power; that sown in dishonor will be raised in glory; 
that sown an animal body will be raised a spirit body; 
and that so we shall ever be with the Lord? Do they not 
tell us that this will be an instantaneous change? Is it 
not styled an awakening from the sleep of death? 

Hearken to St. Paul: "Behold, I show you a mystery; 
we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a 
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump 



(seventh trumpet); for the trumpet shall sound," "and 

the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we which are 

alive and remain shall be caught away together to a 

meeting with the Lord in the air." (I Cor. 15:51,52; I Thess. 4:16,17.) 

How plain, how simple! That will be 

the first meeting of the Church with her Lord. All of 

her members dying before that time will "sleep," while 

those dying since that time will not need to sleep and wait 

for the glorious change. But, says one, does not the second 

coming of Christ take place whenever His holy ones 

die? Does He not immediately come to receive them 

unto Himself? 

Surely only a very lame theory could seek to bolster 
itself up by such a perversion of the Scriptures. If Christ 
were to come every time one of His saintly ones dies, 
would it not mean many comings instead of merely a 
second coming? And even if His faithful were very few 
indeed, does it not seem that this would keep the Redeemer 
busy coming and departing every few minutes? 

Only crass ignorance of the Bible could excuse any 
such misapplication of its teachings. Not merely one 
statement of the Scriptures bears upon this subject, but 
hundreds of statements of Scripture, by Jesus and the 
Apostles; and all these contradict any such thought. 

"NO MAN HATH ASCENDED TO HEAVEN" 

Hearken to Jesus' words, "No man hath ascended up 
to Heaven." (John 3:13.) Only the Son of Man has 
ever been in heaven. He has ascended up where He was 
before, with additional glory and honor. He is now preparing 
a place for His Bride class and preparing the 
Bride class for the place— the place of honor at His own 
right hand. He is overseeing her experiences and causing 
all things to work together for her good, that she at 
His Second Coming may be prepared and be accepted as 
His Bride and granted a share in His glory, honor and 
immortality. 

It is in full harmony with this that a little later on 
the Great Teacher declared that all the dead are in the 
grave, and that at His second advent He will first call 
forth His faithful ones to the perfection of life; and 
later will call forth the remainder of mankind, not as yet 
found worthy of life, that they may have an opportunity, 
a testing as respects their worthiness or unworthiness of 
everlasting life on the human plane. 

Hear His assurance again respecting His faithful 
ones— that they shall share in His resurrection, the Chief 
Resurrection, to glory, honor, immortality, on the spirit 
plane. He said, "Blessed and holy are all they that have 
part in the First Resurrection; they shall be priests unto 
God and Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand 
years."— Rev. 20:6. 

Be it noted that in all these assurances the Church is 
spoken of as a class, all of whom will enter into glory 



R5132: page 356 

together, at Christ's second coming, and not separately, 

as each may die. True, each has an individual trial or 

testing to determine whether or not he or she will be accounted 

worthy, or fitted for a place in the glorious Body 

of Christ, in the glorious Bride company, but the statement 

is repeatedly made that we shall be glorified together, 

that we shall have part in the one resurrection. 

"DAVID NOT ASCENDED TO HEAVEN" 

In full accord with all the foregoing is St. Peter's 
statement on the Day of Pentecost: "For David is not 
ascended into the heavens"; "his sepulchre is with us 
unto this day." (Acts 2:34,29.) St. Peter's words imply 
that if King David had ascended to Heaven he would 
have no sepulchre on earth. Similarly, we might say of 
all of the Prophets, and of all other persons that, if 
once they ascended to the heavenly plane, they could not 
be said to have any sepulchre on earth, for the very 
thought connected with the word sepulchre is that of a 
personality awaiting a resurrection, awaiting deliverance 
from the state and condition of death. So the Scriptures 
always refer, not to a resurrection of the living, which 
would be an absurdity, but to a resurrection of the dead. 

Note the connection in which the Apostle Peter uses 
this expression: "David is not ascended into the heavens." 
He had just called attention to the fact that David 
prophesied of the resurrection of Jesus. In the prophecy 
he personated Jesus, and said, "Thou wilt not leave My 
soul in Sheol (Hades), nor suffer Thine Holy One to see 
corruption." (V. 27.) St. Peter argues that this was 
not true of David, that he did see corruption, that his 
soul was left in Sheol, and is still left there, and will not 
be reclaimed until Messiah, in the resurrection morning, 
shall call him forth. 

"BE WITH ME IN PARADISE" 

But, says some one, did not the dying thief go with 
Jesus to Paradise the very day in which they both died? 
And if so, does not this prove that all in harmony with 
God go to heaven when they die, whatever may be the 
condition of others in death? 

No, we have made a stupid blunder and misinterpretation 
of our Redeemer's dying words to the thief. The 
wrong thought being in our minds we misinterpreted 
in harmony therewith. And our interpretation has done 
an immense amount of harm. Thousands of people have 
been encouraged to continue a life of sin, trusting that 
with their dying breath they may have the opportunity of 
saying, "God be merciful to me," and then be immediately 
ushered into glory, honor and immortality, as joint-heirs 
with the Savior, and in as honorable a station as those 
who "have fought to win the prize, and sailed through 



bloody seas" of trial and persecution and self-denial. 

What a travesty of Justice to suppose such an application 
of this principle! For instance, two ungodly persons 
quarrel. Both draw revolvers and fire; one dies instantly; 
the other, the worse of the two, lives a moment, 
in which he says, "God, be merciful to me." Then, theoretically, 
he passes into glory, while his victim, not having 
the opportunity for a cry for mercy, we are told by 
the same theory, is doomed to endless torture. 

Note the circumstance. (Luke 23:39-43.) Jesus hung 
between two thieves, one of whom joined with the multitude 
in railing at Him as an imposter, crying out, "Yes, 
if you be the Christ, save yourself and us from death." 
The other, of better heart, honestly admitted his own 
guilt and the guilt of his comrade, but defended Jesus, 
declaring that He was innocent. Following this, he addresses 
Jesus. We paraphrase his words: "Lord, I have 
defended you against an unjust attack; remember this 
poor thief if you ever have an opportunity to do a kindness 
to me in return. I heard you before Pilate say that 
you have a Kingdom, but not of this Age; some heavenly 
Kingdom, I therefore presume. I know little about such 
matters, but from what I have seen of you I can well 
surmise you King of such a Kingdom. My request is, 
'Remember me, when Thou comest into Thy Kingdom.'" 

To this Jesus replied, "Verily, verily (so be it, so be 
it, as you have asked)— verily, I say unto thee this day 
(this dark day, in which it would appear that I have not 
a friend in Heaven or on earth— this dark day in which 

R5133 : page 356 

I am crucified as a malefactor, a falsifier and a blasphemer 
—I say unto thee this day), thou shalt be with 
Me in Paradise." 

On the day of their dying all three went to Hades, to 
Sheol, to the tomb, to the state of the dead. The two 
thieves still remain there, and are amongst those mentioned 
by the Prophet Daniel when he refers to those 
"who sleep in the dust of the earth," who will come forth 
in the resurrection morning. (Daniel 12:2.) But Jesus 
arose from Sheol, from Hades, from the tomb, from the 
state of death, on the third day. He had not been to 
Paradise, for Paradise is not even yet in existence. He 
had not been to Heaven, for He had been dead. Let us 
hear His own words to Mary on the morning of His resurrection: 
"I have not yet ascended***to My Father, 
and your Father, to My God, and your God." (John 20:17.) 
Could anything be plainer, simpler, more 
harmonious? 

"DEPART AND BE WITH CHRIST" 

Ah, says one, I have great faith in St. Paul, and I 
remember his words: "I am in a strait between two 
things: having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, 



which is far better." (Phil. 1:23.) If St. Paul expected 
to depart and be with Christ, why is it not reasonable to 
suppose that he did so, and that all others, at least of the 
saintly, at death so depart and pass at once into the presence 
and fellowship of Jesus? 

Yet such a misunderstanding of St. Paul's words and 
thoughts are excusable in view of the general trend of 
Christian thought on this subject for centuries, and in 
view of the error made in this case by the translators. 
We are not faulting the translators, because they had 
the erroneous thought firmly embedded in their minds 
and presumably were trying to make the Apostle here say 
what they conscientiously thought he ought to say. 

But what we are interested in knowing is, What did 
he say on the subject? 

Let us read the Apostle's words critically. He was in 
a strait between two things— whether he would prefer to 
live and suffer further for the Truth's sake, and assist the 
brethren, or whether he would prefer to die and rest 
from his labors. Between these two positions he had no 
choice. But there was a third thing— and if this had 
been a possibility he would have had no difficulty in deciding 
—he had a real, positive desire respecting it; 
neither of the things which were possible to him would 
have stood in comparison at all, this third thing would 
have been so desirable. 

Now what was this third thing? It was not to live 
and suffer and help the brethren, nor was it to die and be 
at rest from his labors. The third thing, according to a 
literal translation, is expressed thus: "I have a desire for 
the returning, and being with Christ, which is far better" 
—far better than either living under the present trying 
conditions or dying, sleeping, resting and waiting for the 
Kingdom. 

But, says one, by what authority do you render the 

R5133 : page 357 

word depart by a word of very opposite meaning, namely 
return. We answer that we give this rendering on the 
authority of the Greek text. The Greek word is analusai; 
it is found in one other place in the Bible, and there it is 
rendered return. In this other case there can be no question 
as to the proper translation.— See Luke 12:36. 

Let us, then, dear fellow-Christians, turn from the 
follies of the Dark Ages and take the inspired words of 
Jesus, the Apostles and Prophets, and have, indeed, 
"beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for the spirit of heaviness," 
in respect to the understanding of the Heavenly 
Father's Program. Thus we will find fulfilled in us more 
and more the Master's prayer: "Sanctify them through 
Thy Truth; Thy Word is Truth." 



R5133 : page 357 



CONSECRATION THE NORMAL ATTITUDE FOR GOD'S INTELLIGENT 
CREATURES 

"The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, 
for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know 
them, because they are spiritually discerned."— 1 Cor. 2:14. 

BY THE EXPRESSION "natural man" we 
understand the Scriptures to mean all who 
have not experienced a change of nature in 
the begetting of the Holy Spirit. All mankind, 
including Adam himself, are natural 
men. Even a perfect human being cannot 
receive the deep spiritual truths which God 
reveals to His consecrated children through 
the Holy Spirit. 

Whoever is desirous of being in harmony 
with God and is endeavoring to become so, even though 
he be not justified, is looking forward to full justification. 
If he continue in this course, he will eventually become 
justified— if not at the present time, then during Messiah's 
reign. But in this Age, none can attain to full justification 
except by faith in the blood of Christ, which leads its 
possessor to make a complete consecration of himself to 
God, by the intervention of our Lord Jesus as Advocate, 
who imputes to him a sufficiency of His merit to make up 
for his deficiency. 

Since our Lord imputes His merit only to those who 
make a full consecration of themselves, one who merely 
believes in the Savior and wishes to do right, cannot at 
this time enter into full peace with God. He receives 
only a measure of peace and justification; for those alone 
who are fully absolved from sin and presented by the 
Advocate can be accepted by the Father— these alone are 
fully justified in the Father's sight. 

Some speak of the sanctified as if these were no longer 
justified. The fact is that only the sanctified can be said 
to be fully justified; and they must maintain their justification 
with God, else they could never make their calling 
and election sure. 

It is very important to observe the sharp outlines and 
distinctions which the Scriptures establish. According to 
these outlines, the Holy Spirit is given only in a very 
special manner, during a very special Age, for a very 
special purpose. The distinction is absolute and positive 
in every sense of the word. Only those begotten of the 
Father have His Spirit, which is the Spirit of the Son; 
and those alone who have that Spirit are begotten to the 
new nature. 

GOOD TRAITS OF CHARACTER NOT A PROOF OF CONSECRATION 

In times past we did not clearly distinguish the Lord's 
people from the world. Whenever we met a man with 
kind, gentle manners, whether an infidel, a Brahman, a 



Mohammedan, a Presbyterian, a Methodist or merely one 
of the world, we said to ourself, "Here is a man who has 
the Spirit of the Lord." Then, we did not know what we 
were talking about; now, we can recognize the difference. 
We are certainly glad to acknowledge good traits of character 
in heathen as well as Christians, but we are not to 
accept gentleness and kindness of manner as evidence 
that their possessor has the Holy Spirit. 

We have all seen people who have very proper sentiments 
of justice on some subjects, who are yet manifestly 
not God's people, begotten of the Holy Spirit. Such 
persons are usually fine characters. Nevertheless, their 
conscientiousness causes them to admit that they are sinners 
and have need of Divine forgiveness. We are glad 
that there are such people, and we should encourage 
rather than discourage them. 

The explanation of this condition of affairs is that 
these fine characters are not so fallen as some others. 
God made man in His own image and likeness. With the 
fall of man came the impairment of that godlike disposition, 
but the image of God is not altogether lost. For our 
part, we wish to show that our Redeemer is the only channel 
for that forgiveness, the need of which they recognize, 
and that the only condition of their full acceptance with 
God is the entire consecration of all that they possess to 
the service of the Lord. 

On one occasion our Lord said, "No man can come 
unto Me, except the Father which sent Me draw him." 
(John 6:44.) No one will receive the Holy Spirit 
without having been drawn to Christ, but some may 
be drawn without receiving the Holy Spirit. Possibly 
in these persons that endowment which God gave 
to Adam and pronounced "very good" has been less impaired 
by the fall than it has been in others. Such naturally 
desire to have God's approval and the blessings 
which He is willing to give to those who seek Him. 

Having this disposition, such persons are said to be 
drawn of God. But the Father points them to the Son, 
through the knowledge of simple truths. For instance, 
they may be influenced through hearing a hymn sung; 
such as, 

"There is a fountain filled with blood, 

Drawn from Immanuel's veins; 
And sinners plunged beneath that flood 
Lose all their guilty stains." 

These words contain the truth of God to any one who 
is in a right condition of heart, and are a very valuable 
hint as to the way to approach God. If those who are 
seeking to know God desire to inquire further on the subject, 
they will probably be led to consult with some of the 
children of God. 

Upon the inquiry of those under the conviction of sin 
as to what must be done to be saved, we tell them, "Believe 
on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." 
(Acts 16:31.) Make a full consecration of your life unto 
God, and thus you may become a son of God. If any one 



is obedient to the drawing, the next step for him to take 
is to say, "I give myself to the Lord and trust Him fully, 
for I realize how unworthy I am." 

The course which we are describing is that which one 
must follow in order to be acceptable to God. But first 
of all, he must desire to approach the Lord. If we should 
find any one who is totally depraved, there would be no 
use to attempt to draw such a one toward righteousness, 

R5134: page 358 

Truth and God. Even those who have the right attitude 
of mind may not be equally impressed at all times. It may 
be that some circumstance must awaken them to the need 
of consecration before they will take the step which will 
enable them to become sons of God.— Rom. 12:1,2. 

THE HIGH CALLING NOT FOR ALL 

No man, however, takes this step of consecration unless 
he is called of God. There must be the call, or invitation, 
as there was with Aaron and with our Lord Jesus 
Christ. (Heb. 5:4,5.) This call comes through the 
proclamation of the Gospel. Each must hear for himself 
before he can accept. "And how shall they hear without 
a preacher?" (Rom. 10:14.) So then, it is for God to 
begin the work with the unjustified by drawing them to 
Christ for justification; and it is for our Lord Jesus Christ 
to continue this work with the consecrated. Furthermore, 
it is the privilege of all who come into God's family to 
proclaim these truths to others, to set forth the terms by 
which those who receive the call may accept it, while still 
"it is called today," before this Age of sacrifice ends.— 
Heb. 4:7; 2 Cor. 6:2. 

None come to God in this Gospel Age except those who 
make a sacrifice. Others may turn toward God; they may 
look toward God; they may be converted from a wicked 
life to a better one. But none except the class who are 
adopted into God's family are begotten of the Holy Spirit. 
The invitation of this Age is NOT an invitation to do the 
best one can; we are all called in the one hope of our calling. 
(Eph. 4:4.) "Gather My saints together unto Me, 
saith the Lord, those who have made a Covenant with Me 
by sacrifice."— Psa. 50:5. 

It is good not to do wrong. But more than a righteous 
life is required of those who would be sons of God. Consecration 
has always been proper; it is the normal attitude 
for all of God's intelligent creatures. The Creator is the 
One to whom all are properly under obligations for every 
blessing which they enjoy; and heart, mind, tongue and 
hand should be ready for consecration to do the Father's 
will. Whether angels or men or New Creatures in Christ 
—all should be in this attitude. 

Since consecration is the only reasonable attitude, then, 
when the one hundred and forty-four thousand of the 
Elect Church shall have passed their testing it will still 



be appropriate for God to permit people to consecrate, 
and to be pleased with their consecration. Therefore, we 
may expect that, in the end of the reign of Christ, all the 
worthy ones shall have made consecration to God. It 
was thus in the Jewish Age, although there was no "high 
calling" then, nor privilege to understand the deep things 
of God. 

The privilege of becoming joint-heirs with Christ will 
end as soon as the Elect number is completed. During 
the thousand years of Christ's reign, those who consecrate 
will come to understand all human things; but not being 
begotten of the Holy Spirit, they cannot understand the 
things of the Spirit. 

KNOWLEDGE OF DEEP THINGS A GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT 

We believe that there are some now living, perhaps a 
good many, who are consecrated to God and whose consecration 
has been accepted, but who are not in the light 
of Present Truth. This number may include some who 
are what the Scriptures term "babes" in Christ, and others 
to whom the Scriptures refer as the "great multitude." 
(Heb. 5:12-14; I Pet. 2:2; Rev. 7:9.) The "foolish 
virgin" class are probably in very large number all around 
us. The fact that there are some of these in Babylon 
seems to be indicated by the command, "Come out of her, 
My people." (Rev. 18:4.) If they are in Babylon, their 
presence there shows that they are not yet well developed; 
and if they are God's people, they are not enjoying the 
full strength of Present Truth, although Spirit-begotten. 

This fact does not signify that they may not receive 
Present Truth. On the contrary, we think it quite likely 
that some may be helped out of Babylon and into a better 
understanding of the Divine Plan; for some of the babes 
may be strengthened, built up, to a full appreciation of 
the things of the Spirit. We are to have in mind the fact 
that God has so arranged that "the deep things of God" 
cannot be known instantaneously; this knowledge comes 
gradually as an evidence of faithfulness to God. 

Those who have not yet learned fully to reverence God 
and who have not yet made progress in the development 
of the graces and fruits of the Spirit cannot expect to 
understand the deep things of God. It is our duty and 
privilege, not only to assist these brethren, but to build 
one another up and to strengthen one another. Let us 
see that we do these things. 



R5134: page 358 

FORGIVE SEVENTY TIMES SEVEN 
-DECEMBER 15.-MATTHEW 18:15-35.- 
"Be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving each 



other, even as God, for Christ's sake, forgave you."— Eph. 4:32. 

TO LEARN TODAY'S lesson well means a 
blessing for life to every true Christian, 
and might be said to ensure him eternal 
life— so fully would he be in accord with 
the Divine requirements. The lesson relates 
specially to the consecrated, to the 
members of the Body of Christ, the Church, 
of which He is the Head, although application, 
of course, may be made by others with 
profit. 

The Master's rule for His followers is, If a brother 
injure you, go to him alone with the matter, striving to 
reach an agreement, an understanding. The probability 
is that misunderstanding is all that there is of it. But if 
this does not suffice and you consider the matter serious 
enough, ask two others to accompany you to the offender, 
without explaining to them the mission— leave their 
minds free to hear the case and to advise yourself and 
the person injuring. 

The agreement of these brethren and their advice 
should be followed by both. If they disagree with you, 
you should acknowledge that you have erred and that the 
matter is evidently susceptible of this construction. If 
they agree with you, and your opponent refuses to heed 
their counsel and persists in doing you injury, and you 
still think it of sufficient importance to trouble the 
Church with the matter, you are then at liberty so to do. 
The Church's decision of the question is to be final, binding 
upon both. The one refusing to hear the Church is to 
be treated as an outsider, not in the sense of doing him 
injury, but abstaining from appointing him to any position, 
or honor in the Church, until his course shall be 
changed. How simple the Divine direction; what a blessing 
would come from following it! 

FORGIVE "SEVENTY TIMES SEVEN" 

St. Peter put a hypothetical question, of how many 
times a brother might trespass and ask forgiveness and 

R5134: page 359 

yet be forgiven— would seven times be the limit? The 

Master practically declared that there could be no limit, 

that any brother confessing his fault and asking forgiveness 

must be forgiven, if it should recur four hundred 

and ninety times. There is no other position left; forgiveness 

is obligatory when asked for. We must not be 

too much afraid of the consequences of following the 

Master's direction; we must put the responsibility of the 

matter with Him, assured that His wisdom has not misdirected 

us. 

Then our Lord gave a parable, to illustrate this matter, 
in respect to the Kingdom of Heaven class— the 



Church in the present embryotic condition. A certain 
king had a reckoning with his servants, and squared up 
all accounts. Amongst the others, one owed him ten thousand 
talents. His master commanded him to be sold, and 
his wife and all that he had, until the payment should be 
made. But the servant fell down at his master's feet and 
besought him to have compassion on him and he would 
pay the debt. And the master had compassion on him and 
discontinued further prosecution on account of the debt. 

"OWED HIM A HUNDRED PENCE" 

The servant thus released went out and began to look 
up some of those who were indebted to him, and found a 
fellow-servant who owed him a hundred pence, a very 
insignificant sum in comparison to the one which he had 
owed the master. He took his fellow-servant by the 
throat, saying, "Pay me the hundred pence thou owest." 
His fellow-servant fell at his feet and besought mercy, 
saying, "Have patience with me, and I will pay thee 
all." But he would not delay, and cast him into prison 
till the debt should be paid. The matter finally reached 
the ears of the master, who called him and said, 
"Thou wicked servant! I released thee from the penalty 
of thy debt because thou didst entreat me! thou shouldst 
also have had mercy upon thy fellow-servant, even as I 
had pity upon thee." And he was angry, and delivered 
him to punishment till he should pay all that was due. 

AN IMPORTANT LESSON HERE 

What is the lesson? It is that we should have compassion 
upon one another, even as we desire that God for 
Christ's sake should have compassion upon us. The lesson 

R5135 : page 359 

is well expressed in our text. We should be kind one 

to another, tender-hearted— even as God also in Christ 

forgave us— and continues to forgive our trespasses day 

by day. The trespasses of others against us are trifling 

indeed in comparison to our obligations to the Lord. We 

should therefore be very willing to forgive all who ask 

us— "until seventy times seven." In thus exercising 

mercy we will be copying the Divine character. The influence 

upon our hearts and lives will be ennobling. Our 

Lord Jesus is the express image of the Father's person, 

and we in copying the qualities of generosity and Love 

become more Christlike, and therefore more Godlike. 

SO ALSO DID GOD DO UNTO YOU 

Our Lord Jesus explains that His parable teaches the 
principles along which the Heavenly Father deals with 
the members of the Body of Christ, which is the Church. 
If they are harsh and unsympathetic, if they hold their 



brethren to a strict account along lines of justice, then 
the Heavenly Father will so deal with them, and will 
hold them to account for all their shortcomings. It 
would seem that if God's people would realize the force 
of this lesson, the practice of forgiving the brethren of 
their trespasses and shortcomings would very generously 
and very generally be brought into play, for who of us 
could afford to have the Heavenly Father exact of us a 
full penalty for every imperfection, and refuse to remit 
any of the same? 

We show our appreciation of God's mercy toward us 
by schooling ourselves in His character and becoming 
more and more merciful and generous toward all the 
Household of Faith. And if merciful toward the 
brethren, naturally we would be generous also toward all 
men. In other words, as we remember and appreciate 
our own weaknesses and blemishes, it will make us sympathetic 
with the brethren and with all mankind. And 
mercy, generosity, sympathy, God delights in. Such as 
cultivate these graces of the Spirit will be pleasing in the 
Lord's sight, and they will thereby be fitted and prepared 
to have a share with Jesus in His Throne of Glory; 
for that great Messianic Kingdom will be established for 
the very purpose of showing mercy unto thousands of 
mankind who will return to Divine favor and blessing, 
under clearer knowledge and with the assistance that will 
then be afforded. 

ADAM'S SIN IS NOT MEANT 

We are not to understand this parable to refer to 
Divine forgiveness of original sin. The sin of Adam is 
not forgiven simply because we cry for mercy. Adam 
and the entire race might have called for mercy, and 
would have received none, except in the Divine way- 
through Jesus— through faith in His blood. Nor could 
this forgiveness be granted until Jesus had finished His 
sacrifice and ascended up on high, and there appeared in 
the presence of God on behalf of those coming to the 
Father through His merit. 

This parable refers entirely to subsequent sins— sins 
referred to in our Lord's prayer, "Forgive us our trespasses, 
as we forgive them that trespass against us." 
This is shown also by the fact that the parable speaks 
of these as servants, whereas the world, as sinners, are 
not God's servants, but aliens, strangers, foreigners. The 
only ones whom God will recognize as servants are such 
as have come back into relationship with Him through 
Jesus— through faith and consecration. It is these who 
are servants of God and who are required to have mercy 
upon their fellow-servants— upon other brethren. 

Each and every one of the New Creatures, sons of 
God, accepted through the merit of Jesus, is held 
responsible for his own weaknesses; but Divine Power 
has provided for the cancellation of these freely for 
Christ's sake, upon their acknowledgment and request for 



forgiveness. But the forgiving of these trespasses of 
God's children is made dependent upon their having a 
spirit of forgiveness toward the brethren, for "if ye do 
not from the heart forgive one another's trespasses, 
neither will your Heavenly Father forgive you." "With 
what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with 
what measure" of benevolence ye mete out to others, the 
same shall be meted out to you. How wonderful are the 
Divine arrangements! How blessed, how profitable to us, 
how helpful to us in our preparation for the Kingdom!

TRULY BEAUTIFUL 

Beautiful hands are they that do 

The work of the noble, good and true, 

Busy for them the long day through; 

Beautiful faces— they that wear 

The light of a pleasing spirit there, 

It matters little if dark or fair; 

And truly beautiful in God's sight, 

Are the precious souls who love the right.

"UNTO US A SON IS GIVEN" 

-DECEMBER 22. -ISAIAH 9:1-7.- 

"Unto us a Child is born; unto 
us a Son is given."— Verse 6. 

TODAY'S STUDY relates to a subject which 

has thrilled the civilized world for centuries 

—a subject which will never grow old— 

a subject which, on the contrary, shall to 

all eternity be a theme of angels and of 

men. The birth of Jesus, to be rightly 

understood and esteemed, must be considered 

from the standpoint of a Gift of Love 

Divine. Any other view of the matter is 

merely the casket without the jewel. The 

Scriptures give us the key to the thought: "God so loved 

the world that He gave His Only Begotten Son, that whosoever 

believeth on Him should not perish, but have everlasting 

life. "-John 3:16. 

The world was under sentence of death; mankind 
had been dying for more than four thousand years. God 
had pitied humanity from the first. Yea, before sin entered, 
Divine Wisdom saw the end, and would not have 
created man, or would not have permitted the condition 



which led to sin and the sentence of death, had Divine 
Wisdom not foreseen and arranged in advance for human 
Redemption. 

God had purposely arranged the matter so that it 
would require the death of a perfect man to redeem 
Adam and the race which lost life in and through him. 
God knew from the beginning that no such perfect man 
could be found, because all men were of Adamic stock 
and had a share in Adamic weakness, imperfection and 
condemnation. From the beginning God in the Divine 
Plan contemplated that the Only Begotten of the Father, 
the Logos, the active Agent of Divinity in the work of 
Creation, should be granted the great privilege of being 
man's Redeemer, and thereby securing a great reward— 
"Glory, honor and immortality," the Divine nature, 
through a resurrection from the dead. 

THE FIRST STEP OF REDEMPTION 

The primary step in man's recovery necessarily was 
that the Logos should be made flesh and dwell amongst us 
and taste death, by the grace of God, for every man. 
(John 1:14; Heb. 2:9.) It is this first step that we celebrate 
at this season of the year— the birth of Jesus. He 
who was rich, for our sakes became poor, that we through 
His poverty might be reclaimed. 

Today's study points out that the ministry of Jesus 
would be in Galilee; that those people of the Jews who at 
the time were supposed to be in greatest darkness would 
see the great Light of Divine Truth, as represented in 
Jesus and His ministry. This had a primary fulfilment 
in Galilee, where the major portion of the mighty works 
of Jesus were performed. But its real fulfilment lies in 
the future, when the great light of the Millennial Kingdom, 
"the Sun of Righteousness, shall arise with 
healing in its beams." Before that glorious Sun, sorrow 
and sighing will flee away; ignorance and superstition 
will vanish; sin and darkness will be no more; every 
knee will bow and every tongue will confess. Jesus is the 
great Center of that Sun of Righteousness, but, as He 
points out, the Bride class, in process of selection during 
this Age, is to be with Him in the Morning, shining 
forth His glory. They shall sit with Him in His Throne. 
After the "Wheat" of this Age is gathered into the 
"garner" by the power of the First Resurrection, the 
Bride of Christ will shine forth with the Bridegroom, to 
heal earth's sorrows and to scatter earth's night. (Matt. 13:43.) 
All this will come to us because "unto us a 

Child is born, unto us a Son is given;" because "the Government 
shall rest upon His shoulders"; because "His 
name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, the Mighty, 
Mighty One, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace." 

THE FALL OF BABYLON 

We are to understand verses 3 to 5 as referring, not 



to Natural Israel, but to Spiritual Israel— nominal. The 
holy nation has phenomenally increased without increasing 
the joy. There are many false children in the nominal 
family of God; there are many "tares" in the wheatfield. 
But in the Harvest time of this Age there will be 
a joy; the faithful "will rejoice as they that divide the 
spoil." The burdensome yoke of the creedal superstitions 
will be broken, and the rod of the oppressor, Satan, 
will be broken as in the day of Midian, when Gideon with 
his little band put to flight the army of the Midianites 
and set the people free. Verse 5 intimates that the fall 
of Babylon and the breaking of the yoke and the rod will 
be in the great "time of trouble." "For all the armor 
of the armed men and the turmoil and the garments 
rolled in blood shall even be for burning, for fuel of fire."

MESSIAH'S MANY TITLES 

Our great Redeemer, highly exalted, is eventually to 
bear many titles in commemoration of the many wonderful 
Offices He will fill and services He will accomplish. 
But these are yet future. His great work in the past, the 
Redemption work, was the foundation of all His future 
work. On account of His faithfulness He will have a 
right to assume these various Offices and use these various 
powers; and as each comes into exercise it will 
be used by Jesus. The right to govern the world is His 
since He died on our behalf, but He awaits the Father's 
time for taking to Himself His glorious power to reign; 
and the Government must come to Him before He can 
begin to fulfil the various titles. 

First of all, His revelation to the world will be as the 
Wonderful One, the embodiment, the Expression, of 
Divine Justice, Divine Love, Divine Wisdom and Divine 
Power. As yet the world knoweth Him not. He will be 
revealed to mankind "in flaming fire" in the time of 
trouble, and subsequently, in the rescue work of His 
Millennial Kingdom. 

He will be the world's Counselor, to give assistance, 
guidance, direction, whereby they may return through 
Restitution into harmony with Jehovah and to the enjoyment 
of the blessings provided through Redemption. As 
the Head of the Church He has been her Counselor, but 
our text refers to Him as the Great King or Governor 
of the world, and as the world's Instructor, the Great 
Prophet, or Teacher, whom God promised through Moses. 

His title, The Mighty God, or Mighty, Mighty One, 
will be recognized then, on earth, as well as in Heaven— 
"that Him hath God set forth to be a Prince and a 
Savior, to grant repentance and remission of sins to 
Israel," and "to all that are afar off."— Acts 5:31; 2:39. 

The title, The Everlasting Father, will apply to Him 
as the Life-Giver of the world, during the thousand years 
of His reign. In all that time He will be giving "life 



more abundant" to mankind— everlasting life to all who 
will obey Him— therefore His title, The Everlasting 
Father, or the Father who will give everlasting life to 
humanity. All the world of mankind, regenerated on 
the human plane, will obtain their right to everlasting life 
as human beings in an earthly Paradise from their Redeemer, 
who will then be their King. Not so the Church, 
for Jesus is not the Church's Everlasting Father. On 
the contrary, St. Peter declares "The God and Father of 
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ hath begotten us again 
to a hope of life." 

R5136 : page 361 

His title, The Prince of Peace, will not apply to Him 
at the beginning of His reign, when He will be breaking 
in pieces as a potter's vessel every human system out of 
accord with the Divine standards (Rev. 2:27; Psa. 2:9), 
but true peace shall speedily be established, and He shall 
be known as The Prince of Peace, and One whose reign 
will be undisputed and unmolested. "Of the increase of 
His Government and of peace there shall be no end"; 
there will be no rebellion; His Kingdom will not pass 
away. When His reign shall terminate finally, at the 
close of the thousand years, it will be because "He will 
deliver the Kingdom over to God, even the Father," that 
He may be the Great All in All. 

"UPON THE THRONE OF DAVID" 

Messiah's Kingdom is styled "the Throne of David" 
for two reasons: first, the name David signifies Beloved, 
and the Messiah, as the Beloved of God, of the Father, is 
the Antitype of David, even as Messiah's Kingdom will 
be the Antitype of David's kingdom. David merely "sat 
upon the throne of the Kingdom of the Lord"; it was not 
his. So the Greater than David will sit upon the 
Throne of the Kingdom of Jehovah, to order it and to 
establish it to completion, during the thousand years of 
His reign. Then He will deliver it up. "The zeal (love) 
of Jehovah of Hosts will perform this," operating through 
Messiah.

KNOW OF THE DOCTRINE 

-DECEMBER 29. -JOHN 7:17.- 

"If any man willeth to do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, 
whether it be of God, or whether I speak of Myself."— John 7:17. 

WE are living in a day when the very word doctrine 
seems to be offensive to the majority 



of Christian people. Each denomination 

realizes that its own system of doctrines 

is imperfect, unsatisfactory, undefendable. 

And the same is believed in respect to all 

other doctrines. Hence by mutual consent 

Christian people seem disposed to henceforth 

and forever ignore doctrines; for they 

believe that, if after nineteen centuries 

they are thus confused, the matter never was clear and 

never will be clear to anybody. 

All this is a great mistake; the doctrines of Christ, 
as presented by the Great Teacher and His Apostles, was 
a great message, of which none of them were ashamed. 
The difficulty with the Lord's people today is that we 
gradually fell away from those doctrines— we gradually 
put darkness for light and light for darkness, and thus 
gradually got into the spirit of Babylon, and into the 
spirit of bondage to human traditions and creeds. Instead 
of shunning doctrines, we should realize that they 
are the very things needed to cause the scattering of our 
darkness and superstitions, and to draw all of God's people 
nearer together. 

The doctrines of Christ and the Apostles is what we 
need to inspire us to break down all our creed fences, 
which so long have separated us as God's people, the 
one from the other, in various denominational folds, all 
of which are contrary to the Divine arrangement; for 

R5137 : page 361 

God has but the one fold for all His "sheep" of this 
Age, as He will have another fold for the Restitution 
"sheep" of the next Age— the Messianic Kingdom Age. 

"ONE LORD, ONE FAITH, ONE BAPTISM" 

Can we doubt that if as God's people we put away 
sectarianism and the creed spectacles of our forefathers, 
and if we go with pure, sincere hearts to the Lord and His 
Word, we will there find again the "one Lord, one Faith, 
one Baptism, one God and Father over all, and one Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ," and "one Church of the First-Born, 
whose names are written in heaven"? (Eph. 4:5,6; 
Heb. 12:23.) Let us hearken to the words: "Cast not 
away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense 
of reward," "But remember the former days, in 
which, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; partly 
whilst ye were made a gazing stock both by reproaches 
and by afflictions; and partly whilst ye became companions 
of them that were so used." "For ye have need of 
patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye 
might receive the promise." (Heb. 10:35,32,33,36.) 

The time seems long to all of us, even though we remember 
that "a day with the Lord is as a thousand years." 
When we think of the fact that it is thirty-nine hundred 
years since God's promise to Abraham, that his Seed 



should bless all the families of the earth— when we think 
of the fact that Israel did not receive that great privilege 
of being the spiritual Seed from which primarily that 
blessing should go forth, and that the "elect" are receiving 
it; when we think of the fact that God has been 
nearly nineteen centuries in selecting the "elect" from 
Israel and from all nations, it is enough to stagger our 
faith unless we hold firmly to the Divine promise and 
remember that God confirmed it with an Oath. By these 
two immutable, unchangeable things, the Divine Word 
and the Divine Oath, we know that the Seed of Abraham 
is to be developed, and that eventually it is to bless all the 
families of the earth. It is the Divine will that we allow 
our faith in this great promise of God to be "an anchor 
to our souls, sure and steadfast, entering into that within 
the veil. "-Heb. 6:19. 

THE DOCTRINES OF CHRIST 

What we all need as God's people is to put away 
human theories and other gospels and take hold afresh 
on the Gospel of Christ. These other gospels are other 
messages of hope, aside from the one which the Bible 
presents. For instance, Theosophy is one of these; Evolution 
is another; New Theology is another. These all 
hold out a different gospel from that which Jesus and the 
Apostles presented; the one that was given to us for our 
sanctification, and through the holding fast of which, 
and the obedience to The Faith, we are to be saved and 
given a share with Messiah in His glorious Empire of 
the world. 

The doctrines of Christ mean those doctrines presented 
in the Bible by Jesus and His mouthpieces, the 
Apostles. These doctrines relate to the Church and to 
the world, and God's blessing for each; these doctrines 
relate to sin and its forgiveness; the terms of that forgiveness, 
the basis of that forgiveness— the death of 
Jesus— and the hope of that forgiveness, release from 
Divine condemnation, fellowship with God, and everlasting 
life obtained through resurrection of the dead. 

A PREREQUISITE TO KNOWLEDGE 

But some one will inquire, Why is it so difficult to 
understand the doctrines of Christ? Why are there six 
hundred different denominations of Christians? Why do 
they all so misunderstand the matter— that these different 
denominations have resulted from the differences of 

R5137 : page 362 

theory respecting the teachings of the Bible? The simple 
explanation is that, shortly after the death of the 
Apostles when the Church began to be in a measure of 
prosperity, the Adversary came in and sowed the seeds 
of false doctrines, using human lips and human pens in 



his service, through pride and ambition. The darkness 
became so great that, looking back today, we speak of 
the period as the "Dark Ages." 

The various denominations of Christendom are evidences 
of honesty, perseverance and love of the Truth, 
because our forefathers, who made these creeds, were 
each trying to get more and more out of the dark and 
back to the "True Light." They all made the mistake, 
however, of holding too much to the creeds and theories 
of the past. Let us not make the same mistake; let us 
cut loose entirely from every authority outside the Word 
of God. Whoever can help us understand God's Word 
—we should be glad to have his assistance; but we cannot 
acknowledge as inspired or authoritative the teachings 
of the "Fathers" of the early times, however conscientious 
they may have been, because we cannot recognize 
that there were any such authorized successors to 
the Apostles. 

God, who foretold through the Prophets this long 
period of darkness, and who has blessed and guided His 
saintly children throughout it, without removing all of 
their blindness, has promised that with the end of this 
Age will come a great blessing and enlightenment upon 
His people, when the "wise virgins" will find their lamps 
burning brightly, and be able to understand and appreciate 
the deep things of God: "The wise shall understand, 
but none of the wicked shall understand." In the 
end of this Age the curtain was to be drawn, and the 
"true light" was to shine forth, scattering all the darkness. 
We are in the dawning of this New Age today, 
and therefore may see much more clearly than did our 
forefathers, the Divine character and Plan for human 
salvation. 

WILLETH TO DO HIS WILL 

Today's study is a message from the Master's own 
lips. He gives us the key to a clear knowledge of His 
doctrines, namely, that the student must be fully consecrated 
to God and fully desirous of knowing His Will 
and His Plan. In order to see light in God's light— to 
see the Truth, from the Divine standpoint of the Divine 
revelation, we must draw near to God in the spirit of our 
minds, consecrated in our heart. We must will to do His 
will. 

But what does this mean? What is it to will to do 
His will? God's will represents actual perfection of 
thought and word and deed, toward God, toward our 
fellows in the Body of Christ, and toward all mankind. 
This is the Divine Standard set up, but we are no more 
able to fulfil its demands than were the Jews. As St. 
Paul declares, "We cannot do the things that we would." 
Weakness of the flesh, frailty and imperfection, we all 
have with the world; the best that we can do is to will to 
do right, and to the best of our ability carry out that 
covenant with the Lord to do His will. At the very best 



all will come short of perfection. 

But for those who have come into harmony with God, 
through Christ— for those who have made a covenant 
with Him by sacrifice— for those who have Jesus for 
their Advocate, a provision has been made, whereby the 
willing, all desiring to do the Divine will, and manifesting 
endeavors so to do, are counted as righteous— as 
though they did the Divine will perfectly. This class, in 
the Scriptures, is known as the "saints"; they are the 
prospective members of the Body of Christ. It is to these 
that the promises of our text apply, that they shall know 
to do the Divine will, shall know whether Jesus merely 
made up these teachings of Himself, or whether He was 
the active agent of Jehovah in what He did and in what 
He taught. 

At the close of the year, and on the threshhold of 
another, shall we not determine to give our hearts, our 
wills, fully to the Lord— determine in our wills to do 
God's will? If so, following the instructions of the Word 
of God during the coming year, we shall doubtless be 
blessed and enabled fully to know, to appreciate, to understand, 
the doctrines of Christ— the deep things of God, 
which are revealed to this class by the Spirit of God. 



R5136 : page 362 

TWO YEARS MORE 

Two years more, and I shall see Him, whom not having 

seen I love, 
This grand prospect, daily, hourly, holds my heart on things 

above; 
Now by faith, I'm pressing onward in the footsteps of my 

Lord, 
Rough the pathway, steep and narrow, 'tis the path my Master 

trod. 

Oh, the rapture of that meeting, Oh, what ecstasy 'twill 

bring, 
When with open, perfect vision I shall gaze upon my King ! 
I shall feast upon the beauty of the One I love so well, 
And with tongue no longer stammering, all my love for Him 

I'll tell. 

Two years, and I'll see the Father, when the Son with loving 

pride, 
Shall conduct me to His presence, with the rest of His dear 

Bride. 
What a sense of awe will fill me, as with unveiled face I 

gaze 
On that grand and mighty Being, whom all Heaven unites to 

praise! 

Shall I know myself, I wonder, when He takes me to His 



heart, 
And of all that heavenly glory I shall find myself a part? 
Heaven not complete without me, mine, eternities of bliss? 
Oh, my soul, thou must not stagger, for thy God hath 

promised this! 

Oft a secret fear assails me, that I may be left behind; 
Then I bid my soul take courage, 'tis that Enemy of mine! 
He would use to cause my downfall censure sharp, or 

flattering breath, 
For he hates God's holy children with a hatred strong as 

death. 

But my Father will not leave me to his mercy, but prepare 
Heavenly armor to protect me, which, if I will always wear, 
Every fight will prove me victor, as I wield the two-edged 

Sword, 
World and flesh and powers of evil, all must fall before His 

Word! 

Oh, my soul, thy life dependeth on thy faithfulness alone; 
While the days and hours are passing, art thou holding fast 

thy crown? 
Keep this thought before thee always, let it daily strengthen 

thee, 
"Two years more decides forever thine eternal destiny!" 

Then the thought, Oh! how it thrills me, any day He may 

send word— 
"Child, thy work on earth is finished, enter into thy reward." 
But, if I need further testings, crosses heavy, trial sore, 
I can wait, for at the longest, it is only two years more! 

—Unknown.

INTERESTING QUESTIONS 

CAN ANY OF THE GREAT COMPANY BE OF THE 
RESTITUTION CLASS? 

Question.— Can any of the Great Company become 
members of the Restitution class? 

Answer.— We understand that the terms under which 
any are begotten of the Holy Spirit are that they renounce, 
give up, the human nature. When God accepts 
their consecration and takes such into Covenant relationship 
with Himself, He indicates that relationship by 
begetting them of the Holy Spirit. The only class into 
which these can come for future life is that of spirit or 
heavenly beings. If they live up to all the terms and 
conditions of their sacrifice, then they will have the very 
fullest blessing which God has provided for the loyal 
and to which He has called them. But for those who 



fail to live up to the highest standard— that of walking 
in the footsteps of Jesus— the arrangement seems to be 
that they shall at least prove themselves loyal, even if not 
to the same degree as their brethren. 

This loyalty will be tested in the great time of trouble 
through which the Great Company will go. Then if they 
fail to prove their loyalty, apparently they will lose that 
life in the Second Death. But if they give up the earthly 
life and manifest loyalty to the Lord, even though they 
may never give it up willingly, but merely when brought 
to straits, then they will have life on the spirit plane. 

The merit of Christ, which has been under embargo, 
as it were, must all be released before the Restitution 
work can begin. In other words, the Little Flock must 
have been "changed" and the Great Company must have 
suffered destruction of the flesh, before the merit can 
again be free in the hands of Justice, ready to be given to 
the world in Restitution. 

Therefore, our answer would be, We cannot expect 
the Spirit-begotten ones to pass through the time of 
trouble in the end of this Age and to live on during the 
Millennial Age; for they belong to the Church of the 
First-borns, all of whom must be born before the after-borns 
can be brought forth. The after-borns will be the 
world in the Restitution. 



FIFTH SUNDAY CONVENTIONS 

Question.— Are Fifth Sunday Conventions advantageous? 

Answer.— We are perplexed how to answer this question, 
and must leave the answering of it to each 
Class for itself, without any particular advice even. 
From some we have heard good reports with blessings 
secured. From others we have had reports to the contrary. 
Those who have had practical experience with 
these Conventions should decide for themselves. We 
have had no experience in this direction. 



HOW TREAT "THE MENACE" 

Question. -How should the WATCH TOWER readers 
treat "The Menace?" 

Answer.— This is a free country and everyone has a 
right to follow that course which he believes will be most 
to the Lord's glory and most to the advancement and the 
good of his fellow-men. The Editor of "The Menace" 
is merely exercising his rights. As for the WATCH 
TOWER, it pursues a different course without criticizing 
others. Perhaps the Lord may have a work for "The 
Menace" for all we know. Our judgment is that His 
work for us is in a different direction and we exhort all 
the WATCH TOWER readers to reserve all their might and 



physical strength for the promulgation of the Truth as the 
Lord has been granting us to see it within the last forty 
years in the WATCH TOWER. It is our mission to preach 
the Word— the Gospel of the Kingdom. We cannot do 
all that we would in this direction, and hence have no 
time to devote to other matters, political, social, etc.

INTERESTING LETTERS 

DEARLY BELOVED BROTHER AND PASTOR:- 

I have read for the second time the article in the October 
1, 1912, TOWER, "Fight the Good Fight," and how it thrills my 
heart to renewed zeal and determination to fight the good 
fight, realizing more than ever that I fight for myself, 
through the power of Jesus. I shall keep the TOWER in my 
desk ready for re-reading at spare moments. 

My heart goes out in gratitude to our dear Father, and 
to our Savior and Advocate for these wonderful helps that 
come as refreshing and energizing dew drops upon our 
thirsting souls. The Truth is new and fresh every morning 
and evening. It is even more precious to me now than when 
I first saw it, nineteen years ago. 

How sweet the words of the poet sound in my heart: 
"There's no place where earthly sorrows are more felt than 
up in heaven; There's no place where earthly failings have 
such kindly judgment given. Search the Scriptures, search 
and see, God in mercy judgeth thee." 

I had occasion to speak to a vessel captain today, who 
to a certain extent is interested in the harvest work, telling 
him about the many blessings we received at the Washington 
Convention, and the profitable and pleasant visit to the Tabernacle 
and Bethel. He said: "You certainly are at peace with 
all mankind, if I can judge by your face." 

Our earnest prayers go up for you daily, that the God 
of all grace may be your strength till the work is finished, 
come what may. 

Sweetest Christian greetings and remembrances from the 
writer and family, in which, I am sure, every member of 
our dear Ecclesia joins. 

Yours, by His grace, N. A. LINDERBERG.-Minn. 



DEAR BRETHREN:- 

I am enclosing two clippings from prominent church papers 
which will be self-explanatory. I wish to say that I think 
one of the best features about the WATCH TOWER is its 
indifference to the ranting of other publications. I feel 
almost to rejoice in this fact every time I receive the TOWER; 
I can sit down and really read the explanation of the Holy 
Scriptures and the discussion of topics without having to 
read every few lines some one's personal slashing of another 



person's belief; or by turning a page run on to a $3.00 watch 
advertisement guaranteeing a watch for twenty years; or a 
minister's boosting of the last Holiness meeting at which 
he and John Doe were the prominent speakers, and Mr. 

the singer, that so many "prayed through, many 

were gloriously blessed, and that he, the writer, had a few 
open dates, and if any of the dear brethren wanted him, to 
write at once." 

Yet I do believe that some of these articles should be 
answered, not by retorting, but by telling your readers some 
of the things accomplished: for instance, in one article which 
you will find underscored, the writer says, "But Russell's 
teachings have not produced even reformations." Why would 
it not be well to reprint both these articles with such comment 
as is your custom to make in a religious way, with only 
the one thought in view, that of shedding light on these 
benighted souls, that their vision may be gloriously enlarged, 
so they may be able to see beyond the confines of the small 
circle in which their thoughts have been accustomed to move, 
and realize the truth of the fact that they are servants of a 
dogma, the charms of which have so veiled their vision, that 
nothing but an almost divine interference can accomplish 
the feat of awakening their soul to the more lovable nature 
of the God of Love, who could not possibly be a God of 
Love were He a God of the Hell Fire punishment which they 
have been standing for. 

May God add His blessing. 

S. R. G .--Dakota. 



Brother Russell's replies to Mr. Ellis he thinks best to incorporate 
in his discourses, which appear in many newspapers and reach many 
people.

THE RETRIBUTIVE CHARACTER OF DIVINE LAW 

"Be not deceived: God is not mocked; for whatsoever 
a man soweth that shall he also reap."— Gal. 6:7. 

THE APOSTLE PAUL here, addressing the 

Church, announces a principle of Divine 

Law which is applicable not only to the 

Church, but to all men everywhere. Hosea 

expresses the same truth, saying that if we 

sow to the wind we shall reap the whirlwind. 

(Hos. 8:7.) Solomon says, if we sow iniquity, 

we reap vanity. (Prov. 22:8.) St. 

Paul says, if we sow sparingly, we reap sparingly, 

and if we sow bountifully, we reap 

bountifully. (2 Cor. 9:6.) This is equally true, whether 

we sow wild oats or good wheat. 

It is in view of the harvest of the world's sowing, that 
we are informed that "the eyes of the Lord are in every 
place, beholding the evil and the good" (Prov. 15:3); 



that "God shall bring every work into judgment, with 
every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be 
evil" (Eccl. 12:14); and that "there is nothing covered 
that shall not be revealed, neither hid that shall not be 
known"; that "whatsoever has been spoken in darkness 
shall be heard in the light"; and that "spoken in the ear, 
in closets, shall be proclaimed upon the housetops 
[openly]." (Luke 12:2,3.) And again we read "Vengeance 
is Mine, I will repay, saith the Lord."— Rom. 12:19. 

But when will this reckoning time come? for now, as 
saith the Prophet Malachi (3:15), men "call the proud 
happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, 
they that tempt God are even delivered." With the Psalmist 
(Psa. 94:3,4) we inquire, "Lord, how long shall the 
wicked triumph, and all the workers of iniquity boast 
themselves?" The Apostle Paul answers that the Lord 
"hath appointed a day in which He will judge the world 
in righteousness by that man whom He hath ordained,"— 
The Christ. (Acts 17:31.) And "then," says the Prophet 
Malachi to those who fear the Lord and whom He hath 
chosen as His jewels, "shall ye return and discern between 
the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth 
God and him that serveth Him not."— Mai. 3:18. 

But take heed. The same Prophet raises a suggestive 
question, which all would do well to ponder. He asks, 
"Who may abide the day of His coming? and who shall 
stand when He appeareth? for He is like a refiner's fire 
and like fullers' soap. ..And I will come near to 
you to judgment, and I will be a swift witness against the 
sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false 
swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his 
wages, and the widow and the fatherless, and that turn 
aside the stranger from his right, and fear not Me, saith 
the Lord of hosts. "-Mai. 3:2,5. 

The reference of these Scriptures is to the great judgment 
of the Day of the Lord— the day of trouble with 
which this Gospel Dispensation is to close— variously described 
as a day "of wrath," "of vengeance," "of recompense," 
and as a "time of trouble such as was not since 
there was a nation." 

But while this great judgment will have to do with 
the world in general— with nations and corporations and 
all civil, social and religious organizations of men; and 
while it will touch the cases of all the individuals living 
at that time, we naturally inquire where retributive justice 
came, or is to come in, in dealing with all the generations 
of the past? 

Our Lord answers the question when He says, "The 
hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall 
hear the voice of the Son of Man and shall come forth; 
they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; 
and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection by 
judgment." (John 5:28,29; see R.V. and Diaglott.) 
The whole Millennial Age is thus set forth as a "day" of 
reckoning, of trial, of judgment. In that searching judgment 
there will be a reckoning, even for every pernicious 



word (Matt. 12:36); and by submitting and learning 
obedience under those judgments, the masses of mankind 
who will to obey are to be gradually raised up to perfection 
of being, as well as of knowledge. 

RETRIBUTION VS. FORGIVENESS OF SIN 

But here a philosophic and important question arises as 
to the extent to which the justification of a sinner, through 
faith in the precious blood of Christ, and his full consecration 
to do the Father's will, may intercept the course of 
the Law, that a man must reap what he has sown. In 
other words, Will his new relationship to God save him 
from a miserable harvest of a former sowing of wild oats? 

We answer, Yes; in one sense it will. The just penalty 
for all sin is death— the severest penalty that can be inflicted. 
And from this penalty his justification freely exonerates 
him. His past iniquities and sins will no more 
rise up in judgment against him, demanding their just 
penalty— death; for "blessed are they whose iniquity is 
forgiven and whose sin is covered; blessed is the man to 
whom the Lord will not impute [reckon] sin." (Rom. 4:7,8.) 
All who by faith in Christ's sacrifice for sin and 
by consecration of heart and life to God's service come 
under the Robe of Christ's Righteousness are thus blessed. 

R5139 : page 368 

The iniquity, or legal sentence, of such is passed altogether 
or forgiven; and while the results of their sins, the harvest 
of their misdeeds sown before they came to a realization 
of the exceeding sinfulness of sin, or to an appreciation 
of God's mercy in Christ, are still painfully with them, 
yet they are assured that these are covered; that God does 
not regard them as they really are, but imputes their sins 
to Christ, who already has paid their penalty, and imputes 
of His worthiness to their account. They are further assured 
that God's provision for them is that they may some 
day be healed, or cured, of the weaknesses brought on 
them through sin and now reckoned as "covered" from 
the Divine eye. 

With the Church these sins, or actual defects, are to be 
blotted out or wiped out when the Times of Restitution 
shall arrive, at the Second Advent of Christ. (Acts 3:19.) 
The result of this blotting or wiping out of sin will be 
new bodies, new beings— free from sin, from imperfection 
and every consequence and evidence of sin. With the 
Church, this cleansing and blotting out process begins with 
the present life, and will be completed early in the Millennial 
Day (Psa. 46:5) by a share in the First 
Resurrection. 

The world's cleansing time will be the entire Millennial 
Age, or "Day of Judgment," when those who then shall 
accept Christ and the New Covenant may gradually be 
cleansed and healed. At the close of that Age, if faithful 
to their opportunities, they may be presented blameless and 



perfect before God, needing no further healing nor cleansing, 
but each being, as was Adam, a human image of the 
Divine Creator— a perfect man. 

The Scriptures, as well as observation, assure us that 
our justification before God does not remove at once and 
without our co-operation all the results of previous transgressions. 
The harvest is like in kind to the sowing; but 
the penitent and forgiven one has the promise of grace to 
help in the battle with his inherited as well as cultivated 
weaknesses; and so we read (I John 1:9), "God is faithful 
and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from 
all unrighteousness." It is in this cleansing process which 
follows vitalized justification that the consecrated believer 
must of necessity suffer from some of the baneful 
results of a past course of sin— reap the reward of his 
former sowing. While the Lord will be very merciful in 
dealing with him, nevertheless, as a Wise Physician, He 
will not spare the necessary experience to eradicate the 
deep-seated evil propensities of long cultivation in the past. 

RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE THE BASIS OF DIVINE LAW 

Here the retributive character of Divine Law is especially 
noteworthy. Men often make a distinction between 
the law of nature and the moral law, calling the one 
natural and the other Divine. But the fixed principles of 
both are of Divine origin, and accomplish the Divine will 
in their operation. Both operate on the basis of retributive 
justice. All Divine Law, whether of nature or of morals, 
is but the operation of certain fixed principles of righteousness, 
having for their object the peace and happiness of 
all intelligent creatures under its jurisdiction. Obedience 
to this Law brings its reward of happiness, while any 
interference with it incurs its certain penalty. 

If you hold your hand before the fire, it will be 
warmed, and your comfort and happiness will be thus 
ministered to; if you put your hand into the fire, it will 
be burned, and you will suffer pain. Thus the law of 
nature, which was designed to comfort and bless us, is 
also prepared to punish us if we violate its proper use. 
And not only so, but it is prepared to grade its penalties 
in proportion to the aggravation of the offense against it. 

If you put your hand into the fire for a very short time, 
it will be scorched; persist a little longer, and it will be 
blistered; and a little longer still, and it will be consumed. 
Applied properly to the cooking of your food, fire will 
reward you with a savory meal; but applied improperly, 
it may render the food undesirable or unfit for use. 
Water, also one of our greatest blessings, becomes, if the 
law of nature be disregarded, an agent of death and destruction. 
So throughout the laws of nature we might 
trace retribution. 

In the realm of moral law, the case is the same. If you 
violate the principles of righteousness, you deface the 
image of God in your being. Impure thoughts write in 
clearly legible signs upon the countenance the dark lines 



of a bad character; while pure, just and noble thoughts 
illuminate the countenance and render the pure character 
transparent to beholders. And the operations of moral 
law are as sure and reliable as are those of natural law. 

The fact that the retribution— the reward or the 
penalty— is often delayed is frequently presumed upon by 
the foolish, who vainly think they can sow their crop of 
wild oats and never realize their harvest. Both individuals 
and nations have long presumed to act upon this 
hazardous and vain hypothesis; and well indeed would it 
be if they would even now hearken to the Apostle's warning: 
"Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever 
a man soweth, that shall he also reap." 

The operations of this law are most manifest upon 
classes and nations— first, because their prominence gives 
them world-wide publicity; and second, because their judgment 
must of necessity be in the present life, since beyond 
the grave the present order of society will have no existence. 
A glance at the pages of history reveals the fact 
that all the nations of the past have reaped a bitter harvest, 
and amid harrowing scenes have breathed their last. They 
had their rising, their struggling periods, and their 
flourishing eras; and then "pride and fulness of bread" 
caused them to rest in fancied security, and to sink in the 
scale of morals, until their decline was followed by their 
fall. They reaped what they had sown. 

Just now, all the nations of the world are fast approaching 
the most terrible crises of their national existences. 
In a great time of unparalleled trouble, which is 
even now imminent, they are about to reap what they 
have sown. They have sown to the wind the seeds of 
selfishness, and now they are about to reap the whirlwind 
of terror and the destruction of all law and order, and of 
national and social organization. 

THE OPERATION OF THE LAW OF RETRIBUTION IN INDIVIDUAL 
CASES 

The operation of this law in individual cases, though 
not so prominent, is none the less sure. Every thought 
harbored, every disposition exercised and cultivated, becomes 
a component part of individual character; and this 
character, which is more or less tender in early life, becomes 
fixed in the course of years. If the cultivation of 
character has been along the lines of righteousness and 
truth, according to the light possessed— whether of conscience 
merely, or of revelation also— the ripened fruit of 
an established, right-preferring and benevolent character 
is a blessed harvest in comparison with others, the reverse. 
If the cultivation has been along the lines of depravity, 
self-gratification and degradation, the terrible fruits are a 
fearful penalty. 

Even though such a one be freely forgiven upon repentance 
and faith in the Redeemer— fully absolved from 
legal condemnation through Christ, who bore its Divinely 
pronounced penalty, death— nevertheless, the fruits of his 



R5139 : page 369 

sowing are manifest in his character. Evil propensities 
must all be rooted out and a proper character formed at a 
considerable cost of painful, but valuable experience; for 
God is just, not only to forgive us our sins, but also to 
cleanse us from all unrighteousness. The eradicating of 
these evil dispositions, propensities and appetites, deep-rooted 
and long-cultivated, will cause great disturbances 
of the soil in which they have grown; and pain as well as 
joy will attend their removal, and their replacement with 
the graces of the Spirit. 

The Lord, as a Wise Physician, will be as merciful and 
tender with His patient as the necessities of the case will 
permit. All will be shown their need of His aid, but no 
patient will be treated further except with his own consent 
and co-operation. With the Church this treatment takes 
place in the present life and is a treatment of the will 
rather than of the body; for although the body will be 
greatly helped by the treatment, it is not the Great Physician's 
purpose to cure these marred bodies, but to give to 
this class perfect spirit bodies early in the Millennial Day. 
In these the consecrated will is being transformed and renewed 
to perfect harmony with the will of God, the mind 
of Christ. The "overcomers," the true Church, passing 
through difficulties and cleansing and trials of faith and 
afflictions now, and being approved of the Lord, will not 
come into the judgment (trial) of the Millennial Age 
(I Cor. 1 1:32); but, with the Redeemer, their Lord, will 
be Kings and Priests of God, who shall judge the world 
and recompense to them good or evil, impartially, under 
the terms of the New Covenant— I Cor. 6:2. 

JUDGMENT DAY EXPERIENCES HEART SEARCHING 

Another feature of retribution upon the world during 
the Millennial trial will be the publicity which will then 
be given to the reaping and to the deeds of the past. Our 
Lord has so intimated, saying, "There is nothing covered 
that shall not be revealed; neither hid that shall not be 
known," etc. (Matt. 10:26; Luke 12:2,3.) This also will 
come about in a natural way, when in that day all that are 
in their graves shall come forth. Then the murderer and 
his victim, the debtor and his creditor, the thief and his 
dupe, the defamer and the defamed, must face each other 
and the facts, which, with even the secret motives, will be 
discerned. The terms of their reconciliation to each other 
and to the Judge will be equitable, and will be known to all. 

Past history will have proclaimed to the world the 
character of many a Nero; but additionally, there will be 
the necessity of their seeing the former victims of their 
ignoble cruelty, and facing them in the light of a new and 
healthy public sentiment, which will manifest crime in all 
its horrid deformity. Truly such "shall awake to shame 
and lasting [Heb. olan] contempt," even in their own eyes; 



for as the renewed manhood of the race begins to assert 
itself, they will the more fully realize the depth of the pit 
of degradation whence they were digged; and even the 
generous forgiveness of formerly injured and outraged 
fellow men will be a great humiliation. It will truly be, 
as the Scriptures suggest, the heaping of coals of fire on 
their heads (Prov. 25:21,22; Rom. 12:20), so great will 
be their shame and confusion.— Jer. 20:11. 

It should be borne in mind, too, that the only standard 
of judgment in public sentiment at that time will be character. 
None of the false standards— wealth, noble birth, 
or aristocracy of power, by which men are often measured 
now, and under which cloaks the wicked often take 
shelter— will then avail anything; for under the New Dispensation 
men will come forth shorn of all their former 
possessions. They will have neither wealth nor power; 
and in the light of that Age, heredity will be nothing 
whereof to boast. 

The same conditions which will thus expose the evils 
of the past life and thus, in the natural operations of moral 
law, bring about a measure of retribution to the evil-doers, 
will also make manifest the good deeds of the righteous, 
so that even the slightest favors done for others, deeds 
which at the time blessed the characters of the doers, will 
then be recognized and appreciated. 

OPERATION OF RETRIBUTIVE LAW NATURAL 

In this view of the matter we can see how, in a perfectly 
natural way, a man must reap the harvest of his 
sowing of wild oats, even though he has been freely forgiven, 
absolved from guilt and its penalty, death, and 
legally justified through faith in Christ. He will reap it, 
not only in the difficulties he will have piled up for himself 
in the hardening of his own character, making the 
steps up to perfection more painful and slow, and requiring 
severer discipline, but also in the just disapproval, or 
indignation of a righteous public sentiment in that Millennial 
Day of Judgment. 

Such will be the natural and inevitable results of present 
wrong-doing. One consolation, however, will be the 
fact that this humiliation, in some measure, at least, will 
be shared by all; "for there is none righteous [none perfect], 
no, not one" (Rom. 3:10); and all must pray, "Forgive 
us our trespasses as we forgive others." It will indeed 
be a time for melting and mellowing all hearts. 
Thus the Lord will take away the stony heart and give to 
all who under the New Covenant shall become His people 
(typified by Israel) a heart of flesh, according to His 
promise.— Ezek. 36:22-28. 

In some instances a portion of the reaping is experienced 
in the present life; and in some it will be in the life 
to come, as the Apostle intimates in I Tim. 5:24,25. So 
also good works are sometimes manifest now, and rightly 
appreciated and rewarded. But whether now or hereafter, 
our Lord's assurance is that even the gift of a cup of cold 



water to one of His disciples, because he is His disciple, 
shall have its reward (Matt. 10:40-42); so minute will be 
the Lord's cognizance of character and works, and His 
rewards therefor; and they will be none the less His rewards 
because accomplished in the natural operation of 
retributive laws. 

A murderer may be one who has little or no knowledge 
of God, whose hereditary disadvantages may be great and 
whose environment may be very unfavorable. He may 
meet with a just recompense for his crime at the hands of 
his fellow men, and yet in due time come forth from his 
grave unto [the privileges and opportunities of] a resurrection 
[lifting up— all the way up] by judgment [trial, 
discipline]. If obedient, he may reach the height of perfection 
and life everlasting, although the sins of his past 
life may have made mountains of difficulties in his character 
for him to clamber over during that Judgment Age. 

On the other hand, one may be a moral man, who has 
"tasted the good Word of God, and the powers of the 
Age to come" and who has been made a partaker of the 
spirit of holiness through faith in Christ; yet he may 
permit envy and strife to take possession of his heart; and 
he may hate his brother, though he outwardly violates no 
law and is esteemed among men. Such a one is a murderer 
at heart (I John 3: 15), though restrained from outward 
violence by respect for the opinions of others or by 
fear of the consequences. Who will deny that such a one, 
because of light enjoyed, may have even greater difficulties 
to overcome in the reformation of his character 
than the grosser, but ignorant, murderer? To whom much 

R5139 : page 370 

is given in the way of knowledge, opportunity, etc., of him 
much will be required. (Luke 12:48.) That judgment 
will be according to knowledge and ability to do right— a 
just recompense of reward. 

SEQUENCE THE DIVINE ARRANGEMENT REGARDING 
RETRIBUTION 

Only the idiotic and the insane are in total darkness. 
All others have had at least a conscience, and few have 
been without some hope of reward in following its dictates, 
though, as St. Paul says, they had no hope and were without 
God in the world. They were without the only real 
hope— the Gospel. (Eph. 2:12.) Previous to the announcement 
of the Gospel hope of everlasting life, and its 
foreshadowing in Israel, the hope of the world in general 
was only for the present rewards of righteousness. And 
no other hope was clearly held out, even to Israel, although 
there were hints and foreshadowings to them of the Gospel 
hope, as there was also in the promise given in Eden— 
that the Seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's 
head. These gleams of hope were doubtless treasured up 
and reasoned upon by the more thoughtful minds; but the 



masses of men discerned only the simple lesson that 
honesty, righteousness, was the best present policy. 

But when Christ came, He "brought life [everlasting] 
and immortality [clearly] to light through the Gospel." 
(2 Tim. 1:10.) Since then, proportionately as men have 
come directly or indirectly in contact with that Gospel, 
their responsibility has been increased, whether they accepted 
or rejected, opposed or ignored it. As it is written, 
"This is the condemnation, that light is come into the 
world and men loved darkness rather than light, because 
their deeds were evil."— John 3:19. 

The Divine arrangement regarding retribution seems 
generally to be that of sequence, so that under it rewards 
and punishments follow naturally, as the results of obedience 
or disobedience to law. Yet in the cases both of rewards 
and of penalties God sometimes steps beyond this 
order; as for instance, when He exalts the Church with 
Christ, their Head, to the Divine nature, Kingdom and 
glory; and when He brings upon Satan and his followers 
swift destruction at the end of the Millennial Age. His 
extraordinary methods have also been occasionally manifested 
in the past; viz., in the destruction of the world 
by the flood, in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, 
in the confusion of tongues at Babel, and other instances 
of minor note. But these are special and exceptional exhibitions 
both of His wrath and of His grace. 

A just estimate of the Lord's dealings in the future 
judgment of the repentant of the world may be approximated 
by a careful observance of His dealings with His 
justified and consecrated children now. Though justified, 
we are not liberated from all the consequences of our 
past ignorance or waywardness. If in youthful ignorance 
and waywardness bad habits were contracted which have 
impaired health and weakened moral and physical powers, 
we have all the difficulties to struggle against now, though 
we realize the Divine forgiveness and assistance. 

This is our judgment day; and the judgment of the world 
will proceed upon the same general principles. They will 
first be brought to a knowledge of the Truth, and will then 
be judged according to their use or abuse of that knowledge 
after they receive it, as worthy or unworthy of life. 
The good and bad actions of their first life, previous to 
their knowledge of the Truth, will enter into this judgment 
only in the natural order of the retributive character of 
moral Law. 



R5138 : page 370 

LOVE NOT THE WORLD 

"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. 
If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not 
in him."— 1 John 2:15. 



IN THE TEXT, "Love not the world," we do 

not understand the term "world" to mean 

either the human race or the planet on which 

we live. The thought of the text seems to 

be more particularly the present order of 

things, for the Greek word here translated 

world is kosmos, signifying arrangement. 

We are to appreciate the beauties of nature. 

We are to love the human family, whom 

God also loves, though not in the sense in 

which He loves the Church of Christ. We read, "God 

so loved the world that He gave His Only Begotten Son, 

that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but 

have everlasting life."— John 3:16. 

St. John cannot therefore be understood to refer to 
the world of mankind, when he says, "Love not the world." 
For them we should have sympathy similar to that which 
the Heavenly Father has for the fallen race. The Scriptures 
inform us that the present order, or arrangement, 
of things on earth is entirely out of harmony with God's 
will, or purpose; for the world is ruled by selfishness. 
The Divine arrangement is that love shall be the rule 
among God's creatures. "God is Love. ..He that 
dwelleth in love dwelleth in God."— I John 4:8,16. 

The world operates along lines different from those 
of love. Each one strives selfishly to heap together treasure 
for himself, even if meantime his neighbor goes 
destitute. Many live in luxury, while realizing that there 
are others who lack the necessities of life. Many seek 
for power to control men, not with the thought of their 
uplift, but with a view to using them for selfish ends 
and motives. This spirit of selfishness belongs to the 
present order of things. We see it in operation 
everywhere. 

The spirit of the world lays hold of all the forces of 
nature and seeks to control these, to adapt them to its 
own selfish interests. It is true that much good has resulted 
indirectly from this spirit of selfishness. For instance, 
a man with a great amount of the vain-glorious 
spirit may for his own selfish purposes benefit others. A 
general might have so much pride in his service that in 
order to win praise for himself he would care for his 
soldiers and have them well dressed. Some of our great 
captains of industry have done the world good service, 
and incidentally have blessed many, while carrying out 
their own designs. 

SELFISHNESS THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD 

If all of the great worldly enterprises were undertaken 
with a view to the betterment of mankind, the spirit 
of these would not be selfish. We know, indeed, that 
much is done to help those who are needy, and that where 
there is a motive of this kind, it is often misinterpreted 
and misjudged to be selfish. But "the Lord looketh on 
the heart." (I Sam. 16:7.) Those who have the selfish 



heart, the selfish intentions, will continue to love the 
things of the world. In proportion as such may be 
shown that there is a new order of affairs coming, in that 
proportion the selfish-minded will not be in sympathy 
with the change of dispensation. 
If a man conducts a large enterprise for the benefit 

R5138 : page 371 

of those who would have opportunity to share such blessings, 
that man would rejoice that there is a better time 
coming. A man who would truly rejoice to have a better 
arrangement of affairs, would not have the spirit that 
dominates in the present order of things. He would have 
the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Love, the spirit that will 
dominate the New Order of things, that will control during 
the thousand years of Christ's reign. 

Many are in the attitude of mind which would say, 
"My employer is rich. Whenever I get the opportunity 
to help myself to some of his money, I will do so and 
get as much as possible." Such people love the present 
order of things, whether they be rich or poor. A great 
many poor love the things of this world, and hope some 
day to get their share. 

There are people who say, "Oh, I do not love the 
world and its selfish spirit! From the crown of my head 
to the soles of my feet I am opposed to it. Sometimes 
I say to my husband, 'This is a very selfish world, John.' 
Then he replies, 'Yes, Mary, it is. Everywhere people 
are seeking for everything that will gratify self and selfish 
desires. But while you condemn the ways of the world, 

R5139 : page 371 

yet you delight in the good things of life provided by 
my industry— the automobile, the pleasant home, etc' 
And I must acknowledge that he is right. I fear that I 
could not be happy without them." Such a person certainly 
loves the things of the world, even while making 
good use of them. 

It seems to be a serious charge to say that any one 
who is in that attitude of mind which loves the world 
and the things belonging to it, has not the love of the 
Father in him. We do not understand, however, that 
such a one has no love for the Father or that the Father 
has no love for him. The Apostle seems to be addressing 
this message to the Church. Those who have been 
adopted into God's family must continue to love Him or 
they would not be counted as members of that class. 

What, then, is the full import of this expression— 
"The Love of the Father is not in him"? To us it would 
mean that the Love of the Father had not gotten full control 
of his heart, and this would mean that ultimately— 
unless he should gain a victory over his selfish disposition 
—he would not be accepted as a son. 

Everywhere about us is this spirit of selfishness. 



Every child of God should be on guard against it and 
against willingness to participate in the things of this 
world. We should strive to be in that condition which 
is pleasing to the Father. We are to try to rid ourselves 
of the spirit of the world and to be filled with the Spirit 
of the Father. This would not mean that we are not to 
appreciate beautiful things, or that we are not to like to 
see others striving to benefit the world; but that we should 
not be satisfied with any of these things, so far as we are 
concerned. 

TWO KINDS OF MOTIVES 

Whatever talents we possess we should use for the 
good of humanity in any kind of work that would be for 
the glory of God. Even a good work could be engaged 
in from the spirit of the world rather than from the Spirit 
of God; that is, it might be done for what we could get 
from others in the way of money, honor or influence; 
or, on the other hand, it might be for the good we desired 
to do for others. 

The highest of all services is that of the ministry of 
the Word of God. Even this noble service might be pursued 
from either of two motives— the Love of the Father 
or the love of self. Apparently there are some engaged 
in the ministry purely for the sake of the loaves and 
fishes, for the honorable position it gives them in the 
world, or because they do not know of anything that 
would serve them better. 

Again, there are those, no doubt, who have entered 
the ministry, not for selfish reasons, but because they 
desire to serve God, to serve the Truth, to serve His 
people. The Lord alone knows what has induced any one 
to enter the ministry. But since we are living in the day 
that will try every man's work, God will prove what sort 
it is— will show what motive is behind the deed. 

Those who are serving merely from the worldly spirit 
will be vexed with everything that is making for Truth; 
and in proportion as their earthly interests suffer, they 
will be angry. Those who are of the right spirit, however, 
will rejoice in everything that will be helpful to 
humanity, in everything that is to the glory of God, in 
everything that will make the Bible more easily 
understood. 

In fact, we may suppose that the real testing, so far 
as the Church is concerned, is the making manifest 
whether we love the world— the things of the present 
time— or whether we love God supremely. As time goes 
on, it will be even more impossible to harmonize the spirit 
of love and the spirit of selfishness. Those who love God 
will be fully out of harmony with the spirit of the present 
evil world. 

"Love not the world! 

He in whose heart the love 
Of vanity has found a place, shuts out 



The enduring world above. 

"Love not the world! 

However fair it seem; 
Who loveth this vain world— the love of God 

Abideth not in him."

THE CREATION OF THINGS MUNDANE 

-JANUARY 5. -GENESIS 1:1-31; 2:1-3. - 

"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 
And the earth was waste and void, and darkness was 
upon the face of the deep."— Gen. 1:1,2. (R.V.) 

IN THE past, Bible students have not been 
sufficiently critical in studying God's Word. 
Today's lesson illustrates this. The Genesis 
account does not begin with the creation of 
the physical earth, as was once supposed. 
"The beginning" refers merely to the work 
accomplished by Divine Power in bringing 
the waste and lifeless earth into condition 
for man's use. 

The earth was already in existence, and 
had been created by Divine Power before the time mentioned 
in the Genesis account. Read our text several 
times until this is clearly seen. Higher Critics (would 
go back millions of years to) discuss various theories respecting 
how the mass of earth was formed, and they 
attribute millions of years to this. Bible students may 
well content themselves with the record that the earth 
already was at "the beginning," of the Genesis account. 

The Bible mentions days of various lengths; for instance, 
"the day of temptation in the wilderness"— forty 
years (Heb. 3:8,9); "A day with the Lord is as a thousand 
years" (2 Pet. 3:8); our Lord's "day," etc. (John 8:56). 
While God could have accomplished the great 
work of ordering the earth in six 24-hour days, or in 

R5139 : page 372 

six minutes, for that matter, there is no reason to think 
that such short days are meant, as we shall see later. 
God arranged a great Week of Seven Days for His 
great work of bringing man to perfection. Six of these 
Days prepared our planet to receive Adam as its lord 
and earthly king, an image of his Creator. The Seventh 
Day, which there began, is not yet completed— it lacks 
a thousand years of completion. During that period, the 
Bible tells us, Earth will be brought to a Paradise condition 
and man will be restored by his Redeemer to God's 



image. 

Six great Thousand- Year Periods or Days have passed 
since Adam was created, according to Bible chronology. 
We are now in the dawning of the great Seventh Day 
or Sabbath Day of human experience. God has promised 
that this Seventh Day of a thousand years will be very 
different from the preceding Six Days, in which mankind 
has experienced a reign of Sin and Death. The Seventh 
Day of a thousand years is Scripturally called the "Day 
of Christ," and by many it is styled the Millennium. In 
it Satan and Sin are to be overthrown, righteousness is 
to be established by the Redeemer, and mankind, purchased 
by the precious blood at Calvary; are all to have 
full opportunity for arising from present degradation to 
re-attainment of the image and likeness of God, lost in 
Eden by Adam's disobedience. 

The Seventh Day of the Creative Week began with 
Adam's creation and has already lasted six thousand years, 
and is to be completed with the thousand years of Christ's 
Reign. The Seventh Creative Day will be seven thousand 
years long. Whoever sees this to be a reasonable 
deduction can easily suppose that the six preceding Days 
of the Genesis account were, likewise, seven thousand 
years each. Reckoned thus, the total period from the 
time that Divine Energy began to operate upon the waste 
Earth down to the time when the whole work of creation 
and Restitution will be fully completed, would be 7 times 
7,000 years, or 49,000 years. 

According to the Bible, that time will be a thousand 
years hence, when The Christ shall have accomplished 
His work for mankind to the full and shall deliver up the 
Kingdom to God, even the Father. At that moment the 
fiftieth thousand-year period will begin, with every creature 
in Heaven and on earth ascribing praise to Him 
that sitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lamb, forever. 
How appropriate this will be, especially when we recall 
that in God's arrangement fifty is the greatest climax 
of numbers! In Bible usage the number seven is 
symbolical of perfection, and 7 times 7 represents a completeness 
of perfection; and the fiftieth or Jubilee 
following is climacteric. 

R5140 : page 372 

"LET THERE BE LIGHT" 

We hold that the Genesis account is in full accord 
with all the facts known to science. There was no light 
in the Earth prior to the time when Divine Energy 
brooded on the surface of the waters. The account seems 
to suggest an electrical influence, and a light somewhat 
resembling the Aurora Borealis. The Earth was dark 
because shrouded with an impenetrable fog and an upper 
canopy of water, mineral water, etc. This thoroughly 
shut out the light of the sun, moon and stars, which did 
not shine in upon the Earth in any sense until the Fourth 



Day. The Jewish day, patterned after the Genesis account, 
began with the night. So the First Day of 7,000 
years, under the Divine Energy, gradually increased this 
electrical light and prepared for the next epoch. 

The work of the Second Day, or Epoch, was the 
establishment of a firmament, separating between the 
waters of the sky and the waters of the Earth. Doubtless 
the light had to do in a natural way with bringing about 
this secondary feature of the Earth's preparation. The 
establishment of the firmament began very slowly, but 
was completed with the end of the Second Day. 

In the Third Day, or Epoch, under Divine direction 
earthquakes took place, mountain ranges were thrown 
up, and thus the waters of the Earth were gathered into 
seas, draining off a land surface in preparation for 
vegetation. Forthwith vegetation sprang up— grass, 
bushes, trees, with their seeds and fruits. The account 
does not say that God made so many different kinds of 
grasses and fruit, trees, etc. It declares that under Divine 
command the Earth brought forth these various kinds. 
Nothing in the Genesis account would interfere with an 
evolutionary theory as respects vegetation. Thus, under 
Divine supervision, the Third Day accomplished its 
purpose. 

According to the Vailian Theory the Earth was once 
surrounded by rings and belts similar to those of Saturn 
and Jupiter, consisting of minerals and waters thrown off 
to a great distance when the Earth long previously was 
in a molten state. These rings, attracted to the Earth, 
approached her gradually, one by one. Held off by the 
firmament, they spread out like a great curtain, causing 
much of the darkness. Then, influenced by the motion 
of the Earth on her axis, they gravitated toward the 
poles, gradually becoming heavier. Finally they broke, 
one after the other, coming down as great deluges, burying 
vegetation, which later became coal beds, and depositing 
minerals of various kinds, which man has since been 
using. 

Each successive deluge added minerals to the crust of 
the Earth and water to the seas, the weight of the seas 
creating further upheavals of mountains, etc. The last 
of these rings came down as a deluge in Noah's day. 
Previously, for centuries, it had been a great watery 
canopy. Through it the sun, moon and stars were visible, 
but not clear, as now. Under these conditions there were 
no storms, nor was there any rain. (Gen. 2:3.) The 
entire Earth under this canopy was like a greenhouse of 
equable temperature. This accounts for the vegetable and 
animal remains found near the poles, and long imbedded 
in ice, which formed instantly when the canopy collapsed 
as a deluge. 

With the fall of several of Earth's "rings," the atmosphere 
became translucent, so that the luminaries of the 
sky could exercise their beneficial influences in respect 
to animal life about to be created. These luminaries have 
served mankind as a great clock, marking days, months 



and years. Thus the work of the Fourth Epoch-Day was 
accomplished. 

On the Fifth Day the waters began to swarm with 
living, moving creatures. Next came fowl and great sea 
monsters. Here again a measure of evolution is suggested 
by the statement that "the waters brought forth abundantly" 
the various kinds, under Divine supervision. Only 
in the case of man does the Bible distinctly declare a 
personal creation. 

The creation of land animals marks the Sixth Epoch-Day. 
Fish and fowl took precedence, as scientists agree. 
Again we read that "the earth brought forth," but we 
also read that the Lord directed the matter in the 
development of the different kinds or varieties. 

It was at the very end of the Sixth Day that God 
created man. The earth did not bring him forth. He 
was created in his Maker's character-likeness, to be the 
king of Earth, to have dominion over the creatures of the 
land, the air and the sea. Another account seems to 

R5140 : page 373 

imply that Mother Eve was taken from Father Adam's 
side, to be a helpmate on his own plane, in the beginning 
of the Seventh Day, for this was the last feature of 
creation. We read that God finished His work on the 
Seventh Day and rested. He has rested or ceased from 
His creative work during this Seventh Day, leaving the 
finishing touches to be accomplished by the Redeemer 
during His Messianic Kingdom, which will complete the 
Seventh Day— 49,000 years from the time God said, "Let 
there be light." 



R5140 : page 373 

"GOD CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE" 

-JANUARY 12.-GENESIS 1:26-2:25; PSALM 8.- 

HOW DIFFERENT the statement respecting 

man's creation from that describing the 

creation of plants and the lower animals 

which the seas and the earth brought forth! 

Man's creation was premeditated. In advance, 

God designed man to be the king over 

the Earth, having dominion over fish and 

fowl and beasts, even as his Creator has the 

supreme dominion of the Universe. He was 

to be his Creator's image, not in physical 

form, but in moral and intellectual qualities. He was 

not to be of the Divine nature, but of human nature— 

a fleshly being resembling his Creator, a Spirit Being. 

This intention of Deity was fully carried out in man's 

creation. As we read, "God created man in His own 



image; in the image of God created He him; male and 
female created he them." Not a word here can be construed 
as in any sense implying the evolution of man from 
the lower creatures. 

A FALL, NOT AN EVOLUTION 

So far from teaching an evolution, the Bible teaches 
the very reverse, both in the Old and in the New Testament. 
St. Paul declares, By one man's disobedience sin 
entered into the world, and death as the result of sin. 
Thus death passed upon all men, because all are sinners. 
(Romans 5:12.) The Prophet David refers to this fallen 
condition and queries respecting God's mercy in providing 
for man a redemption and restoration to Divine favor, 
saying, "What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?" 
(Psalm 8:4.) He then proceeds briefly to picture man's 
glorious condition before he fell, saying, "Thou madest 
him a little lower than the angels. Thou crownest him 
with glory and honor and didst set him over the works 
of Thy hands." Later he describes man's dominion as 
related to beasts of the field, fowl of the air and fish of 
the sea. 

In a word, the Bible represents man as the crowning 
masterpiece of mundane creation. The seal of God's 
Word is set to this in the statement that God pronounced 
him "very good." This is also implied in the statement 
that God created him in His image, for the Scriptures 
declare, "All His work is perfect." Nor could we for a 
moment esteem it just or right that any but a perfect 
being should be placed on trial for life or death 
everlasting. 

NOT TWO CREATION ACCOUNTS 

Higher Critics, anxious to discredit the Bible, claim 
that the Second Chapter of Genesis is another account 
of the whole creation written by a different person. 
They claim that it gives a different order of creation, 
showing man created first, and then trees, beasts, etc. To 
us this is all foolishness. Moses, having described 
creation in its logical order, merely emphasizes and particularizes 
some of his previous statements. 

He declares (Genesis 2:4) that he has already described 
the generation or developments of things heavenly 
and earthly from the beginning, before there was any 
plant life. Incidentally he mentions that at that time 
there was no rain— before the flood. He again assures 
us that man was God's last creation, to be the king or 
supervisor of earth. Then, much to our satisfaction, 
Moses proceeds to give an account of the specialty of 
man's creation, so different from that of the lower animals 
and vegetation. He was not evolved, but was God's 
handiwork. He was not spirit, but flesh, formed of the 
dust of the ground. But still he had the spirit of life 
common to all the lower creatures, of whom he was the 



head or king. The Hebrew reads, literally, "In his nostrils 
the breath of lives"— the breath or spirit of life common 
to all breathing creatures. 

Then a description of Eden follows, how God particularly 
supervised its preparation as the home of the king 
of earth, in which God placed him. Nothing in this 
implies that Eden was made after Adam's creation. On 
the contrary, we have already been informed that God's 
creative work ceased with the production of Mother 
Eve, and that since then He has rested or desisted from 
further mundane creation— leaving to His glorious Son, 
Messiah, the work of human redemption and restitution.— 
Acts 3:19-21. 

R5141 : page 373 

When we read (V. 19) that all animals that God had 
previously created were named by Adam, it would be 
foolish for us to suppose that the animals were a subsequent 
creation. This bringing of all creatures to Adam's 
attention implies his mastery of them all and leads up 
to the statement that in none of them was he able to find 
fellowship and companionship. God wished him to 
realize the need of a companion and wife before providing 
her. 

MAN ORIGINALLY SEXLESS 

The details of human creation imply that Adam lived 
in Eden some time alone and sexless. Some Bible students 
infer from the chronology that it was about two years 
from the time of Adam's creation until the expulsion 
from Eden under the death sentence. The cause for the 
division of Adam into two persons is stated; the earth 
was to be filled, populated with a race of his species, and 
amongst all the creatures none was suitable as a companion 
for him or fit to be his mate, and the mother of 
an offspring in his likeness. 

Thus again is shown that Adam was distinctly different 
from apes and monkeys, and all the other creatures 
placed under his control. He was in the likeness of his 
Creator. Other Scriptures show us that after the earth 
shall have been filled with a population, it is the Divine 
purpose that the sex quality in humanity shall be dropped. 
Jesus' words are, "They that shall attain unto that Age 
(of perfection— future) will neither marry nor be given 
in marriage, but be like the angels of Heaven"— sexless. 
See Luke 20:34-36. 

The division of Adam into two parts, male and female, 
left the headship with the male, but deprived him of 
some of his sympathetic qualities. His wife, predominating 
in the sympathetic tendencies, had in her perfection 
less of the masculine and aggressive traits; but the two 
were perfectly adapted to each other's needs and fulfilled 
each other's ideals. The fall from God's favor has affected 



R5141 : page 374 

both sexes and has disturbed the original balance 
and harmony, producing extremes of coarseness and 
effeminacy, destroying perfection and robbing the marriage 
relationship of much of its ideal happiness. 

The Restitution or resurrection of the willing and 
obedient, to be brought about by Messiah's Kingdom, will 
not mean the restoration of sex perfections, but rather 
the gradual perfecting of each individual in the image 
and likeness of God in personal completeness, such as 
Adam possessed before his division. 

The sex attractions having passed away, man will not 
be alone, as Adam was originally; for the earth will be 
full of human brethren, all in the image of God and in 
fullest fellowship of spirit, enjoying the world-wide Eden. 
Such a condition of things can be appreciated only as we 
take the Divine standpoint and realize the superior perfection 
of God and the angels in their sexless condition- 
though always spoken of as masculine. 

"BY ONE MAN'S DISOBEDIENCE" 

Note the consistency of the Bible theory which necessitated 
the division of one man into male and female. God 
purposed that the entire race must proceed from the one 
man. He foresaw sin and how He would permit it to 
flourish, and how He would provide for man's recovery. 
If two or more separate individuals had sinned and involved 
the race, it would have required just as many 
redeemers, according to the Divine Law, "An eye for an 
eye, a tooth for a tooth," a man's life for a man's life. 
(Deut. 19:21.) Because God from the beginning intended 
only one Lamb of God, one glorious Redeemer, therefore 
the entire race sprang from the one man Adam, that "as 
by a man came death, by a man" should come "the resurrection 
of the dead." -I Cor. 15:21. 

SECOND ADAM AND SECOND EVE 

We should not forget that Adam and Eve in some 
respects foreshadowed Christ and the Church. Jesus 
personally is the great Savior of mankind, whose death 
constitutes the Ransom-price for the sins of Adam and 
the entire race. He is to be the Great Life-Giver, or 
Father of mankind. During His Millennial Reign He 
will give back earthly life to Adam and as many of his 
race as will receive it— raising them gradually, more 
and more, out of sin and death conditions, up to perfection 
during that thousand years,— "the times of refreshing 
that shall come from the presence of the Lord,... 
the times of restitution of all things, which God hath 
spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the 
world began." (Acts 3:19 to 21.) This will be the 
glorious work of regenerating the world,— "whosoever 
will" may then drink the water of life freely. 



But before beginning His work of regenerating the 
world, God has arranged that first from the wound in 
Christ's side, figuratively, an Elect Church shall be formed 
to be His companion and joint-heir in His Kingdom— 
the second Eve, on the spirit plane, as He, the Heavenly 
One, is the Second Adam. 

The Church will not be the Life-Giver or Father, but 
she will be the mother, or care-taker of the regenerated 
hosts of humanity during the Millennium. Under her 
care the willing and obedient will retain the image of God 
in the flesh.

DISCIPLINE 



The hammer of Thy discipline, O Lord, 

Strikes fast and hard. Life's anvil rings again 

To Thy strong strokes. And yet we know 'tis then 

That from the heart's hot iron all abroad 

The rich glow spreads. Great Fashioner Divine, 

Who spareth not, in Thy far-seeing plan, 

The blows that shape the character of man, 

Or fire that makes him yield to touch of Thine, 

Strike on, then, if Thou wilt! For thou alone 

Canst rightly test the temper of our will, 

Or tell how these base metals may fulfill 

Thy purpose— making all our life Thine own. 

Only we do beseech Thee, let the pain 

Of fiery ordeals through which we go 

Shed all around us such a warmth and glow, 

Such cheerful showers of sparks in golden rain, 

That hard hearts may be melted, cold hearts fired, 

And callous hearts be taught to feel and see 

That discipline is more to be desired 

Than all the ease that keeps us back from Thee. 



R5143 : page 374 

WISDOM FOR HARD TIMES 

MANY PEOPLE are wasteful without intending 

to be so. They do not know how to 

economize. Economy is less important to 

the rich than to the poor, yet the poor 

usually know nothing about true economy. 

Economy does not signify always the purchase 

of that which is cheapest, nor does 

it mean to purchase in various small quantities 

sparingly. In view of the possibilities 

of the near future we believe that "a word 

in season" will be helpful. Our advice would be to keep 



a good supply of fuel ahead, as storms and accidents might 
interrupt the supply— not to speak of strikes. 

But our particular message now is in respect to food. 
We advise a fair supply of staple goods which do not 
run into money— rice, beans, peas, oatmeal, potatoes, salt, 
sugar. What we have enumerated are staples. Bought 
in reasonable quantities, they are the cheapest, as well as 
the most wholesome food. The rice and the potatoes are 
rich in starch, while the beans and peas are richly 
nitrogenous and largely take the place of meats in support 
of the human system. 

Meat in moderate quantities is wholesome and desirable, 
but not indispensable where beans and peas are 
used freely. However, certain portions of beef are sold 
cheap everywhere, the objection usually being that the 
cheap portions are tough. We want to give our readers 
a recipe, by the use of which they can always have tender 
meat, even though they buy the cheapest and toughest. 

The recipe is the use of a small quantity of the best 
vinegar in the preparation of the meat. Press the tough 
pieces of meat tightly into ajar, and put just enough 
water on it to cover it. Note the quantity of water used, 
and allow two teaspoonfuls of vinegar to a pint of water 
—a tablespoonful to a quart, and in same proportion for 
larger quantities. Let this vinegar and water remain upon 
the meat over night. In the morning cook your meat in 
whatever way you may please, and it will be tender. The 
same treatment will make the toughest fowls tender. If 
the vinegar is not quite good and strong, a larger quantity 
will be needed. In frying steak, a teaspoonful of vinegar 
put into a large frying-pan will give the steak a spicy 
flavor and make it tender. WATCH TOWER readers need 
never have tough meat hereafter.

YOUR "GOOD HOPES" FOR 1913 

[The plan here proposed we designate "GOOD HOPES," 
because nothing is actually promised— only your generous 
hopes expressed, based upon your future prospects as they 
now appear to you. The plan proved not only so beneficial 
to the cause of Truth, but also so blessed to the hopers, for 
some years past, that we again commend it to all as Scriptural 
and good. Those who desire to make use of this plan 
can fill out both of these memoranda. One should be kept 
for the refreshment of your memory; the other mail to us.] 

-TO THE- 

"WATCH TOWER BIBLE & TRACT SOCIETY." 

Dear Friends:— I have read with interest of the openings 
for the STUDIES and Tract work in foreign lands and here 



at home. I need not tell you that I am deeply interested in 
the spread of the Glad Tidings of the lengths and breadths, 
the heights and depths of redeeming love expressed for us 
in God's great Plan of the Ages. 

I am anxious to use myself— every power, every talent, 
voice, time, money, influence, all— to give to others this 
knowledge, which has so greatly blessed, cheered and comforted 
my own heart and placed my feet firmly upon the 
Rock of Ages. 

I have been considering carefully, and praying to be instructed, 
how to use my various talents more to my Redeemer's 
glory and for the service of His people— those 
blinded by human tradition who are, nevertheless, hungering 
for "the good Word of God," and those also who are 
naked, not having on the wedding garment of Christ's imputed 
righteousness, the unjustified, who stand at best in 
the filthy rags of their own righteousness. I have decided 
that so far as my "money talent" goes, I will follow the rule 
so clearly laid down for us by the great Apostle Paul (1 Cor. 16:2), 
and will lay aside on the first day of each week, according 
to my thankful appreciation of the Lord's blessings 
during the preceding week. Out of this fund I wish to contribute 
to the several parts of the Lord's work specified on 
the back of this letter. Of course, I cannot in advance judge 
or state particularly what the Lord's bounty may enable 
me to set apart weekly, and hence you will understand the 
sum indicated to be merely my conjecture or hope, based 
upon present prospects. I will endeavor to contribute more 
than I here specify, and should I not succeed in doing as 
well, the Lord will know my heart, and you, also, will know 
of my endeavors. 

My only object in specifying in advance what I hope to 
be able to do in this cause is to enable those in charge of 
the work of publishing and circulating the Tracts, etc., to 
form estimates, lay plans, make contracts, etc., with some 
idea of what I will at least try to do in the exercise of this, 
my highly appreciated privilege. 

My present judgment is that during the coming year, by 
self-denial and cross-bearing, I shall be able to lay aside on 
the first day of each week for Home and Foreign Mission 
Work (to assist in circulating SCRIPTURE STUDIES in foreign 
languages, and in publishing the PEOPLES PULPIT in various 
languages, and in supplying these gratuitously to brethren 
who have the heart and opportunity to circulate them widely, 
and in meeting the expenses of brethren sent out as Lecturers 
to preach the Divine Plan of Salvation, and in general to 
be expended as the officers of the Society may deem best), 
the amount of per week. 

To comply with United States Postal Laws, all or any 
portion of my donation may be applied as subscription price 
for WATCH TOWER or PEOPLES PULPIT sent to the Lord's poor 
or others, as the Society's officers may deem advisable. 

That the work be not hindered, I will endeavor to send 
you what I shall have laid aside for this cause at the close 
of each quarter. I will secure a Bank Draft, Express Order 
or Postal Money Order as I may find most convenient, and 



will address the letter to

WATCH TOWER SUBSCRIPTIONS 

ON "GOOD HOPES" ACCOUNT. 

The friends who contribute to the "Good Hopes" (described 
on the reverse of this sheet) at times desire to send 
THE WATCH TOWER to friends who are not yet interested 
enough to subscribe for themselves, or to deeply interested 
friends who are too poor to subscribe and backward about 
accepting our Lord's Poor offer. They are invited to give us 
such addresses below— the expense to be deducted from their 
donations. Give full name and address, and write very plainly, 
please, mentioning the length of the subscriptions. 

WATCH TOWER SUBSCRIPTION RENEWALS 

Most of our subscriptions end with the year, so we take 
this opportunity to remark that we shall be glad to hear 
promptly from such as desire the visits of THE WATCH TOWER 
continued. The Lord's Poor friends have been requested to 
send their applications in May. When names are dropped and 
afterward renewed it makes us unnecessary trouble. When

A PRIVILEGE AND A SERVICE 

We are convinced that THE WATCH TOWER lists do not 
contain the names of one-half of those deeply interested in its 
teachings. The total is small enough surely, and we are not 
content that the name of any should be missing. We believe 
that all such will be stimulated and encouraged on the "narrow 
way" by its semi-monthly appearance on their table, 
reminding them afresh of spiritual matters which the world, 
the flesh and the Devil continually tend to crowd out of mind 
and heart. 

Hitherto we have at times required that all desiring THE 
WATCH TOWER on credit, or free, as "the Lord's Poor," should 
make personal application; but now we request every subscriber 
to inquire among those whom he knows to be interested 
in Present Truth, and to obtain the consent of all such 
to send in their subscriptions either on credit or free, as their 
circumstances may necessitate. Any getting it on credit may 
at any future time request that the debt be canceled, and we 
will cheerfully comply. We desire that as nearly as possible 
THE WATCH TOWER lists shall represent all those deeply interested 
in its message. 

Our object is not the gain of "filthy lucre," but "the perfecting 
of the saints for the work of ministry"— present and 
to come. (Eph. 4:12.) We offer no premiums, desiring the 
co-operation of such only as appreciate the privilege of being 
co-workers with us in this ministry. Our list is now about 
35,000; but it should be at least 50,000, and we confidently 
expect the above program to bring it to that figure. Let as 
many as appreciate it as a privilege join in this service.

THE ENDING OF THE GENTILE TIMES 

IF IN times past the records of history had 
been kept as they are at present, there would 
seem to be no excuse for any discrepancy or 
misunderstanding on the subject of chronology. 



But they were not so kept. In olden 

times it was the custom to date events according 

to the period of the reigning king, 

thus: In the third year of the reign of King 

Cyrus; in the seventh year of the reign of 

King Solomon, etc. As king followed king, 

some living a few months, some a few years, some many 

years, the threads of history were always in danger of 

becoming entangled. Indeed, no particular necessity was 

seen for keeping chronological records. Even the Bible 

merely relates these histories in their order, telling the 

number of the years of the life or of the reign of each 

king, without twisting these threads into one common cord 

of history. 

So matters continued, with little effort to arrange an 
exact chronology of human history, until the Sixth Century 
A.D. when Dionysius, a Roman abbot, set forth 
our present method of counting, styled the Christian 
Calendar. It undertook to mark the beginning of the 
Christian era with the birth of Christ, reckoned as January 
1st. Previous history was reckoned and styled Before 
Christ (B.C.) and subsequent history was styled Anno 
Domini (A.D.)— in the year of our Lord. 

Whether Dionysius began his A.D. period January 
1st, A.D. 1, or whether he began it January 1st, A.D. 0, 
we may not be sure; neither may we feel too certain 
whether he began the B.C. dates December 31st, B.C. 0, 
or December 31st, B.C. 1. For all ordinary purposes 
this question would be rather immaterial. But it has 
a very important bearing on our calculation of Gentile 
Times. Even in this particular the matter seemed less 
important thirty or forty years ago than it does today; 
for now as we come down to the close of the Gentile Times 
we are disposed to give every feature a critical and 
microscopical examination not thought so necessary some 
years ago. 

Then, we were content to say, "606 B.C. seems a 
well authenticated date for the destruction of Jerusalem 
by Nebuchadnezzar, and B.C. 536 the date when the 
seventy years' appointed desolation of the land ceased." 
Our method adopted in the STUDIES IN THE 360 

SCRIPTURES was a simple one. We said: 7 

The Bible times of Gentile supremacy and 
Israel's rejection equals 7 times 360, or 2,520 

2,520 years. From this we deducted the B.C. 606 

date before Christ (B.C.) 606. Thus we 

found the year A.D. 1914. A.D. 1914 

AN OPEN QUESTION 

Coming now to a very critical examination of the 
date 536 B.C., there is an open question: Shall we call 
it 536 full years to A.D., or 434 full years? The difference 
in time between October 1st and January 1st would 
be the fourth of a year; hence our query is respecting 
536-1/4 or 535-1/4 years B.C. What is the proper method 



of calculation, is in dispute. If we count the first year 
B.C. as 0, then the date 536-1/4 B.C. is the proper one for 
the end of the seventy years of captivity. But if we begin 
to reckon it by counting the first year before the Christian 
era as B.C. 1, then evidently the desolation ended 
535-1/4 years B.C. 

As to the methods of counting, Encyclopaedia 
Britannica says, "Astronomers denote the year which 
preceded the first of our era as and the year previous 
to that as B.C. 1— the previous year B.C. 2, and so on." 

Whichever of these ways we undertake to calculate 
the matter the difference between the results is one year. 
The seventy years of Jewish captivity ended October, 
536 B.C., and if there were 536-1/4 years B.C., then to 
complete the 2,520 years' cycle of the Times of the 
Gentiles would require 1913-3/4 years of A.D., or to October, 
1914. But if the other way of reckoning were used, 
then there were but 535-1/4 years of the period B.C., and 
the remainder of the 2,520 years would reach to A.D., 
1914-3/4 years, otherwise October, 1915. 

Since this question is agitating the minds of a considerable 
number of the friends, we have presented it 
here in some detail. We remind the readers, however, 
that nothing in the Scriptures says definitely that the 

R5142: page 377 

trouble upon the Gentiles will be accomplished before 
the close of the Times of the Gentiles, whether that 
be October, 1914, or October, 1915. The trouble doubtless 
will be considerable before the final crash, even though that 
crash come suddenly, like the casting of a great millstone 
into the sea. (Rev. 18:21.) The parallel between the 
Jewish Harvest and the present Harvest would corroborate 
the thought that the trouble to the full will be 
accomplished by October, 1915. 

OUR CONSECRATION IS UNTO DEATH 

Many of our readers will recall our reference to this 
subject in a sermon preached at Allegheny, Pa., January 
11, 1904, and published in the Pittsburgh Gazette. We 
make an extract from that sermon as follows:— 

"We find, then, that the Seven Times of Israel's punishment 
and the Seven Times of Gentile dominion are 
the same; and that they began with the captivity of Zedekiah, 
and, as will be seen from the Chart, they terminate 
with the year 1915. According to the best obtainable 
evidences on the subject, synchronized with the Scriptural 
testimony, Zedekiah's captivity took place in October, 
605-1/4 years before A.D. 1. If we will add to this 1914-3/4 
years, we will have the year, October, 1915, as the date 
for the end of Gentile supremacy in the world— the end 
of the lease of 2,520 years, which will not be renewed. 
Instead, He whose right the Kingdom is, shall take possession 
of it. This, therefore, marks when the Lord Himself 



shall assume control of the world's affairs, to end its 
reign of sin and death, and to bring in the True Light." 

There surely is room for slight differences of opinion 
on this subject and it behooves us to grant each other 
the widest latitude. The lease of power to the Gentiles 
may end in October, 1914, or in October, 1915. And 
the period of intense strife and anarchy "such as 
never was since there was a nation" may be the 
final ending of the Gentile Times or the beginning of Messiah's 
reign. 

But we remind all of our readers again, that we have 
not prophesied anything about the Times of the Gentiles 
closing in a time of trouble nor about the glorious epoch 
which will shortly follow that catastrophe. We have 
merely pointed out what the Scriptures say, giving our 
views respecting their meaning and asking our readers to 
judge, each for himself, what they signify. These 
prophecies still read the same to us. Should we ever see 
reason for changing our belief, be assured we will be 
prompt to advise you respecting the same and give you the 
reason for it. However, some may make positive statements 
of what they know, and of what they do not know, 
we never indulge in this; but we merely state that we 
believe thus and so, for such and such reasons. 

Many disposed to cavil at every statement of faith respecting 
the time and ending of this Age and the dawning 
of the New Age are very positive in their assertions. 
Some of them declare that surely the end of this Age 
cannot come for fifty thousand years yet. Others, with 

R5142: page 378 

equal positiveness, declare that it may happen at any 
moment. Neither one gives any Scriptural proof. Then 
why should either of them criticize us for merely presenting 
the Scripture testimonies and our opinions respecting 
the signification of them, with the request that others 
investigate and form each his own opinion? 

Finally, let us remember that we did not consecrate 
either to October, 1914, nor to October, 1915, or to any 
other date, but "unto death." If for any reason the Lord 
has permitted us to miscalculate the prophecies, the signs 
of the times assure us that the miscalculations cannot be 
very great. And if the Lord's grace and peace be with 
us in the future as in the past, according to His promise, 
we shall rejoice equally to go or to remain at any time, 
and to be in His service, either on this side the veil or 
on the other side, as may please our Master best.

ADVICE TO PILGRIMS, GOOD FOR ALL 
TO THE PILGRIM BRETHREN OF I.B.S.A. 



DEAR BRETHREN, BELOVED IN THE LORD:-I know well that 
as New Creatures your desires are to lay down your life for 
the Brethren. I know well, also, that the world, the flesh 
and the adversary (especially the latter) evidently oppose all 
who seek to walk in the footsteps of Jesus, particularly those 
in public places and those who are active in the service of 
the Truth. These attacks come sometimes in one form and 
sometimes in another— sometimes through too much sympathy 
and sometimes through too little. 

I feel constrained to give you some advice: 

Do not do much writing of letters. Experience shows 
that those Pilgrims who do much of this generally neglect 
the particular work in which they are supposed to be engaged. 
If there are questions needing answers, ten words on postcard 
will refer the friends to THE WATCH TOWER OFFICE, or 
to STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES. We believe that the results 
would be far more profitable than if you would attempt 
to write lengthy discussions. In some instances the 
friends could be more profited. Is it not wise that we remember 
St. Paul's exhortation that the eye, the hand, the 
foot, strive to do its own part as members of the Body of 
Christ? Your portion, dear Brethren, is a very honorable 
and important one. We believe that it will need all of your 
time, if properly attended to. 

The forenoons, or times when there are no meetings, we 
advise that brief visits be made to dear friends of whom 
you get word that they are sick, or for some other reason 
have not attended meetings of the Class recently. 

Such opportunities not presenting themselves, we suggest 
that you write a brief synopsis of your principal address (if 
you give a public one), suitable for the newspapers. This 
will be a valuable experience to you and may prove acceptable, 
and thus give the Truth a wider swing. One dear 
Brother has been very successful in this way. Not being 
much of a hand at writing nor much of a scholar, he inquired 
of me if he could use some of my sermons. I gave cheerful 
consent. Rewriting them, he has been able to get them into 
numbers of papers, and thus the Truth has been circulated. 
We wish to give you all this same privilege. 

Do not understand by this that we mean for you to go 
out of the Pilgrim service into the literary work, but merely 
that you seek for opportunities to write up something that 
may effect the scattering of the Truth. The time thus employed 
would be much more useful in the Lord's service than 
in writing to the friends. 

I remember you daily in my petitions at the Throne of 
Heavenly Grace and hope that I am remembered by you all. 
Remember me to the dear friends wherever you may go, 
assuring them that you bear my greetings. As ever, 
Yours in the Fellowship of the Anointed, 
C. T. RUSSELL.

SUGGESTIONS FOR BEREAN CLASSES 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

In sending current report to Tabernacle I feel constrained 
to express anew my hearty Christian Love for you, 
as I perceive the activity of our opponents increasing in their 
efforts to overthrow the work committed to you. You have 
our prayers, as well as our sympathy, in the trials incidental 
to the various attacks being made in the public press against 
you. I feel confident the same Grace which has held you 
up in the past will prove sufficient to the end. 

Most of the classes seem to be leaping forward in the 
things of the Spirit, as though trying to make amends for 
past slackness. 

I notice a few classes making the serious mistake of 
thinking a constant change is essential to "keep from getting 
into a rut." Thus in one class the Lord evidently saw 
a more competent leader was needed, and He sent a brother 
to work here who had the necessary qualifications. After 
serving two six months' terms that spirit of change refused 
to elect him, or, rather, prompted him to think he ought not 
to be elected again. The present Elder is a good brother, 
but the two as Elders together would be able to accomplish 
manifold more.— Eccle. 4:9-12. 

That same idea causes this class to shift its meetings 
around, even including the Sunday services, until some of 
the irregular attendants are discouraged from going out for 
fear they will go to one home and find the meeting is not 
to be held there. That is one reason why they never become 
regular attendants. 

Another thing, some of the classes need advice upon the 
conduct of Berean classes, as quite a few places where they 
think they have Berean classes they really have preaching 
services. The Elder asks the questions, one or two of the 
friends give a very brief answer, and then the Elder preaches 
a 10 or 15-minute sermon; this is repeated with next question, 
and so to the end. 

There are some very small and weak classes where I can 

R5143 : page 378 

imagine this might be allowable, but in every case where I 
have found it to be their method there seemed to be no 
excuse for it. 

We have been enjoying very precious fellowship with the 
Brethren in Illinois, and are greatly rejoicing in the privileges 
of service in the cause which has as its object the 
glory of God. With much Christian Love, 

Yours in His Precious Name, BENJ. H. BARTON. 

THE EDITOR'S REPLY 

I embrace this opportunity to endorse the statement of 
Brother Barton, given above. We need to keep well balanced. 
While the Classes are to retain the full control of 
their own affairs, this does not mean that they should ever 



speak or think slightingly of those whom they have chosen, 
under what they believe to be Divine Guidance, to be their 
Elders or leaders. Let us remember the Apostle's words, 
"Obey those who have the rule over you, and submit yourselves, 
for they watch for your souls as they that must give 
account."— Heb. 13:17. 

A faithful leader, who does not attempt to take the control 
from the hands of the Class, can be, and should be, 
trusted greatly. His is a labor of love, and not for filthy 
lucre; and the love of the whole Class should be freely paid 
to him as in a measure a reward for his faithfulness in the 
service. This does not mean that the control should be left 
in the hands of one Elder, nor that he should feel offended 
that others should be brought to the front, even if he be the 
most competent one. As Elder brethren the leaders should 
be on the lookout to help, encourage and instruct all the 
younger brethren, and to prepare them for the work of 
Deacons, and, subsequently, for Eldership. 

Some of the Lord's dear people seem a little inclined to 
run to the extreme. Strong characters are always in danger 
of going to extremes. The Apostle exhorts, "Let your 
moderation be known to all." To have our affairs conducted 
decently and in order is not Babylonish in any evil sense. 
Can we imagine Heaven as without rules, regulations and 
order? Do we not recognize that order is Heaven's first law? 
Does not the Apostle intimate that the Lord is setting the 
various members in the Body as it pleases Him? Could it 
be wrong for us to co-operate with God in the recognition 
of His will and in carrying it out? Surely not! It is just 
as bad, or even worse, for a small minority to tyrannize over 
the majority as it would be for a reasonable majority to 
tyrannize over the minority. The spirit of love bids us remember 
the Golden Rule, and be as generous to others as 
we would have them be to us. 

I quite agree with Brother Barton's suggestions respecting 
too great a desire for change. Recently we learned of 
one Class which rotates its leaders every week. This would 
not be so bad, of course, for prayer and testimony meeting, 
though even then it would appear as if a month or a quarter 

R5143 : page 379 

would be better for each leader; but in the case of the 
Berean Studies a weekly change seems very injurious, both 
for the leader and for the Class. Continuity, connection with 
previous lessons, is very desirable. We recommend at least 
three months' incumbency for Berean Study leaders. 

RESPECTING BEREAN STUDIES 

Brother Barton's suggestion is good, that a successful 
teacher is one who draws the answers from the Class. It 
is in this very particular that the Berean Studies are helping 
the Lord's people more and more. Now, it is true that 
some persons who have a talent for talking or preaching 
have insufficient talent for teaching— for drawing answers 



from the Class. In such a case it might be well to give different 
Elders an opportunity to show whether they possess 
aptness to teach, which the Apostle explains to be one of 
the qualifications of an Elder. 

Many Class leaders report that it is impossible for them 
to get the friends to study the lesson in advance. It is a 
pity that this is so, but it would not be wise to cause offense 
to any or to hinder any from attending the meetings by berating 
them for failure to study the lessons. We advise 
another course: At the beginning of each study let the 
pages of Studies in the Scriptures referred to in the lesson 
be read by some one capable of reading clearly, distinctly, 
forcefully; and then shut the books and discuss the subject 
along the lines of the questions. A very helpful way 
is for the leader to assist by gathering up some of the fragmentary 
statements of an answer and helping to put them 
together. The effect is to encourage the answerers for another 
occasion and to make the answers more valuable for 
the time. On the whole, the Berean Studies, we are sure, 
are doing very effective work in grounding and establishing 
in the Truth. 

We urge all the dear brethren that they keep up the 
regular reading of the STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES, ten to 
twelve pages a day, wholly regardless of the Berean lessons. 
What will be read will be so much of aid in connection with 
the lesson studies. 



R5143 : page 379 

AN INTERESTING LETTER 

PASTOR RUSSELL:— May I write you my joyful experience 
in which our dear Father so clearly used you and a tract. 

In 1879 I joined a church in a small town where the religious 
atmosphere seemed to be good. After some years I 
moved to a city and at once I identified myself with the 
church there. I soon noticed the absence of the simplicity 
of religion, and the prevalence of form and ceremony, including 
many kinds of entertainments to raise money. I grew 
dissatisfied; and though still loyal to the creed, I only 
attended the services intermittently. 

Last August while homeward bound on the car I sat beside 
a lady who quietly handed me a folded PEOPLES PULPIT 
asking me that I read it and pass it on to others. Simply 
because her quiet manner attracted me I said "Yes." I did 
not think of the paper for several days and then felt too 
busy to take the time. This occurred several times until 
finally I remembered my promise to the woman and read 
the article "Where are the Dead" aloud to my companion. 

Finding the STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES advertised 
therein she purchased them for me as a present. 

From the beginning our hearts and minds accepted all 
from cover to cover, because the Bible was clearly proving 
them. Oh, the years of heart hunger; and never to have 



heard of the STUDIES nor the Truth! 

Later in the Spring we heard you in Boston and Maiden. 

I now have all the STUDIES, BEREAN NOTES, WATCH 
TOWER, etc. Truly much has come to us in one year— the 
satisfying of the longing of a lifetime. May the dear Father 
abundantly bless "the faithful steward"; and the dear unknown 
sister in the Truth who first gave me the PULPIT. In 
her longing to help one she helped two; and I anxiously 
give out PULPITS to others, as she asked, "pass it on." This 
at present seems all I can do. 

I gladly and prayerfully take the Vow trusting to the 
Father's sustaining grace to keep it. 

NELLIE J. WENT WORTH.

1 9 1 2--ANNUAL REPORT-- 1912 

WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY 

DECEMBER 1ST, 1911-DECEMBER 1ST, 1912 

OUR FISCAL YEAR begins and ends December 
1. The year past has been one of the 
most interesting and successful in our 
Society's experience. Every day has 
seemed to add momentum to the work. 
Those who have been enjoying the light of 
Present Truth for years seem generally to 
be ripening in Christian character and in 
loving zeal for the Lord, the Truth and the 
brethren. Nothing pleases us more than this. 

The next most interesting thing is the manifest awakening 
of thinking Christian people of all denominations. 
Many dear people of God have lived in a sort of religious 
lethargy for years. Sometimes they dreamed of converting 
the world, only to be rudely awakened to a fresh 
realization that if the heathen were brought to the same 
civilization that prevails in Christendom, God's will would 
be as far as ever from being done on earth as in Heaven. 
Others have had nightmares of horror as their minds 
would be recalled to the teachings of their creeds— as 
they would remember the old theory that all except the 
saintly Elect few will spend an eternity in torture. 

The awakening ones very generally wander off into 
"Higher Criticism" unbelief, Evolution theories, and general 
doubt respecting everything. Others wander into 
Christian Science, and seek to convince themselves that 
aches and pains are purely imagination, etc., etc. Still 
others wander into New Thought, etc., only to find, in 
these, dangerous quicksands. Under the Lord's providence 
many of all these classes during the past year have 
been brought in contact with the Bible's own teaching, 
which we all have so long lost under the debris of human 
theory and tradition. 

It has been a real pleasure to note, as the weeks went 
by, the increased attendance at the meetings and the increased 
number of meetings being held and the development 
of faithful brethren everywhere as heralds of the 
"good tidings." It has been a great satisfaction to read 
some of the warmly encouraging letters that have been 



received from hungry souls. Some tell of the sweetness 
of the Truth at its very first hearing. Others tell of how 
increasingly precious the Word of God grows, as their 
study of it continues in the light of the Divine Plan of 
the Ages. Surely THE WATCH TOWER is the favored 
place for a review of the entire Harvest field! 

The Lord has greatly blessed the brethren who have 
engaged in Class Extension work, especially in Great 
Britain and America. There is room in this Department 
for the talents of every consecrated child of God. The 
Harvest is great. The laborers are few. All who are 
praying to the Lord to send forth more laborers are surely 
zealously watching for opportunities to take a hand in the 
work themselves. And all this energy is showing fruitage. 
There is nothing like it in the whole world. No money 
inducements ! Everything is done from the love of the 
Lord and His Truth, and from a great desire to "show 
forth the praises of Him who hath called us out of darkness 
into His marvelous light." The blessing is two-fold. 
Not only are many thus brought into the light and caused 
to rejoice in the fullness of our Savior and His great 
salvation, but the laborers all receive spiritual refreshment, 
in proportion as they seek to lay down their lives 
and talents in the Harvest work. 

THE TRUTH IN FOREIGN FIELDS 

Our readers are aware that our Society has been doing 
something in South Africa and South India during the 
past three years. Evidently the Lord's blessing in some 
degree on the work in foreign lands led up to the sending 
of an I.B.S.A. Committee to see the conditions of 
the heathen and to report. The report was given in the 
early part of the year, and published in a special issue 
of this journal. We have received complimentary testimonies 
respecting the truthfulness of the Report and the 
kindly spirit with which those truths, not altogether 
flattering, were presented. Some of these have come 
from foreign lands. 

As a result of that investigation it was decided that 
conditions in heathendom warranted the expenditure of 
some of the Society's funds in proclaiming the Gospel of 
the Kingdom there. Accordingly, free literature was 
printed in six of the principal languages of India, the two 
principal languages of China, in the Japanese and in the 
Korean. This literature was designed principally for 
those professing Christ. But reports indicate that many 
non-Christians have manifested eagerness for the study 
of these things. 

The Bible story of the election of the Church to be 
joint-heirs with Jesus in the Messianic Kingdom was new 
and palatable to many of the Christian natives and others; 
and the Bible assurance presented to them, that their 
friends and forefathers who have died in heathenish darkness 
were not in purgatory nor a hell of eternal torture, 
but in the Bible hell, the grave, was a relief to many. 



R5144: page 384 

God's character, cleared of the awful stain laid upon it by 
our creeds, shone more brightly before the minds of many. 
We may be sure that the effect on honest hearts everywhere 
is the same; namely, that "the Love of God constraineth 
us." 

THE WORK IN SOUTH INDIA 

In South India, where the London Missionary Society 
has had a start for over a hundred years, where it has 
established colleges, etc., the field seemed ripe for the 
Gospel of the Kingdom which we sent to them. As the 
people heard and read of the good time coming, it cheered 
them. According to the reports, the missionaries endeavor 
to keep the people from hearing, even threatening to excommunicate 
those who attend our meetings, and, going 
further than this, threatening to excommunicate whole 
families if even one member attends our meetings. And 
further, they are reported to have declared that they 
would not allow any marrying between any of their faithful 
and any who might come to hear and have a relish for 
the "good tidings of great joy which shall be for all people." 
But in spite of all the threats and endeavors and 
influence and rice, the hungry hearts came to our meetings 
and got some crumbs of comfort, benefiting in the 
present life and preparing them, we trust, for the life to 
come. 

The latest reports from South India are that the missionaries 
of that vicinity, unable to stem the popularity of 
our Bible meetings, have been obliged to start similar 
Bible instruction respecting the Kingdom. Well, whether 
it be from strife or from some other motives, we are 
glad that Messiah's Kingdom is being heralded to whoever 
will be "Israelites indeed" of far-off India. 

If the missionaries would all preach the Gospel of the 
Kingdom, if they would all tell the people the Bible 
Truth respecting "the wages of sin" and "the gift of God," 
the coming of Messiah, the rolling away of the curse and 
the pouring out of God's blessing, and announce that this 
grand consummation of the Divine Plan is near at hand, 
how glad we would be! If now our efforts have stirred 
them up to give the people the real Bible Message, we are 
glad. 

Undoubtedly there are sincere missionaries, but such 
sincere ones are hampered and hindered by the limitations 
placed upon them respecting the creeds— burdens which 
are becoming galling to all "whom the Son makes free." 
But with the missionary, as with the home pastor of 
civilized lands, every one seems bound up in his congregational 

R5145 : page 384 

fetters. Only the courageous "overcomers" could 



even think of bursting the bonds which associate them 

with their food supply, their honor of men, and all opportunity 

they know for Divine service. We sympathize with 

such. Would that they might take a more satisfactory 

course! Would that they might exercise more faith in 

God! 

If the ministers have much advantage every way as respects 
education, time, opportunity for study, etc., they 
are also having weightier trials, because any change of 
denominational base to them means practically their all. 
Few of them realize that this is the very test which the 
Lord wishes to bring to bear upon every one called during 
this Gospel Age— faithfulness, loyalty, zeal for God and 
His Truth— even unto death, counting not their lives dear 
unto themselves. It is of this class that it is written, 
"They shall be Mine, saith the Lord, in that day when I 
make up My jewels."— Mai. 3:17. 

THE NEWSPAPER WORK 

Very encouraging reports come to us respecting the 
influence of the Truth as it goes out from week to week 
through the public press of the English-speaking world. 
Approximately fourteen hundred newspapers are publishing 
our sermons and Sunday School comments every 
week. Our Adversary, God's Adversary, Satan, is, of 
course, displeased now, as he was eighteen hundred years 
ago, to perceive that "the poor have the Gospel preached 
unto them." Yet notwithstanding slanders, misrepresentations 
and violent attacks made by some, God's blessing 
continues with the work; and approximately twelve 
millions of people have the opportunity every week of 
learning a little respecting God and His Word— His Plan. 

One would think that every true Christian in every 
pulpit, in every pew, would thank God that the people 
whom they could not get into the churches are having the 
Message of God's Love laid before their eyes in an attractive 
form weekly. It would be a pity if anything akin 
to jealousy should anywhere spring up to poison a Christian 
heart against a fellow-Christian and fellow-servant. 
Any one engaged in sowing such seed and planting such 
roots of bitterness would assuredly have Divine disfavor 
for his portion in some manner. But our point is, that, 
by the grace of God, the Gospel is preached. Earnest 
souls are being found. Hungry ones are being fed and 
made to rejoice. God is being glorified. 

Let us be thankful to have any share in this great 
work. More and more it appeals to us to be the Lord's 
work. We cannot see how it could progress so marvelously 
as it has done, except under His blessing. We give 
Him our thanks. What if it has stirred up here and 
there an evil spirit in a class which the Bible describes 
as "sons of Belial"? What if these do fulfil toward us 
the Word of the Lord which declares, Whoever of you 
will live godly shall suffer persecution? 

What if we do receive from some revilings, slanders, 



persecutions? Did not the Master forewarn us that this 
would be a part of our wages, saying, "They shall say all 
manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake? Rejoice, 
and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in 
Heaven; for so persecuted they the Prophets which were 
before you." St. Paul, who suffered not only from the 
tongues of men, but also from their whips, declared that 
present experiences were light afflictions, when viewed 
from the standpoint of the glory that is to follow as a 
reward of faithful endurance. 

The proper way to view such experiences is to call to 
mind the blessed revenge which soon we shall be fitted 
and prepared to mete out to our enemies. In the language 
of the Scriptures, we shall by and by heap coals of 
fire upon the heads of those who now persecute us, by 
blessing them, opening the eyes of their understanding and 
helping them onward and upward to greater knowledge 
of God and harmony with His gracious arrangements. 
That is the kind of revenge that God is preparing for 
those who now so grievously misrepresent Him and His 
Word— ignorantly . 

Let us be assured that ignorance rather than malevolence 
is at the foundation of opposition to the Truth. 
It was so at the First Advent. Many of those Scribes and 
Pharisees and chief priests were fairly decent people. 
They had theories of their own respecting God's Plan- 
as to how it must be fulfilled. Their own plans seemed 
better than God's because they were worldly-minded— not 
"Israelites indeed"— at heart. 

Cannot very similar things be said truthfully and kindly 
respecting many of the ecclesiastically prominent in the 
present Harvest time? If so, instead of thinking too 
harshly, let us rather take our cue from St. Peter's words 
when, speaking under the influence of the Holy Spirit, 
he said to repentant Jews, "I wot, brethren, that in ignorance 

R5145 : page 385 

ye did it, as did also your rulers"; and St. Paul's 

words, "for, had they known, they would not have crucified 

the Lord of Glory." 

So ignorance is the excuse for much of the wrong that 
has been done in the world amongst those bearing the 
name of Christ during the past eighteen centuries. And the 
same is true today. It behooves us, while seeking to rid 
ourselves of ignorance and to come to a clear knowledge 
of the Truth, to have sympathy for those whose eyes of 
understanding are still more or less blinded by "the god 
of this world." Let us pray for such, as St. Paul did, 
saying, "I pray God for you that the eyes of your understanding 
opening, ye may be able to comprehend with all 
saints the height and the depth, the length and the breadth 
—and to know the Love of God, which passeth all understanding 
-Eph. 1:18; 3:18,19. 

THE WATCH TOWER LISTS 



Post Office rulings require us to keep our subscription 
lists very clean. When subscriptions expire, but a short 
time can be left for renewals. This insures that our list 
is quite a live one. For several years we have been urging 
the friends that, instead of lending their papers to 
interested friends, they encourage them to become subscribers 
to THE WATCH TOWER and to the papers publishing 
the sermons. Friends of the Cause have provided a 
special Fund out of which any such subscriptions can be 
paid, so that poverty need not be a hindrance to the receiving 
of a regular supply of spiritual food. 

In various ways we know that our list still represents 
only the smaller portion of those really interested in the 
Harvest Message. The list, however, is gradually growing. 
Many of you will be glad to know that we are now 
publishing thirty-five thousand or more copies at every 
issue. We wish we dared hope for an increase of fifteen 
thousand or more during the coming year. The matter is 
in your hands. If you are receiving a blessing through 
these channels, and if you desire to extend the blessings 
to others, be sure you properly advise them. 

THE PILGRIM SERVICE 

The Lord continues His blessing with the Pilgrim 
service. It is not the Society's desire to supply regular 
preaching for the Classes or in any manner to relieve 
them of the responsibility for their own spiritual upbuilding. 
The frequent supply of Pilgrims, therefore, is confined 
to large cities, where a more public witness than the 
local Class is able to provide seems necessary. Even then, 
we encourage the Classes to continue their regular studies, 
just as though the Pilgrims did not come so frequently. 

Pilgrim visits are intended to serve a double purpose: 
First, to assist in giving from time to time public witnesses 
for the Truth— but preferably only one or two public discourses 
at each visit; second, the coming of a Pilgrim 
affords excellent opportunity for refreshing and strengthening 
the Household of Faith. They may be called upon 
to help unravel knotty questions which may arise, although 
there will generally be found in every Class some 
familiar enough with the STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES to 
give a Scriptural answer to nearly every important 
question. 

Many Classes of Bible Students have written us that 
by vote they have chosen the Editor of this journal as 
their Pastor (under-shepherd or bishop). We suggest to 
such that the Pilgrim brethren be considered in a general 
way our assistants, and that they be received accordingly. 
This does not mean that the lessons they give, the spiritual 
food which they present, should be received carelessly, 
or without proper mastication. 

Rather, the Lord would have all of His dear sheep 
use their consecrated minds in rightly dividing the Word 
of Truth, giving special heed to the suggestions and expositions 



of those whom they have reason to believe are 
serving them according to the will of God. This advice 
would be applicable to the presentations of the Pastor or 
the Pilgrims or the local Elders— everybody. 

Whenever public meetings are thought to be desirable, 
remember that one of the chief necessities for such an 
occasion is the procurement of a desirable auditorium- 
clean and in good repute. In many respects opera houses 
or small theatres of good class are more desirable than 
churches, because people of all denominations and those 
who attend no church services will feel free to come. 
The friends are gradually learning that it is useless to 
invite intelligent people to a meeting held in a dingy 
place or more than one flight of stairs from the street 
level. They are learning, too, the necessity for advertising 
meetings when they have good halls. 

For success, the three things must co-operate— a 
speaker of ability, a desirable auditorium and the meeting 
well advertised. In the past much advertising effort has 
been wasted by poor auditoriums. Where notified that a 
public meeting is desired the Society will, as far as possible, 
apportion Sundays— especially if the town is of reasonable 
size and if the promises in respect to auditorium, 
etc., are encouraging. Increase of wisdom along these 
lines is helping forward the work in every direction. 
These same remarks apply in a lesser degree to Class 
Extension work, by which we mean meetings held in surrounding 

R5146 : page 385 

villages and towns by those Elders who have 

talent for public speaking and whose services are not 

needed by the local Class sending them forth. The Society 

has had the pleasure of co-operating along these 

lines during the year. The results are encouraging every 

way. All classes that have the talent to spare and that 

have not engaged in this Extension work should write to 

us for particulars at once. This work is in harmony with 

the Master's instruction, Pray the Lord of the Harvest 

that He will send forth more laborers into His vineyard. 

Let us labor while we pray.— Matt. 9:38.

THE CORRESPONDENCE DEPARTMENT 

Naturally, our correspondence increases every year. 
However, a change is noticeable in the character of the 
communications. Those who have been long on our list 
are asking fewer questions, finding that they have the 
answers already in THE WATCH TOWER and in the six 
volumes of STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES. But our clerical 
force is still busily engaged in replying to questions from 
beginners, who have received of our literature and desire 
further spiritual nourishment. Herewith we present to 
you a memorandum of the number of letters received and 

R5146 : page 386 

the number dispatched. All parts of the earth are represented 
in our mail. 

Total letters received 1912— Brooklyn 143,756 

Total letters dispatched 1912-Brooklyn 264,190 

THE COLPORTEUR WORK 

It amazes us that the sale of STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES 
continues as it does. Colporteurs report to us that 
with the new method they are using they can generally 
sell the entire set of six volumes as easily as they formerly 
sold one volume or three volumes. The general 
awakening amongst Christian people is permitting many 
of them to become enlightened, preparing them for the 
Truth. They are satisfied neither with the darkness of 
the past, nor with the unbelief of Higher Criticism or 
Evolution. A soul-hunger is abroad in the world— with 
an increasing number of people. We thank God that we 
have for them the true Bread of Life, of which both they 
and we have so long sung, 
"It satisfies my longings 
As nothing else can do." 

The number of volumes of STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES, 
etc., circulated during the year, we here report 
with considerable satisfaction. We congratulate especially 
all the dear Colporteurs. Nearly all of these books 
were sold by them. 

The total number of volumes of STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES 
circulated in 1912 was 634,951. 

FREE LITERATURE CIRCULATED 

Our two little papers, PEOPLES PULPIT and EVERYBODY'S 
PAPER, circulated for the most part free, have gone 
far and wide this year in thirty-three different languages. 



The friends, our readers, knowing that they can have 
literature in any language, are more and more availing 
themselves of the privilege and seeking to interest their 
neighbors. Incidentally we remark that the majority of 
people can serve the Lord's Cause much better by handing 
a tract with a few commendatory words than by seeking 
to explain the Divine Plan. So many forget in telling of 
God's glorious Plan that their hearers are comparatively 
ignorant of it— that they know only the first principles of 
the Gospel of Christ, and have need that one teach them 
again the rudiments. A teacher must be wise and give 
only the kind and only the quantity that will nourish.— 
Heb. 5:12-14. 

Too many make a mistake, choking their friends with 
strong meat. Others make the mistake of talking too 
boastfully and drawing unpleasing comparisons, saying, 
What you believe, and, What we believe. We are glad, 
however, that all are gradually learning the import of the 
Master's words, "Be ye wise as serpents, harmless as 
doves." Let us remember that we not long ago were in 
similar darkness to that which generally prevails— and 
still we were Christians. 

Hence we should not, in talking to our friends, give 
any hint that they do not belong to the family of God. 
Rather we find it the much better way to class ourselves 
in with all as true neighbors, to acknowledge that once 
we were in darkness, and to express the thought that all 
Christian people are becoming more and more enlightened 
in respect to the teaching of God's Word, because 
we are now living in God's due time for revealing some of 
the secrets of God's glorious Plan of the Ages. We are 
now living in the time of which the Prophet Daniel declared, 
"The wise shall understand"— the Wise Virgin 
class. -Dan. 12:10; Matt. 25:1-3. 

TRACTS DISTRIBUTED, INCLUDING EVERYBODY'S PAPER 
AND PEOPLES PULPIT 

November 1, 1911, to November 1, 1912. 

In the English language 34,672,475 copies. 

In all other languages 848,000 " 

Grand total of tracts 35,520,475 " 

Equaling in usual tract pages 481,632,950 pages. 

The above does not include the millions published in Great 
Britain and Australia nor in foreign languages. 

FINANCIAL REPORT 

As we look back over the past, we perceive a steady 
progress in the amount of money donated to the Tract Fund 
for the promulgation of the Truth. Each year has shown 
a little better than its predecessor, and the present one is 



no exception to this rule. Remember, too, that few of our 
donations are large— that not many WATCH TOWER subscribers 
have much of this world's goods. Two things astonish 
our enemies and our friends:— 

(1) While all denominations of Christendom are in 
distress because of increased expenditure and decreased 
contributions and because they are ashamed to beg more 
than they have done, our receipts, on the contrary, without 
solicitation, come gradually forward, apparently just 

as they are needed. Or rather, we should say, keeping 
within our receipts we are enabled to push the work a 
little more and a little more every year. Of course, we 
could do much more if we had more means; but we are 
not worried about that, for if the Lord desires us to do 
greater things, He is abundantly able to provide the means. 

(2) The other point which surprises both our enemies 
and our friends is the large amount of work accomplished 
with the small amount of money expended. This is attributable 
to the fact that we pay no salaries, and all of our 

expenses are kept at a minimum. Our home and office force 

of over a hundred persons all labor diligently, earnestly, 

perseveringly, rendering their services as unto the Lord. 

We have no drones. All are provided for decently, comfortably, 

as, we believe, the Lord would be pleased with, 

but very inexpensively. This is one secret of our ability 

to do more than others with the same amount of money.

We will not here mention particularly the outlook for 
the future, but will leave that for next issue. We thank 



God for the privileges and blessings of the year closing, 

R5147 : page 387 

and rejoice with you all that by His grace we have had 
the privilege of His service. Let us press forward, 
"Still achieving, still pursuing." 
Let us not be fearful of the great Adversary's roar, 
when, like a roaring lion, he would seek to intimidate us. 
"Be of good courage and He shall strengthen thine heart." 
"He who has begun a good work in us is able to complete 
it." "He knoweth our frame and remembereth that we are 
dust." He will not suffer us to be tempted above that 
we are able, but will, with every temptation, provide a 
way of escape.— I Cor. 10:13. 

"Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, 

But trust Him for His grace; 
Behind a frowning providence 

He hides a smiling face. 

"Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take; 

The clouds ye so much dread 
Are big with mercy and shall break 

In blessings on your head."

THE ADVERSARY'S TACTICS 

"For we are not ignorant of his devices."— 2 Cor. 2:11. 

AS WE PROGRESS toward the consummation 
of the Harvest, it should not surprise us that 
in every way the Adversary becomes more 
persistent in his attacks. Opposition to the 
Divine Plan of the Ages is on the increase 
everywhere. Slanderous misrepresentations 
are so unblushingly made as to carry a 
measure of conviction with them, to the 
injury of the Cause we serve. 

What Satan cannot do against the Truth 
along the lines of logic, the Bible and common sense, he 
seeks to do through slanderous misrepresentations of all 
who take their stand on the side of Truth; and his opposition 
is incurred usually in proportion to the activity of 
the servants of the Truth. This opposition is to them a 
trial of faith and of patient endurance. It tests their loyalty 
to God, to the Truth and to the brethren. It becomes, 
likewise, a test of brotherly love to the household of faith. 
It does a sifting or separating work. "The Lord your God 
proveth you."— Deut. 13:3. 

R5148 : page 387 



The same line of attack furnishes special trials for the 
church nominal— both wheat and tares. It gives opportunity 
for exhibitions of envy, anger, malice, hatred, strife, 
evil-surmising and evil-speaking. Thus many are being 
tested and their love of unrighteousness is being shown. 
"By their fruits ye shall know them." (Matt. 7:20.) The 
thorn and brier classes, however closely affiliated with 
religious things, are not Vine branches. They do 
not bear the fruit of the Vine, but contrariwise are injurious 
to the Lord's people. "The poison of asps is 
under their lips." Some of them are courageous enough 
to make lies; others, less courageous, love the lies and are 
mean enough to circulate them. The advance of the Day 
of the Lord will ultimately reveal the true situation. Some 
will have shame and contempt, while others will shine as 
the stars forever and ever. 

All who have the Spirit of the Lord, the spirit of meekness, 
gentleness, patience, long-suffering, brotherly-kindness 
and love— will be tested, too, along these same lines. 
The Lord's will for such is that they should deepen and 
broaden their characters along all these lines in proportion 
as contrary temptations assail them. Thus more and more 
will they become copies of God's dear Son, and the trials 
will assist in making them meet, fit for the Kingdom. 

ACCUSER OF THE BRETHREN 

Another of Satan's devices is to discourage the Lord's 
faithful disciples who are seeking to know and to do His 
will. The more conscientious they are, the more subject 
they will be to Satan's suggestions of unworthiness, rejection, 
condemnation, Second Death. God permits this 
as a test or trial to faith. "Without faith it is impossible 
to please Him." To be developed, faith must be tried with 
opposition. The more our faith is developed, the more 
pleasing in the Father's sight we shall be. He would have 
our faith in Himself implicit, unwavering. 

The Adversary, on the contrary, would destroy our 
faith. Sometimes he attempts this by misrepresenting 
God's character as unloving, unjust, unkind, and sometimes 
by exaggerating our weaknesses and failures, to 
cause us to cease striving for the goal of Divine approval. 
He would have us give up in despair. 

Persons who have been obsessed by evil spirits tell 
plainly that first of all the spirits personated God and His 
angels, advised prayer, etc. Afterwards they gave evil 
suggestions. By and by they gave both good and evil 
suggestions. The evil suggestions entertained, they would 
next condemn the individual for having entertained them. 
Finally all pretense would be dropped, and the individual 
would be told that he had sinned away all Divine favor 
and was wholly at the mercy of the evil spirits. Then 
would come suggestions of evil deeds or of suicide, the 
endeavor being made to drive the individual to a full surrender 
of his mind, his will, in order to full possession 



and mental unbalance. 

The only remedy for persons in such a deplorable condition 
is that they exert their will power to oppose all 
such false suggestions. Nothing is so helpful under such 
circumstances as correct knowledge of the Divine teaching 
respecting God's Love and the abundance of His 
merciful provision in Christ. Persons in this condition 
should be encouraged to cast themselves fully and unreservedly 
at the foot of the cross in the spirit of their 
minds— in fullness of consecration. Then in proportion 
to their faith they may lay hold upon the Lord in prayer 
for complete deliverance from the Adversary's power. 
We know of no other way to get rid of the evil spirits. 

There are also cases where the obsession has taken 
place and where the Adversary seems to be able to exercise 
an evil influence upon the mind, causing doubt, fear, 
alienation from the Lord. Generally "sin lieth at the 
door"— some violation of the soul's covenants with the 
Lord. Such are in danger of great gloom, loss of faith, 
trust— everything. The cure for their case is a knowledge 
of God's real character— His great Love and sympathy 
exercised through the Lord Jesus Christ and made available 
through Him to all who give their lives in full 
consecration. 

Faith should triumph, or the light of joy and blessing 
will die. "According to your faith be it unto you," is the 
Divine rule. Those who will not exercise the faith will 
never be acceptable to the Father for membership in the 
Kingdom class. Such must wait for the next Age and 
have different experiences. The Little Flock, the Elect 
ones whom the Lord is now choosing, must all be faith-full. 

"THE WICKED ONE TOUCHETH HIM NOT" 

The Apostle John declares that a certain course of 
conduct is possible in which the Adversary would be unable 
to touch us. (I John 5:18.) The picture brought 
before our mental eyes is that of a charmed circle, within 
which God's people may come. This circle is not a fence, 

R5148 : page 388 

but merely a line of light, which can easily be overstepped. 
On the inside of that circle is the Lord's favor. The very 
center of it is the Lord Himself, the Head of the Church. 
The exhortation of the Scriptures, the leadings of the 
Holy Spirit, and the providences of the Lord, all encourage 
His followers to press close to Him— "Nearer, my 
God, to Thee." 

Outside the charmed circle are the powers of evil. 
These are sometimes allowed to touch the earthly interests 
and temporal affairs of the children of the Light; 
but the demon influence is not permitted to really touch 
the New Creatures in Christ inside this circle. Over 
that line they cannot exercise their influence. But alas! 
lured by the world, the flesh and the Devil, some of the 



saints at times go too close to the line, perhaps pursuing 
some fleshly bait or golden bauble or earthly honor. Such 
the Adversary is ever ready to lay hold of, to drag them 
out into the darkness of sin, doubt, despair— further and 
further away from the Lord. 

The lesson of this picture to all Spirit-begotten children 
of God is, "Abide in Him," "Abstain from all appearance 
of evil," "Draw near unto God," "Press onward and 
upward," "Take heed to yourselves," "Forget the things 
that are behind," "Mortify your flesh," and earthly desires 
and ambitions, Keep close to the Master, that "the Wicked 
One touch you not." 

But we again remind any who may be touched by the 
Adversary and temporarily ensnared that God is full of 
loving-kindness, that His mercy endureth forever, for all 
those who desire to live in harmony with Him. While 
it is true that the nearer we get to the separating line, 
the nearer do we come within the range of the Adversary's 
influence and power, and the weaker becomes the 
power of the Truth, the Spirit of the Lord, in our control, 
nevertheless, there is joy in Heaven over one sinner that 
repenteth, and the Lord will welcome the strayed sheep, 
even though He temporarily allow trying experiences. 
Ultimately to the returning one these experiences will 
prove valuable lessons, safeguarding against any further 
tendency to stray or to dally with earthly things. 



R5147 : page 388 

THE PHILOSOPHY OF OUR DAILY EXPERIENCES 

"If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; 
for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?"— Heb. 12:7. 

ALL CHASTENINGS are testings, but all 
chastenings are not necessarily punishments. 
We should judge of the purpose of 
our experiences by self-examination, that 
we may ascertain whether in our conduct 
there has been something out of harmony 
with the Father's will. In every case our 
experience is a test of our loyalty of heart- 
as to our willingness to learn the lessons 
which the Lord is seeking to teach us and 
our recognition of the source from which they come. 

The trials and difficulties of the consecrated child of 
God are not to be esteemed as the results of Divine carelessness 
or indifference in regard to his interests, but 
rather as the outworkings of Divine providence in his 
behalf. Those who can see the matter from this viewpoint 
are thus enabled to learn some of life's most helpful 
lessons, and are thereby prepared for the glorious future 
which God has arranged for those who faithfully carry 
out their Covenant of sacrifice. 



Ordinarily the word chastisement is used to signify 
correction for wrongdoing. But in the Bible, it is especially 
used to convey the thought of discipline or instruction 
in righteousness. Sometimes we use it in this way 
in the ordinary affairs of life. If we sin, we receive punishment 
indeed. But those who are trying to do right 
are continually receiving discipline of the Lord. There 
is a purpose in this training, or chastisement. The Church 
is learning how to build character pleasing in the Father's 
sight, to be well qualified for particular service; and discipline 
is the means employed for that instruction. 

If a man were about to train a dog for the circus, he 
would first choose the right kind of animal for that 
special service. He would not think of selecting any 
chance poodle that might come to hand, but would find a 
dog that was capable of being taught. In carrying out 
his course of instruction, he might find it necessary to 
chastise the dog in order to teach him some trick. This 
would not mean that the animal was bad, surly or vicious, 
but that there was no other way by which he could learn. 
An animal that was being fitted to guard the house would 
not need the same training that was necessary for the 
dog that was to perform in public. The watch-dog must 
know how to guard property; but the animal that is to 
jump through hoops, etc., must be trained carefully by 
those who have in mind his future career. 

So with the Church. They need practical lessons in 
character-development of a very high order, and consequently 
they are receiving experimental knowledge such 
as no other creatures in the universe receive. Because 
they are trying to live righteously, trying to please the 
Heavenly Father, they are being chastened for instruction, 
that they may be fully conformed to the Divine will, 
that they may lay aside their own preferences, that they 
may not do their own will, but that of the Lord. 

Such experiences are not for mankind in general. 
Such experiences were not given to Adam. He was required 
to live merely in harmony with his environment 
and to be obedient to the Heavenly Father. Such experiences 
are not for the angels. They are required merely 
to live righteously, to avoid sin and to use their bodies in 
harmony with the Divine purposes of their creation. They 
occupy such positions as are natural to them. Therefore 
the angels have never required chastisements. 

SUFFERING DEVELOPS CHARACTER OF A HIGH ORDER 

With those, however, who are to be associated with 
the Redeemer and ultimately to be exalted to the Divine 
nature and glory, it is necessary that they make special 
manifestations of loyalty, of self-abasement and of self-sacrifice. 
What was true of Christ is also true of the 
Church, which is His Body, and which He purchased 
with His own precious blood. (Col. 1:24; Acts 20:28.) 
We are called to follow in His footsteps; hence every son 
whom the Father receives is chastised.— Heb. 12:6,7. 



Every child of God will need chastening. If we wander 
from the paths of righteousness, we are chastened to 
bring us back; but even if we did not wander, we should 
still need chastisement, that we might learn obedience. 
Our Lord Himself learned obedience by the things which 
He suffered. (Heb. 5:8.) Of St. Paul the Lord said, "I 
will show him how great things he must suffer for My 
name's sake." (Acts 9:16.) The Apostle was put 
through disciplinary experiences because he was a favored 
child of God. 

We revert to our illustration of the dog under training 
for a special purpose. The dog must yield himself 
submissively to his teacher. Another dog that was watching 

R5147 : page 389 

the process by which the one was being trained might 

think that he was suffering unnecessary hardship, and 

might feel that if it were himself, he would assert his 

rights and not suffer so much. But in the end the trained 

animal would prove to be the more valuable, for the one 

that had escaped the suffering would remain only a commonplace 

dog. 

So it is with the Church. There are people who say 
of us, "Those who endeavor to do God's will suffer more 
than do those who do not try; we do not care to undertake 
any such experience." These people may succeed in 
having fewer trials in the present life, but they will have 
blessings of a lower order in the world to come, when the 
faithful Church will be glorified with her Lord and Head. 

These experiences with trouble are the very tests of 
character necessary for our development. The reason 
why some of the consecrated will get into the Great Company 
is that they have not had enough determination- 
enough strength of character. In the time of trouble, such 
will either develop that strength by faithfulness under 
severe trial or they will go into the Second Death. 

The Great Company class are loyal in heart or they 
would not be in that class. But they are willing to compromise; 
and because of this willingness to do so, they 
weaken their character. In order to be overcomers they 
must develop this element of character at any cost. 

Let us be thankful that we are of those who appreciate 
the privilege of being trained in the School of 
Christ— of suffering with Him now and of reigning with 
Him by and by. In this school we are learning valuable 
lessons of experience. Here we receive chastisements, 
many of which are not punishments for sins, but preparation 
for the work of the next Age. Let us remember that 
unless we are willing to learn these lessons and to endure 
hardness, we shall not be prepared to enter into the eternal 
glory.~2 Tim. 2:3; I Pet. 5:10. 

All things are ours; for we are Christ's and Christ is 
God's, and God called Christ to these glorious experiences. 
(I Cor. 3:21-23.) Whoever does not appreciate the 
spiritual joys can hardly be expected to endure the present 



training with patience and thankfulness. We must 

see something of "the glory that shall follow" (I Pet. 1:11) 

in order to realize the necessity of the vicissitudes 

of the present trial time. 



R5148 : page 389 

WHAT CONSTITUTES PURITY OF HEART 

"Blessed are the pure in heart; for 
they shall see God. "--Matt. 5:8. 

THE WORD pure is a comprehensive term, 

meaning without adulteration, sincere, unsullied. 

Purity of heart is purity of motive, 

of intention, of effort, of will— purity in the 

sense of transparency, of truthfulness. In 

other words, Blessed are the honest-hearted 

—those who have absolutely right intentions. 

The word heart in this text does not refer 

to the organ which pumps the blood throughout 

the system, but to the intention, the will 

of the man. 

In his creation, man was made in the image of God, 
and so was originally pure in heart— honest, sincere, 
truthful, perfect in intention; but by reason of the fall 
from his natural condition, sin and selfishness have developed 
in his heart, and the Godlike qualities given him 
in his creation have been to a considerable degree obliterated. 
While there are many worldly people who to 
some extent might claim honesty of heart, yet only those 
who have given themselves to God in full consecration 
can belong to the class which shall see Him. 

When one has made a full consecration of himself and 
has been begotten by the Holy Spirit, he is said to have 
a new heart, a new will, new ambitions, new desires. 
Where the conversion from sin to righteousness is thorough, 
it may be truthfully said, "Old things have passed 
away; behold, all things are become new." (2 Cor. 5:17.) 
To accomplish so radical a change requires the operation 
of a powerful influence— that of the Holy Spirit. 

Purity of thought, however, does not mean absolute 
perfection of thought, word and deed. To this condition 
no member of the fallen race can attain until the beneficent 
influences of the Kingdom shall have restored the race 
to its original perfection. But to will right, to will perfectly, 
to be pure in heart, is quite possible; indeed, it is 
very necessary to all who desire Divine approval. The 
standard set before us, to which our hearts, our wills, 
must give assent, is the Divine Standard, "Be ye perfect, 
even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect."— 
Matt. 5:48. 

As long as we are in the flesh, we are obliged to think, 
to speak and to act through the imperfect medium of the 



fallen body, whose affections are continually in opposition 
to the new will and must be resisted. Therefore to perform 
all that the new will would prompt is sometimes beyond 
the ability of the Lord's most earnest followers: 
and all have need that the merit of Christ cover their 
blemishes, so that the new will, the new heart, may be 

R5149 : page 389 

judged of the Lord and tested as to its worthiness or unworthiness 
of eternal life and the attendant blessings 
which God has promised to the overcomer. 

Only the pure in heart have the promise of seeing 
God. These continue faithful to the end of their pilgrimage; 
and not only do they attain the character-likeness 
of the Lord Jesus in their purity of heart intention 
toward all, but eventually they shall be made like 
Him and "see Him as He is," in the glorious change of 
the First Resurrection.— I John 3:2. 

HONORABLE MOTIVES INDICATIVE OF HEART PURITY 

When one finds imperfection in himself, when he discovers 
that he is not up to the glorious standard of 
righteousness set forth in the Scriptures, when he realizes 
that he comes short of the glory of God, then it becomes 
his privilege to seek to amend his conduct. The very 
act of deciding to do right is the beginning of the process 
by which one gets a new mind, a new will. This renewing 
of the mind corresponds to the perfecting of certain 
organs of the brain. 

The will is able to control the whole body. Occasionally 
there will be opposition from one or another of 
the lower organs, which will resent the control of the 
superior ones; but in a general way, the will has the 
mastery. The qualities which constitute the mind were 
originally a part of the image of God; but all of the powers 
of the human mind have been injured by the fall of 
man. All have been more or less weakened. 

The organs of veneration, conscientiousness and firmness 
form a very powerful combination. If these qualities 
rule the life, the growth of the new mind will be 
rapid. Whoever has sufficient brain capacity to determine 
to do right and to serve God to the best of his ability, 
may, notwithstanding the weakness of his flesh, will to 
live in accordance with the Divine standard. So long 
as the motives of his new will are honorable, he is pure 
in heart; and as long as he maintains that condition, he 

R5149 : page 390 

has the assurance that he may ultimately reach perfection 
through obedience. 

In olden times, this purity of heart intention was as 
much as any one could have. On one occasion, Joshua 
said, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." 



(Josh. 24:15.) In that statement the old warrior manifested 
purity of heart— the determination of the mind to 
serve the Lord. David and all the other Ancient Worthies 
had this determination. This was as much as they could 
do; and therefore, they had this testimony, that they 
"pleased God."-Heb. 11:5,6,39. 

Whoever has this determination shall be blessed. 
He shall one day see the light of God's countenance. If, 
however, for a season he should fail to maintain this 
standard, there would be a cloud between him and the 
Lord. This can be removed only by repentance and forgiveness. 
Then with the Psalmist he could say, "Return 
unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully 
with thee."— Psa. 116:7. 

During the Gospel Age, the people of God may have, 
not only this purity of heart, or conversion to the Lord, 
turning to Him in fulness of consecration through the 
precious blood of Christ, but also something more. They 
may have the Divine acceptance of that consecration and 
the begetting of the Holy Spirit. Therefore these are 
the children of God in a sense peculiar to this Age. These 
may cry, "Abba, Father." (Rom. 8:15.) To them, God is 
not merely the Controller of the Universe, but their Father. 

During the Gospel Age, the people of God may have 
special blessings greater than anything previously enjoyed. 
They have the illuminating power of the Holy 
Spirit, which comes through the Divine Word, the Divine 
providences, etc. It requires an illumination of our mental 
conceptions in order that we may see God. Therefore 
the Church of Christ, who are begotten of the Holy 
Spirit, may see Him with the eyes of their understanding 
in a sense in which the Ancient Worthies could not. 

If we maintain our purity of heart by purity of mind, 
we may have the assurance of future blessings as well as 
of present favor and happiness. If this be our course in 
"the life that now is," we have the Lord's promise that 
we shall see Him in a very special sense in the life "which 
is to come." We shall be changed to spirit beings and 
shall see Him as He is and shall share His glory. Every 
one who has this hope within him purifies himself, even 
as the Lord is pure.— I John 3:2,3. 



R5149 : page 390 

BY ONE MAN'S SIN THE DEATH-CURSE 

-JANUARY 19.-GENESIS 3.- 

"Every one that committeth sin is the 
bond-servant of sin."— John 8:34. 

ADAM'S FIRST SIN brought the penalty specified 

in this lesson; but it is not the thought 

that subsequent sins brought other additional 



penalties. The Bible proposition is 

that God, having made Adam perfect, required 

perfect obedience as the condition of 

his continuance in Divine favor and everlasting 

life. One act of disobedience broke 

the covenant between God and Adam by 

which he was treated as a son and guaranteed 

everlasting life. (Hosea 6:7, Margin.) As a sinner 

he dropped from favor immediately, under the sentence, 

"Dying thou shaltdie." 

Nothing that Adam or his children could do subsequently 
could alter that sentence or recover to him 
covenant relationship with God. The death penalty was 
the limit. It could not be increased by any subsequent 
sins, just as a murderer sentenced to be hanged could not 
receive a more severe penalty, whether he had committed 
one murder or a thousand. By a law of nature, heredity, 
Father Adam transmitted to his race a share of what he 
possessed, both good and bad. Hence we were all born in 
sin and "shapen in iniquity; in sin did my mother conceive 
me."-Psa. 51:5. 

As Adam could not increase his penalty, neither can 
his children. As Adam could not restore himself to 
covenant relationship with God, neither can his children. 
But as Adam could, by obedience to the Divine Law, prolong 
the process of his dying, so may his children. He 
was nine hundred and thirty years dying before the death 
penalty was fully attained. But the impairment wrought 
by sin has so progressed that many of Adam's children 
die in infancy, and few can maintain the struggle for 
existence for a hundred years. 

DEATH THE CURSE--NOT TORTURE 

Our forefathers during the Dark Ages, before the 
day of printing and Bibles and general education, got 
some strange misunderstandings of the Heavenly 
Father's character and Plan. And their errors of doctrine 
naturally led them on to errors of conduct, that, to 
us, are abhorrent. Misunderstanding the Bible to teach 
that God arranged for the eternal torture of all mankind 
except a saintly few, the true Church, they sought to 
copy their misconception of Jehovah by torturing their 
fellow-creatures. Some were stoned, some sawn asunder, 
some made outcasts, some tortured on the rack, some had 
their tongues cut out by the roots, some were skinned 
alive and some were roasted at the stake. 

But we must not think of these, our forefathers, as 
fiendish at heart, but as deceived by what St. Paul calls 
"doctrines of demons." (I Tim. 4:1.) We sympathize 
with their godly intentions, but reprobate their devilish 
procedures. It is because God's people have been gradually 
getting back nearer and nearer to the teaching of 
His Word, and its spirit, that the horrible practises of the 
past are no longer approved. But many have much yet 
to learn respecting the true Plan of God— the true teaching 



of the Bible. We must be zealous for ourselves and 
patient with others. 

One of the first lessons for us to learn is that the 
curse which God pronounced against our race is not a 
sentence to eternal torment at the hands of devils, but 
plainly and simply, as the Apostle says, "The wages of 
sin is death." Then he points us to the remedy, a resurrection 
from death, secured for all through the Redeemer's 
death at Calvary. The Apostle therefore adds, "But 
the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our 
Lord."— Rom. 6:23. 

All experience the death penalty, with its weakness, 
pain, sorrow, tears. All will have an opportunity sometime 
of learning of God's grace in Christ and of manifesting 
obedience to the Divine will and of regaining 
everlasting life through Messiah's redemptive work and 
His Millennial Kingdom with its Restitution. For some, 
a few, a Little Flock, who in this Age have ears to hear 
and hearts to obey the Master's voice, God has provided 
glorious things, far superior to anything that Adam had 
or lost. 

To those who now hear, consecrate, sacrifice their 
own wills, and walk in Jesus' footsteps, God promises a 
share in the First Resurrection, to glory, honor, immortality, 
the Divine nature. These will constitute the Bride 

R5150 : page 391 

class and be joint-heirs with the Master as His Elect, in 
His glorious Kingdom, which soon is to be established 
for the rolling away of the curse of sin and death and 
the lifting up of humanity— of all who will— to all that 
was lost in Eden and redeemed at Calvary. 

THE LESSON OF THIS STUDY 

If our Christian forefathers could but properly have 
studied and appreciated today's lesson, they would have 
known what the Bible teaches respecting "the wages of 
sin," and would soon have seen how seriously public 
thought had drifted away from the Divine testimony 
to "doctrines of demons." How plain the Scriptural 
account! How distinctly God forewarned our first 
parents that the eating of the forbidden fruit would be 
disobedience and would bring upon them the death 
penalty ! 

After they had disobeyed, can we not see the force 
of the declaration that God drove them out of the Garden 
of Eden that they might die— that the penalty He pronounced 
against them might be accomplished? Had they 
continued in Eden, eating of its life-sustaining fruits, they 
would have continued to live indefinitely. In order that 
the sentence of death might be executed upon them, they 
were driven out and the angel's flaming sword protected 
the entrance to Paradise. 

Moreover, after their expulsion from Eden God explained 



to our first parents the whole procedure, saying, 
"Cursed [unfit] is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow 
shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns and 
thistles shall it bring forth unto thee. ..In the sweat 
of thy face shalt thou eat bread, until thou return unto 
the ground;. ..for dust thou art and unto dust shalt 
thou return."— Genesis 3:17-19. 

WHY EVIL WAS PERMITTED 

The Bible distinctly tells us that God foreknew the fall 
of man, and that before the foundation of the world, in 
His purpose, He had provided the Lamb of God to take 
away the sin of the world and thus to effect ultimately a 
reconciliation for all of Adam's race desirous of living 
righteously. God had a glorious purpose interwoven with 
His permission of sin, which the majority, even of Bible 
students, evidently but faintly discerned until lately. 

The words of Jesus intimate that shortly, before the 
establishment of His Kingdom, His Church will be like 
a company of virgins, all pure and justified, but some of 
them wise and some of them foolish. He intimates that 
at that time the Wise Virgin class will understand features 
of the Divine Plan previously kept secret. Evidently 
we are living in such a time now. It is on this account 
and not by their own superior wisdom that the Wise Virgin 
class is today attaining an appreciation of God's Plan, 
including His reasons for having permitted a reign of 
Sin and Death amongst mankind for six thousand years 
—which is to be abolished by Messiah's Reign of Righteousness 
during the Seventh Great Thousand-Year Day. 
We may deal with this subject in a later study. 

THE TEMPTATION OF EVE 

How Lucifer and holy angels became disloyal to God, 
and how Lucifer acquired the name Satan, or Adversary 
of God, we will inquire into later. In this lesson he is 
shown as seeking to alienate the affections of our first 
parents from the Creator, and, by tempting them to sin, to 
bring them under the death penalty, that he might enslave 
them as servants of sin. A spirit being, he would 
be unseen to Mother Eve, except as he would assume 
some kind of a material body. It suited his purposes to 
possess a serpent and through it to tempt Mother Eve. 

The serpent doubtless spoke by signs, as we sometimes 
say, "Actions speak louder than words." The serpent ate 
of the forbidden fruit in the sight of the woman and then 
manifested its wisdom, its sagacity. The woman perceived. 
She craved knowledge. Why had God forbidden 
that particular fruit? It did not kill the serpent. Why 
should it kill her? The serpent seemed wise. Why should 
not that fruit make her more wise? Could it be that God 
wished to keep them in ignorance, and for that reason had 
forbidden their eating of the fruit? 

Such disloyal thoughts should have been promptly 



spurned. Confidence in their Creator should have been 
complete. But the insidious poison worked. More and 
more Mother Eve craved knowledge and imagined what 
wonderful blessings it would bring. She surmised that 
her husband would not consent, so she ate alone. She 
was not deceived as respects the wrongdoing, but she 
was deceived regarding the result. Seeing that the serpent 
was not poisoned by the fruit, she did not realize 
that the poison to her was that of disobedience, bringing 
the death sentence. Father Adam's eating of the fruit 
was with full knowledge of the result. In love with his 
wife, he ate knowingly, preferring to die with her rather 
than to live without her.

THE MARK OF CAIN 

--JANUARY 26.-GENESIS 4:1-15.- 

"Whoso hateth his brother is a murderer."— 1 John 3:15. 

THE first tragedy of Earth was disobedience to 

God— the eating of the forbidden fruit. The 

next generation saw the image of God so 

marred that murder resulted from a fit of 

jealousy. Since the Bible teaches that our 

first parents were perfect, in the image of 

their Creator, the question arises, How could 

such noble parentage bring forth a son of 

Cain's evil disposition? As we look back 

for six thousand years and consider the 

reign of Sin and Death for so long a period, we do not 

wonder that we see so low and groveling samples of human 

depravity— some fallen more particularly in one direction 

and some in another. Some we class as almost 

entirely devoid of every trace of the Divine character, and 

these we designate "degenerates." 

It is not necessary for us to suppose that Cain was 
"degenerate" in the present day acceptance of that word. 
Undoubtedly, with so noble a parentage, he must have 
been a great man in many ways. But he was birthmarked, 
as we all are, with selfishness. It was after the 
tragedy of Eden, after their expulsion from Paradise to 
the unfit earth, after they were cut off from access to the 
life-sustaining fruits of Eden, after they began to toil 
with sweat of face in battling with the thorns and thistles 
of the earth— it was then that Cain was born. The period 
of his gestation was surely one of much mental distress 
to his mother. As she murmured respecting the loss of 
her Eden home and selfishly coveted it, she doubtless 
marked her child with discontent and selfishness also. 

By the time Abel was born, doubtless our first parents 
had become more reconciled to their fate and more accustomed 



to their surroundings. Hence it is fair to suppose 
that Abel was born under more favorable conditions than 
Cain. We are not by this argument justifying murder, 
but we are getting our minds to take a sympathetic view 

R5150 : page 392 

of the murderer's case, corresponding to the view God took 
of it, as expressed in today's study. God reprobated and 
condemned the sinner, and arranged for his special punishment; 
but none of His messages to the murderer indicate 
bitterness or hatred on the part of the Great Judge. 

So parents, while correcting their children with necessary 
severity, should allow no sentiment to have control 
of their hearts contrary to love or the best interests and 
highest welfare of their children. So the laws of men, in 
dealing with all forms of vice and crime, including murder, 
should be as swift as righteous judgment will permit 
and as severe as seems necessary in the interests of society; 
but those laws should never be vengeful. They should 
always recognize the fact that all mankind were born in 
sin, misshapen in iniquity— in sin did our mothers conceive 
us. Hence, "There is none righteous, no, not one." 
There is none in whom the original glory of the Divine 
character-likeness persists. The vengeance of the law 
against the criminal should, therefore, be sympathetically 
enforced, with a view to warning others against evil-doing, 
and, so far as reasonably possible, for the reclamation of 
the culprit. 

It is with great satisfaction that we note that in our 
day this humane spirit is more and more prevalent. Our 
prisons more and more are being turned into great reformatories, 
in sharp contrast with the treatment accorded 
to the vicious in a darker past. The charges of judges in 
pronouncing sentence against criminals, especially against 
murderers, are often fatherly and tender. There is even 
a danger of too much leniency. The feeling that a terrible 
responsibility is associated with the taking of human 
life, even in a judicial way, is right; but this feeling— a 
certain weakness, in fact— is manifesting itself in opposition 
to capital punishment. This, we believe, is generally 
the result of misunderstanding the Divine Word. 

True, in the case of Cain, God did not require an execution 
of the criminal, but specially prohibited it. Nevertheless, 
the Divine Law, as given through Moses, stands: "He 
that sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed." 
The careful observance of this law, yet with a spirit of 
kindness and sympathy, and in the least painful manner, 
but with proper ignominy, seems necessary to the preservation 
of law and order. Weakness in this respect encourages 
criminality and also furnishes an excuse for mob 
law and mob violence— defiance of every principle of 
righteousness. 

Undoubtedly the general misapprehension of the Divine 
Character and Plan has led up to the weakness we mention, 
which opposes capital punishment. This wrong view, 



which Bible students are gradually finding is not supported 

by God's Word, led us to believe that the murderer, as 

one of the non-elect, would at death pass into horrible and 

endless tortures. Naturally and properly, with that 

thought in mind, we would hesitate to plunge a fellow-creature 

into such misery. Bible students now are learning 

R5151 : page 392 

that we all labored for a time under a delusion, that 
this delusion came from the Dark Ages of the inquisition, 
the block, the stake. Our forefathers, imagining God to 
be worse than themselves, twisted the Scriptures to support 
their errors. 

Now we see that the Bible teaches that the whole 
world, good and bad, fall asleep in death and will know 
no awakening, no joy, no sorrow, until their awakening at 
the Second Coming of Messiah, when He will establish 
His Kingdom. "Where the tree falleth, there shall it be." 
Ah, how much truth and common sense is in the Bible 
statement that all, good and bad, "sleep with their fathers," 
gathered to their fathers in death! They are gone to the 
one great slumber-house, the tomb— Sheol, Hades— the 
prison-house of death. From that prison none can break 
forth, but all the prisoners there are "prisoners of hope." 

Messiah so loved the world that He gave His life as 
a Man for the redemption of Adam and his race. As a 
result, as soon as He shall have selected His faithful 
Bride class, He will establish His glorious Kingdom. Its 
mission is to open the prison doors and set at liberty the 
captives. It will bring all to an accurate knowledge of the 
Truth. Every wilful transgressor against light and knowledge 
will then receive stripes. But all evil-doers, as members 
of the one race, were redeemed by the precious blood, 
and all must have a full opportunity for deciding willingly, 
either for harmony with God and everlasting life, or for 
harmony with sin, and for its penalty— Second Death. 

"SIN CROUCHETH AT THE DOOR" 

Before the murder was committed, Cain was vexed, 
angry, jealous, soured, because God had manifested His 
favor toward his brother Abel's offering of an animal 
sacrifice, while rejecting Cain's offering of vegetables. 
Cain should have rejoiced with Abel, and should have 
brought a similar sacrifice himself and had Divine acceptance. 
God warned him that his spirit of selfish jealousy 
was sin, and that it like a wild beast crouched before 
the door of his heart, ready to spring upon him and overwhelm 
his better sentiments. 

God forewarned him that he should conquer this beastly 
spirit of selfishness and jealousy, and rule over it. How 
much we all need to learn this lesson! Through the fall 
we all have baser sentiments which war against the 
nobler ones. As a beast of prey they would seek to devour 
us. The will must be exercised in overcoming the beast, 



and Divine aid is needed. The Christian has this Divine 
aid in his access to God through his Great Advocate, the 
Redeemer. 

Cain heeded not God's warning. He ruled not the 
beast. He was overcome by it. His brother's blood cried, 
figuratively, to God. In other words, all injustice cries 
out to the God of Justice, and sooner or later the Divine 
penalty will be meted out. But as we have seen, the judgments 
of the Lord are "just and righteous altogether." 
His judgments are left for the Great Mediator of the 
New Covenant to execute in sympathy and in kindness, 
during the Millennial Age. That will be the World's 
Judgment Day. Only accepted believers in Christ, begotten 
of the Holy Spirit, are now on trial for life eternal or 
death eternal. 

BROTHER-HATERS ARE MURDERERS 

The Great Teacher, addressing, not the world, but the 
Church, declares that brother-haters are murderers in 
God's sight. In other words, a spirit of hatred is a spirit 
of murder. Alas, how many have vicious, wicked, hateful 
dispositions, merely controlled by their fear of the law! 
Yet it is not the world, but only the Church, that is being 
specially dealt with thus far. But alas! how many of the 
professed followers of Jesus occasionally harbor a spirit 
of hatred, and sometimes manifest it in anger, malice, envy, 
strife, works of the flesh and the devil! 

Christians are accounted as New Creatures because 
begotten of the Holy Spirit. These are to fight a good 
warfare against their own flesh and its imperfections. 
Sin crouches before the door ready to devour them as 
New Creatures. They must watch and pray and strive 
against the fallen nature. They must cultivate the fruits 
and graces of the Holy Spirit— meekness, gentleness, patience, 
brotherly-kindness, love. If they do not do so, if, 
on the contrary, they are brother-haters and manifest 
the murder spirit, they have the warning that they will 
lose the great Prize— join t-heirship in the Kingdom. 

The Scriptural assurance is, "We know that no murderer 

R5151 : page 393 

hath eternal life abiding in him." (I John 3:15.) 
Whatever elements of the spirit of murder may still lurk 
in our flesh must be determinedly warred against, and, 
proportionately, we must become copies of our Heavenly 
Father and of our Lord Jesus. Thus we shall ultimately 
share with our Lord in His great Kingdom, which is 
shortly to be set up, and to bless the world with the light 
and the knowledge of the glory of God. 



R5151 : page 393 



"WISE AS SERPENTS-HARMLESS AS DOVES" 

MATTHEW 10:16. 

PRESUMABLY all of the Lord's people remember 

the Master's words quoted in the 

title. Yet apparently very few have appreciated 

them; for otherwise they would surely 

be putting this advice into practice— seeking 

to do the Lord's will. When we think of 

blundering mistakes which others make and 

which we ourselves have made in presenting 

Divine truths to others, we are silent. The 

consolation we seem to find is in the further 

word of Jesus, that God is sometimes praised by the prattling 

of the mouths of babes. As children of God we have 

a period of infancy, of childhood. 

St. Paul refers to this, saying, "When I was a child, I 
spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a 
child; but when I became a man, I put away childish 
things." (I Cor. 13: 1 1.) So we all need to exercise ourselves 
to some extent in order to counteract the results of 
the childishness and the mistakes of our earlier experiences 
in the family of the Lord. Let us not be content to 
remain children long. Let us rapidly grow in grace and 
knowledge and love. Let us take such earnest heed to the 
Master's words, that we may speedily become acceptable 
and profitable ambassadors for the King Eternal. 

How often we have advised the dear readers of this 
journal not to choke Christian brethren who, so far as 
knowledge of God and His Word are concerned, are 
merest babes, no matter if their consecration dates twenty 
or thirty years back! When such come into our midst, 
their presence implies that they are hungering for spiritual 
food. Shall we stuff them to nauseation? Shall we feed 
them strong meat of Divine Truth which they cannot appreciate 
and which will choke them? Or shall we act 
more wisely and give them meat in due season— spiritual 
food adapted to their condition? 

Some dear friends, full of zeal and greatly appreciated 
both by the Lord and by ourself, are so unwise that they 
would probably do the Cause more good if they never attempted 
to expound the Heavenly things to others— if they 
would content themselves with merely saying, "I will 
give you something to read which will make that subject 
very clear to you." On the contrary, there is danger that, 
when good meetings have been held for the public, and 
earnest souls are seeking the Lord, hungering and thirsting 
for the Truth, they may be injured by those whose 
hearts are the very best, but whose judgments are poor. 

THE POINT ILLUSTRATED 

An illustration of this is before us in a letter. A 
friend writes, "I took friends to our regular meetings 
several times— people who have read some and manifested 



some interest. With one accord all of our Class 
began, after the meeting, to acquaint them with all kinds 
of information, chiefly about the materialization of evil 
spirits and about Christ's presence, etc., with the result 
that they were so confused that they did not care to go 
again. Sometimes the leader of the Class, discerning the 
visitor, will leave the regular lesson and go into dissertations 
which seem unwise for the newcomers and unprofitable 
to the Class. 

"The newcomers would have understood and appreciated 
our Berean Lesson, if the item specially intended 
for them had been omitted. I was discouraged about taking 
outsiders with us any more. When no strangers are 
with us, our Berean Lessons are good and instructive, because 
we stick closely to them. The tiresome rambling 
occurs when visitors come. So I am just keeping still 
and not inviting my friends, believing that it will do them 
more good to read thoroughly before attending our Class 
under existing conditions." 

This is an exact illustration of a point which we are 
making and which we have tried to make several times. 
We do not wish to discourage the dear friends from 
preaching the Truth. We are merely urging the words of 
the Master, "Be ye wise as serpents and harmless as 
doves." Obedience to the Master should control whatever 
wayward and excitable tendencies may be ours naturally.

INTERESTING LETTERS 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:- 

I am glad to have the favor of writing you a few lines. I 
often would like to write you, but I know the interest and 
work of the Harvest press you, so I refrain from cumbering 
you with less important things. I would like to assure you 
of my interest and love for you as an humble, yet very greatly 
used instrument in the Lord's hand for the blessing and satisfying 
of His own true sheep. Well I remember how the burden 
rolled away when the scales of ignorance and tradition 
fell from my eyes and I was permitted, through the STUDIES 
IN THE SCRIPTURES to see the light on God's Plan (not man's) 
for His creatures, and only then for the first time could I 
truly believe God was love. I rejoiced and was glad and my 
joy continues increasingly; the sacred yoke of fellowship in 
His sufferings is easy and joyous. His Law of love is my 
delight. 

Now, dear Brother, the work of Harvest goes on here as 
best we can with the available labor. A considerable number 
of STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES have been placed in the hands 
of the people of Auckland and suburbs during the past six 
years by diligent Colporteurs. Each year since first the 
STUDIES were sold here we have systematically put out from 
about 30,000 to 50,000 tracts and the Truth has been watered 



by Pilgrims from Melbourne. We were making preparations 
in hope of having you pay us a visit, and when we learned 
that it will not be His will now, we were sorry, but bowed in 
loyal submission. We had hopes that the Truth would have 
a good presentation and that an interest might be awakened. 
Many have the books on the shelf, and only an awakening is 
needed to investigate, we feel sure. 
Yours in the grand Hope, DAVID HOOK. --New Zealand.

BELOVED PASTOR:- 

Oh, what a feast our present Lord spreads before us, via 
our precious WATCH TOWER. Surely His bounty flows like 
a river, so full, so free. 

The issue of Oct. 1, p. 304, "Fight the Good Fight," abounds 
with "milk and honey." It is unlike our temporal food, for 
after having eaten our feast we can return to it again. We 
must prepare again ere we renew our failing bodies, but this 
table has the old story always fresh. 

As I read back over the past TOWERS, they have so ripened 
in flavor, I eat, I digest; eat and digest; wondering why 
they taste so much sweeter now than when I first read them, 
but the Word reminds me— "growth"— yea, it is all within 
me. I was not able, had not the capacity to assimilate it all 
at once. Praise His holy name for such a plan and for such 
"green pastures" and "living waters!" 

Yours in His Service, ,— Phila.

"I.B.S.A." BIBLES AND OTHER BIBLE STUDY HELPS 

First in this list we mention the several volumes of 

"STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES" SERIES 

—referring inquirers to another page of this journal for prices, etc. 
We commend also, as aids, the following publications (not all our own), 
which we supply at specially low prices because of the assistance they 
will lend to the study of God's Word. We mention these somewhat 
in the order in which they seem to us to be desirable aids. 

OUR SPECIAL "I.B.S.A." BIBLE 

Hereafter to distinguish our own special edition from other 
Bibles, we will refer to it as the "I.B.S.A." Bible. This Bible is 
becoming more and more indispensable to all readers as they learn 
how to use it. The translation, of course, is not at all different from 
that of other Bibles of the Common Version. 
We specially recommend it for its smallness 
of size, lightness of weight, and good-sized 



print, and above all for the helps to Bible 
students and teachers bound with it; printed 
on India paper; excellent press work. Its 
special feature, distinguishing this Bible from 
all others, is 

BIBLE TEACHERS' MANUAL. 
Parti. 

Biblical Comments from Genesis to Revelation, 
with references to the STUDIES IN THE 
SCRIPTURES and others of our publications 
showing the page where the text is more 
fully discussed and elaborated. We can 
scarcely imagine anything more helpful than 
these for Bible study. It is so easy to turn 
to the reference and ascertain if the matter 
has been treated and where and how. It represents 
four hundred and eighty-one pages 
of matter. 

Part II. 

INSTRUCTORS' GUIDE TEXTS. 

This is a topical arrangement of Bible 
subjects specially convenient for those who 
have opportunity for teaching others the 
Divine Plan of the Ages. Its various Topics 
are arranged under distinct headings and the 
various texts bearing upon the subjects are 
collated. With this help a novice has at his 
command, well-furnished, "the Sword of the 
Spirit." It is in condensed form, very convenient, 
and consists of eighteen pages solid 
matter. 

Part III. 

BEREAN TOPICAL INDEX. 

The Berean Topical Index, alphabetically 
arranged, presents a large variety of subjects 
showing references to the STUDIES IN THE 
SCRIPTURES and others of our publications 
treating the same. This feature covers twenty-eight 
pages. 

Part IV. 

DIFFICULT TEXTS EXPLAINED. 

SPURIOUS PASSAGES NOTED. 

In this, specially difficult texts are brought 
to the attention and references given showing 
where they are treated in our publications. 
Following this is a full list of various 
interpolations and spurious passages of the 
Scriptures not in the original MSS., as 



proven by the oldest Greek MSS.— fifteen 
pages. 

These four features, representing five hundred 
and forty-two pages, are not to be found 
in any other Bibles on earth and, in our 
opinion, they are of almost priceless value. 
One of our interested readers if he could not 
procure another would not sell his copy for 
a hundred dollars— many of them surely 
would not take thousands for it. 

All of our "I.B.S.A." Bibles contain the 
above, and some of them, the numbers of which end with a nine, contain 
additionally Bagster's Bible Study Helps, including an alphabetical 
index of proper names and Bagster's Bible Concordance and Maps— a 
total of one hundred and eighty-six pages. 

We not only supply these Bibles at cost price, but, because of 
the large quantities ordered at a time, we are enabled to secure a 
cost price which is really phenomenal. We are safe in saying that, 
even aside from our Berean Helps, no Bibles are to be found in the 
world of such extraordinary values. The price is the same whether 
the order be for one copy or for more. To save danger of misunderstanding 
we below quote the prices, including postage. The very low 
prices must not lead you to think that these are manufactured in any 
slipshod manner. They are first class in every particular. The prices 
are, many of them, less than one-half of what you pay for such books 
almost anywhere else. 

So great is the demand for these "I.B.S.A." Bibles that hereafter 
we purpose carrying no others in stock except pocket Bibles and 
large type Bibles for the aged. We will, still, however, be pleased to 
serve anyone who desires other Bibles. We can procure for these 
wholesale rates, usually twenty-five per cent, off, plus postage.

from the columns of back issues of THE WATCH TOWER. 

Our present edition of the "Manna" contains the same texts 
and comments as all former editions. Every alternate leaf is blank -ruled, 
for use as an autograph and birthday record. It is printed on 
fine bond paper. We now have it in three different grades of binding,

food, stimulating thankfulness to the Giver of all Good and thus 
inducing the peace of God and favoring both spiritual and natural 
health and well-being. 

THE EMPHATIC DIAGLOTT 

This very valuable work, published under the author's copyright 
by Fowler & Wells Co., New York City, has been sold by them at $4 
in cloth and $5 in half leather binding. For several years a friend, an 
earnest Bible student, desirous of assisting the readers of our Society's 
publications, has supplied them through us at a greatly reduced price; 
now he has purchased the copyright and plates from the Fowler & 
Wells Co., and presented the same to our Society as a gift, under our 
assurance that the gift will be used for the furthering of the Truth 
to the extent of our ability, by such a reduction of price as will permit 
the poor of the Lord's flock to have this help in the study of the Word. 

REDUCED PRICES. -These will be sold with THE WATCH TOWER 



only. In cloth binding $1.50 (6s. 3d.)— includes postage and, as a 
Premium, one year's subscription new or renewal, to THE WATCH 
TOWER. On thin paper, in full morocco leather, divinity circuit, red

postage and one year's subscription to THE WATCH TOWER. 

THE TISCHENDORF NEW TESTAMENT 

This is the ordinary Common Version in cloth binding. As footnotes 
it gives the reading of the three oldest Greek MSS., Sinaiticus, 
Vaticanus and Alexandrine, wherever these differ from the Common 
Version. This is a very valuable little work, published in Europe, 
which we specially import. Price, 50c, including postage. 

LEESER'S TRANSLATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT 

This is the standard translation amongst English reading Hebrews, 
by one of their own rabbis. It is not perfect, but is a valuable aid 
in critical study of the Old Testament. Our special price, in leather 
binding, including postage, is $1.10. 

ANALYTICAL CONCORDANCE TO THE SCRIPTURES 

In English, Hebrew and Greek, by Prof. Young (Presbyterian). 
A valuable work for all critical students. The publishers advise that 
they are bringing out a new revised edition of this valuable work, with 
considerable additional matter— historical data, etc., and have advanced 
the price. We are not permitted by the publishers to cut this price, 
but we may and do give in addition, postage free, any four volumes of 
STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES, cloth binding, with each Concordance, or 
six volumes if purchaser pays expressage. Postpaid, cloth binding, $6. 

EXHAUSTIVE CONCORDANCE TO THE SCRIPTURES 

In English, Hebrew and Greek, by Prof. Strong (Methodist). 
This is also an able work and useful in critical study. It has some 
advantages over Young's; after getting used to it we prefer it. 
Special reduced prices— in cloth binding, $3; half leather, $5. Carriage 
prepaid, 65c. extra. 

CRUDEN'S CONCORDANCE TO THE SCRIPTURES 

A valuable work, but scarcely necessary to those who have either 
of the above mentioned. English only. Cloth binding, $1, delivered. 

SMITH'S BIBLE DICTIONARY 

This is one of the most desirable editions of Prof. Smith's work. It 
is a large volume of 1,020 pages. Cloth binding, $1.30, including postage. 

"BIBLE TALKS IN SIMPLE LANGUAGE" 

This is the best book of its kind we have ever seen. It presents 
the Bible stories in simple, but not childish language, and seems 
remarkably free from the bad theology so common in this class of 
books. All Christian parents should have a Sunday Bible lesson with 



their children, and this book furnishes interesting topics, to which may 
be added as much concordant "Present Truth" as the age of the 
children will justify. Parents are responsible for their children's 
training in theology as well as in morals. This will assist in the discharge 
of this duty, be a blessing to yourself and your children. 

624 pages, 250 illustrations; cloth sides, leather back and corners, 
gilt edges. A subscription book at $3. Our special price, 75 cents, 
plus 25 cents postage. 

Should any desire other Bibles we will be pleased to supply 
publisher's catalogue, giving full description and prices. 
We are usually able to secure a discount of 25 per cent, on 
the publishers' list prices.

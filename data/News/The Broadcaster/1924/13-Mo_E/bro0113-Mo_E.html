<p><span class="font9">AT A DISCOUNT</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ANOTHER MONARCHY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">OVERBOARD</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Following the examples of Portugal, Germany, Poland, Russia, Austria, Czecho-Slovakia, Albania, Greece, Turkey, and China, the Bulgarians have deposed their King and organized a Republican form of Government- The world is emerging rapidly from the Royalty humbug. The influence of the United States of America has been all-powerful in bringing this about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TENSE SITUATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN MADRID</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A censorship is practised in Madrid these days, and there is work for the censors to do. Practically all the leading Liberals of Spain attended a meeting in Madrid, urging the overthrow of the Dictatorship at any cost and declaring that the present regime is disgracing Spain before the civilized world. The police broke up the meeting, arresting everybody in sight, and the censors put the lid on so tight that on the morning of October 28th following the evening of the meeting, the Madrid newspapers contained many blank columns from which all reference to the meeting had been eliminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">THE FRENCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">GOVERNMENT WILL</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ABOLISH ALL TITLES ft</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the ground that Titles of Nobility are out of harmony in a Republic, the French Government is expected shortly to suppress the legal recognition hereafter of all so-called Titles of Nobility. They might as well have done it long ago. Such Titles stand only for fraud or the worst crimes of downright theft and murder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">METHUSELAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ONLY EIGHTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A college Professor at the University of California, rises to explain that the ancients computed their time by cycles of the moon, not of the sun, so that Methuselah lived not 969 years, but 969 months, or 80 years. Now won’t this wise Professor be so good as to go a step further and call the attention of the public ro the fact that Enoch became Methuselah’s father at the ripe age of 65 months, which, being interpreted is 5 years and 5 months, while his great grandfather, Mahalaleel, was a still more interesting character, having become the father of Enoch iri 5 years and 2 months?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Comprehending the Bible Teaching</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">N</span><span class="font0">OTHING is more satisfactory to a thinking person than something tangible to think about. Many things believed in have no basis in fact. Theories and doctrines of men have had their day; and now recognizing the passing away of the old order of things with the Golden Age </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font0"> prophecy at the door, nothing shall survive this transition period but truth, truth pertaining to the conscientious scruples of moral conduct and religious belief.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Creeds of Men Inaccurate</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Printing was not invented until the fifteenth century. Before then the Scriptures were in handwriting. Few were educated; fewer still were scribes. The people were dependent on a vacillating and unfaithful priesthood. Creeds were made, and subscribed to as epitomized statements of the Scriptures ; and these were freely circulated to those of inquiring minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is not a creed that is in harmony with the Bible. Even the so-called “Apostles’ creed” would be repudiated by the apostles of our Lord; for they had nothing to do with it. The time came in God’s providence for the Scriptures to be translated out of dead languages into the living languages of the people: Peter Waldo translated the Bible into French; John Wycliffe into English; Martin Luther into German. The priests fought these translations from the first; for they were recognized as being dangerous to the “system.” Finally the Bible was printed. Out of rivers of blood and </span><span class="font1">many </span><span class="font0">bonfires the Bible has survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the people continued to clamor </span><span class="font1">for </span><span class="font0">the sacred writings in order that they might know the truth, a Bible was “authorized” by the “Most High and Mighty Prince, James” of England, </span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font0">the beginning of the seventeenth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But Bibles did not multiply until the Bible societies sprang up, in the beginning of the nineteenth century. The King James Version was intended </span><span class="font1">to </span><span class="font0">be an “exact translation” out of the original sacred tongues into the English tongue. But hundreds of ancient manuscripts have been discovered within the last three hundred years which make manifest that hundreds of major and thousands of minor discrepancies are to be found in the </span><span class="font1">Au</span><span class="font0">thorized Version.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Light Shining Brighter Than Ever</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">The early Church made progress until the Nicene Creed put the crimp on Scripture study. The retrogression of Christian truth made necessary more bewildering creeds, and the “dark ages” was the logical result. Bold breaks were made for liberty. from creedal bondage, and back-to-the-Bible movements were started by the Reformers. Every reform movement made progress until a creed was formed. A creed is like a hobby-horse: You may rock in it, but it will carry you nowhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">God has permitted man-made religion to occupy the attention of the people in order to furnish a lasting lesson of the futility of man’s working out </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">scheme of religion for his own benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">God will have us learn our dependence upon Him for grace and mercy and truth. God will have us reverence Him and worship His Son Jesus. God is </span><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font0">Giver of life, and His Son is the means by which that life is obtainable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The writings of Pastor Russell disclose the fact that God has a great and wonderful plan which He is working out; that it is systematic in both its redemptive and chronological aspects; that there was a time when God was not offering general salvation, but laying the foundation of His great plan in types and shadows; that there was a time for the ransom sacrifice to be giv</span><span class="font1">en </span><span class="font0">and the consequent selection of the true Church, the spiritual seed of Abraham; and that there is yet future </span><span class="font1">to </span><span class="font0">be a gathering of every nation, kindred and tongue into full harmony with God, in order that the world of mankind may have life and live forever upon the earth.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark11"></a>God Honors the Honest-Hearted</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Unless a person manifests faith in the Almighty he will receive no favor from God. Faith means a knowledge of, and an entering into the spirit of, the Word of God. “Without faith it is impossible to please God.” The Bible expresses God’s mind toward the children of men. He says: “My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways.” (Isaiah 55:8) Therefore if we seek to know God’s will concerning us and are honest-hearted, coming in the appointed way, through Christ, we shall have the eyes of our understanding opened to discern the truth. The scheme of redemption becomes comprehensive, the plan of the ages opens to our astonished gaze, the permission of evil is seen in a new light, the whole Bible becomes a delightful inspiration because of its new-found beauty and harmony, and the jargon of confusing creeds becomes even more intolerable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Lord promised that in the end of the Gospel Age knowledge would increase and that those who were wise toward God should have a fuller understanding. The light of our day is • pictured as a sun rising—not a literal sun, but the dawning of a great light in our minds. We are living in the days of the fulfilling of prophecy, and those who are seeking the favor of God are having the mystery of the ages disclosed to them.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Blessing for Those who Understand</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">The redemption, the selection of the Church, the blessing of the world, the great crisis impending by the everincreasing trouble, and the dispensa-tional change now taking place, have been explained in these columns. The Lord is taking to Himself His great power and beginning His reign of righteousness, the preliminary work of which is the dissolving of the present systems and institutions of men so that they will not retard the blessings God designs to bestow.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">JERUSALEM BECOMING</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A MODERN CITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The streets in Jerusalem are being named, which is something new; sidewalks are being laid, which is also new; electric lights are being installed; homes are being fitted with running water and sanitation, and in the newer parts wide and handsome streets are being laid out, lined with houses that are modern in every respect. The oriental appearance of the old city is being preserved, but not at the cost of the health and comfort of' those who live in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">WONDERFULLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">EFFICIENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">NEW ELEVATORS</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the new Standard Oil Building at 26 Broadway, some new elevators have been installed that in accuracy of working and in safety and speed put human operation away back in the shade. A person steps in the car, and names the floor at which he wishes to alight; the operator presses a single button, the gates and doors automatically close and lock, the car starts, stops unerringly at the floor desired, and the passenger alights, all without the loss of a fraction of a second, and with absolute safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">NEW X-RAY MAKES</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">WALLS TRANSPARENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the laboratory of the General Electric Company at Schenectady, a new X-Ray apparatus 7 x 8 x 10 inches in size has been invented, which, when attached to the nearest electric light socket will enable plumbers, electricians, and others to see through walls and determine just where to run their pipes or wires without unnecessary damage to the finished walls. The whole device weighs but thirty pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">GERMAN INVENTS A</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">NEW TYPE OF SHIP</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A new type of sailing vessel, of which great things are expected, has been invented by a German, and has has been tried out and found practical. Instead of sails, the ship has immense hollow masts, open on one side. Into these hollow masts the winds blow more effectively, so it is said, than into the belly of a sail. Moreover, the commander, by manipulation of the towers or masts, can control the effect of the winds at will. The' crew of such a vessel will need to be but one fifth the size of the crew of the sailing vessels in general use now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ENGLAND’S SUN</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ABOUT TO SET</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cecil Roberts, British War Correspondent, and editor of the Nottingham Journal, in an address in Chicago on October 31, said: “You are going to have in America a new phase - a phase in which the mental and intellectual will clash with the physical and industrial. If they cannot combine without physical struggle, God alone can save the nation. England and America stand as the last two units in the trial of civilization. Our England’s sun is about to set - but it will be a glorious sunset.”</span></p>

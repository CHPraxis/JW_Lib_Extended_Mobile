<p><span class="font4">Dr. Harvey N. Wiley, former chief of the Bureau of Chemistry in Washington, one of the most useful men America ever produced, in an address delivered on his 80th birthday, said: “If luxury were to be destroyed and all houses burned to drive us out-ofdoors, the diseases which kill us old and middle-aged men would disappear.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Wall paper and carpets of red are so trying to the nerves as to be almost sure to make those who live in such surroundings quarrelsome. They might even drive people insane. On the reverse side of the question, it is found that those who are insane are benefited by quiet blue tones or chrome yellow or buff.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark10"></a>DR. ELIOT TELLS THE</span><br><br><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark11"></a>TRUTH</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Dr. Eliot, President Emeritus of Harvard University, tells the truth when he says that the religion of the future will reject the idea of a place of torment where a just God will inflict</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The announcement comes from Vienna that where the streets are paved with granite blocks the result is an increase in tuberculosis. The theory seems to be that the flying dust, laden with germs, oppresses the weak with a burden too great for their systems to bear. This matter having been brought to the attention of the Vienna authorities, they have resorted to tarring and oiling the streets and anticipate that the improvement in the public health will more than pay the expense.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark13"></a>THE TRANSFORMATION</span><br><br><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark14"></a>OF DENMARK</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Before the eyes of the world, Denmark has been making amazing progress in creating an ideal country in which to live. The Socialist Government has done everything possible to turn the tenant farmers into owners. Moreover, they have made electric power so cheap and so plentiful that more than half of the farms of Denmark now have electric lights, and do their pumping, feed cutting, threshing and grinding by electricity. The step next contemplated is the complete scrapping of the entire army and navy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Jesus’ Death Guarantees Life</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">L</span><span class="font4">IFE is recognized as a great boon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>!</sup> Part of the appreciation of life is vitiated by the erroneous theory that mankind must live forever, somewhere. Life is a gift from .the Almighty; and it is the righteous who will receive this gift, not the wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Adam was created and became a sentient being, he might have continued his life in a state of happiness had he not sinned. The perpetuity of his existence was made contingent upon his loyalty to his Benefactor. God told him plainly that if he disobeyed he would die. And this was right, pr6per and just. Being created perfect, perfection of conduct was not only possible with him, but entirely natural; for every fiber of his being was made harmonious with Gods’ law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why Man Is Dying</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Man is not a dying creature because he was created but to die. Man in harmony with God will live, so death is unnatural. When Adam became disobedient and wilfully transgressed the law of his Maker, he was driven from the life-sustaining trees of the Garden and began dying. His children having been born subsequent to the expulsion from Eden, perfection of being and everlasting life on earth were an impossibility for them. The human family is a dying race because of the condemnation which father Adam brought ujion us.—Romans 5:12-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">-Hatred, jealousy, and selfishness are as much diseases as are rheumatism and catarrh. The race has been degenerating for centuries, growing weaker and weaker. The influenza pandemic could not have taken its terrible toll had the peoples of earth been strong in body. If there is not a change, within a thousand years it is estimated that the race will be unable to transmit the jpark of life and will become extinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Redemption of Man Necessary</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible refers to Jesus as the “Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” This means that God foreknew the course man would take. There is no redemption without the shedding of blood. A perfect man was condemned to death; a perfect man must needs voluntarily meet the penalty to rescue the condemned. The slaying of animals to clothe Adam and Eve with the skins prefigured the necessity of blood redemption to satisfy the justice of God. The paschal lamb saving the first-born of Israel in Egypt pictured the sacrifice of Jesus, who John declared was the “Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God created the earth and purposed it to be inhabited eternally with a contented, happy people fitted for an earthly environment. He could have permitted the Adamic family to die out, to become extinct, and could have created a new race to people the earth; but in His wisdom and love He decreed otherwise.—J ohn 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore Jesus came to earth at the appointed time, and sacrificed his humanity for the life, of the world. He said: “The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.” (John 6:51) He died “the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.” “We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.” (Hebrews 2: 9) What a wonderful thing this is, and how our gratitude should respond to it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Opportunity for Life Must Come</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">St. Peter said respecting Jesus: “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men,whereby we must be saved.” St. Paul said that God “will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth”; and also, “as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” These texts surely prove that because of the wonderful redemptive plan that is being carried out by the Lord Jesus all must come to a sufficient knowledge of the truth to release them from Adamic condemnation. The time set for this to reach the world of mankind in general is during the thousand-year reign of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The mass of mankind is in the tomb, having never received this knowledge. No one can be saved in unbelief or in ignorance. Therefore the sleeping dead are to be awakened and come forth from the graves in order that they may receive their first opportunity for salvation. (John 5:28, 29, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">JI.</span><span class="font4"> P.) Those who have already received this opportunity, and have made their “calling and election sure,” belong to the “seed of promise” and shall be with Christ in the heavenly phase of the kingdom when it is established in power and great glory. But those outside of the Church will have their opportunity in the “day of Christ,” when the refreshing times of restitution will prove to be the Golden Age of prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Resurrection and Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not only was it necessary for Jesus to die, but He must be raised from the dead, ascend on high and intercede in behalf of the Church during the Gospel Age. But not all are Christians. Jesus said that He would come again. The Church wdl then be joint-heirs with Him in the kingdom. And the kingdom is for the blessing of everybody outside of the Church with opportunities of living forever upon the earth, in a world-wide Eden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The rightful ruler of the world is Jesus. (Isaiah 9:6; Ezekiel 21:25-27) The second coming and the inaugura tion of the kingdom of equity, truth and righteousness, is the sequel to the ransom sacrifice. As the Great Physician He will cure all the ills mankind is heir to, until there is none sick anywhere. As the Mediator He will reconcile the world to God the Judge of all. And the world shall be lifted to perfection of mind and body, and, remaining loyal to God, live forever in a state of happiness upon the earth.</span></p>

He might have added, truthfully also, that the Bible does not teach the existence of such a place and that this fact is well known to every intelligent minister of the Gospel. Dr. Eliot also states, and wisely too, that a future existence of idleness would be wholly unbearable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">PRIMITIVE BAPTISTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ANNOYED BY THE TRUTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The primitive Baptists of Virginia are all upset because one of their ministers has discovered and set forth in hi# sermons the plain teaching of the Bible that there are two salvations, one spiritual and one temporal. They are even having a lawsuit about it. All this is encouraging,as it will stimulate some peopki at least to read Acts 15:14-17, inclusive, and many other like passages until understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">NEW YORK’S INCREASED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">APPETITE FOR GRAPES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is remarkable how the prohibition law has increased the appetite for grapes in New York city. In 1917, the shipments of grapes into New York city totaled 300 cars. In 1918, after prohibition came into sight there were 3,000 cars. In 1920, there were 5,000 cars; in 1922,12,000 cars; in 1923. 14,000 cars; and this year 16,000 cars, besides frequent shipments from Europe in 200 barrel lots. Fruit dealers report that some customers order at one time as many as 50 twelve-quart baskets. This would be enough for papa and mamma and each child to have a twelve-quart basket at each meal, and some in between.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">SUN PARLORS ARE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">NO GOOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The craze for sun parlors is sure to run out, not because they are cold in winter and drafty in summer, merely, but because the passage of light through glass shuts out the violet rays of the sun, which are really life-giving. A sun bath through a window pane is no sun bath at all, but a sun bath in the open sun produces a marvelous effect upon the organism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">REPORTED SUCCESSFUL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">USE OF CHARCOAL GAS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Reports from Sweden state that a gas obtained from charcoal has been used successfully in connection with the driving of automobiles, boats and railroad trains. It is declared that this gas costs less than gasoline or alcohol. The charcoal is carried in the vehicle to be propelled by the gas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CHINA’S EMERGENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">WILL BE SUDDEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Everything indicates that China’s emergence into the full blaze of civilization will be sudden. The Chinese have almost no railways and very few good highways, but instead of agitating for these they are earnestly discussing the development of airplanes, and wondering if they cannot make these altogether take the place of highways and railways. Such a solution of a great problem would be characteristic &quot;of the Chinese mind. It seems naturally to do almost everything different from what is customary with the rest of us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The known dead in China’s flood are 13,115, with many times that number missing. Some day, when the world has stopped making and using arms and warships, the scientific use of sheet piling will make China’s rivers tame and prevent these oft-recurring scenes of desolation. Sheet piling is of steel and locks together in such a way as to be absolutely water proof.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Colonel William M. Haskell who accomplished such extraordinary work in the relief of 35,000 districts of Russia when the famine was at its height, in an address at the Institute of Politics urges America to send a commission to Russia with a view to ending the economic blockade of that country. With rare common sense he argued that Russia has a natural market for America’s present excess of goods and that it is impossible to bluff a nation of 150,000,000 people. Both France and Britain endeavored to overthrow the present Russian government by force of arms. Now they are recognizing the Soviet, and leaving the United States to hold the bag.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark11"></a>IF CHINA GOES TO WAR</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">If China goes to war, one of the heavy contributing reasons will be the tons and tons of morphine and heroin which go from India to England, from England to the United States, from the United States to Japan and from Japan to China. China at one time almost completely blotted out the opium traffic; but the accursed stuff grown in India is now finding its way back into the Celestial Empire with devastating effects. Some provinces remain clean but others have abandoned the fight, and the poppy now flourishes where only human food should be raised. War and debauchery follow as a matter of course and may set the world afire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Somebody with a nose for statistics has ferreted out that since the war the European world is only fractionally living, and he gives the fractions. By actual weight of flour consumed per person Europe has only 77 percent as much bread to eat as formerly, only 75 percent as much butter and 72 percent as much sugar. Of cotton clothing only 60 percent as much can be worn: of coal only 75 per-</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark16"></a>God’s Promise to Bless Mankind</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">F</span><span class="font6">OR many centuries the land of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Palestine has been sacred to the hearts of Jews, Mohammedans, and Christians. It is known as the Holy Land. The reason for this is that it is the land where God foreshadowed the outworkings of His great plan. But Jews, Mohammedans, and Christians have long been unable to see the full significance and beauty of the wonderful things pictured in Palestine. The greater majority have regarded the land as sacred solely because of its ancient history. The Bible discloses that there are yet things to transpire in Palestine which will endear it to the hearts of all people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&gt;A great deal of that which occurred in the Holy Land in centuries past foreshadowed even greater things to come. It. is exceedingly interesting and important to refer to the things that happened in the past and, in the light of prophecy, to see what is to be expected there in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Promise Made to Abraham</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Approximately 4,000 years ago there lived in the land of Ur of the Chaldees a man by the name of Abraham, which means “Father of a multitude.” Jehovah used this man to foreshadow things that will yet thrill with gladness all the peoples of earth. When Abraham was seventy-five years of age Jehovah said to him: “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will show thee: and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee; and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.”—Genesis 12:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Abraham reached Canaan, the land now known as Palestine, God made a covenant with him, in which covenant He said: “I will give unto 'thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession.”—Genesis 17:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Abraham pitched his tent in the plains of Mamre, south of the present site of Jerusalem. It was there that he sat in the door of his tent when messengers appeared unto him, whom he recognized as servants sent from the Lord. In fact, they were angels from heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God Pictures Coming Blessings</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Notwithstanding the promise God had made to him, that in his seed should come the blessing, Abraham had no children. Concerning this we read: “Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.” (Genesis 18:11) The Lord’s messenger told Abraham that Sarah, his wife, should bear a son. At the appointed time a son was born, and they called his name Isaac, signifying laughter. Laughter means joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God was making a picture of coming blessings. Abraham here represents Jehovah God (Bomans 4:16,17); Isaac represents God’s only begotten Son, Jesus of Nazareth; and Sarah represents the covenant. (Galatians 4:22-26) As Isaac caused rejoicing at his birth, so his antitype, the Lord Jesus, at His birth caused great rejoicing in heaven and on earth. It was then that a host of angels sang: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is exceedingly interesting to follow the type and the antitype, and to mark how marvelously the Lord foreshadowed the great redemption and blessing of mankind. When Isaac was about grown God said to Abraham: “Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.”—Genesis 22: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moriah is one of the mountains upon which the city of Jerusalem was afterwards built. Mount Moriah is the site of the temple. The Mosque of Omar is now built upon the site, and the place is sacred to the Mohammedans. But the day will come, not far distant, when it will be even more sacred to Mohammedans, Jews, and Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Abraham’s Test of Faith</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Abraham journeyed from Mamre to Moriah, his son with him. Isaac had no intimation that he was to be the sacrifice. Reaching the place indicated, they built an altar; and then Isaac said to his father: ‘Where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” (Genesis 22:7) Here was a supreme test of faith. Abraham bound Isaac, and laid him upon the altar. God had promised that through Abraham’s seed the blessing should come; and now He asked Abraham to take the life of his only son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Abraham believed that God was able to raise his son out of death. He took the knife, and raised it for the fatal blow, when an angel called unto him: “Lay not thine hand upon the lad, . . . for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me. . . . By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord; for because thou hast done this thing, . . . that in blessing I will bless thee, . . . and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.”—Gen. 22:12-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Promise Certain of Fulfilment</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the perfect man Adam sinned he began to die, and all his offspring are under sentence of death. God could not change His judgment; but He could make a provision that His own law’s requirements could be met by another. Jesus was sent into the world to redeem mankind from death. (John 3:16,17) The “seed” of Abraham is the Messiah, which, according to St. Paul, is Christ and His Church. When the Church is glorified in. the first resurrection, the long-deferred blessings of life, liberty, and happiness will be showered upon humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s determination to bless all was pictured in His oath to Abraham, which was an unconditional promise on the part of God. Everlasting life will not be forced upon any, but the promise guarantees that the opportunity for the blessing will be granted to every one.—1 Timothy 2:3-6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Oregon-has found a way to kill off its surplus rabbits, which have been devastating' wheat and watermelon fields. The method pursued was to dust alfalfa with strychnine. About 125,000 rabbits were killed in two counties by this method. By one method or another ways will be discovered to dispose of all enemies of the human family until eventually, as the Bible assures us, there shall be nothing to hurt or destroy in all God’s holy kingdom. This earth is God’s footstool and God has declared His purpose to make it glorious—to have His will done here as fully as it is done in heaven.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark21"></a>HOUSING CONDITIONS</span><br><br><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark22"></a>IN EAST ST. LOUIS</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has sent out letters to the newspapers stating that although the Negro population of that city has tripled since 1914 there has been no improvement in housing; with the horrible condition resulting that there are now scores of cases where there are eight or ten families living in the same house. Anybody with a brain can see the crime and sickness which such a condition is sure to bring.</span></p>

With a roar the giant plane, which can carry three tons of bombs, and which has an engine of 1,000 horse power, went aloft as easily as a bird, from the airdome at Brough. The machine is so large that two of them could not be placed on a lot 50 feet wide and 150 feet deep.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Forty-three members of the Pentecostal church at Pomeroy, Ohio, have been arrested because of complaints that even young boys and girls danced all night in the church to hymns played in ragtime and in one instance a couple were found on the floor kicking their feet and shaking their shoulders in time with the music but too exhausted to rise. Anybody ought to be able to see that this is not religion: it is demonism, pllre and simple.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark30"></a>VISIONS OF ANGELS</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">Three different correspondents of the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express,</span><span class="font6"> one from Lingfield, south of London, and two from,Cardiff, Wales, have written describing visions of Christ in the sky, surrounded by angels. One of these visions was at midday and the others at midnight. A rector writes and explains that these are confirmations of spirit-writing to the effect that there are “grave events in the almost immediate future, and lasting until 1928.” We doubt not that evil spirits are back of these visions.</span></p>

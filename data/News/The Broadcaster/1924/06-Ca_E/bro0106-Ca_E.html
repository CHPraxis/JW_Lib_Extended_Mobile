<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>HOW BIG BUSINESS CAUSES WARS</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">All the papers nowa-days contain stories of troubles in Honduras. Part, at least, of the troubles are due to the fact that the United Fruit Company has been importing West Indians into Honduras so that it could control the labor situation there. The Hondurans do not like it, and have threatened to resist by force. This makes a difficult situation for the Honduran Government to meet, as it has to reckon with the British Government and the United States Government before it can do anything.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Cardinal Mercier is reported in the New York Times as having written to a gentleman of this city saying in part, “The world at this hour is a great invalid. All eyes are turned to the physicians, all lips anxiously asking: Is there hope of recovery? Have you a remedy, the remedy? The physicians have no concrete answer or rather, they give diverse answers all at once. The more the consultations and remedies multiply, the more we realize that we are at a standstill.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Following the examples of Mussolini, De Rivera and other Dictators, General Altamirano, military head of the nation, has virtually seized the government. This seems to mark the end of the Chilean Republic, for the present. The attempt by the Militarists to seize the government of Brazil did not succeed as yet, but is still active.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In an address before the League of Nations the Premier of Albania, Bishop F. S. Noli, said that everything the League said or did was bound to come to nothing, and that the Dawes Plan is “a tortuous, complicated, diabolical, infernal combination of bubbles, the most colossal super-bubble modern history has produced.” The Premier, who is a graduate of Harvard University, described Boston as “a city in Ireland full of O'Connors, O’Connells, Fitzgeralds, all of them good talkers, and with other Irishmen do all the talking in American electoral campaigns.” It was his hope that some of these Irish orators might come to Geneva and talk the Assembly to death. Bishop, we are surprised at you.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark18"></a>God’s Promise to Bless Mankind</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">F</span><span class="font4">OR many centuries the land of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Palestine has been sacred to the hearts of Jews, Mohammedans, and Christians. It is known as the Holy Land. The reason for this is that it is the land where God foreshadowed the outworkings of His great plan. But Jews, Mohammedans, and Christians have long been unable to see the full significance and beauty of the wonderful things pictured in Palestine. The greater majority have regarded the land as sacred solely because of its ancient history. The Bible discloses that there are yet things to transpire in Palestine which will endear it to the hearts of all people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A great deal of that which occurred in the Holy Land in centuries past foreshadowed even greater things to come. It is exceedingly interesting and important to refer to the things that happened in the past andj in the light of prophecy, to see what is to be expected there in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Promise Made to Abraham</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Approximately 4,000 years ago there lived in the land of Ur of the Chaldees a man by the name of Abraham, which means “Father of a multitude.” Jehovah used this man to foreshadow things that will yet thrill with gladness all the peoples of earth. When Abraham was seventy-five years of age Jehovah said to him: “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will show thee: and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee; and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.”—Genesis 12:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Abraham reached Canaan, the land now known as Palestine, God made a covenant with him, in which covenant He said: “I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession.”—Genesis 17:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Abraham pitched his tent in the plains of Mamre, south of the present site of Jerusalem. It was there that he sat in the door of his tent when messengers appeared unto him, whom he recognized as servants sent from the Lord. In fact, they were angels from heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God Pictures Coming Blessings</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Notwithstanding the promise God had made to him, that in his seed should come the blessing, Abraham had no children. Concerning this we read: “Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.” (Genesis 18:11) The Lord’s messenger told Abraham that Sarah, his wife, should bear a son. At the appointed time a son was born, and they called his name Isaac, signifying laughter. Laughter means joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God was making a picture of coming blessings. Abraham here represents Jehovah God (Romans 4:16, 17); Isaac represents God’s only begotten Son, Jesus of Nazareth; and Sarah represents the covenant. (Galatians 4:22-26) As Isaac caused rejoicing at his birth, so his antitype, the Lord Jesus, at His birth caused great rejoicing in heaven and on earth. It was then that a host of angels sang: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is exceedingly interesting to follow the type and the antitype, arid to mark how marvelously the Lord foreshadowed the great redemption and blessing of mankind. When Isaac was about grown God said to Abraham: “Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.”—Genesis 22: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Moriah is one of the mountains upon which the city of Jerusalem was afterwards built. Mount Moriah is the site of the temple. The Mosque of Omar is now built upon the site, and the place is sacred to the Mohammedans. But the day will come, not far distant, when it will be even more sacred to Mohammedans, Jews, and Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Abraham’s Test of Faith &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Abraham journeyed from Mamre to Moriah, his son with him. Isaac had no intimation that he was to be the sacrifice. Reaching the place indicated, they built an altar; and then Isaac said to his father: “Wliere is the lamb for a burnt offering?” (Genesis 22:7) Here was a supreme test of faith. Abraham bound Isaac, and laid him upon the altar. God had promised that through Abraham’s seed the blessing should come; and now He asked Abraham to take the life of his only son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Abraham believed that God was able to raise his son out of death. He took the knife, and raised it for the fatal blow, when an angel called unto him: “Lay not thine hand upon the lad, . . . for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me. . . . By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord; for because thou hast done this thing, . . . that in blessing I will bless thee, . . . and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.”—Gen. 22:12-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Promise Certain of Fulfilment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the perfect man Adam sinned he began to die, and all his offspring are under sentence of death. God could not change His judgment; but He could make a provision that His own law’s requirements could be met by another. Jesus was sent into the world to redeem mankind from death. (John 3:16,17) The “seed” of Abraham is the Messiah, which, according to St. Paul, is Christ and His Church. When the Church is glorified in the first resurrection, the long-deferred blessings of life, liberty, and happiness will be showered upon humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God’s determination to bless all was pictured in His oath to Abraham, which was an unconditional promise on the part of God. Everlasting life will not be forced upon any, but the promise guarantees that the opportunity for the blessing will be granted to every one.—1 Timothy 2: 3-6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">MANUFACTURERS'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">RECORD ON WARPATH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Manufacturers' Record says that, “Organizations representing, or purporting to represent, religious interests or the churches should be extremely careful in the wording of the statements which they send out to the Press, but we regret to say that the Federal Council of the Churches has issued many statements which do not convey the exact facts, but which do serve to create an entirely erroneous impression, and in this respect that organization so words much of its propaganda as to mislead newspaper readers who are not thoroughly posted.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After going that far the editor of the Record seemed to feel there was still something lacking in what he had started out to say, so he wound up with the observation that, &quot;Our contention is that absolute truthfulness in statements on the part of the Federal Council of the Churches is important, unless it intends to bring about a reaction in which intelligent people will not accept as thoroughly truthful any statement issued by it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">BOSTON TO NEW YORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">IN LESS THAN AN HOUR</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An army flier, Lieutenant R. C. Moffat, who was in a hurry to deliver some photographs, flew from Boston to the Mitchell Aviation Field in New York in 58 minutes, recently, and returned again to Boston in 67 minutes flying against the wind. This is more than twice as fast as the fastest train ever operated between the two cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">PREVENT SAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">FROM SPREADING</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Down on Cape Cod the State of Massachusetts is preventing the spreading of drifting sand by the planting of Scotch Pine. The planting of these trees not only has the effect of holding the sand in place, but the trees first planted are now nearly ready to be cut, and what was first intended as an emergency measure to protect the city of Provincetown will doubtless in the end be a profitable business venture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">BRITISH HOUSING</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">SITUATION IMPROVING</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The London Daily Express reports a building boom all over England, but especially in the South. The houses which are being erected are almost entirely of moderate size, and are sold as soon as they are finished or while they are still building. This has resulted in a call for bricks so great that British brick yards are unable to meet the demand, and millions of bricks are coming in from Germany and other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">GRASSHOPPERS WIPED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">OUT BY FLIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Helena, Montana, reports that this summer just as the grasshopper pest was becoming acute, swarms of flesh flies came into the fields and killed the hopper, by depositing listing maggots which ate into the vital organs and caused its death.</span></p>

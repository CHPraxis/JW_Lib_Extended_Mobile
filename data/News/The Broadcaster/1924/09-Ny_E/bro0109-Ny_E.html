<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Entered as Second Class Matter August 14, 1924, at the Post Office at Brooklyn,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> N.

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark5"></a>ONE MORE KING OUT</span><br><br><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark6"></a>OF BUSINESS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">King- Hussein of the Hedjaz, after he had spent several hours in prayer and in wireless communication with his son Feisal, king of Mesopotamia, and his son Abdullah, king of Trans-jordania, has decided to give up his job; partly because warring tribesmen were about to capture his capital, Mecca; and partly because the leading men of Mecca united in a written request to him to please get out. King Hussein has also resigned as head of the Moslem church.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark8"></a>RULE OF MILITARISTS</span><br><br><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark9"></a>IN HUNGARY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Details just brought to light show’ that in 1919, officers w<sup>T</sup>ho are still connected with the Hungarian Government were responsible for killing six laborers without even asking their names. In the town of Dunafoldbar they hanged a number of young people without a hearing. In Simontornya, victims w’ere first cruelly tortured before being executed, but in the same towm at least one prominent man who had been arrested was given his liberty upon payment of a bribe.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark11"></a>HERRIOT STANDS FOR</span><br><br><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark12"></a>LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">After assuring the French cardinals that the Catholic faith w’ould not be molested in any way, Premier Herriot says, and every lover of liberty and progress will applaud his assertions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“But we are resolved to protect the rights and conscience of individuals. We are entrusted to maintain State rights, but w’e are of the opinion that it is necessary to distinguish the spiritual from the temporal. While refraining from interfering w’ith individuals we refuse to permit these rights to lie controlled by others than those concerned with our national sovereignty.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A new and sensible use has been discovered for the airplane. Loaded with a half ton of arsenate of calcium, the plane speeds back and forth across the fields, leaving a path of dusted cotton, fully 200 feet wide. The dusting is much more effectively done from the airplane than close at hand, and only about a third as much dust is needed, namely, about two pounds to the acre.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark17"></a>The Distress of Germany</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font5">EN years ago the German empire was the greatest world-power on earth. Today her pomp and glory are gone. The richest mineral productive portion of Germany is in the hands of an enemy that, for tin* time being, is a victor. The German people have suffered great loss therefrom, and the enemy has reaped no real benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fields are tilled chiefly by women. The men that survived the war have congregated in the cities with but few exceptions. The farming of the soil is done in a primitive way, principally with spades and hoes and other hand instruments. Seldom is a team of horses or mules seen to be drawing the plow or harrow. A familiar sight is that of a milch cow drawing the plow guided by the hand of a woman. When the day’s work is done the children must drink the milk from a cow that has labored hard in the field. Obviously the result is injurious to the children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sorrow Written on Faces</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people are despondent and sad. Upon practically all faces are seen sorrow, disappointment and despair. The wages paid for labor are inadequate to provide the necessary comforts of home life. Food and clothing are high. Two years ago Germany was the cheapest country in Europe in which to reside. Today it is the most expensive. The goods produced are inferior, the prices are higher, and the merchant and tradesman are indulging in profiteering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason is obvious when the facts are known. The public press does not publish the inside facts, because it is thought these facts might disturb conditions even more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The merchant who carries an account at a bank, and who is compelled to borrow money to carry on his business, is required by the bank to pay four percent monthly, or forty-eight percent annually, for all money borrowed; and if his business is poor and he is forced to overdraw his account at the bank the rate of interest is increased by the bank to eighty-four percent annually. Thus it is seen that in only a short time his capital is wiped out in interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Gold Mark Will Not Save</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The merchant feels that he must sell his goods at an exorbitant price in order to meet his obligations. Thus the banks are forcing the business men to be profiteers, and the rank and file of the common people are the victims. All this has no tendency to sweeten the disposition of the people. Socialism, Communism, and other forms of radicalism are ever on the increase. The tide of discontent rises higher and higher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The banks have adopted the gold mark at a fixed price. It is purely fictitious, being fiat money. There is nothing back of it. The gold mark is bound to fail, and the Dawes Plan will be a complete failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These conditions are alarming to the financiers and to the statesmen. These are running into the arms of the ecclesiastics, particularly into the Papal church, hoping there to find some means of appeasing the wrath that is falling upon them, or to find some shelter from the impending storm. Their hearts are failing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is but one class in Germany that is content. This class is composed of a few people who have turned their hearts fully to the Lord, and are waiting patiently for the establishment of Uis kingdom upon the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is said of Germany practically applies to Iloumania, Czecho-Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, and the other countries of Southern Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan Has Control of Men</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There must be some good and adequate reason why Europe is in such distress and perplexity, and why this condition increases rather than decreases. The men who have attempted to rule the earth have been overreached by the great adversary, the devil. The financial element, the real strength of the nations, has been wickedly selfish. The politicians have done the bidding of the commercial power. Ecclesiasticism, for a time, enjoyed the high privilege of representing the Lord and declaring His kingdom; but these have yielded to the baneful influence of the “Wicked One,” joined hands with the commercial and political powers of the earth, and thus the three elements have formed what the Scriptures describe as “the beast.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord declares that this order of things should end at some time certain; and the Scriptures show that the beginning of that end would be in the autumn of 1914, and that it would be marked by a world war, followed by famine's and pestilence. Jesus, then speaking specifically of conditions that would exist in the earth following the war, and that would be a proof of the end of the old order of things, said: “Upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves [restless people] roaring; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.” Thus we see a complete fulfilment of our Lord’s word.—Luke 21: 25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lord Blesses When Man Yields</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is apparent to all thoughtful men that the present conditions of the world point to a crisis—to a great time of trouble not far distant. The statesmen of the world recognize this and freely admit the difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah foreknew exactly what would transpire at this time; and, speaking through His prophet, declared of our day: “At that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there Was a nation even to that same time; • and at that time thy people shall be delivered.”—Daniel 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the people of earth turn their hearts and minds to the Lord He will bring them out of their distressed condition, and establish amongst them a government of righteousness that shall fulfil the desire of every honest heart.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Germany has developed a system of telephone conversation between passengers on the Berlin-Hamburg express and persons at Berlin and other | German cities, which has proved entirely successful, although the train was speeding at 45 miles an hour. The conversations were very distinct, connections were made without difficulty, the price charged was only the ordinary telephone rate. It is expected to extend the service immediately to all the principal express trains of Germany. No such arrangement as this 1 is at present in operation anywhere in । America.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark27"></a>WHAT IT COST TO SEIZE</span><br><br><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark28"></a>THE ISLAND OF HAITI</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has drawn attention to the report of Major General Barnett, former commander of marines in Haiti, in which he admits that besides “many unlawful and indiscriminate killings” the marines under his command in seizing the island of Haiti slew 3,250 Haitians. The number of U. S. marines killed 1 in this slaughter of Haitian black men j was less than 20. It is generally supposed that Haiti was seized in order to satisfy the demands of one of the New York banks, which had loaned money to the Haitian Government, and which also occasionally loans money to the United States Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Last year, in the high schools of Cleveland, Ohio, military drill was compulsory, and 3,016 boys participated in the drills in seven of the high schools. This year, the military drill was made optional, and the number of boys enlisted for the drill was 2,089.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark30"></a>LLOYD GEORGE WAXES</span><br><br><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark31"></a>SARCASTIC</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Writing in sarcastic vein of the progress of the Christian religion in China, Lloyd George in an article in the Phila. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Bulletin,</span><span class="font5"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;The best army is supposed to be commanded by a Christian General of the name of Feng Huh Siang. He has trained his army on the modern Christian principles, as they are practiced in the West. They, alone in China, know how to drive an argument home with the bayonet. I assume they are all true Protestants, for they pride themselves on being called ‘Ironsides?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;In the war of 1922, the eminent Christian warrior who leads this phalanx is reported to have ridden into Honan on a bicycle, gone straight to the Y. M. C. A. there and, in his reply to addresses of welcome naturally tendered him by his fellow believers, ‘declared himself a Christian and said it was his aim to do his duty as a Christian should.’ He is as good as his word, for he has marched at the head of 10,000 of his Ironsides to take part in a fratricidal struggle around Shanghai.”</span></p>

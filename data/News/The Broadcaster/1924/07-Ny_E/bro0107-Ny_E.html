<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>WHY THE MILITARISTS</span><br><br><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark6"></a>SEIZED CHILE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The reason why the militarists seized Chile and drove out of the country the only president who ever represented the common people of that country, is that he demanded separation of church and state, the reduction of the army and navy, and the placing of proper income taxes upon the representatives of the so-called one hundred “first families” of Chile, who have practically all the v'ealth of the country in their hands. From the time Alessandri assumed office, all the power of the Roman Catholic Church, the militarists, and the grafters, was lised against him. At the time he was chased out, he had only eighteen dollars in his pocket.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Two generals of the Greek army are under arrest for having attempted obtain a revolt of the Grecian 4rmy against the newly established treek Republic. It was their hope bring in another Royalist form of government ; but they did not succeed i» their attempt, as the soldiers refused to follow their advice.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>SWAGGERING IN FRONT OF JAPAN</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Japan probably looks upon the American recent “Defense Day” test as an unnecessary affront. Perhaps she feels the same way also about the concluding paragraph of the speech of Secretary of the Navy Wilbur at San Francisco, which is believed to have led the President to summon him to return to Washington immediately. Mr. Wilbur said: “It has been a great personal satisfaction for me to come down the coast with 14,000 sailors wearing the American uniform in ships adequate for their own protection and for the protection of our coasts, both east and west, from the aggression of any people influenced, as all people may be, by some extension of the mob spirit, some outburst of passion or some real or fancied insult. There is nothing so cooling to a hot temper as a piece of cold steel. There is nothing so conductive to calm and cool deliberation as the contemplation of adequate means of defense of our opponent.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark16"></a>The End of the World</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font5">HE meaning of </span><span class="font4">the phrase “end of the world” has been greatly misunderstood. For generations people have been taught that the end of the world meant that the earth and everything in it would be burned up amidst suffering beyond description. Necessarily this caused dread in the minds </span><span class="font5">of </span><span class="font4">the people. Since unpleasant things are not desirable to listen to, few have cared to hear anything about the end </span><span class="font5">of </span><span class="font4">the world. When properly understood, however, it is a theme to be welcomed with joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bondage Superseded by Liberty</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The human race has long been in bondage to evil influences. If the people can understand that the end of the world means release from this bondage, bringing to them happiness and peace, health and strength, this message would be received with gladness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The word “world” as used in Scripture does not mean earth. It means the social, political, and ecclesiastical ' order of things controlling the general course of man. Everyone will bear witness to the fact that the history of the world is written in tears and human blood. It has been a long, suffering and toilsome way; yet man has ever hoped for something better. The end of the world means the end of such suffering and the beginning of a better way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The earth is the mundane sphere upon which man resides. The earth will never be destroyed. (Ecclesiastes 1:4; Isaiah 45:18) God formed the earth that man might have a home suitable to </span><span class="font5">his nature; and when man </span><span class="font4">is restored to perfection in the Messianic kingdom the earth will be a fit place in which to spend eternity. While man has been going through trying experiences, the earth has been in course of development, and by the time that man is restored to a perfect condition the earth will be like the garden of the Lord, an Edenic Paradise. It will be Paradise restored. The Bible gives us to understand that heaven is God's home, but the earth hath He given to the children of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Worlds Are Dispensations</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The period of time from Eden until the flood is described in the Scriptures as the “world that was.” “Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.” (2 Peter 3:6) Noah and his family were in that world; and they were carried over to the new world, which began when the flood ceased. Noah had warned the people of the end of that world and of the coming deluge. A parallel is found at the end of the present world, when some are warning the people now that it is about to end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The world which began at the flood is mentioned as the “present evil world.” (Galatians 1:4) St. Peter says that it is “kept in store, reserved unto fire [destruction] against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.” (2 Peter 3: 7) We are told that after the second world is destroyed there is to be a third world, one “wherein dwelleth righteousness” </span><span class="font5">(2 </span><span class="font4">Peter 3:13) Therefore worlds are dispensations or epochs, progressive steps in the divine plan of the ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus often spoke to His disciples about the coming of the Messianic kingdom, which would necessitate the overthrow of the Satanic arrangement </span><span class="font5">or </span><span class="font4">evil order of things. The disciples were anxious to know about this new kingdom, and asked the question re-* corded in Matthew 24:3. The question was: “Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign </span><span class="font5">of </span><span class="font4">thy coming, and of the end of the world?’’ The correct translation is more comprehensive: “What shall be the proof of thy presence and of the end of the age?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not any longer a man but a divine being, Jesus would be invisible to the human eye at the second advent; and after Ilis arrival His kingdom would gradually come into power, and then remain for one thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus Speaks with Authority</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus in His answer shows that it would be a long time before the end </span><span class="font5">of </span><span class="font4">the world would come. But He spoke with authority, and His answer </span><span class="font5">is </span><span class="font4">prophetic. He knew that by the time it did come His answer would be forgotten by all except those who were diligently watching the unfolding of events in the light of the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus said that the nations would be angry, and that God’s wrath would be manifested against them: “Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.” (Matthew 24:7,8) It would be impossible for the physical facts to fit more completely the conditions foretold than what we have observed to happen during the past ten years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1914 began the World War, the worst that man has ever experienced; 8,000,000 were killed. It was followed by pestilences, the like of which were never known before; about 32,000,000 perished by influenza. Great famines swept the earth, the worst that were ever known; about 120,000,000 have died of starvation. Over twenty minor and nine major earthquakes have killed hundreds of thousands and destroyed much property since 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus, being familiar with the prophecies, said that Jerusalem should be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles should be </span><span class="font5">ful</span><span class="font4">filled. The “times of the Gentiles” is </span><span class="font5">a </span><span class="font4">period of 2,520 years, which began in 606 B. C., with the overthrow of God’s typical kingdom, when Zedekiah was dethroned. The prophet Ezekiel said that the kingdom would be overturned until 'Tie come whose right it is,” </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font4">it would be given to him.” This is </span><span class="font5">a </span><span class="font4">reference to the kingdom of the Lord. The “times of the Gentiles” reaches from 606 B. C. exactly to 1914, and the World War came right on time. When the present selfishness in the world comes to the full, adding greater sorrows, then Messiah’s kingdom will be fully inaugurated and the desire </span><span class="font5">of all </span><span class="font4">nations shall speedily come.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark18"></a>USE OF GOVERNMENT</span><br><br><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark19"></a>PLANES IN HAITI</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Not long ago we noticed that officers of the United States Government presented the use of United States Government planes to a Roman Catholic priest who wished to make a trip from New York to San Francisco. Now we have a word that other government officials are loaning other government planes for the use of an Episcopal clergyman in Haiti. This free use of government property by preachers leads us to wonder why the officials who are so free with airplanes should stop there. Why not supply yachts, cruisers, battleships, printing presses, paper, postage, radio service, meat and drink, especially the latter, free?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark21"></a>TAX BURDEN GROWS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The tax burden of the people of the United States was over three-quarters of a billion dollars more in 1923 than in 1922. In ten years, from 1914, the Federal, State, and Local government tax of the country has risen over five and one-half billion dollars or, in terms of dollars, over three and one-half times as much as it was in 1913.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark23"></a>MAKING USE OF THE</span><br><br><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark24"></a>FIELDS OF MACEDONIA</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Fields of Macedonia, which had not been tilled since the days of Alexander the Great, have been subjugated this past summer by the use of American tractors. Refugees from Smyrna and Armenia are being settled on these lands. The Grecian Government is borrowing $50,000,000 to assist in carrying out its plans of making these refugees self-supporting.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark26"></a>SUGAR MADE FROM</span><br><br><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark27"></a>CORN</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">Superior sugar, excellent in sweetness and preserving qualities, can now be made from corn. It is said to be a-purer product than sugar made from either cane or beets. But the sugar trust, according to Alfred W. McCann, will not let Attorney General Stone or Secretary of Agriculture Wallace give recognition to the new form of sugarderived from corn. In refining, cane-and beet sugar go through a “stench” period which is not necessary for the; corn sugar. But to hinder the marketing of this new product the Washings ton officials will not allow it to be labeled “sugar”.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark29"></a>ANOTHER WONDER OF</span><br><br><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark30"></a>INVENTION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">An inexpensive, safe and simple way has been found by which wheat straw may be converted into gas, tar, and carbon residue. The method has been developed by the United States Bureau of Chemistry, which claims that one ton of sun-dried wheat straw will yield 10,000 feet of illuminating gas, 10 gallons of tar, and 25 pounds of carbon residue. It will also supply an efficient fuel for internal combustion engines. Something like </span><span class="font5">this </span><span class="font4">was found a few years ago by acci* dent at Moose Jaw, Canada.</span></p>

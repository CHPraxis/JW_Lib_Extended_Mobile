<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark3"></a>PLAN FOR A UNITED IRELAND</span></h2>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>HEARTENS LOVERS OF LOVABLE PEOPLE</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>MACDONALD’S GREAT</span><br><br><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark8"></a>SPEECH AT GENEVA</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">Premier Ramsay MacDonald in a great speech before the League of Nations at Geneva made a sterling appeal for a new era in world, affairs based on righteousness and justice. Concerning militarism, these greatest of curses burdening mankind, he said: &quot;Our position is this: We don’t believe a military alliance is going to bring security. We believe a military alliance is an agreement for. security; like the mustard seed, is small to begin with, and that this seed with the years will grow and grow, until at last the tree produced from it will overshadow the whole heavens and we shall be back exactly at the military position in which we found ourselves in 1914.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark10"></a>WHY MANY CHILDREN</span><br><br><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>ARE CRIMINALS</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">The reason has been discovered why so many of the first children born to immigrants after they arrive in America are criminals. The mothers are disturbed, everything is new and strange and difficult, and they have to work too hard. To make the lot of these mothers easier is an act of truest charity and truest sentiment. Every discovery of science proves that mothers cannot do more than care for the home without danger to the next generation.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark13"></a>THE POSSIBILITY OF A UNITED IRELAND</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">All friends of Ireland will be interested to know of a plan already received with a measure of approval by all parties interested, which proposes a permanent division of Ireland into two parts, Northern and Southern, with a joint All-Ireland Council composed of representatives of the North and of the South in equal numbers and with equal rights for deciding all matters affecting the whole of Ireland. The plan proposes that neither the Southern nor Northern Parliament shall make any law to endow or prohibit any religion, or impose any disability on account of religious belief. This plan seems to have splendid possibility.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark15"></a>FINDING HONDURAS</span><br><br><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark16"></a>NON-COMBATANT</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">The United States government is trying to pick a president for Honduras, who has not been entangled on either side in the revolutions and counter revolutions so frequent in Honduras of late. If the United States feels that it must interfere in Honduras affairs, we think this policy of encouraging only the non-combatants is a most excellent one, and should be imitated by all governments to the remotest bounds of earth.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark18"></a>A Desirable Government</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font4"> GOVERNMENT is a body politic, governed or controlled by duly constituted authority. A desirable government is one the powers of which are exercised in a just and righteous manner for the greatest good to all the people. Such government would bring a blessing to all people who desire to do right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For more than 6,000 y,ears man has attempted to establish a government that is satisfactory. Today the leading statesmen of the world freely admit that efforts toward establishing a desirable government have failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Disorder in </span><span class="font4">Present Governments</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is not a government on earth today that satisfies any reasonable proportion of the people. Discontent exists everywhere; selfishness is always to the fore; tho nations are practically bankrupt; and many of them are ruled by dictators. Every effort at reformation has proven abortive. The statesmen of the world have attempted by leagues and similar compacts to solve the difficulty. The financiers have made an attempt. Church denominations have put forth every effort. All have failed. The reason is that all have ignored God’s way. Man’s extremity should cause him to consider calmly God’s way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Eden Adam had an ideal government. When he sinned, he lost it; and every effort since to establish a righteous government has met with failure. </span><span class="font5">While </span><span class="font4">some efforts at reformation have made progress, none has suc</span><span class="font5">ceeded in </span><span class="font4">bringing the desire of </span><span class="font5">all nations to the people. God promised </span><span class="font4">that through the seed of Abraham all the families of the earth should be blessed. This seed is the Messiah, the Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Expecting Blessings from God</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Orthodox Jews have, for centuries past, expected the Messiah to establish an ideal government. Christians have vaguely looked forward to the time of the second coming of the Lord, the setting up of His kingdom; and all denominations have taught their members to pray: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” (Matthew 6:10) How, then, could we expect the will of God to be done thus on earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Is there any hope of reforming those who indulge in fraudulent practices, in oil scandals or like schemes to defraud men? Is it possible to remedy their wrongs by sending them to prison and holding them up to the scorn of mankind? No! Long efforts at this have failed. The reason why men in high official positions become unfaithful is because of their weaknesses inherited by reason of the fall of Adam. </span><span class="font5">There </span><span class="font4">is but one remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God has provided through' His </span><span class="font5">be</span><span class="font4">loved Son redemption for the human race, and has promised that at His second coming the kingdom of righteousness under Christ shall give to every man an opportunity to profit in the dominion of earth which shall then have been transferred to Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We may know that the kingdom </span><span class="font5">of </span><span class="font4">the Lord will not be entrusted to selfish men. The kingdoms of earth </span><span class="font5">are </span><span class="font4">tottering, </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font4">many have already </span><span class="font5">fall</span><span class="font4">en; the whole world is in distress and perplexity, and the rulers do not know what to expect. The time has come for the establishment of God’s kingdom in the earth. We know this because the old order has ended and is being destroyed. The Lord is cleaning up the ground preparatory to beginning His reign of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God’s Declaration is Sure</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God through His prophet, referring to this time, said: “And in the days of these kings [toes of the Gentile image, the last rulers] shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.”—Daniel 2:44; 7:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Referring to Messiah, the Prophet said: “The government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.” (Isaiah 9: 6, 7) And we are plainly told that the overcoming Church shall reign with Christ as kings and priests for a thousand years. These will be in the spiritual or invisible phase of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The visible rulers are to be men who have proved their loyalty to truth and righteousness. The eleventh chapter of Hebrews enumerates the ancient worthies, from Abel to the last of the prophets. They loved righteousness and hated iniquity. They were not popular in the world. They were destitute, afflicted, tormented, slain with the sword. They all died in faith and were pleasing to God; and they have been sleeping in the dust of the earth awaiting the resurrection day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Earthly Rulers Made Perfect</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Apostle in Hebrews 11th chapter shows that when the Christ, the seed of Abraham, the royal family of heaven, is complete, these faithful men of old will have a resurrection. They will come forth from the tomb as perfect men. Referring to the progenitors of the household of faith, God, through the prophet, said: “Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.” (Psalm 45:16) And these princes shall rule in judgment.—Isaiah 32:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“When thy [God’s] judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.” “With righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: . . . righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. . . . They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain [kingdom]: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” (Isaiah 26:9; 11: 4,5, 9) Thus will come the desirable government.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">ALFONSO READY FOR</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ANOTHER INQUISITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Alfonso was recently in Italy he is reported by the Italian paper “Iltestimeno&quot; as having offered to the Pope ‘‘the solemn pledge of the secular arm in Spain to combat heresy, and the promise to begin a crusade against the enemies of the Church when the Pope thinks it necessary.” What must be the hopeless benighted condition of the Spanish people when their king could give expression to sentiments so opposite to education or even to common sense ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">HOW TO GET YOUR</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">SINS FORGIVEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You can get your sins forgiven during 1925, and also receive &quot;the fullest indulgence, remission and pardon,” if, during that time you pray once a day for the Pope for twenty days and visit four churches in Rome, which he has been good enough to name. There is another way also recorded in the Old Book. It reads: &quot;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;—1 John 1:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">GROWTH OF FRENCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">COMMERCIAL AVIATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">France has four commercial aviation companies whose routes cover most of Europe. Last year the planes of these companies made 9,720 trips carrying about 1,200 passengers, and a thousand tons of merchandise, with only six accidents. The French mails to the west coast of Morocco now require about a day as against three and one-half days by boat. Moreover, the planes go every day and the boats only twice a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">OCEAN CURRENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ACTING STRANGELY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Western Greenland, warmed by the Gulf Stream, is freer now from cold than formerly, because the Labrador current has ever diminished its speed or has been submerged to the bottom of the ocean caused by seismic disturbances or earthquakes. The Labrador current normally flows through Davis Strait and coming in proximity to the Gulf Stream swings east and then northeast. If the change is permanent the Gulf Stream may warm the Scandinavian shores, and the submerged Labrador current may cool the lower Atlantic waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">SUICIDES AMONG</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE RICH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is an increasing tendency to suicide on the part of well-to-do and highly educated people; and there is no increase among other people, says Fred. L. Hoffman of the Prudential Life Insurance Company. The Pacific States lead the country in this respect with San Diego ignominiously showing up in front with 50 per 100,000, an excess of 29 percent. While nearly all cities show increases, it is notable that the Great Lake Region shows a decrease, as Chicago, Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, and Milwaukee are below the average.</span></p>

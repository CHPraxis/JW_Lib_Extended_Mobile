<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>AN INEXHAUSTIBLE TREASURE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">IS FOUND IN THE DEAD SEA</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark5"></a>HERRIOT DISCONTINUES</span><br><br><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark6"></a>EMBASSY TO VATICAN</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">For years the United States Government has been without any official diplomatic representative among the sixteen different kind,s of Methodist churches, the fifteen kinds of Baptist churches, the twelve kinds of Presbyterian churches, the twenty-one kinds of Lutheran churches, the fbnr kinds of Plymouth Brethren, and the fiftyseven other varieties of which we more or less feebly boast. And now, following this sensible example, the French Government has decided to save money by cutting off its embassy to the Roman Catholics. The Vatican is said to be much grieved over this.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark8"></a>BULGARIAN CHILDREN’S CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The school children of Bulgaria obtain their clothing, shoes, school books, and medical attention, all at actual cost without a cent of profit to anyone concerned. This cooperative plan, introduced originally at the capital, has proven so successful and desirable that it has spread throughout the country. Cooperative activity should become contagious. When the right spirit animates man, cooperation will prove workable.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark10"></a>DEAD SEA PALESTINE’S GREATEST ASSET</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The waters of the Bead Sea have been found to bo heavily laden with potash, one of the most essential ingredients of fertilizer. <sub>t</sub> It has been founds also, that this potash can be laid down on the Mediterranean seaboard for one-half the cost of European potash. What a strange conclusion confronts us; namely, that the Dead Sea, supposedly worthless, is destined to become Palestine’s inexhaustible bank!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark12"></a>CAUSES OF OUR</span><br><br><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark13"></a>COOLER SUMMERS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Elias R. Dunn, familiarly known as “Farmer Dunn” of the Weather Bureau, says that the reason for the cooler smnmers in the northern and eastern states is the irrigation of vast areas in the southwest. These cause the transcontinental storms to pass farther south than formerly, and in their passage they draw down upon us cool winds from the north. It is impossible to transform a desert into a water surface without notable and permanent climatic changes. Many other physical changes are going on in our planet, and all possibly working towards its ultimate perfection.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark15"></a>A Desirable Government</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">A</span><span class="font3"> GOVERNMENT is a body politic, governed or controlled by duly constituted authority. A desirable government is one the powers of which are exercised in a just and righteous manner for the greatest good to all the people. Such government would bring a blessing to all people who desire to do right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For more than 6,000 years man has attempted to establish a government that is satisfactory. Today the leading statesmen of the world freely admit that efforts toward establishing a desirable government have failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Disorder in Present Governments</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is not a government on earth today that satisfies any reasonable proportion of the people. Discontent exists everywhere; selfishness is always to the fore; the nations are practically bankrupt; and many of them are ruled by dictators. Every effort I at reformation has proven abortive. The statesmen of the world have attempted by leagues and similar compacts to solve the difficulty. The financiers have made an attempt. Church denominations have put forth every effort. All have failed. The reason is that all have ignored God’s way. Man’s extremity should cause him to consider calmly God’s way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Eden Adam had an ideal government. When he sinned, he lost it; and every effort since to establish a righteous government has met with failure. While some efforts at reformation have made progress, none has succeeded in bringing the desire of all nations to the people. God promised that through the seed of Abraham all the families of the earth should be blessed. This seed is the Messiah, the Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Expecting Blessings from God</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Orthodox Jews have, for centuries past, expected the Messiah to establish an ideal government. Christians have vaguely looked forward to the time of the second coming of the Lord, the setting up of His kingdom; and all denominations have taught their members to pray: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” (Matthew 6:10) How, then, could we expect the will of God to be done thus on earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Is there any hope of reforming those who indulge in fraudulent practices, in oil scandals or like schemes to defraud men? Is it possible to remedy their wrongs by sending them to prison and holding them up to the scorn of mankind? No! Long efforts at this have failed. The reason why men in high official positions become unfaithful is because of their weaknesses inherited by reason of the fall of Adam. There is but one remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God has provided through His beloved Son redemption for the human race, and has promised that at His second coming the kingdom of righteousness under Christ shall give tn every man an opportunity to profit in the dominion of earth which shall then have been transferred to Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We may know that the kingdom of the Lord will not be entrusted to selfish men. The kingdoms of earth are tottering, atnd many have already fall-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">en; the whole world is in distress and perplexity, and the rulers do not know what to expect. The time has come for the establishment of God’s kingdom in the earth. We know this because the old order has ended and is being destroyed. The Lord is cleaning up the ground preparatory to beginning His reign of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God’s Declaration is Sure</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God through His prophet, referring to this time, said: “And in the days of these kings [toes of the Gentile image, the last rulers] shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.”—Daniel 2:44; 7: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Referring to Messiah, the Prophet said: “The government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.” (Isaiah 9: 6,7) And we are plainly told that the overcoming Church shall reign with Christ as kings and priests for a thousand years. These will be in the spiritual or invisible phase of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The visible rulers are to be men who have proved their loyalty to truth and righteousness. The eleventh chapter of Hebrews enumerates the ancient worthies, from Abel to the last of the prophets. They loved righteousness and hated iniquity. They were not popular in the world. They were destitute, afflicted, tormented, slain with the sword. They all died in faith and were pleasing to God; and they have been sleeping in the dust of the earth awaiting the resurrection day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Earthly Rulers Made Perfect</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Apostle in Hebrews 11th chapter shows that when the Christ, the seed </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font3"> Abraham, the royal family </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font3">heaven, is complete, these faithful men of old will have a resurrection. They will come forth from the tomb as perfect men. Referring to the progenitors of the household of faith, God, through the prophet, said: “Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.” (Psalm 45:16) And these# princes shall rule in judgment.—Isaiah 32:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“When thy [God’s] judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.” “With righteousness shall he judge the poor; and reprove with equity dor the meek of the earth: . . . righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. . . . They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain [kingdom]: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.” (Isaiah 26:9; 11:4,5,9) Thus will come the desirable government.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">GREAT MOTOR HIGHWAY IN ASIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A great motor highway now reaches from the port of Beirut, on the Mediterranean Sea, all the way to Teheran, via Damascus and Bagdad. Over the same route, slow-moving caravans have traveled for centuries. Over part of this route, Abraham came with Sarah into the land of promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">WATERS OF EUPHRATES DRYING UP</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the face of recently published claims that the churches are increasing their “membership'’, the Institute of Social and Religious Research declares that church attendance all over New England, the Middle States, the Middle West, and the Far West is on the decline. Ministers today are preaching to empty pews. The people are refusing to go to church, because&lt; they do not believe that the preacheri himself believes what he is teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">CANCER CAUSED BY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">WHITE BREAD</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">J. Ellis Barker, a British investigator, has produced evidence to justify \ his contention that cancer is due to impoverishment and clogging of the system by that worst of all human foods, white bread. The same effects are also produced by swallowing tea and coffee at temperatures above 150°. Miners and farmers, whose work is of a nature to keep the muscles of the abdomen well developed, seldom suffer from cancer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">BREAD TO STAY AT</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TEN CENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The American Bakers' Association has agreed to continue to&gt; sell bread for 10 cents a loaf. It seems to us that this is a wise decision. There are 280 loaves of bread in a barrel of flour. For this wheat the farmer receives about $5; and it would certainly seem as though the millers, bakers, and railroad companies, and grocers ought to he able<sup>1 </sup>to get along on the $23 per barrel difference. Under a sensible plan of distribution the bread could be sold at 5 cents a loaf, and leave a profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“EXCEED THOSE DAYS SHOULD BE SHORTENED”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The United States Army now possesses an automatic pilot that flies airplanes without any one aboard. The possession of these planes makes it certain that no army can ever invade the United States, except by airplane. It also makes it certain that in the future no lying bankers can arrange for the trans-shipment to Europe of ft million of our best youths contrary to the Constitution of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">MANKIND TO LIVE A</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THOUSAND YEARS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A German scientist, Fritz Haber, has predicted that through elimination of the causes of death men will live to reach a thousand years of age. The Bible beats this estimate all hollow. It shows conclusively that the time is coming here on earth when death will cease absolutely. Best of all, we have entered the happy era; and there are millions now living who will never die.</span></p>

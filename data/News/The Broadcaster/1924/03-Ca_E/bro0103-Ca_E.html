<p><span class="font4">A </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font4"> ersey peach grower is ridding his orchard of moths by lighting the whole orchard brilliantly with electric lights. On dark nights the moths are attracted to the lights and fall to their death in kerosene cans placed beneath. The moths are thickest at eleven o’clock at night. The scheme does not work on moonlight nights.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark10"></a>PROGRESS ELIMINATING</span><br><br><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>TWELVE-HOUR DAY</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">In place of the man-killing twelve-hour day and seven-day week formerly prevailing in the steel industry, there is now, thanks to Ex-President Harding, an eighthour day and a six-day week throughout the works of The Carnegie Steel Company, Pittsburgh, The Illinois Steel Company, Chicago, The National Tube Company, Pittsburgh, and The American Steel and Wire Company, Cleveland. Changing over from the longer to the shorter day added 9,000 men to the Carnegie Steel Company’s payroll.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark13"></a>HABITS OF WEATHER</span><br><br><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark14"></a>BECOME UNRELIABLE</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The president of the largest wrecking concern in the United States declares that since the war the barometer, the cloud formations, the direction of the wind, the humidity, the heat of summer and the cold of winter can no longer be depended upon.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark16"></a>♦</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">This is the verdict of the seamen of his company who have spent their lives studying the weather. To our way of thinking, this is another proof that conditions in the earth are changing—getting Teady for the Millennium.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark18"></a>DESTROYS WEEDS BUT</span><br><br><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark19"></a>SPARES THE PLANTS</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">Michigan and California have been invaded by forms of insect life which feed only upon thistles, burdock, nettles, plantain and other weeds, and will not feed upon plants useful for human food unless driven to it by starvation. Mr. R. P. Pettit, professor of entomology of the Michigan Agricultural College, says truly: &quot;The coming of this creature in Michigan is really a Godsend.&quot; This so-called “thistle worm” attacks the thistle near the seed heads, thus destroying the seeds first.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Preparing Earth’s New Kings</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font5">HE Book of Revelation was written by St. John while serving a prison term on the Isle of Patmos, which message came from the Lord of glory after His resurrection. It gives </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">brief history of the Christian Church from its beginning until now. It points out that a time would come when the evil powers would be arrayed against the Lord in opposition to the establishment of His kingdom of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The evil powers will be, ensnared. For a time they will seem to be victorious, but their triumph is shortlived; for they are to be overcome. Jesus is the Lord of lords and King of kings, and they that are with Him are called, and chosen, and faithful. (Revelation 17:14) This is proof that the Lord Jesus is the great King, that He must come into His kingdom, and that He will have with Him others who, by His grace, will serve with Him as kings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Identification of the Kings</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In another part of the Revelation, Jesus said concerning those who will be with Him: “They shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.” (Revelation 20: 6) This is another proof that they will be kings; for only kings reign with power and authority. The ones here referred to shall occupy the most exalted positions in all God’s universe, Jehovah alone excepted. It follows that if these have such an exalted place Jehovah would take much time and pains in preparing them; for they must be exceptional characters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By what means is it possible to identify those who will compose this class of kings? They are designated under different titles. They are members of the body of Christ. St. Paul says that Jesus is the Head of the body, which is the Church. (Colossians 1:18) St. Peter says concerning this class: “Ye are a chosen generation, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">royal priesthood, an holy nation, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light: which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God.”—1 Peter 2:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It follows that whoever is a member of this class must measure up to the standard laid down by the apostle Peter. The Jews thought that they were the ones because God had previously promised that they should be unto Him a peculiar people and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">kingdom of priests. But today no Jew claims to be of that class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Confusion in the Churches</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There has been great confusion in the minds of the people as to what constitutes the Church of Christ. Those who are the light-bearers of truth, and who at heart measure up to the requirements, compose the true Church of Jesus Christ; and these are the kings, the priests, the members in particular of His body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After our Lord had ascended on high, men organized bodies which they designated the church. Many Catholics have long thought that their organization is the one mentioned by the apostle Peter; but when we come to apply the standard it can hardly be said that the Catholic church is a holy nation or a royal priesthood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then came upon the scene the Protestant church denominations, each in turn claiming to be the chosen people of the Lord who should constitute the special associates in His kingdom. We apply the divinely given standard; and we see that none of these systems organized by men meet the requirements. You may ask then: What earthly organization answers the description and comes up to the requirements? The answer is: There is no such earthly organization, nor did God intend for any to have this honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostle Paul speaks of the true Church in these words: “The church of the firstborn, which are written [margin, enrolled] in heaven.” (Hebrews 12:23) He does not say that their names are enrolled on some earthly church book; nor does he say that they are designated as clergy or laymen, or that they have any peculiar dress or marks visible to man. The Lord deals with His people according to the secret intent of the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How Selection is Made</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the members of the true Church are to be associated with Jesus as kings and priests, we should expect to find the qualifications required and the manner of selection set forth in the Bible. St. Paul says that the Lord did not lay hold upon angels to make them kings, but that He laid hold on the seed of Abraham, meaning those who possess the faith like Abraham, whether Jew or Gentile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Abraham is known as the father of the faithful; and the first essential to pleasing God is to have faith, faith that God exists, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. (Hebrews 11:6) None others are to be considered. Faith means (1) an intellectual understanding and appreciation of the Bible as God’s Word of truth given for the guidance of man relative to his salvation, and (2) a confident reliance upon that Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The terms of acceptance are laid down by the Lord in these words: “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.” (Matthew 16: 24, 25) To deny oneself means to agree to do what another would direct. One surrendering himself to the Lord, seeking the Lord’s favor and turning away from the world, agreeing to do the Lord’s will, may consider himself consecrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The real desire of one who thus makes consecration is that he may be in harmony with the Lord and in line for the enjoyment of the blessings of life everlasting. Justification follows the imputation of Christ’s meritorious sacrifice; and spirit-begetting (James 1:18) then is necessary before one is a “new creature in Christ Jesus” and a prospective heir to a place in the kingdom with Jesus as a member of the glorified royal priesthood.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">AVIATOR HEARS AND BROADCASTS MESSAGES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Despite the roar of his motor which prevents conversation in the airplane, an aviator flying a mile high over New York, and out of sight of the receiving station, carried on a lengthy conversation with a receiving station located in Central Park, which conversation was relayed to the public from one of the radio-casting stations in New York. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">LEPROSY NO</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">LONGER INCURABLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Chaulmoogra oil, useful in the treatment of leprosy, and formerly obtainable at great expense only from the west coast of Africa, is now produced on the grounds of Uncle Sam’s $1,000,000 leper colony at Carville, Louisiana. At this institution, lepers are frequently dismissed as cured. The relapses of cured patients are extremely rare. The Carville colony is large enough to take care of the entire 1,000 lepers now in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">HUNGARIAN CHILDREN</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">IN BELGIUM</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past season 3,500 Hungarian children have been entertained in Belgian homes, all of their expenses being paid by the Belgian people. After staying in Belgium for six months these little folks return home having gained from sixteen to twenty-four pounds in weight and being quite accomplished French scholars. No one can read of these tales of generosity and love without having their hearts warmed toward the common people who are trying to wipe out war hatreds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">POSSIBLE INTERVENTION BY ANGEL OF THE LORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the mining town of Slovan, Pennsylvania, in the home of Judge Tennyson, at midnight, his little four-year-old daughter became frightened and sought her parents’ bedroom. A little later during the night villians who desired to kill the judge blew up his home. The bed in which the little Miss had been sleeping was blown to atoms; but although the home was destroyed, none of the judge's family were injured in the least. We think it reasonable that this deliverance may have been brought about through the ministrations of one of the angels of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">BUSSES TAKE THE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">PLACE OF STREET CARS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In London and Paris, busses take the place of street cars. The same system is almost in sight for New York. John Hoitz, a Chicago man, has paid $20,000,000 for the Fifth Avenue coach line and its franchises and proposes to give New York a really up-to-date surface transportation. Mr. Hoitz seeks to operate thirty-four new routes, adding 116 miles to the present’ Fifth Avenue system. The chairman of the executive committee of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company has resigned from the Interborough to become chairman of the board of directors of the coach company. The north and south lines will operate on a ten cent fare and the crosstown lines on a five cent fare.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">All the papers now-a-days contain stories of troubles of Honduras. Some at least of the troubles are due to the fact that the United Fruit Company has been importing West Indians into Honduras so that it could control the labor situation there. This the Hon--durans do not like, and have threatened to resist by force. This makes a difficult situation for the Honduran Government to meet, as it has to reckon with the British Government and the United States Government before it can do anything.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Cardinal Mercier is reported in the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font4"> as having written to a gentleman of this city saying in part: &quot;The world at this hour is a great invalid. All eyes are turned to the physicians, all lips anxiously asking: Is there hope of recovery? Have you a remedy, the remedy? The physicans have no concrete answer; or, rather, they give divers answers all at once. The more the consultations and remedies multiply, the more we realize that we are at a standstill.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Following the examples of Mussolini, de Rivera and other dictators, General Altamirano, military head of the nation, has virtually seized the government. This seems to mark the end of the Chilean Republic, for the present. The attempt by the militarists to seize the government of Brazil has not succeeded as yet, but is still active.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In an address before the League of Nations the premier of Albania, Bishop F. S. Noli, said that everything the League said or did was bound to come to nothing, and that the Dawes Plan is “a tortuous, complicated, diabolical, infernal combination of bubbles, the most colossal super-bubble modem history has produced.” The premier, who is a graduate of Harvard University, described Boston as a city in Ireland “full of O’Connors, O’Connells and Fitz-Geralds, all of them good talkers, who with other Irishmen do all the talking in American electoral campaigns.” It was his hope that some of these Irish orators might come to Geneva and talk the assembly to death. Bishop, you surprise us!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Preparing Earth’s New Kings</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font4">HE Book of Revelation was written by St. John while serving a prison term on the Isle of Patmos, which message came from the Lord of glory after His resurrection. It gives a brief history of the Christian Church from its beginning until now. It points out that a time would come when the evil powers would be arrayed against the Lord in opposition to the establishment of His kingdom of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The evil powers will be ensnared. For a time they will seem to be victorious, but their triumph is shortlived; for they are to be overcome. Jesus is the Lord of lords and King of kings, and they that are with Him are called, and chosen, and faithful. (Revelation 17:14) This is proof that the Lord Jesus is the great King, that He must come into His kingdom, and that He will have with Him others who, by His grace, will serve with Him as kings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Identification of the Kings</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In another part of the Revelation, Jesus said concerning those who will be with Him: “They shall be priests of God and .of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.” (Revelation 20:6) This is another proof that they will be kings; for only kings reign with power and authority. The ones here referred to shall occupy the most exalted positions in all God’s universe, Jehovah alone excepted. It follows that if these have such an exalted place Jehovah would take much time and pains in preparing them; for they must be exceptional characters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By what means is it possible to</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">identify those who will compose this class of kings? They are designated under different titles. They are members of the body of Christ. St. Paul says that Jesus is the Head of the body, which is the Church. (Colossians 1:18) St. Peter says concerning this ■ class: “Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light: which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God.”—1 Peter 2:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It follows that whoever is a member of this class must measure up to the standard laid down by the apostle Peter. Tire Jews thought that they were the ones because God had previously promised that they should be unto Him a peculiar people and a kingdom of priests. But today no Jew claims to be of that class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Confusion in the Churches</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been great confusion in the minds of the people as to what constitutes the Church of Christ. Those who are the light-bearers of truth, and who at heart measure up to the requirements, compose the true Church , of Jesus Christ; and these are the kings, the priests, the members in par-■ ticular of His body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After our Lord had ascended on [high, men organized bodies which they designated the church. Many Catholics have long thought that their organization is the one mentioned by the apostle Peter; but when we come to apply the standard it can hardly be</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">said that the Catholic church is a holy nation or a royal priesthood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then came upon the scene the Protestant church denominations, each in turn claiming to be the chosen people of the Lord who should constitute the special associates in His kingdom. We apply the divinely given standard; and we see that none of these systems organized by men meet the requirements. You may ask then: What earthly organization answers the description and comes up to the requirements? The answer is: There is no such earthly organization, nor did God intend for any to have this honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle Paul speaks of the true Church in these words: “The church of the firstborn, which are written (margin, enrolled] in heaven.” (Hebrews 12:23) He does not say that their names are enrolled on some earthly church book ; nor does he say that they are designated as clergy or laymen, or that they have any peculiar dress or marks visible to man. The Lord deals with His people according to the secret intent of the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How Selection is Made</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the members of the true Church are to be associated with Jesus as kings and priests, we should expect to find the qualifications required and the manner of selection set forth in the Bible. St. Paul says that the Lord did not lay hold upon angels to make them kings, but that He laid hold on the seed of Abraham, meaning those who possess the faith like Abraham, whether Jew or Gentile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Abraham is known as the father of the faithful; and the first essential to pleasing God is to have faith, faith that God exists, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. (Hebrews 11:6) None others are to be considered. Faith means (1) an intellectual understanding and appreciation of the Bible as God’s Word of truth given for the guidance of man relative to his salvation, and (2) a confident reliance upon that Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The terms of acceptance are laid down by the Lord in these words: “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.” (Matthew 16: 24, 25) To deny oneself means to agree to do what another would direct. One surrendering himself to the Lord, seeking the Lord’s favor and turning away from the world, agreeing to do the Lord’s will, may consider himself consecrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The real desire of one who thus makes consecration is that he may be in harmony with the Lord and in line for the enjoyment of the blessings of life everlasting. Justification follows the imputation of Christ’s meritorious sacrifice; and spirit-begetting (James 1:18) then is necessary before one is a “new creature in Christ Jesus” and a prospective heir to a place in the kingdom with Jesus as a member of the glorified royal priesthood.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“MANUFACTURERS’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">RECORD” ON WARPATH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “Manufacturers’ Record” says that “organizations representing, or purporting to represent, religious interests or the churches should he extremely careful in the wording of the statements which they send out to the press, hut we regret to say that the Federal Council of the Churches has issued many statements which do not convey the exact facts, but which do serve to create an entirely erroneous impression, and in this respect that organization so words much of its propaganda as to mislead newspaper readers who are not thoroughly posted.” After going that far the editor of the “Record” seemed to feel sure there was still something lacking in what he had started out to say, so he wound up with the observation that “our contention is that absolute truthfulness in statement on the part of the Federal Council of Churches is important, unless it intends to bring about a reaction in which intelligent people will not accept as thoroughly truthful any statement issued by it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">BOSTON TO NEW YORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">IN LESS THAN AN HOUR</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An army flier, Lieutenant R. C. Moffatt, who was in a hurry to deliver some photographs, flew from Boston to the Mitchell Aviation Field in New York in. 58 minutes, recently, and returned again to Boston in 67 minutes flying against the wind. This is more than twice as fast as the fastest train ever operated between the two cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">PREVENT SAND FROM</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">SPREADING</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Down on Cape Cod the State of Massachusetts is preventing the spreading of drifting sand by the planting of Scotch pine. The planting of these trees not only has the effect of holding the sand in place but the trees first planted are nearly ready to be cut, and what was at first intended as an emergency measure to protect the city of Provincetown will doubtless in the end be a profitable business venture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">BRITISH HOUSING</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">SITUATION IMPROVING</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The London Daily </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Express</span><span class="font4"> reports a building boom all over England, but especially in the south. The houses which are being erected are almost entirely of moderate size, and are sold as soon as they are finished or while they are _still building. This has resulted in a call for bricks so great that British brick yards are unable to meet the demand, and millions of bricks are coming in from Germany and other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">GRASSHOPPERS WIPED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">OUT BY FLIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Helena, Montana, reports that this summer just as the grasshoppers pest was becoming acute, swarms of flesh flies came into the fields and killed the hopper by depositing living maggots which ate into the vital organs and caused its death.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>JOHN D. JR. SEES IT</span><br><br><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark6"></a>COMING</span></h3>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark8"></a>I</span></h3>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark10"></a>I NEW YORK LOOKS LIKE</span><br><br><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>ANCIENT BABYLON</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">John I). Rockefeller, Junior, sees what is coming. In a recent address he made the interesting and truthful, though none too pleasant observation, that “it is clear that civilization built upon the marvellous discoveries of science, made possible by the most advanced and general system known to man, with all the comforts, luxuries, pleasures and opportunities which it has brought, is headed toward its own annihilation.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark13"></a>“EXCEPT THOSE DAYS</span><br><br><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark14"></a>SHOULD BE SHORTENED”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">The president of the American Chemical Society, Dr. Baekeland, declares that “in future wars nobody will find a safe place where he may think he is safe or escape the consequences. The largest and best protected cities, irrespective of their size or distance, will be continuously exposed to destruction or mutilation. Death and torture of the inhabitants will occur whether they are slumbering in their beds, reading their newspapers or saying their prayers. There will be no way of safeguarding women or children.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tinies</span><span class="font5"> makes the interesting observation that “New York is getting to look more and more like the wicked capital of ancient Mesopotamia. The ‘setback’ compelled by the new building regulations is endowing us with mighty pyramidal structures whose successive narrowing levels are very much like the platforms on which people used to bring burnt offerings to Bel.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark16"></a>PRAYERS IN ST. MARK’S</span><br><br><span class="font6"><sup><a name="bookmark17"></a>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHURCH</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">At. St. Mark’s Episcopal Church, New York city, they have been having prayers. The papers tell all about it. There were invocations to the sun, moon, stars, winds, clouds, rains, mists, hills, valleys, rivers, lakes, trees, grasses, birds and animals and to some unnamed persons styled “all ye of the heavens”. There was an Aztec prayer, a mystic contemplation prayer and a totemistic prayer from the Omaha ritual of the Great White Rock. We do not know the text for the sermon. It may have been from Hoyle’s Book of Games or some book on Mah Jong.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark19"></a>When War Is No More</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">W</span><span class="font5">HEN the Lord’s kingdom has been established in the earth, there will be no more selfish schemes tolerated to control the masses of mankind, nor will the people be robbed by exorbitant taxation. There will be none permitted to oppress the poor, nor to rob the rich; but everyone will stand equal before the law, which will be administered fairly and justly, and everyone will be compelled to obey that law. “Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. . . . Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”—Isaiah 2:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Desirable Government Shall Come</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That will be a happy time for the people. Concerning it we read: “In this mountain [kingdom] shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things.” (Isaiah 25: 6) Not a feast for a few, but for all people. No longer will the fraudulent advocates of prohibition be permitted to follow their own selfish course and fill their cellars with illicit liquor, while they prosecute and punish the poor fellow who has a little in his pocket. No longer shall a few men build the houses, charge the poor excessive and oppressive rents, and frighten them with eviction when the rent cannot be paid; for the Prophet says: “They shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid.”—Mic. 4:4; Isa. 65:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In times past, selfish rulers of the earth, desiring to accomplish some selfish end, have fallen out with others. Instead of going themselves to fight it out, they declared war and sent their subjects. Governments enact conscription laws compelling the people to go forth and fight each other, while the rulers stay at home. Under the righteous reign of Christ war will no longer be permitted. Selfishness will not be encouraged; but love, righteousness and peace will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The common people have long wanted peace; they desire the comforts and conveniences of home, a chance to make a living, and that their families keep well and happy and contented. We see the nations shaken by trouble. It is the Lord’s doings, because of wickedness. —Haggai 2: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Proposed Blessings to Come</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The righteous government under Christ will meet all the desires of mankind; for it will provide everything that man wants. A blessing is that which brings benefit to people. The greatest of these is life, which to be enjoyed must be endowed with peace and happiness. These are the things man possessed in Eden before he sinned. These things he lost, and these are the things which Jesus’ blood purchased for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Life is the gift of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23)' This means that all who will be granted life everlasting must accept the Lord Jesus as the great Redeemer and Ruler. Adam sinned, and brought death and trouble upon his offspring. Jesus died to provide the gift of life and its attendant blessings. (Romans</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">5:18; John 10:10; 6: 51) The coming of the Lord and the setting up of His kingdom are for the purpose of granting life everlasting to the redeemed race, if they will accept and obey Uis new order and rule.—-Acts 3:19-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even those who have been wicked shall have a chance to live, if they will turn away from their wickedness and do right. (Ezekiel 18:27, 28) Jesus, having in mind His kingdom, said: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death” (John 8:51); also, <sup>If</sup>Who-soever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.”(John 11: 26) Knowing that the world is passing away, that the time of restoration is here, the Bible Students are proclaiming the message of good news throughout the earth, “Millions now living will never die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Liberty and Happiness Desired</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Man has long had a great desire for liberty. The whole race has been held in bondage by Satan. Satan’s representatives in the earth have oppressed the common people. It has been a favorite scheme of Satan’s representatives to enact and enforce espionage laws denying freedom of speech, and to persecute, imprison and kill men for attempting to exercise the liberty of preaching the gospel of the Messianic kingdom. This blame cannot be laid to man; for the wrong proceeds primarily from Satan, the invisible foe and oppressor of mankind. When the Messianic kingdom is in force, the oppressor and his power over man will be no more; for Satan shall be bound a thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The devil, through his earthly representatives, has taught the people that the masses will spend eternity alive in torment, and not in happiness. This is a false doctrine. The deficiencies of blindness, lameness, and deafness shall pass away under the righteous administration of the incoming kingdom. The prophet Isaiah (35:1— 10; 11:1-16; 65:17-25) forecasts the conditions which shall prevail under Christ. In order to be happy, man must be relieved of sickness, be given health and have peace, and know the truth. These are promised.-—Jer. 33: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Transition Period Is Here</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are now living in the most wonderful time of man’s history to date. We are standing at the very portals of the Golden Age. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Broadcaster </span><span class="font5">is seeking only to help our fellow creatures to an understanding of these marvelous things and thus to make them happy. We are in harmony with the Lord’s will to have wickedness, superstition, ignorance, injustice, and want obliterated forever from the earth. The Lord has been gracious in revealing His purpose toward man through the redemptive sacrifice, and the fact that the perplexity in the world is occasioned by the overturning of Satan’s empire and the inauguration of the Lord’s kingdom. Everyone should be acquainted with these facts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">HURRAH FOR DOCTOR</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">STRATON!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Doctor John Roach Straton, himself a clergyman, is out with an article in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> in which he says: &quot;So lax have moral ideals become under the influence of Modernism in the pulpit, worldliness in the pew and these latter day departures in our literature, that we are facing an ever increasing menace to individual integrity and racial safety in this country. Magazines that even ten years ago maintained a high standard of literary excellence and a true ethical ideal are today literally dripping with sex suggestion and sensuality both in their printed matter and in their pictures.” Years ago, Pastor Russel forewarned that this very situation would result from the dishonest handling of the Bible by clerical unbelievers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">WANTED—A CHANGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">IN THE HEARTS OF MEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nothing truer was ever said than the declaration of the Washington newspaper, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Labor,</span><span class="font5"> that “poverty exists because of men’s greed and ignorance—a powerful combination. It will not be wiped out until we work a change in the hearts of men as well as in our industrial system.” We supplement this with the positive declaration of the Scriptures that Christ will replace the stoniness of men’s hearts with tenderness, and lift up the poor and needy, in His kingdom now at hand. His kingdom is the remedy, and the only one, for poverty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">PROFITS OF FIFTEEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">PERCENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After paying all the costs of operation and maintenance, and interest on their bonded indebtedness, the following railroads, in the current year, made more than fifteen percent dividends on their common stocks: Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe, Atlantic Coast Line, Chesapeake and Ohio, Big Four, Delaware and Hudson, Lackawanna, Illinois Central, International and Great Northern, New Orleans, Texas and Mexico, New York Central and Union Pacific.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">AMERICAN CAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">COMPANY’S 500 PERCENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The American Can Company has announced a stock dividend of 500 percent after the first of the year. The Company is grateful because, under the decision of the Supreme Court, these stock dividends are not subject to taxation. The public is also grateful. It is grateful because the Can Company did not hold it up for a thousand percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">FLASHES OF LIGHT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A MILLION YEARS OLD</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Photographs made with the great 60-inch and 100-inch reflectors of the Mount Wilson Observatory fully confirm the discovery that the most distant spiral nebulae are universes of stars merely, some of them so far away that the light now reaching the earth must have been on its way at least a million years—at the rate of 186,000 miles a second. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

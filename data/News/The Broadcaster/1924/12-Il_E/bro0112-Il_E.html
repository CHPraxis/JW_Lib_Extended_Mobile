<p><span class="font7">RATIO OF LONGEVITY INCREASING</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">DR. WILEY’S PUNCH IS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">AS STRONG AS EVER</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dr. Harvey N. Wiley, former Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry in Washington, one of the most useful men America ever produced, in an address delivered on his 80th. birthday said; “If luxury were to be destroyed and all houses burned to drive us out of doors the diseases which kill us old and middle aged men would disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">NEW YORK’S INCREASED</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">APPETITE FOR GRAPES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is remarkable how the prohibition law has increased the appetite for grapes in New York City. In 1917, the shipments of grapes into New york City totaled 300 cars. In 1918, when prohibition was going into effect there were 3,000 cars. In 1920, there were 5,000 cars. In 1922, 12,000 cars, in 1923, 14,000 and this year, 16,000 cars, besides frequent shipments from Europe in 200 barrel lots. Fruit dealers report that some customers order at one time as many as 50 twelve quart baskets. This would be enough for Papa, Mamma and each child to have a twelve quart basket at each meal and an occasional one in between.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TARRING THE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">STREETS PREVENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TUBERCULOSIS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The announcement comes from Vienna that where the streets are paved with granite, the dust, laden with germs, oppreses the weak with a burden too great for their systems to bear. This matter having been brought to the attention of the Vienna Authorities, they have resorted to tarring and, oiling the streets and anticipate that the improvement in the public health will more than pay the expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE TRANSFORMATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">OF DENMARK</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before the eyes of the world, Denmark has been making amazing progress in creating an ideal country in which to live. The Socialist Government has done everything possible to turn the tenant farmers into owners, moreover they have made electric power so cheap and so plentiful, that more than half the farms of Denmark now have electric lights and do their pumping, feed cutting, threshing and grinding by electricity. The step next contemplated is the complete scrapping of the entire Army and Navy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Jesus’ Death Guarantees Life</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">L</span><span class="font5">IFE is </span><span class="font4">recognized as a great boon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Part of the appreciation of life is vitiated by the erroneous theory that mankind must live forever, somewhere. Life is a gift from the Almighty; and it is the righteous who will receive this gift, not the wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Adam was created and became a sentient being, he might have continued his life in a state of happiness had he not sinned. The perpetuity of his existence was made contingent upon his loyalty to his Benefactor. God told him plainly that if he disobeyed he would die. And this was right, proper and just. Being created perfect, perfection of conduct was not only possible with him, but entirely natural; for every fiber of his being was made harmonious with Gods’ law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why Man Is Dying</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Man is not a dying creature because he was created but to die. Man in harmony with God will live, so death is unnatural. When Adam became disobedient and wilfully transgressed the law of his Maker, he was driven from the life-sustaining trees of the Garden and began dying. His children having been born subsequent to the expulsion from Eden, perfection of being and everlasting life on earth were an impossibility for them. The human family is a dying race because of the condemnation which father Adam brought upon us.—Romans 5:12-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hatred, jealousy, and selfishness are as much diseases as are rheumatism and catarrh. The race has been degenerating for centuries, growing weaker and weaker. The influenza </span><span class="font5">pandemic </span><span class="font4">could not have taken its terrible toll had the peoples of earth been strong in body. If there is not a change, within a thousand years it is estimated that the race will be unable to transmit the spark of life and will become extinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Redemption of Man Necessary</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible refers to Jesus as the “Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” This means that God foreknew the course man would take. There is no redemption without the shedding of blood. A perfect man was condemned to death; a perfect man must needs voluntarily meet the penalty to rescue the condemned. The slaying of animals to clothe Adam and Eve with the skins prefigured the necessity of blood redemption to satisfy the justice of God. The paschal lamb saving the first-born of Israel in Egypt pictured the sacrifice of Jesus, who John declared was the “Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God created the earth and purposed it to be inhabited eternally with a contented, happy people fitted for an earthly environment. He could have permitted the Adamic family to die out, to become extinct, and could have created a new race to people the earth; but in His wisdom and love He decreed otherwise.—John 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore Jesus came to earth at the appointed time, and sacrificed his humanity for the life of the world. He said: “The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.” (John 6:51) He died “the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.” “We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace </span><span class="font5">of </span><span class="font4">God should taste death for every man.” (Hebrews 2: 9) What a wonderful thing this is, and how our gratitude should respond to it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Opportunity for Life Must Come</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">St. Peter said respecting Jesus: “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men,whereby we must be saved.” St. Paul said that God “will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth”; and also, “as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” These texts surely prove that because of the wonderful redemptive plan that is being carried out by the Lord Jesus all must come to a sufficient knowledge of the truth to release them from Adamic condemnation. The time set for this to reach the world of mankind in general is during the thousand-year reign of Christ’ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The mass of mankind is in the tomb, having never received this knowledge. No one can be saved in unbelief or in ignorance. Therefore the sleeping dead are to be awakened and come forth from the graves in order that they may receive their first opportunity for salvation. (John 5:28, 29, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.)</span><span class="font4"> Those who have already received this opportunity, and have made their “calling and election sure,” belong to the “seed kof promise” and shall be with Christ Bn the neavenly phase of the kingdom ■ben it is established in power and great glory. But those outside of the Church will have their opportunity in the “day of Christ,” when the refreshing times of restitution will prove to be the Golden Age of prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Resurrection and Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not only was it necessary for Jesus to die, but He must be raised from the dead, ascend on high and intercede in behalf of the Church during the Gospel Age. But not all are Christians. Jesus said that He would come again. The Church will then be joint-heirs with Him in the kingdom. And the kingdom is for the blessing of everybody outside of the Church with opportunities of living forever upon the earth, in a world-wide Eden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The rightful ruler of the world is Jesus. (Isaiah 9: G; Ezekiel 21:25-27) The second coming and the inauguration of the kingdom of equity, truth and righteousness, is the sequel to the ransom sacrifice. As the Great Physician He will cure all the ills mankind is heir to, until there is none sick anywhere. As the Mediator He will reconcile the world to God the Judge of all. And the world shall be lifted to perfection of mind and body, and, remaining loyal to God, live forever in a state of happiness upon the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">DR. ELLIOT TELLS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE TRUTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dr. Elliot, President Emeritus of the Harvard University, tells the truth when he says that the religion of the future will reject the idea of a place of torment where a just God will inflict punishment for misdeeds. He might have added truthfully also that the Bible does not teach the existence of such a place and that this fact is well known to every intelligent minister of the Gospel. Dr. Elliot also states, and wisely too, that a future existence in idleness would be wholly unbearable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">PRIMITIVE BAPTISTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ANNOYED BY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE TRUTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Primitive Baptists of Virginia are all upset because one of their Ministers has discovered and set forth in his sermons the plain teaching of the Bible that there are two salvations, one spiritual and one temporal. They are even having a lawsuit about it. All this is encouraging as it will stimulate some people at least to read Acts 15: 14-17 inclusive and many other like passages until understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">COLORS OF</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">DECORATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">AFFECT NERVES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wall paper and carpets of red are so trying to the nerves as to be almost sure to make those who live in such surroundings quarrelsome and might even drive people insane. On the reverse side of the question, it is found that those who are insane are benefited by quiet blue tones, chrome yellow or buff.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">VIEW OF PRESENT CONDITIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">SOUTH DAKOTA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">IMPROVED MEADOWS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The South Dakota Board of Charities and Corrections maintains at Redfield a home for 400 feeble-minded. The Superintendent wanted a physician for these; he was refused the $2,000 needed for the physician, but was given permission to spend $6,000 in draining and improving a meadow. The Board is interested in meadows, not people. It also has a $20,000 prize Holstein bull of which it is very proud. The Board is efficient as to agricultural management, but no good at all for the thing for which it was appointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">WAR NETTED Y. M. C. A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">EIGHTEEN MILLIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The American people contributed $170,000,000 to the w<sup>T</sup>ar work of the Y. M. C. A., and the kindred and allied organizations of the Knights of Columbus, Y. AV. C. A., Jewish AVelfare Board, American Library Association, Salvation Army and AVar Camp Community Service. After all bills were paid and all merchandise sold, the Y. M. C. A. had $18,503,805 still on hand. The disposition of this is now in the hands of the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">MRS. GENE STRATTON-PORTER’S SOLEMN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">WORDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mrs. Gene Stratton-Porter, shortly before her tragic death, penned the following in one of the leading magazines: “The letters I am receiving today, the accounts that are being carried to me by preachers and college professors, and the people who are coming in contact with our young folks will bear me out in the statement that in all God’s world there never has been a bunch of youngsters in such absolute and appalling peril as confronts the young people today. And if something is not done and done quickly, right now<sup>T</sup> in the year of our Lord 1925, w<sup>T</sup>e are going to experience the same fate that came to the people of Babylon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THE DEMAND FOR</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">FREE SPEECH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Commerce and Finance” wisely says: “There is a great deal of stuff published that we would be better off without; but we cannot safely leave it to government officials to determine where the line should be drawm, nor to the majority of the moment to lay down general principles of exclusion.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>God’s Purpose in His Plan</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">M</span><span class="font3"> AN was created a human being to live everlastingly upon the earth; he was not created to get sick, die, and go to heaven. God would not need to do that in order to fill heaven with intelligent creatures. The angels were created' for the heavenly realm, and mankind for the earthly. Had Adam not transgressed the divine Taw, and had none of his children transgressed to the present time, such a thing as death among humans would be unknown. But because of disobedience Adam was sentenced to death, and all of his children died in him (Romans 5:12), and therefore every child has been born in a state of condemnation. —Psalm 51:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Redemption Necessary to Salvation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God’s plan should be easily understood by all who accept the Bible account of the condition of those who are dead. Reason backed up with the five senses tells us that when a person dies he is then dead. False Christianity, false theology, teaches to the contrary of this. “Orthodoxy” is as false as false can be. The difficulty lies in the false theory that man has an immortal soul. No text of Scripture, even remotely, associates “soul” with “immortality”. The union of the air, called in the Scriptures “the breath of life” (for the air vitalizes), with the organism which God had formed, made a soul-being, a thinking man. When the air is cut off, or the organism becomes so diseased and weak that it cannot function,.these two things which made an intelligent creature are disunited; and the thing which they unitedly made ceases ta exist. It is dead.—Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10; Romans 6:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is God’s purpose to fill the earth with intelligent creatures. (Genesis 1: 28; Isaiah 45:18) But He will not permit the race to live everlastingly in a state of rebellion or in any sense disloyal to their Creator. Humanity is therefore going through its experience with sin and death in order to learn the exceeding degradation, misery and woe that come through alienation from an all-wise and loving God. In learning such a lesson it is necessary for the race to be redeemed from the death sentence, brought to </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font3">knowledge of the truth, and given an individual opportunity to have life in righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ages and Dispensations</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The plan of God is divided into three great dispensations of time, called “worlds”, a word which in reality means “ages”. World number one extended from the creation of Adam to the Flood; world number two covers the long period of time from the Flood unto the second coming of Jesus Christ; world number three has its beginning with the second advent of Christ and the glorification of His Church, and extends into the illimitable future. The first of these “worlds” was not subdivided; that is, the sama order of things obtained throughout its length. The second of these “worlds” is divided into three smaller periods, known as the Patriarchal* Jewish, and Gospel ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God dealt with individuals in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">first of these smaller ages; with the nation of Israel alone during the second; and with the self-sacrificing, foot-step followers of Jesus Christ during the third. The third of these &quot;■worlds” is divided into two parts, the first of which is only one thousand years in length, during which the promised Seed of Abraham (Jesus and the glorified Church united together in celestial splendor, the invisible spiritual Adam and the invisible spiritual Eve) will bless all the families of the earth with mental, moral and physical perfection, placing them upon the “highway of holiness” (Isaiah 35:8-10) through which they may attain unto that which was lost—human perfection.—Luke 19:10; 1 Timothy 2:3-6; Acts 3:19-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Saving Power of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some have thought that since the days of Adam the Almighty God has been trying to save the world from sin and to get men into heaven; but such is far from the truth. Xo thing was done to stop the dying process for 2,511 years, from Adam to Moses. (Romans 5:14) The Law Covenant was made with Israel through Moses as Mediator. But no one gained life on earth or in heaven under it. (John 3:13) The keeping of the Law was the measure of a perfect man’s ability; and as none ivas perfect, no one kept it to gain the life promised under its provisions. It was God’s method of teaching humankind the futility of all boot-strap religions. St. Paul tells us that the Law was found to be the way of death. (Romans 7: 9-11) As no one could attain life by means of the Law Covenant, God sent His beloved Son into the world to die in behalf of mankind, thereby opening up a “new and living way”.—Hebrews 10:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the Gospel Age there has been no way of life except that which is offered in Christ, through the sacrificial death of those who take up their cross and follow Him, through trials, through shame and ignominy, through revilings and persecutions, meanwhile being faithful to truth and righteousness unto death — going against the spirit and popularity of the world. God’s plan has marked out for the Church the way of suffering; and few, very few, have eared to walk in it.—Luke 12:32; Matthew 7:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Salvation of World in Future</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first age in “the world to come”, the Millennial Age, is for the reign of Christ, whose purpose is to undo all the evil and havoc that Satan and his agencies have wrought in the past six thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is at that time that the power of God will be exerted through Christ for the salvation of the race, not only for the living but also for the billions who are dead. (John 5: 28, 29, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A. S. V.; </span><span class="font3">2 Timothy 4:1) The race of mankind is not lost by any manner of means; for Jesus has redeemed it and has become a surety of a better covenant, which will indeed bring life.—Hebrews 7:22; 8:7-11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">MORE 100 PROFIT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">AMERICANS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the war </span><span class="font3">and subsequently there were many who widely advertised themselves as 100 percent Americans. It was noted at the time that many of these were connected with enterprises which made 100 percent profits due to the war. There is a fresh accession to the list. The First National Bank of New York is now paying dividends at the rate of 100 percent per year. Hurrah for the 100 percent patriots of the First National Bank I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TOM LAWSON DIED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">PENNILESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tom Lawson, who heartened Americans for a time by his courageous attacks on the crooked methods of big business some twenty years ago, and who at that time was worth $20,000,-000 in his own right, died a penniless man. The very men he had exposed deliberately planned his ruin financially, and accomplished their object perfectly. Whoever exposes or attacks the methods of the crooked big business rulers is bound to get the dirk sooner or later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CHILD SUICIDES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">MORE COMMON</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The stress of modern life is disclosed in the oft recurrence of stories of child suicides, generally because they could not pass their examinations at school. Because he was unable to pass the spelling examination, and hence was deprived of the privilege of singing with the other children at a school exhibition, a little chap off only twelve years hanged himself </span><span class="font4">at </span><span class="font3">Auburn, N. Y. Child suicides are common in Germany and are becoming common here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ORIGIN OF THE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CRIME WAVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When A. C. Bedford, president off the Standard Oil Company, was asked his opinion as to the origin of the present crime wave sweeping America, he said that the wave was to be traced not to the police but to the church. He told the truth. The church of today, Catholic and Protestant, has turned its back upon the Bible, and has caused the common people to have no respect for its teachings, the true bulwarks of law and order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">WEEHAWKEN RUM RING</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">LOSES ITS PASTOR</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Father Bennett, who exposed the Weehawken rum ring, nine of the twelve members of which, including the Police Commissioner himself, were members of his church, has lost his job. Bishop O’Connor has sent him on </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font3">long trip to Europe to rest his nerves, and has put into his place the Reverend Thomas J. Moran.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">IMMENSE LANDSLIDE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">IN WYOMING</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wyoming </span><span class="font3">has been visited </span><span class="font4">by a </span><span class="font3">great landslide. A mountain side slid into the Gros Ventre River, resulting in the creation of a lake seven miles long and a mile wide. It was such </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font3">landslide that enabled the Israelites </span><span class="font4">to </span><span class="font3">cross the Jordan at Jericho.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>EARTHQUAKES</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">On June 27th and 28th the state of Montana experienced a series of earthquake shocks which cracked many buildings and caused others to sway dangerously. Three trains were hemuled in for several hours by rock slides caused by earthquakes before and behind. A bank building and another structure collapsed. The shock was felt as far west as Oregon. The whole earth seems to be uneasy, getting ready for the greatest of all earthquakes, the one predicted by the Lord as due at this time, no doubt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In 1921 in-India the wages of men cotton workers in the Bombay mills averaged 42 cents per day; women and children 21 cents. In 1922 the average wages of agricultural workers were 18 cents per day in rural areas and 21 cents per day in urban areas; skilled workers such a carpenters and blacksmiths received 51 cents per day in rural areas and 65 cents per day in urban areas. The Indian worker’s average life period is 23.5 years. In Madras 78 percent of the school children suffer from under-nourishment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In the Santa Barbara earthquake thirteen persons lost their lives, with three persons missing. Of the injured forty-one required hospital attention. Of the sixty buildings which received, major damages almost none were of modern construction. The committee of engineers estimates that ten million dollars will rebuild the destroyed buildings, mailing them of modern construction. Rebuilding is under way. The state of California supplies the money.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Chairman Borah of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee explains the troubles in China as follows: &quot;Any one who is familiar with vdiat has been going on in China for the last ten years, and the manner in which foreigners have disregarded and bruited the Chinese .interests, will have no doubt as to the real cause of the trouble in China. So far ^is I am concerned they are not going to hide the cause of the trouble. These interests, including the Americian Chamber of Commerce in China, are the real </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">cause </span><span class="font4">of this trouble.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Millennial Reign Brings Health</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">S</span><span class="font4">ICKNESS has not always been in the earth'. Nor would it be yet, were it not for sin and the dying condition. There was no sickness in the garden of Eden; and we may suppose that there was little sickness in the antediluvian era. Because of. disobedience Adam was sentenced to death; and as the dying process would manifest its presence in his body, he would grow weaker and weaker. But the longevity of the people who lived before the Flood seems to indicate that there was not much dis-ease of body. Infant mortality was not great’until long years after the Flood. But as time wore on, the weakened condition of mankind became conducive to disease and sickness; and then came the medicine-man with his roots and herbs and barks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Diseases Have Greatly Multiplied</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Diseases have greatly multiplied .within the last century, with increasing momentum. Medical science has been able to divide and subdivide the human organism and to give to every ailment a name peculiar to its locality and nature, which, after all, may be the symptom and not the cause of the disease. Whatever the causes may be —whether they result from wrong combinations of food, the overeating of certain kinds of food, the lack of necessary elements, a clogged system, impure blood, deranged nervous system, or what not—the outstanding cause is ignorance as to what to eat, when, how much, and how to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Much of the prevalence of disease in our day is caused fyy denatured, devitalized foods which are overcooked and overprepared and robbed of their mineral salts, and therefore do not nourish and replenish the system as foods would do in their more natural state. People ignorantly invite diseases by eating white-flour products, polished rice, cold-storage meats, and other foods which are partly decomposed. The deadened sense of smell in our fallen race is unable to detect fermentation in its earliest stages. The human family has come to the point where it cannot successfully ward off the ravages of disease; for epidemics sweep localities and pandemics sweep nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Need of a Physician</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The penalty of death brought the race under Divine condemnation; and therefore it became necessary for humanity to work out its destiny as best it could. When remedies were needed, it was necessary to experiment fdr curative agencies. When God gave His Law to the Jews it included information on the subject of sanitation and dietetics; for they were His call-ed-out nation and objects of His special care. One touching any unclean thing must go through the process of purification; his hands and clothing must be washed. Contaminated water and food vessels must be destroyed. Certain foods were condemned. Persons having certain diseases suffered isolation. Filth must be disposed .of, and the premises disinfected. Gluttony was punished, Rest was enjoyed. Marriage laws were given which it would be well to follow today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Jews were then the most disease-free arid vigorous people in the world; and this because of their efforts </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">carry out the instructions which came to them through Moses, thirty-five hundred years ago. The Gentiles were without this instruction, and have suffered greatly as a consequence. But amongst many of the Jews much of their law is in the discard; and even the so-called Christian world has little or no use for the Word of God. The dieticians and physicians, generally speaking, ignore the laws of health which are in the Bible, and are pioneering in their own self-appointed way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus, the Great Physician</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The race lost its life through Adam’s transgression; it has been redeemed from death by the ransom sacrifice of Jesus. Jesus has the authority to raise the dead, to restore the living to perfection, and to bring in an era of peace and righteousness. This He will do, when His kingdom is established in the earth—the kingdom for which we have been taught to pray: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” Jesus is the Great Physician; but He does not begin to exercise His curative powers until God’s “due time”, which is after Satan is bound and evil is restrained and the New Covenant is put into operation.—Hebrews 8: 8-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Millennium, then, shall come health. “I will bring . . . health and cure, and I will cure them, and reveal unto them the abundance of peade and truth.” (Jeremiah 33:6) “The inhabitants shall not say, I am sick; the people that 'dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.” (Isaiah 33:24)’ “His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s.: he shall return to the days of his youth.” (Job 33:25) “The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever.” (Psalm 37:29) Then the drug stores will cease to find anyone for their products. The doctors will have no more patients. But the druggists and doctors will have a happier lot in tilling the soil and beautifying their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Knowledge is a Prerequisite</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The light of Truth is now dawning for the peoples of earth. Worldly wisdom is ready to retreat and to make full surrender. God “will have all men to be saved [redeemed and raised from the dead], and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.” (1 Timothy 2:4) For this reason God sent His beloved Son into the world. (John 3:16; 10:10) During the reign of Messiah everyone will be brought to a knowledge: of the truth, and everyone will have an opportunity to receive the truth and be obedient to it. Life everlasting will depend upon one’s obedience to the Lord. Each of the prophets foretold the restoration of the obedient to human perfection. We are now standing upon the threshold of that wonderful day; millions of people are witnessing its beginning; all should appreciate the words of Jesus: “Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.” —John 11: 26.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">THE PARIS FOUR</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ARTS BALL</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Paris on the night of June 22nd it is generally admitted that the most indecent ball ever held in the world took place. Invitations warned against complete nudity, but in practice the sole requisite was a tall Assyrian hat. Two thousand men and women, many of them naked to the waist, exhibited painted torsos and legs as. their principal attire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">HOHENZOLLERNS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">AGAIN IN UNIFORM</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On July 8th at Potsdam, at the one hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Non-Commissioned Officers’ School, there was an unveiling of a monument at the conclusion of which the former Guards marched in review before the former Crown Prince, dressed in full uniform for the first time since the war. The republican flag was not shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">HORRIBLE CONDITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">OF RUSSIAN REFUGEES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of the horrible condition of the Russian refugees, encamped in four abandoned military camps on the outskirts of Berlin, a writer in the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font4"> says: “The grownups have been so long underfed that they are as living skeletons. They have been so long without the possibility of sanitary care of their bodies that they have all kinds of skin, eye and other diseases, so that, dressed as they are in only filthy rags, decent German workingmen will not work alongside of them. The Russian children who are growing up in these camps are veritable savages.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">JAPAN ALARMED BY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">QUAKE IN QUIET ZONE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of Japan is said to be alarmed over the fact that the latest earthquake, which occurred on July 7th, is said to have been in what is known as Japan’s quiet zone. All the earthquake zones in Japan are now active. Officials of the Tokio Meteorological Observatory are said to expect more earthquakes soon, but do not know where.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">AERATED CONCRETE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">HOUSE AT WEMBLEY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the interesting sights at Wembley British Empire Exhibition is a house erected of aerated concrete, the invention of Swedish engineers. The aeration is accomplished by mixing certain chemicals with cement and coal slag, and results in a concrete which floats on water like wood, weighs a little less than one-sixth the weight of ordinary concrete, and can be made impervious to dampness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">BLOTTING OUT YELLOW</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">FEVER IN BRAZIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Bahia and some other Brazilian cities there are no wells and there is no piped water supply. Water used in the home is purchased from vendors and kept in the home in large porcelain containers. Experience has shown that yellow fever was blotted out when these containers were covered or screened or when fish were inserted in them, so that the eggs of the yellow fever carriers could not hatch.</span></p>

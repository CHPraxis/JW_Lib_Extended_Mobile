<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark3"></a>WHOLE COUNTRY AFLAME</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">OVER EVOLUTION QUESTION</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>THE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE TO NOAH</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The Patriarch Noah never saw 'Adam, but he was no doubt personally acquainted with his grandson, Enos, who lived 695 years contemporary with the first man and who did not Hie until 74 years after Noah’s birth. Besides, he must have known Cainan, who lived 605 years with Adam, and 169 years in his own time; also Ma-Iialaleel who bridged the gap by 535 years on one side and 224 on the other; Jared, who lived 470 years with Adam and 356 with Noah; Methuselah, who lived 233 years with Adam and 600 with Noah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lamech, Noah’s own father, was born 46 years before Adam’s death, and did not die until Noah was 595 years old. There is not a reasonable question but that Adam lived in the same neighborhood and was personally known to his posterity Enos, Canian, Mahalaleel, Jared, Methuselah and Lamech; and that subsequent</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ly </span><span class="font4">these same men lived in the same neighborhood as Noah, and were personally known by him. During all these years such a degenerate thing as an evolutionist had not yet appeared. These descendents of gorillas did ii»t appear until long after the flood.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE STRIFE REGARDING EVOLUTION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The country is aflame over the evolution question. More than a quarter of a century ago Pastor Russell saw this controversy coming and millions of people were helped by him to see that this question really involves the veracity of the Holy Scriptures. Unfortunately the literature of the country is so poisoned as to lead the multitudes to believe that true science is on the side of the evolutionists. It is not; there is no evidence that man came into<sup>1</sup> existence by evolution, and that Adam was the image of a chimpanzee instead of being “in the image of God”. As one intelligent man puts it, the question now is: God or gorilla.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>THE TENNESSEE</span><br><br><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark10"></a>EVOLUTION LAW</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">The Tennessee anti-evolution law is now in force and its validity is to be tested in the courts. The law merely provides that it shall be unlawful in any public schools of the state, which are supported in whole or in part by the public school funds, to teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man descended from the lower animals.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark12"></a>What the Devil is Doing</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">S</span><span class="font4">OME people have wondered who made the devil. The devil made himself. It was this way: God created Lucifer a glorious and beautiful spirit being; and the Scriptures speak of him as the king of Tyrus, showing his deflection and fall from favor with God. (Ezekiel 28:12-19) Verse 15 says: &quot;Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee?' When Lucifer sinned by alienating Adam and Eve from worshiping God, he there and then became Satan, Satan meaning adversary. He has been the persistent opponent of righteousness for six thousand years; he betrayed the confidence God reposed in him; he has taken advantage of the human family; and he has tried to thwart God’s plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Devil a Murderer from the Beginning</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan instilled hatred in the heart of Cain, which caused him to slay his brother Abel. Satan debauched the race before the Flood. He led the Babylonians into licentious religious worship soon after the Flood. He tried to contaminate Sarah, the wife of Abraham, who had been promised that in his seed all the families of the earth should be blessed, thus endeavoring to nullify the promise of God before the first child was born. He tried to kill Jacob, Joseph, Moses, David, and others. Many of the prophets of God were hounded to death, hiding in the dens and eaves of earth from their persecutors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan tried to bring about the death of Mary before Jesus was born, in order to kill the child. He conspired with Herod and others to have the babe Jesus killed, and did through his agents kill all the children in Bethlehem in the attempt. But Joseph, being warned in a dream, escaped with the child and his mother to Egypt. When Jesus made a consecration, the devil set about at once to cause Him to violate God’s law and by this means to cause His destruction. Satan caused those under his power to slander Jesus and to bring accusations against Him of almost all crimes know to the criminal calendar, even though He was pure, harmless and without sin. Enmity has certainly been put between Satan and his seed and the woman and her seed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Seed of Satan</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The scribes and Pharisees and the priests, who claimed to represent God, and who stood before the people as leaders in religious thought, persecuted Jesus. That these and all others who have the same spirit are the seed of the devil is stated thus: &quot;Ye 'are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar and the father of it.”—John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just before His death, Jesus said to His disciples: “If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were ot the world, the world would love his own: but </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font4">cause ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">therefore the world hateth you. . . . All these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him [God] that sent me.”— John 15:18-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is quite plain then that the Christian’s course is exactly opposite to that of the world; for Satan outlines the course of the world, and is opposed to the Christian, whose destruction he seeks. Everyone who tries to live a conscientious Christian life knows that he is opposed from every quarter; and that this is the spirit of Satan in the world, operating through his subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How Satan Operates</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The world is moved by selfishness in all that it does. Christians must be moved by unselfishness in what they do. Love is the principal thing, and love is unselfishness. A man may claim to be a Christian; but if he pretends to preach the Word of God that he may be popular with men, or that he may gain weight, he can not be pleasing to the Lord. The devil inculcates into the minds of mankind selfishness, hatred, and ill-will, that lead to war; and then his “seed” (his rep'resentatives) proclaim war as a holy thing, sanctify it and induce the people to enter it and kill one another. Satan operates through pride, vainglory, deceit, jealousy, superstitio i, fear, strife, hypocrisy, sentimentality, intimidation, etc. All of his ways are dowmward, leading to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is utterly impossible for a man to be popular with the political and financial elements of the world and at the same time be a Christian. Those who think they can, do not know the meaning of the word Christian. “Not every<sup>7</sup> one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” (Matthew 7:21) “Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.” (James 4:4) A great deal of the trouble in the world is due to misunderstanding, which is also an implement of the devil. A person who unselfishly devotes his life, his time, his strength, his money, in behalf of his fellow creatures, and does this by proclaiming God’s Word of Truth, without money and without price, is looked upon as a fool, and is scoffed at.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Turning Point is Coming</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Christians are God’s people, chosen for a purpose. They' are undergoing a course of training which is to equip them for reigning with Christ when the Messianic kingdom is ushered in for the blessing of all the families of the earth. Satan hates them and brings them into disrepute with the world, so that their message will be unavailing. But Christ’s kingdom is at the door; Satan will be bound for a thousand years; and then will come that blessed time in which nothing will hurt nor destroy in all the world, for salvation for the world will have come. ■—See Isaiah 65:17-25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">THE EVIDENCE AVAIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ABLE TO MOSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Between Noah and Moses there were but three intermediaries, Eber, Jacob and Kohath. Eber, the greatgreat grandson of Noah, was contemporaneous with his great-great grandfather for 283 years, and with Jacob his own great-great-great-great-great-great grandson for 19 years. Jacob’s grandson, Kohath, went down with him into Egypt; and Kohath’s sister was Moses’ own mother, so that it is a fair assumption that Moses knew Kohath himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus we see that all the clearly connected history from Adam to Moses comes down to us through the hands of five contemporaneously related men, none of whom there is any good reason to doubt. But there would be reason to doubt the evidence if it had come to us through the preachments of the evolutionists, because their stories do not hang together from one day to the next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CATHOLIC CHURCH UP</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">HOLDS EVOLUTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We had always supposed that the Roman Catholic Church stood for the Biblical theory as to the origin of man, as opposed to the evolution theory, but The New’ York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font4"> asserts that the editor of the “Catholic Encyclopedia”, Dr. Wynne, upholds the evolution theory of human origin, and holds that the evolution hypothesis should be taught in the schools, ■with the facts tending to support it and the facts tending to discredit it impartially displayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">OVERNIGHT MAIL SERVICE TO CHICAGO</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The overnight air mail service between New’ York and Chicago begins on July 1st and operates on a flying time of nine hours fifteen minutes each way, to and from New York. Emergency landing fields have been established fifteen miles apart through the mountains of Pennsylvania. No trips are made on Saturday or Sunday nights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">STANDARD OIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TAKES UP FLYING</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Standard Oil Company, having arranged for private landing fields in a number of cities, has ordered one special plane, wing span, sixty feet, built to accommodate pilot, mechanic, cook, waiting desk and typew’riter, and berths for six passengers. Delivery of this airship is promised by August 10th. This looks like business in the American (lying field at last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">' The airplane, although invented in America, has been put to far better use 'in Europe than here at home. Perhaps w’e will now’ begin to catch up with European ingenuity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">MOTION PICTURES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">BY RADIO</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">As </span><span class="font4">far as known, the first motion pictures to be transmitted by radio W’ere sent about five miles, from one side of the city of Washington, D. C., to the other, on June 13th of this year. The inventor, C. Francis Jenkins, ofi Washington, claims that the pictures received w’ere as good as any of the motion pictures of. twenty years ago.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Doctor Cadman, head of the Federal Council of Churches, says that there have been more crimes of violence in the United States in the last three years than in the previous quarter of a century, that America is now the crime center of the world, that the criminal bids fair to be supreme here very soon and that then the honest citizen will not stand a chance. A boys’ club was just uncovered in Chicago which no boy could join until he had committed at least one burglary.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark8"></a>THE PHONQHLM IS</span><br><br><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark9"></a>A SUCCESS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The Phonofilm, which pictures or reproduces a person engaged in making a speech, as well' as the speech or music itself, is pronounced a success. This invention, the work of Dr. Lee De Forest, was a dream of Thomas A. Edison more than ten years ago, and has been the goal of inventors since. A speech of the President was recently photofilmed by this method, and the reproduction in New York a week later was realistic. During the reproduction the audience broke into involuntary applause.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark11"></a>PEOPLE DEMAND</span><br><br><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark12"></a>THE EILTH</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">The true standard of news distribution is to circulate the things that are true, honest, just, pure, lovely and of good report, so that the people may think on these things. The Fayetteville, North Carolina, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Observer,</span><span class="font2"> tried this policy for one week, omitting all crime news. At the end of the period the subscribers by a vote of sixty to one demanded a return to the old method of publishing all the news of wretchedness and crime, so that they might have it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">In his great fight to clean up the city of Philadelphia General Butler has proven that the public in general do not want things cleaned up, but that openly or secretly their sympathies are with the lawless. General Butler started put with the statement that he would clean the city up in 48 hours. After a year and a half of faithful effort, he admits that the forces<sup>1</sup> arrayed against righteousness and honesty are too great to be overcome, and he is ready to go back ta.the Marine Corps and stay there.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Why Man Grows Sick and Dies</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">T</span><span class="font2">HE world is full of sorrow; everyone has more or less of human ailments. All men suffer bodily pain and mental anguish; and in course of time they die. Ofttimes the question is asked: As the Bible teaches that God is a loving God and that the habitation of His throne is established upon justice, why does He permit sickness, suffering and death? Could not God have prevented all such unhappiness ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is true that God could have made man in such a way that He could have prevented him from sinning. Had He done so, man would have been like a machine, without the power of choice between right and wrong. He would have had no power to exercise his will. There would have been no free moral agency. Man would be devoid of moral sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">God’s Plan Not Thwarted</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">God's wisdom prompted Him to make man a free moral agent, with power of choice; and for this reason Adam was made in the image of God. There was already created a large variety of the lower animals; but the crowning act of the earthly creation was the bringing forth of man. Man was then placed under a test to demonstrate whether he would remain loyal to his Creator. Had Adam withstood the test, he would have crystallized his character for righteousness; and had his posterity faithfully followed the example of the first man, there would have been no sickness in the world, nor suffering, nor death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">God purposes to have the earth full of happy people, living forever in perfection. He has not been thwarted in His plan. Jesus came to earth, grew up to perfect manhood, and gave His humanity as a ransom price for the condemned race. According to the plan of God humanity could be saved no other way. Redemption is an accomplished fact; but the restoration of the race awaits the setting up of the Messianic kingdom before the blessing of all the families of the earth can commence. The enlightenment of our day, with the conveniences, labor-saving devices, and wonderful inventions, is strong circumstantial evidence that we are on the threshold of that kingdom for which Christians have been praying: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” An equitable distribution of all conveniences, stopping the necessity for death, and relieving humankind of sickness, would go a long way toward changing the mentality of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">God Teaches by Experience</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Experience is the best teacher. God made man perfect, and set before him right and wrong. The baneful effects of wrong-doing and the blessed effects of doing good could be thoroughly learned only-by experience. Disloyalty and disobedience have led to suffering, ‘strife, selfishness, sin and death. This must be learned and appreciated. But man will never be saved against his will; he must cooperate with God to the extent of knowledge and ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The outworking of God’s plan must demonstrate to all in due time that Jehovah’s every act is prompted by love and is for the benefit of man; and that while He is merciful and longsuf-fering, yet His dealings are along the lines of justice. His plan proves that He is just, arid also that He is the jus-tifier of those who believe in Jesus. (Romans 3: 26) The ultimate goal to everlasting happiness is for those only who do good. For this reason a correct understanding of God’s great program is absolutely essential for a peaceful condition of mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How Judgment Was Enforced</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The penalty for disobedience is ’death. Adam might have died instantly; and then we, his offspring, would never have been. But God had the redemption in mind and therefore permitted a lingering death, as the margin of Genesis 2:17 implies: “Dying thou shalt die.” After driven from Hie garden of Eden man was compelled to subsist upon imperfect foods and of a very inferior kind. As his vitality was weakened, dis-ease began to make encroachments upon his body; and mental, moral and physical impairment was the unavoidable result. The breaking of the vast ring of water which canopied the earth, causing the flood in Noah’s day, brought further hardships upon the race in changed conditions of atmosphere, greatly shortening the lives of mankind and making the problem of existence even more serious. Food fads, artificial foods, and the pre-digested foods now flooding the markets are further weakening the race and multiplying the diseases with which man must combat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sickness is a concomitant of death; it is the dying process. Efforts are constantly being made to find a perfect food in order to eliminate physical ailments. Much has been accomplished; but not many know how, when and what to eat for health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sickness to be Eliminated</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For 6,000 years the race has been on the “broad road to destruction”, going down into death. But it is a long lane that has no turn. The Messianic kingdom has Jesus the Great Physician for its ruler; and He who has the right and power to restore the race to perfection of health will gladly do so when the clock strikes the hour. There is a set time for that great work to begin; and when it is started, nothing can stop its operation for the following thousand years. We have thought of the Great Physician as being interested only with “soul” disease; but the Bible shows that He will also cure every physical ailment. “The eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped, . . . the lame man [shall] leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb [shall] sing.” “The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick.” “Deliver him from going down to the pit </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[shachath,</span><span class="font2"> destruction, decay, death] ; I have found a ransom. His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s [in the resurrection] : he shall return to the days of his youth.”—Isaiah 35: 5,6; 33:24; Job 33:24,25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">A JUSTLY FAMOUS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">LANDLORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Max Dick, owner of the largest apartment house in New York’s crowded East Side, is justly famed for the reason that he has not raised the rent in thirty years. Additionally, for every pair of twins born in his house he presents the parents with $500. Periodically, he forgives tenants who get behind in their rents. He started on the East Side, penniless, forty years ago, and never lost interest in the poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">WHAT UNCLE SAM SUP</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">PLIES THE PRESIDENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Besides his salary of $75,000, and an expense allowance of $25,000, Uncle Sam supplies the President with free servants, free rent, free furniture, free automobiles, transportation by land or water with all expenses paid, the free use of the Marine Band when he wants it, and one annual formal dinner to the diplomatic corps. The President pays all other food bills. As the White House family and servants number forty persons, that is no small item.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RAIN MAKING</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">IN CALIFORNIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is living in California a gentleman, Charles M. Hatfield, whose business has been that of rain-making for now nearly a quarter of a century. He claims to have discovered certain chemicals which, when exposed to the air, attract clouds. In twenty-seven contracts to bring rain to a community the &quot;Farm Journal” claims that Hatfield has not scored a single failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">GREAT SALT LAKE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">EXPANDING</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Groat Salt Lake of Utah is an erratic lake. Between 1850 and 1870 it added 420 square miles to its area, after which it began to shrink. Now it is again expanding, and the waters are rising over railroad tracks, farms and highways. The average depth of the lake is about six feet. The Southern Pacific Railroad runs directly across the lake for a distance of thirty-five miles. At the time this road was projected across the lake, Mr. Harriman, the great financier, was told by the engineers that this could not be done; but he told them to go ahead and do it anyway. This they did, and already the line has been in use for a generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A POLICEWOMAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ANSWERS AN</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ADVERTISEMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A certain party in New York, claiming to be an investment broker, recently inserted an advertisement in some of the New York papers, wanting a stenographer. Eighty young women answered the advertisement, ,and some of them emerged from his office declaring the man had insulted them. A goodlooking policewoman went in and asked for the job; the man tried to put his arms around her, but she lugged him off to jail, where a hardhearted judge sent him up to the workhouse for six months. Now he will have plenty of time in which to write his next advertisement, and to decide what he will do when the applicants begin to come.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">FROM MANY LANDS</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark5"></a>THE WAR TAUGHT</span><br><br><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark6"></a>BRITAIN NOTHING</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Ramsay MacDonald, former Premier of Britain, says: ‘‘The last war settled nothing, removed no menaces; apparently it only multiplied dangers to be provided against. None of the explosions of the last war has been powerful enough to blow our governments out of the old deep militarist ruts; and we are back to 1900 or 1906, consulting the same oracles, resorting to the same remedies and provoking the same fate.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark8"></a>AIR TRAVEL IN GERMANY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Air travel in Germany has reached such proportions that a time table of 110 pages is now needed to tell the points reached and the times of .arrival and departure within the republic. At Berlin it is said there is an average departure or arrival of one airplane every ten minutes throughout the daylight hours. This is one real blessing brought by war.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark10"></a>SELLING AN ENTIRE CITY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The corporation of Liverpool is negotiating for the purchase of the entire city of Bootle, population 80,000. This city is owned by one man, Lord</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark12"></a>ALL CHINA IS ASTIR</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Every dispatch from every part of China shows increasing restlessness, and an increasing determination on the part of the Chinese to run their own affairs in their own way regardless of results. Not since the Boxer uprisings have there been such widespread, and never at any time such deep-seated, antagonisms to foreigners. The Soviet is fanning the flames. The injustices of foreign capitalists afford a convenient, readily understood text. All foreign missionaries have been ordered out of Canton. Much shipping is tied up at Shanghai and Hongkong, duo to the Chinese strikes against foreigners. The unrest is steadily increasing.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark14"></a>A RIDE ON</span><br><br><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark15"></a>A WHALE’S BACK</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">H. A. Snow, returned from a whaling expedition in the Arctic, brings back .motion pictures of an astonishing adventure in which his party engaged. They had harpooned a whale and were following it in their small .boat when its mate, which was also following, rose beneath the boat and for a time carried the boat along out of the water, violently churning the water on all sides with its fins and tail.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Light and Truth Dispel Darkness</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">B</span><span class="font3">ECAUSE of the prevalence of sin and its baneful effects, the period of time from Eden to the Millennial reign of Christ is designated in the Scriptures as a great, dark night: “Weeping may endure for a night, hut joy eometh in the morning.” (Psalm 30:5) “Darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: hut the Lord shall arise upon thee [in the morning], and his glory shall he seen upon thee [restored Israel]. And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.”—Isaiah 60:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Morning is Dawning</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “night” and “darkngss” refer to ignorance and superstition, to vague and erroneous ideas about God and true religion. “Joy” and “glory” refer to the results of knowledge and understanding about God’s plan and purpose in redemption, and the freeing of the mind from every beclouding influence. Very little light, truth, shone in the world until the days of Jesus. He was the great Lightbearer; and Uis followers have been smaller luminaries since then. But the day of full truth and intelligence, and absolute freedom from superstition, fear and intellectual bondage, is on the way. But this glorious day of clear light, full truth, is preceded by a one-thousand-year morning. We are in the breaking of the dawn of that morning now, and have been since 1874.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The period from 1874 to 1884 marks the beginning of great strides in im mentions—electric lights, typesetting machines, improvements in printing presses, gasoline engines, etc. It was in 1874 that the first labor organization was founded, looking to the relief of the laboring element from their oppressors. From that time forward there has been a great increase, of knowledge and advancement for the betterment of mankind. The better conditions for the laborer and the coming of labor-saving machinery is, in the Lord’s providence, His way of introducing an era in which toil will be eliminated from the earth. These are the forerunners of great blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Increase of Knowledge Foretold</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The time of the end” does not refer to the end of time; for time, the passing of events, will never end. “'The time of the end” (Daniel 12:4) clearly refers to the period of time in which the dark night of sin will be coming to a close, making ready for the introduction of the reign of righteousness. The “increase of knowledge” belongs to tills period. For over one hundred and twenty-five years we have been in that time. But knowledge itself does not bring righteousness. When knowledge is .not accompanied with the sanctifying power of the truth of God, it fosters selfishness; it begets bigotry; it inspires pride; it leads to self-aggrandizement, to lording it over others, to licentiousness and loose morals. Man does not have today greater wisdom than any of the enlightened people of the past; his brain capacity is no greater; but the greater knowledge, inventions, more intensive living and opportunities, have increased his activity and skill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Selfishness led to the. World War. Selfishness is leading on to the ( darkest, most terrible time the world has ever known; it is leading to “a time of trouble, such as never was since 'there was a nation.” (Daniel 12:1) The prophecies point to the ‘rising of the Sun of righteousness’, to the second advent of the world’s Messiah, when evil, sin and selfishness shall no longer triumph. Six years have passed since, the nations ceased to fight; and yet all the nations are in distress and perplexity, and'do. not know the way out of the difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus the Rightful Ruler</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is as Jesus said: “Upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves [restless humanity] roaring [clamoring for their real and fancied rights]; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth [war-planes, poison gas, electric • death-dealing waves, etc.]: for the powers of heaven [spiritual rulers and ’ their forces—ecclesiasti-cism] shall be shaken.”—Lu. 21: 25,26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These are the things which are looming over the horizon to wake the people up, to awaken in their hearts a longing for something better. These things will bring man to a realization that he has reached his extremity. And then he will turn and seek God, humbled and contrite and submissive —and will find Him! At the second advent Jesus is not a man, as some suppose, but a mighty and glorious Spirit Being, invisible to the natural eye, and therefore a world-wide Ruler. Zedekiah, the last king to reign in God’s typical kingdom, was dethroned and the world came under Gentile dominion. It was stated of the typical kingdom that it should be overturned “until he come whose right it is”. (Ezekiel 21:27) Other scriptures show that the rightful ruler is Jesus. Soon Satan, the god of the old order (2 Cor. 4:4), will be restrained of his liberty; for this is among the first works of earth’s new King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Restoration to Primitive Purity</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While there is considerable head knowledge at present, early in the Millennium there will be a great increase of true knowledge and'enlightenment, not only for the head but principally for the heart. Having reached the heart the illumination will proceed with great brilliancy for the blessing of all the families of the earth. Wars will be no more; hatred will die a natural death; profiteering will have vanished; people will be sober-minded, and thoughtful of others; true love, which is unselfishness, will manifest itself in thousands of ways for the betterment and uplift of everyone who bows before the Lord and acknowledges allegiance to the new order of things—the new heavens and the new earth. And finally man shall be restored to the mental, moral and physical perfection of the first man before sin marred his intellect and heart and life.—Isaiah 11:9; 65:17-25; Acts 3: 19-23.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Derby. The price which he wants for his city is five million pounds, or about twenty-five million dollars. The poor deceived, robbed people now wish to purchase what justly is their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ACCURACY OF THE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">PERIODIC LAW</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sixty years ago the great Russian scientist, Mendeleff, formulated the Periodic Law, from which he deduced that there are ninety-two elements, nine more than the eighty-three then known. Chemists and other scientists have been greatly interested in the growing accuracy of Mendele ff's views. Two new elements have been discovered recently by German scientists, leaving only three to be isolated. The age of discovery seems to be nearing its end. All that is left for the modern explorer is to fill in details.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">AIRPLANES LOCATE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SARDINE SHOALS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A new and practical use for airplanes has been developed off the French coast. The sardine shoals pass to the northward during the summer time along lanes sometimes quite far apart and quite a distance at sea. Airplanes now locate these shoals and signal the French fisherman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">GREECE WILL</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">IMPROVE HER LANDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the Vardar plains, a short distance west of Saloniki, Greece is about to undertake the largest reclamation project ever entered into in the Near East. A contract has been made with the Foundation Company of New York city, by which the entire basin, covering 840 square miles, wall be drained and irrigated at a cost of $26,000,000. Greece will be able to raise enough food on this area to. maintain the whole nation. Greece has just had a bloodless revolution, the country having been seized by the army and the navy in revolt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THE KRUPP FARM</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">IN RUSSIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By arrangement with the Soviet government the Krupps have leased 67,500 acres of rich soil in the valley of the Don, and arc now putting into tliis area the wealth of talent and skill which made the Krupp works the greatest manui'a during establishment on earth. Krupps now is entirely given over to the arts of peace. The men once engaged in the manufacture of firearms are now making plows, harvesters, Diesel engines, surgical instruments, etc. One of the buildings of the Krupp plants has a frontage of 1,640 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">GIANT SKELETONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">FOUND IN MEXICO</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An American engineer in the west-ern part of the state of Chihuahua has found a cave in which are eight skeletons of persons that in life were ten to twelve feet tall. Evidently these are the remains of more of the giants who died prior to the flood and were buried in the cave by their comrades. Each skeleton was found in a sitting position on the reipains bf what had once been a plank, with the shoulders and arms bent </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">forward, </span><span class="font3">resting </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">upon </span><span class="font3">the upraised knees.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">SEE A DARK OUTLOOK FOR EUROPE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">CROWN PRINCE FORESEES A NEW KAISER</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In an interview with the representative of the Chicago </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font3"> the former Crown Prince of Germany confessed to a feeling that General von Hindenburg's election presaged ^he return of the'monarchists to power. He predicted that his own son would ultimately be the Kaiser, but not at first. He would first have to be a dictator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is well known that the visit of the Crown Prince to the Vatican a week before the election resulted in the eleventh-hour swing of the German Catholic vote to the monarchist Hindenburg. Even the Papal press gives the Pope the credit for this accomplishment. The Crown Prince has learned nothing from the World War; .but he is not alone. Dumbclls are the border 0’ the day,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ALFONSO SEES END</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">OF PARLIAMENTARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">GOVERNMENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">King Alfonso recently asked the sig- &gt;&nbsp;nilicant question, (respecting other governments following Spain’s and Italy's example) : “Who knows,&quot;’ said he, “if other nations will not be obliged to abandon legality for a time? I see the outline of the sword forming almost everywhere,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">MOST UNSETTLED</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">PERIOD SINCE WAR</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Webb Miller, London correspondent, declares that Europe is in the most-unsettled condition since the World War. Blood has been spilled in Bulgaria and Portugal; governmental changes have occurred in France, Germany and Belgium; Italy, Spain and France are at war in Africa; Turkey is at war in Asia; Bulgaria is in the throes of a white terror.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">William Philip Simms, Washington correspondent, declares that Europe is rapidly drifting toward a “bust-up”. Germany has gone monarchist, France is bankrupt, Poland is increasing her army by fifty percent, Russia openly talks of another World War, Mussolini refuses to decrease Italy’s army, Hungary talks of restoring the Haps-burgs; all Europe is nervous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">BELGIUM GOES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SOCIALIST</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the elections which have been takingplace in Belgium the Socialists have gained ten more seats than they had previously, thus giving them 79 seats as against the Centrists’ 78. The Socia'ists are now the largest single political force in Belgium. The Premier has resigned.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Is the Soul Immortal?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">W</span><span class="font3">HEN God said: “Let us make man in our own image,” there was no thought of making him in the form of God. God is a spirit being, and Adam was an earthly creature. Adam was neither a spirit being nor a spiritual being. (1 Corinthians 15: 45-47) But Adam was made a character image of God; i.. e,, Adam could think and reason and exercise his mind like God, but limited, of course, to his organism. Because of this fact God gave a dominion to the first man over all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of What is Man Composed</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Man’s organism contains elements which are common to our earth. The necessity to rebuild and repair the waste of the body by the assimilation of food taken from the earth proves this to be a fact. The organism of itself can not live; it must be infused with the “breath of life”—air. The atmosphere, the air, the oxygen, of itself can not think; it has no intelligence. Man does not hold the secret of the germ of life; that belongs to God, our Creator. When God was ready for man to inhabit the earth He made an organism according to His own wisdom, an organism in every way suitable for the earth and its en-' viromnent. The germ of life was implanted in the blood-stream; but the blood itself was not life. “For the life of the flesh is </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font3"> the blood.” (Leviticus 17:11) It was necessary for the oxygen of the air to have contact with the blood to fecundate the germ of life and give it vitality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The simple statement of Genesis 2: I 7 is: “The Lord God formed man of <sup>:</sup> the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” When that body was animated, it was a thinking, sentient being. When that body became devitalized, it was a nonthinking, non-sentient organism — it was dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">False Theories of Men</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Man has theorized that the soul, somehow or other, is immortal. Neither are “soul” and “spirit” synonymous terms. “Spirit” often signifies power; for instance, the “spirit of life” means the power of life. God did not implant a soul in man, as many believe, Man was formed, air was forced into his lungs, and man </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">became </span><span class="font3">a living soul. The union of the air with the organism completed the creative act, the result being an animated body that could think; and the thinking faculties, with their arrangement and capability, was what constituted the divine likeness—the mind was patterned after God’s mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Immortality means death-proofness. A mortal person die; an immortal person can not die. Mortality does not mean that a person must die, but merely that he </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font3"> die. Immortality is scarcely comprehensible to the finite mind, for the reason that one possessed of immortality is self-existing; the power of perpetuation of life is inherent without the aid of foods, water, air, or any outside element. Man is mortal. The soul is mortal. If two things united (body and air) make something (soul) then it stand® to reason that when those two things (body and air) are..disunited, the tiling (soul) ceases which they unitedly make!—Ezekiel 18:4; Acts 3:23; Matthew 10:28; Romans 6: 23. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The spirit shall return unto God who gave it.” (Ecclesiastes 12:7) This means that in death the pow’er or privilege of life returns into God’s hands, who in the resurrection time will restore it. The argument is against the immortal soul theory.—Eccl. 3:19-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Man is a Soul</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bible does not say that God made a man and gave him a soul. No man possesses a soul; man is a soul. By virtue of his organism man is a human soul. Every creature that breathes is a soul. It will not be contended that a cow possesses a soul. When God created the lower animals, long before He created man, He designated them souls. (See Genesis 1:20, 30, margin.) Also, afterwards, God instructed Moses: “Levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">soul</span><span class="font3"> of five hundred, of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep.” (Numbers 31: 28) There are then human souls, cow souls, sheep souls; but all of these are earthly souls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All theology—that of heathen lands and that which passes as Christian— is based upon the erroneous doctrine of the immortality of the soul. It is not a true Christian doctrine; for it is not supported by a single text of Scripture. For sixteen hundred years the so-called leading theologians and creed-makers have perverted the Word of God on this point. But, not long ago, the Federal Council of Churches seems to have aroused from an agelong stupor, and published a large advertisement which said: “The Soul. Man does not have a soul; man is a soul. The soul is not something separate and apart from a man, to be eared for and nursed with a view to its future bliss. The soul of a man is himself, his personality.” ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those Who Have Immortality</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bible sets forth the idea that only those who have the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">divine</span><span class="font3"> nature arc immortal, that immortality is an inherent quality of the divine. God being divine is immortal, the self-existing One. Jesus, when raised from the dead, was “highly exalted” to a station far above that which He had ever had before, even to the divine nature. St. Paul, referring to Jesus’ present exalted condition, says that He is the express image of His Father’s person. The Church of Jesus Christ, that saintly company which participates in the first resurrection (Revelation 20:6), will also have the divine nature when the resurrection takes place (2 Peter 1:4); and unquestionably, this is the reason why Paul admonishes the disciples of Christ to “seek for glory and honor and immortality”. (Romans 2:7) Thus immortality is set before the Christian as a arize to be sought for.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">DESCRIPTION OF THE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">FASCIST!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font3"> correspondent of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Labor</span><span class="font3"> describes the Faseisti as follows; “Everywhere you see them in uniform—cut- in the same lines as the olive green of the army uniform-—only the breeches arc baggy; they have black shirts and small caps with black tassels. They are belted with automatic pistols and, usually, a knife about 10 inches long. They parade the streets; they guard the railway Lincs; they have their own offices in the railway stations; they even ride in the trains, ‘regulating’ the traffic. They look for the most part like young daredevils, w’ho never did a stroke of w'ork in their lives; which is mostly true. They are the young chaps who grew up as the World War closed. They had only a taste of carrying aims. Then came the post-war economic chaos when they couldn’t get a decent job. They have never held any job except carrying a gun around. Now<sup>7</sup> they draw<sup>7 </sup>state pay for gun-toting and they ‘support’ the government. There seems to be over 100,000 of this militia.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ARABS THINK THE MIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">LENNIUM AT HAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the San Francisco </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Examiner, </span><span class="font3">Lady Drummond Hay reports having an interview with a learned Arab, who expressed his confidence that the world is at the beginning of the Golden Age, and that shortly, the- way having been prepared, the second advent would be due; that the Messiah would appear, unite all nations as one, and join Christianity and Islam into one perfect faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ROME’S HOLD ON</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">MEXICO SLIPPING</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">President Calles, of Mexico, recently said, “The Roman Catholic clergy have declared open rebellion against the constitution, despising the authorities, through the expressions of their most prominent spokesmen.” All this indicates desperation, not wisdom. At present there are hundreds of Catholic churches in Mexico which are sealed up or at most are opened but once a year. The Mexican people are awakening. No foreign priests of any denomination may hereafter conduct religious services in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TRINIDAD’S PRICELESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ASPHALT FARM</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The asphalt deposit on the island of Trinidad covers an area of only 110 acres, but from that area four million tons of asphalt have been removed, with a fall of only fifteen feet in the surface. The diggers always work in the same place; the holes they dig during the day are always filled during the night. Every three days the railroad has to be taken up and relaid,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">HUNDREDS OF LEPERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ALREADY CURED</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A dispatch from Manila states that four hundred and thirty-five lepers have been cured by Chaulnioogra oil in the Philippine Islands, during the last four years. This announcement is said to have come from Governor General Leonard Wood, and is evidently authentic. Thus ends one of the greatest curses that has ever afflicted the human family.</span></p>

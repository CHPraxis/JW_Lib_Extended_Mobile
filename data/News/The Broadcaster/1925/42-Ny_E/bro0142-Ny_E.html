<p><span class="font6">OF THE LAWS 'NEEDED MOST</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>LET US HOPE HISTORY WILL NOT REPEAT</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">One of the significant events antedating the entrance of the United States into the World War was a loan of some four hundred million dollars to Great Britain by the Morgan interests. Now comes the news that another great loan of three hundred million dollars has been made to the Bank of England, one-third of it by the Morgan interests and the balance by the Federal Reserve Bank. Let us hope that history is not about to repeat itself.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>NEGRO PEONAGE</span><br><br><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark8"></a>IN FLORIDA</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">A county judge, an attorney, a deputy sheriff, three prominent turpentine operators and five other citizens of Calhoun County, Florida, indicted for working negroes against their will in the turpentine camps, tried to have their indictment quashed on the ground that one of their jurors was a director of a national bank, and there--fore an official of the United States Government, and therefore legally disqualified to serve on a grand jury. The plea did not work; and therefore the eleven men are being tried.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark10"></a>i UNTERMEYER ON THE</span><br><br><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark11"></a>WAR PATH</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">In a letter to the Peoples’ Legislative Service of Washington, reviewing the successful efforts, of the General Electric Company to avoid criminal prosecution, and the overwhelming influence of the Morgan interests in the Department of Justice, Samuel Untermeyer recently said, “If the forces that are now in the saddle, under the superb generalship of the world’s greatest banking house, can use the Department of Justice and &quot;get away<sup>1</sup> with such crimes against our laws, our institutions are in greater peril than is generally realized.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark13"></a>WHAT THE PEOPLE</span><br><br><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark14"></a>MOST NEED</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">President Coolidge, speaking at the laying of the cornerstone of the Jewish Community Center in Washington, D. C., declared that “The greatest privilege that can be conferred upon the people in the mass is to free them from the demoralizing influence of privilege enjoyed by the few.” This being the case he should see Mr. Untermeyer at once about the influence of the Morgan banking house in the Department of Justice.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Death Is an Enemy</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">M</span><span class="font4">OST ministers try to make us believe that death is a friend, that death is the portal of endless ages, especially if the life is to be spent in heaven. They have no hope for any others. The theory is that death liberates the soul from its encased condition, and that after death the soul is more alive than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Death has resulted from disobedience to the Divine law, the penalty for which was in the pronouncement to Adam: “Dying thou shalt die.” St. Paul tells us that “the wages of sin is death”, and that as a result of transgression on the part of Adam the whole race is a dying one. (Romans 6: 23; 5:12) The world is under condemnation. Condemnation signifies unworthiness because of imperfection, and all are imperfect and therefore unrighteous. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Exception to the Rule</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible points out that after Christ comes at the second advent, for a short period of time the righteous who die will be changed “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.” The righteous are those who have been justified through faith in the blood of Jesus and have become saints of the most high God. The dying of these is precious in God’s sight (Psalm 116:15); for they have been rescued from sin and. Adamic death, and are now dying sacrificially in participation with Christ in His sufferings. (1 Corinthians 10:16; Colossians 1: 24) But these are few in number; they are meek and unpretentious; they are unknown as saints to the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the end of the present age or dispensation, “at the last trump,” these few righteous who die are called blessed, for the reason that they do not have to remain in death awaiting the resurrection; for the “first resurrection” is then in process of fulfilment. The statement is peculiar; it says: “Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.” (Rev. 14:13) The dead who die are the consecrated Christians, and none others.—Colossians 3: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">What It Means To Die</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God created man a living soul, which means that man was mentally, morally and physically perfect; that he had perfect use of all his faculties; that he had not a blemish of eye, ear, skin or form; that he had not a wrinkle, not a gray hair, nor an ache or a pain. His disloyalty to his Maker merited death; he was driven from the garden of Eden, and during the long period thereafter he grew weaker and weaker until he succumbed in death. Had he remained in harmony with God, he would'be living on the earth today, strong and vigorous and happy; and likewise there was the same possibility for all his children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When born, every child has more or less of the beauty of childhood. Coming to maturity the beauty is marred. In old .age there are wrinkles, and gray hairs, bald heads, stooped shoulders, stiff joints, deaf ears, poor eyesight, toothless mouths, infirm steps, and forgetful memories. The heritage of the aged is that in which one be-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">comes misshapen, ■ deformed and unsightly; and thus he goes down into death. Thus Death has fed upon humanity for more than 6,000 years. Approximately 24,000,000,000 have gone into the great prison-house of death. But because of the resurrection power vested in Jesus, what might have been an eternal death has been.changed into a sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Savior of the World</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Adamic death was an eternal one, as far as the sentence was concerned; it was not “eternal torment” on the theory that the soul is immortal and can not die. When a person dies he is really dead, his soul and body are dead; and if there were not redemption, he would never live again. But Jesus came to earth to save humanity from Adamic condemnation. (Romans 5:18) He gave his life a ransom for all, to be testified to all in God’s due time.—1 Timothy 2: 5, 6; 1 John 2: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The logical sequence of the ransom sacrifice is the restitution of the human family. When we know what Adam lost, then we know what is to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">restored. All the perfection, the beauty of form, life-giving foods, beautiful scenery and harmonious surroundings, which we may imagine belonged to the first pair in Eden, are the things to which man may look forward as his ultimate inheritance when he comes into harihony with God and is blessed with the Messianic kingdom. The dominion of earth has been purchased by Jesus with the right of restoring man to his original estate; and the Scriptures point out that man is yet to have that for which Jesus died —life, liberty and happiness right here upon the earth when Eden is restored world-wide. Jesus will reign for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">thousand years, during which time all authority and rule and power, not in harmony with truth and righteousness, will be completely subjugated and destroyed. Even death, the great enemy of mankind, will be destroyed.—1 Corinthians 15:24-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Reason For Delay</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many know that the Scriptures teach these things, but they can </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font4">comprehend the seeming delay. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font4">has a schedule for every feature of His plan. The Church of Jesus Christ must first be gathered and glorified before any blessing of life can come </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">the world. Jesus is Mediator between God and men, and therefore will put into operation another Covenant </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font4">His second advent. He will bind Satan for the same thousand years </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">which he will be uplifting humanity out of sin and death. He will establish truth in the earth, raise the dead, and extend to the “residue of men” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Acts </span><span class="font4">15:17), all outside of the glorified Church, the privilege of attaining unto the blessings of life, which God long ago promised through His faithful servant Abraham: “In thy seed [the Church; Christ, Head and Body] shall all the families of the earth be blessed.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">TRAFFIC RULES OBEYED</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Alderman Harvey of New York wants the Police Dept, plates removed from the automobiles of Judge Gary, George F. Baker, T. Coleman Du Pont, and scores of other wealthy men. Nothing came of his resolution, but it is a common thing to see representatives of the clergy and other fat and sleek persons in New York breaking traffic rules right and left, and doing it because they have Police Department plates on their machines. How do they get the plates'?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">JEZEBEL GETS HER</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">FACE SLAPPED</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Chief of Police of St. Louis, ■ Mo., discovering that the church Our Lady of Sorrows, in that city, wa's to hold a picnic on June 9th at which a flat would be chanced off, served formal notice on the Reverend Stolte, pastor of the church, that the lottery would not be permitted; that the Police Department of the city would be on hand to prohibit the scheme from being carried out or any other such illegal enterprises continued. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">EFFORTS TO REJUVENATE THE NICENE CREED</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Desperate efforts are being made this year to rejuvenate the Nicene Creed, the Creed put through by the heathen unbaptized emperor Constantine in the year in which he murdered his own son. This creed, which displaced the Scriptural doctrines taught by Arius, lays emphasis on the necessity of believing that three’ is one and one is three, and that the Father is his own son and the son is father of himself, and that each of these is another person who is the same as and yet different from the other two. This would be a good year to give the Nicene creed a happy burial and go back to the Bible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Major A. Hamilton Gibbs, late of the Royal Artillery, in an interview in the Detroit </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font4"> declares that the veterans of the World War have none of the things they fought for; that they fought to make the world better, only to find that it is more bitter; that they fought for liberty, only to find Europe armed to the teeth; that they fought for democracy, yet the preachers are failing Christ and preaching force<sup>1</sup> just as they used to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">MINISTERS DRIFTING</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">INTO INFIDELITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font4"> rises to remark that “If Ingersoll were to return to earth he would find himself somewhat orthodox alongside some of the regularly ordained of our day”, and that he did not do half as much toward leading the American people - into infidelity as has been done by ministers who have stayed in their pulpits and thrown rocks at their faith. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font4"> is astute enough to observe what we have claimed all along, and that is that the ministers of today are for the most part infidels, absolute unbelievers in the Bible, and have no more right in the Christian pulpit than unconverted Hottentots.</span></p>

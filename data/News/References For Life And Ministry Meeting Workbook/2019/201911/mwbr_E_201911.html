<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Do Not Love the World or the Things in the World”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 John 2:15, 16) </span><span class="font1">Do not love either the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him; </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font1">because everything in the world—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life—does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Hold to the Pattern Jesus Set</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font8">Some might reason that not everything in the world is wrong. Even so, the world and its attractions can easily distract us from serving Jehovah. And nothing the world provides is designed to draw us closer to God. Hence, if we grow to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font8"> the things in the world, even things that may not in themselves be wrong, we are on a dangerous course. (1 Timothy 6:9, 10) Besides, much in the world truly is bad and can corrupt us. If we watch movies or television programs that highlight violence, materialism, or sexual immorality, those things can become ac-ceptable—and then tempting. If we mix with people whose main interest is in improving their life-style or cultivating business opportunities, those things can become of chief importance to us too.—Matthew 6:24; 1 Corinthians 15:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 John 2:17) </span><span class="font1">Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but the one who does the will of God remains forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Consider What Kind of Person You Ought to Be</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font8">Another factor that helps us to resist “the things in the world” is that we keep in mind John’s inspired words: “The world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.” (1 John 2: 17) Satan’s system seems to be permanent and real. Nevertheless, one day it will come to an end. Nothing that Satan’s world has to offer has permanence. Remembering that fact will help us not to be seduced by the Devil’s enticements.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 John 2:7, 8) </span><span class="font1">Beloved ones, I am writing you, not a new commandment, but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning. This old commandment is the word that you heard. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font1">Again, I am writing you a new commandment, which is true in his case and in yours, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Reminders Are Trustworthy</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font8">The Christian Greek Scriptures are replete with reminders for us to show love for one another. Jesus said that the second greatest commandment is to “love your neighbor as yourself.” (Matt. 22:39) Similarly, Jesus’ half brother James called love “the kingly law.” (Jas. 2:8) The apostle John wrote: “Beloved ones, I am writing you, not a new commandment, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning.” (1 John 2:7, 8) To what was John referring as the “old commandment”? He was referring to the command to love. It was “old” in the sense that Jesus had given it decades earlier, “from the beginning.” But it was also “new” in that it called for self-sacrificing love, which the disciples might need as they faced new circumstances. As disciples of Christ, do we not appreciate warnings that help us to guard against developing the selfish spirit so characteristic of this world, which can erode our love of neighbor?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 John 5:16, 17) </span><span class="font1">If anyone catches sight of his brother committing a sin that does not incur death, he will ask, and God will give life to him, yes, to those not committing sin that incurs death. There is a sin that does incur death. It is concerning that sin that I do not tell him to make request. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font1">All unrighteousness is sin, and yet there is a sin that does not incur death.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Forgiveness</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is proper to pray for God’s forgiveness in behalf of others, even for an entire congregation. Moses did so respecting the nation of Israel, confessing their national sin and asking forgiveness, and he was favorably heard by Jehovah. (Nu 14:19, 20) Also, Solomon, at the dedication of the temple, prayed that Jehovah might forgive his people when they sinned and then turned back from their wrong course. (1Ki 8: 30, 33-40, 46-52) Ezra acted representatively in confessing publicly the sins of the repatriated Jews. His heartfelt prayer and exhortation had the result that the people took action in order to receive Jehovah’s forgiveness. (Ezr 9:13-10: 4, 10-19, 44) James encouraged the spiritually sick one to call for the older men of the congregation to pray over him, and “if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.” (Jas 5: 14-16) However, there is “a sin that does incur death,” sin against the holy spirit, a deliberate practice of sin for which there is no forgiveness. A Christian should not pray for those sinning in this way.—1Jo 5:16; Mt 12:31; Heb 10:26, 27; see SIN, I; SPIRIT.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 John 1:1-2:6) </span><span class="font1">That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have observed and our hands have felt, concerning the word of life, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">(yes, the life was made manifest, and we have seen and are bearing witness and reporting to you the everlasting life that was with the Father and was made manifest to us), </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font1">that which we have seen and heard we are reporting also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us. And this fellowship of ours is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">And we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">This is the message that we heard from him and are announcing to you: God is light, and there is no darkness at all in him. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font1">If we make the statement, “We are having fellowship with him,” and yet we go on walking in the darkness, we are lying and are not practicing the truth. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font1">However, if we are walking in the light as he himself is in the light, we do have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font1">If we make the statement, “We have no sin,” we are misleading ourselves and the truth is not in us. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font1">If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous so as to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font1">If we make the statement, “We have not sinned,” we are making him a liar, and his word is not in us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font1">My little children, I am writing you these things so that you may not commit a sin. And yet, if anyone does commit a sin, we have a helper with the Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">And he is a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins, yet not for ours only but also for the whole world’s. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font1">And by this we realize that we have come to know him, namely, if we continue observing his commandments. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">The one who says, “I have come to know him,” and yet does not observe his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in this person. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">But whoever does observe his word, in this person the love of God has truly been made perfect.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font8"> We are not ignorant of Satan’s designs because the Scriptures reveal his basic tactics. (2 Corinthians 2:11) Against the righteous man Job, the Devil used severe economic problems, the death of loved ones, family opposition, physical suffering, and unfounded criticism from false friends. Job became depressed and felt that God had abandoned him. (Job 10:1, 2) Although Satan may not directly cause these problems today, such hardships do affect many Christians, and the Devil can use them to his advantage.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font8"> Spiritual dangers have proliferated in this time of the end. We live in a world where material pursuits override spiritual goals. The media constantly portray illicit sex as a source of happiness rather than heartache. And the majority have become “lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.” (2 Timothy 3:1-5) This way of thinking can threaten our spiritual balance unless we “put up a hard fight for the faith.” —Jude 3.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Jude 4) </span><span class="font1">My reason is that certain men have slipped in among you who were long ago appointed to this judgment by the Scriptures; they are ungodly men who turn the undeserved kindness of our God into an excuse for brazen conduct and who prove false to our only owner and Lord, Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Jude 12) </span><span class="font1">These are the rocks hidden below water at your love feasts while they feast with you, shepherds who feed themselves without fear; waterless clouds carried here and there by the wind; fruitless trees in late autumn, having died twice and having been uprooted;</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Love Feasts</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible does not describe these love feasts nor does it indicate how often they were held. (Jude 12) They were not commanded by the Lord Jesus Christ or his apostles, and it is apparent that they are not to be considered mandatory or permanent. Some say they were occasions when materially prosperous Christians held banquets to which their poor fellow believers were invited. Together, the fatherless, the widows, the rich, and the less fortunate shared a bountiful table in a spirit of brotherhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it-2 816</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rock</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another Greek word, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">spi-las',</span><span class="font8"> evidently has reference to a rock or reef that is hidden beneath the water. It is used by Jude to illustrate certain men who had slipped into the Christian congregation with corrupt motives. As hidden rocks were a menace to ships, so these men constituted a real danger to others in the congregation. He says of such men: “These are the rocks hidden below water in your love feasts while they feast with you.”—Jude 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Jude 14, 15) </span><span class="font1">Yes, the seventh one in line from Adam, E</span><span class="font8">'</span><span class="font1">noch, also prophesied about them when he said: “Look! Jehovah came</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">with his holy myriads </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font1">to execute judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly concerning all their ungodly deeds that they did in an ungodly way, and concerning all the shocking things that ungodly sinners spoke against him.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“He Had Pleased God Well”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What was Enoch’s prophecy? It went as follows: “Look! Jehovah came with his holy myriads to execute judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly concerning all their ungodly deeds that they did in an ungodly way, and concerning all the shocking things that ungodly sinners spoke against him.” (Jude 14, 15) Now, the first thing you may notice is that Enoch spoke in the past tense, as if God had already done what the prophecy describes. That is a pattern that many prophecies thereafter followed. The idea is this: The prophet is speaking of something that is so certain to occur that it may be described as if it has already happened!—Isaiah 46:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">wp17.1 12</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl3</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“He Had Pleased God Well”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Enoch’s faith may move us to ask ourselves whether we see the world in which we live as God sees it. The judgment that Enoch bravely proclaimed still stands; it applies to today’s world just as it did to the world of Enoch’s day. In harmony with Enoch’s warning, Jehovah brought the great Deluge against that ungodly world in Noah’s day. But that destruction set the pattern for a greater destruction yet to come. (Matthew 24:38, 39; 2 Peter 2:4-6) Today, as then, God stands poised with his holy myriads to bring a righteous judgment against an ungodly world. Each of us needs to take Enoch’s warning to heart and share it with others. Our family and friends might stand apart from us. We may feel alone at times. But Jehovah never abandoned Enoch; neither will he abandon his faithful servants today!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(2 John 1-13) </span><span class="font1">The older man to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I truly love, and not only I but also all those who have come to know the truth, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">because of the truth that remains in us and will be with us forever. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font1">There will be with us undeserved kindness, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, with truth and love. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">I rejoice very much because I have found some of your children walking in the truth, just as we received commandment from the Father. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">So now I request you, lady, that we love one another. (I am writing you, not a new commandment, but one that we had from the beginning.) </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font1">And this is what love means, that we go on walking according to his commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should go on walking in it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font1">For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those not acknowledging Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font1">Look out for yourselves, so that you do not lose the things we have worked to produce, but that you may obtain a full reward. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font1">Everyone who pushes ahead and does not remain in the teaching of the Christ does not have God. The one who does remain in this teaching is the one who has both the Father and the Son. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font1">If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your homes or say a greeting to him. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font1">For the one who says a greeting to him is a sharer in his wicked works. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font1">Although I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink, but I am hoping to come to you and to speak with you face-to-face, so that your joy may be in full measure. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font1">The children of your sister, the chosen one, send you their greetings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Revelation 1:20) </span><span class="font1">As for the sacred secret of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars mean the angels of the seven congregations, and the seven lampstands mean the seven congregations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">What Kind of Spirit Do You Show?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font8">To avoid that kind of spirit, we can remember that Jesus is pictured in the Bible as having “in his right hand seven stars.” The “stars” represent the anointed overseers and, by extension, all the overseers in the congregations. Jesus can direct the “stars” in his hand in any way he feels appropriate. (Rev. 1:16, 20) Thus, as Head of the Christian congregation, Jesus has full control of the bodies of elders. If someone on a body truly needs correction, the One who has “eyes as a fiery flame” will see to it that this is done in His own time and way. (Rev. 1: 14) In the meantime, we maintain proper respect for those appointed by holy spirit, for Paul wrote: “Be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you and be submissive, for they are keeping watch over your souls as those who will render an account; that they may do this with joy and not with sighing, for this would be damaging to you.”—Heb. 13:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font8">In the vision recorded in Revelation chapters 2 and 3, the glorified Jesus Christ inspects the seven congregations of Asia Minor. The vision reveals that Christ sees not just general trends but specific situations. In some instances, he even mentions individuals, and in each case, he gives appropriate commendation or counsel. What does this indicate? In the fulfillment of the vision, the seven congregations represent anointed Christians after 1914, and the counsel given to the seven congregations applies in principle to all the congregations of God’s people today earth wide. Thus, it is safe to conclude that Jehovah by means of his Son is actively leading his people. How can we benefit from that guidance?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep in Step With</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> </span><span class="font8">Keeping in step with Jehovah’s progressive organization requires that we recognize the God-assigned role of Jesus Christ as “head of the congregation.” (Ephesians 5:22, 23) Noteworthy, too, is Isaiah 55:4, where we are told: “Look! As a witness to the national groups I [Jehovah] have given him, as a leader and commander to the national groups.” Jesus certainly knows how to lead. He also knows his sheep and their deeds. In fact, when he inspected the seven congregations in Asia Minor, five times he said: “I know your deeds.” (Revelation 2:2, 19; 3:1, 8, 15) Jesus also knows our </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">needs,</span><span class="font8"> as does his Father, Jehovah. Before giving the Model Prayer, Jesus stated: “God your Father knows what things you are needing before ever you ask him.”—Matthew 6:8-13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Pronouncement of judgment. </span><span class="font8">All enemies of God’s Kingdom will then be forced to witness an event that will intensify their agony. Jesus states: “They will see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.” (Mark 13:26) This supernatural display of power will signal that Jesus has come to pronounce judgment. In another part of this same prophecy about the last days, Jesus gives more details about the judgment that will be pronounced at this time. We find that information in the parable of the sheep and the goats. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">(Read Matthew 25:31-33, 46.) </span><span class="font8">Loyal supporters of God’s Kingdom will be judged as “sheep” and will “lift up [their] heads,” realizing that their “deliverance is getting near.” (Luke 21:28) However, Kingdom opposers will be judged as “goats” and will “beat themselves in grief,” realizing that “everlasting cutting-off” awaits them.—Matt. 24: 30; Rev. 1:7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Book of Revelation—I</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">2:7—What is “the paradise of God”? </span><span class="font8">Since these words are addressed to anointed Christians, the paradise here must refer to the paradisaic heavenly realm—the very presence of God himself. The faithful anointed will be rewarded with eating “of the tree of life.” They will receive immortality.—1 Cor. 15:53.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Revelation 6:2) </span><span class="font1">And I saw, and look! a white horse, and the one seated on it had a bow; and a crown was given him, and he went out conquering and to complete his conquest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Four Horsemen—Who Are They?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Who is the rider of the white horse? The key to his identity is found in the same Bible book, Revelation, which later identifies this heavenly rider as “The Word of God.” (Revelation 19:11-13) That title, The Word, belongs to Jesus Christ, for he acts as God’s spokesman. (John 1:1, 14) In addition, he is called “King of kings and Lord of lords” and is described as “Faithful and True.” (Revelation 19:16) Clearly, he has authority to act as a warrior-king, and he does not wield his power in any corrupt or abusive way. Yet, some questions arise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">wp17.3 4</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl5</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Four Horsemen—Who Are They?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When did the horsemen begin their ride? Note that the first rider, Jesus, begins his ride when he receives a crown. (Revelation 6:2) When was Jesus crowned as King in heaven? It was not when he returned to heaven after his death. The Bible shows that a period of waiting began back then. (Hebrews 10:12, 13) Jesus gave his followers a means of recognizing the end of that waiting period and the beginning of his reign in heaven. He said that at the beginning of his rule, world conditions would take a decisive turn for the worse. There would be warfare, food shortages, and pestilences. (Matthew 24:3, 7; Luke 21:10, 11) Soon after World War I broke out in 1914, it became apparent that mankind had entered that era, a troubled time on earth that the Bible calls “the last days.”—2 Timothy 3:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Revelation 6:4-6) </span><span class="font1">Another came out, a fiery-colored horse, and it was granted to the one seated on it to take peace away from the earth so that they should slaughter one another, and he was given a great sword. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say: “Come!” And I saw, and look! a black horse, and the one seated on it had a pair of scales in his hand. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font1">I heard what sounded like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures say: “A quart of wheat for a de^nar'hus and three quarts of barley for a de^nar'hus; and do not harm the olive oil and the wine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">wp17.3</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> 5 fl2</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Four Horsemen—Who Are They?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This rider represents warfare. Notice that he takes peace away from not just a few nations but the whole earth. In 1914, for the first time in history, a global war erupted. It was followed by a second world war, which was even more destructive. Some estimates place the total number of deaths due to wars and armed conflicts since 1914 at more than 100 million! In addition, vast numbers of other individuals suffered debilitating injuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">wp17.3</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> 5 fl4-5</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Four Horsemen—Who Are They?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I saw, and look! a black horse, and the one seated on it had a pair of scales in his hand. I heard what sounded like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures say: ‘A quart of wheat for a denarius and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the olive oil and the wine.’ ”—Revelation 6:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This rider represents famine. We find here a picture of food rationing so severe that a quart (1.08 L) of wheat would cost one denarius, a whole day’s wage in the first century! (Matthew 20:2) The same coin could purchase three quarts (3.24 L) of barley, a grain viewed as inferior to wheat. How far would that go to feed a large family? People are then warned to be frugal even with daily foodstuffs, aptly pictured by such basic staples of that time and culture as olive oil and wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Revelation 6:8) </span><span class="font1">And I saw, and look! a pale horse, and the one seated on it had the name Death. And the Grave was closely following him. And authority was given them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with a long sword and with food shortage and with deadly plague and by the wild beasts of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">wp17.3</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> 5 fl8-10</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Four Horsemen—Who Are They?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fourth rider represents death due to plague and other causes. Soon after 1914, the Spanish flu killed tens of millions. Possibly some 500 million people were infected, about 1 out of every 3 humans then alive!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the Spanish flu was just the beginning. Experts estimate that hundreds of millions died of smallpox during the 20th century. To this day, the lives of millions are cut short by AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, despite intensive medical research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The result is the same, death—whether due to war, famine, or plague. The Grave relentlessly gathers up the victims, offering no hope.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Revelation 4:4) </span><span class="font1">All around the throne were 24 thrones, and on these thrones I saw seated 24 elders dressed in white garments, and on their heads golden crowns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Revelation 4:6) </span><span class="font1">Before the th rone was something resembling a glassy sea, like crystal. In the midst of the throne and around the throne were four living creatures that were full of eyes in front and behind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Magnificence of Jehovah’s Celestial Throne</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font8">John knew that priests were appointed to serve in the ancient tabernacle. So he may have been surprised at seeing what he describes next: </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“And round about the throne there are twenty-four thrones, and upon these thrones I saw seated twenty-four elders dressed in white outer garments, and upon their heads golden crowns.”</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> (</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Revelation 4:4</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">) </span><span class="font8">Yes, instead of priests, there are 24 elders, enthroned and crowned like kings. Who are these elders? They are none other than anointed ones of the Christian congregation, resurrected and occupying the heavenly position Jehovah promised them. How do we know that?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Magnificence of Jehovah’s Celestial Throne</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font8">What do these creatures picture? A vision reported by another prophet, Ezekiel, helps us to find the answer. Ezekiel saw Jehovah enthroned on a celestial chariot, which was accompanied by living creatures embodying characteristics similar to those described by John. (Ezekiel 1:511, 22-28) Later, Ezekiel again saw that chariot throne accompanied by the living creatures. This time, however, he referred to the living creatures as cherubs. (Ezekiel 10:9-15) The four living creatures that John sees must represent the many cherubs of God—creatures of high rank in His spirit organization. John would not think it unusual to see cherubs positioned so close to Jehovah’s person, since in the ancient tabernacle arrangement, two cherubs of gold were displayed upon the lid of the ark of the covenant, which represented Jehovah’s throne. From between these cherubs, Jehovah’s voice issued commandments to the nation.—Exodus 25:22; Psalm 80:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Revelation 5:5) </span><span class="font1">But one of the elders said to me: “Stop weeping. Look! The Lion of the tribe</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of Judah, the root of David, has conquered so as to open the scroll and its seven seals.” </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">cf 36</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl5-6</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Look! The Lion That Is of the Tribe of Judah”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font8"> The lion is often linked to courage. Have you ever stood face-to-face with an adult male lion? If you have, most likely you were safely separated from the beast, perhaps by the fence of his enclosure at a zoo. Still, such an experience can be daunting. As you look into the face of this huge and powerful creature and he gazes steadily back at you, you can hardly imagine the lion ever fleeing in fear from anything. The Bible speaks of “the lion, which is the mightiest among the beasts and which does not turn back from before anyone.” (Proverbs 30:30) Such is the courage of Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font8"> Let us discuss how Jesus displayed lionlike courage in three ways: in standing up for the truth, in upholding justice, and in facing opposition. We will see, too, that all of us—whether naturally brave or not—can imitate Jesus in showing courage.</span></p></li></ul>

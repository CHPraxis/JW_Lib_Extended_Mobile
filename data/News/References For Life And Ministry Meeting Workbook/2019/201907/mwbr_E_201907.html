<p><span class="font6">Receive God’s Spirit, Not the World’s</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup></span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> Which spirit does my personality reflect? </span><span class="font6">(</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Read Colossians 3:8-10, 13.</span><span class="font6">) The spirit of the world advances the works of the flesh. (Gal. 5:19-21) A real test as to which spirit influences us comes, not when things are going well, but when they are not, such as if a Christian brother or sister ignores us, offends us, or even sins against us. Additionally, in the privacy of our homes, it may become evident which spirit holds sway. Some self-examination may be in order. Ask yourself, ‘Over the past six months, has my personality become more Christlike or have I slipped back into some bad habits of speech and conduct?’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup></span><span class="font6"> God’s spirit can help us to “strip off the old personality with its practices” and to clothe ourselves with “the new personality.” That will help us to become more loving and kind. We will be inclined to forgive one another freely, even if there seems to be a legitimate cause for complaint. We will no longer react to perceived injustices with outbursts of “malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech.” Instead, we will put forth effort to become “tenderly compassionate.”—Eph. 4:31, 32.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Colossians 3:10-14) </span><span class="font6">and clothe yourselves with the new personality, which through accurate knowledge is being made new according to the image of the One who created it, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font6">where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, foreig ner, ScythTan, slave, or freeman; but Christ is all things and in all. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font6">Accordingly, as God’s chosen ones, holy and loved, clothe yourselves with the tender affections of compassion, kindness, humility, mildness, and patience. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font6">Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another. Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font6">But besides all these things, clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Have You Been Transformed?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup></span><span class="font6"> For God’s Word to produce in us needed transformation, regularly reading and learning from the Bible is but a beginning. Many people read the Bible from time to time and thereby have come to be quite familiar with what it says. Perhaps you have met such ones as you engage in the field ministry. Some are even able to recite Bible passages from memory. Yet, this may have little effect on their thinking and way of life. What is missing? For God’s Word to influence and transform a person, he must allow it to be “sounded down” into the heart. (Gal. 6:6, ftn.) Hence, we need to spend time thinking about what we are learning. It would be good to ask ourselves: ‘Am I convinced that this is more than just some religious teaching? Have I not seen that it is the truth? Moreover, do I see ways to apply in my own life what I am learning and not view it only as something I might teach to others? Do I feel that Jehovah is talking to me personally?’ Thinking and meditating on such questions can help us to deepen the feelings we have for Jehovah in our hearts. Our love for him will grow. When the heart is thus touched, positive changes will follow.—Prov. 4: 23; Luke 6:45.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup></span><span class="font6"> Regularly reading God’s Word and meditating on it will motivate us to continue to do what we likely have already done to some extent: ‘Strip off the old personality with its practices and clothe yourselves with the new personality, which through accurate knowledge is being made new.’ (Col. 3:9, 10) Yes, we can have continued success as we get the real sense and impact of God’s Word. The resulting new Christian personality will help to protect us against Satan’s cunning machinations.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom of the Son of His Love.”</span><span class="font6"> Ten days after Jesus’ ascension to heaven, on Pentecost of 33 C.E., his disciples had evidence that he had been “exalted to the right hand of God” when Jesus poured out holy spirit upon them. (Ac 1:8, 9; 2:1-4, 29-33) The “new covenant” thus became operative toward them, and they became the nucleus of a new “holy nation,” spiritual Israel.—Heb 12:22-24; 1Pe 2:9, 10; Ga 6:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ was now sitting at his Father’s right hand and was the Head over this congregation. (Eph 5:23; Heb 1:3; Php 2:9-11) The Scriptures show that from Pentecost 33 C.E. onward, a spiritual kingdom was set up over his disciples. When writing to first-century Christians at Colossae, the apostle Paul referred to Jesus Christ as already having a kingdom: “[God] delivered us from the authority of the darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of his love.”—Col 1:13; compare Ac 17:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ’s kingdom from Pentecost of 33 C.E. onward has been a spiritual one ruling over spiritual Israel, Christians who have been begotten by God’s spirit to become the spiritual children of God. (Joh 3:3, 5, 6) When such spirit-begotten Christians receive their heavenly reward, they will no longer be earthly subjects of the spiritual kingdom of Christ, but they will be kings with Christ in heaven.—Re 5:9, 10.</span></p>

You previously heard about this hope through the message of truth of the good news </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font6">that has come to you.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Keep Encouraging One Another and Building One Another Up”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 Thessalonians 5:11-13) </span><span class="font6">Therefore, keep encouraging one another and building one another up, just as you are in fact doing. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font6">Now we request you, brothers, to show respect for those who are working hard among you and presiding over you in the Lord and admonishing you; </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font6">and to give them extraordinary consideration in love because of their work.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Have Regard for Those Who Are Working Hard Among You”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>12</sup></span><span class="font6"> “Presiding over” the congregation involves more than just teaching. The same expression is used at 1 Timothy 3:4. Paul said that an overseer should be “a man presiding over his own household in a fine manner, having children in subjection with all seriousness.” Here the expression “presiding over” obviously includes not only teaching his children but also taking the lead in the family and “having children in subjection.” Yes, elders take the lead in the congregation, helping all to be in subjection to Jehovah.—1 Tim. 3:5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Have Regard for Those Who Are Working Hard Among You”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>19</sup></span><span class="font6"> What would you do if you received a gift especially made for you? Would you show your appreciation by using it? The “gifts in men” are what Jehovah through Jesus Christ has provided for you. One way you can show your gratitude for these gifts is by listening intently to talks given by the elders and by trying to apply the points they bring out. You can also show your appreciation by making meaningful comments at meetings. Support the work in which the elders are taking the lead, such as the field ministry. If you have benefited from counsel you received from a certain elder, why not tell him so? In addition, why not show your appreciation for the elders’ families? Remember, for an elder to work hard in the congregation, his family is sacrificing time spent with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 Thessalonians 5:14) </span><span class="font6">On the other hand, we urge you, brothers, to warn the disorderly, speak consolingly to those who are depressed, support the weak, be patient toward all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Support those who are weak.</span><span class="font6"> The genuineness of our love can be tested by the Bible’s command to “support the weak, be patient toward all.” (1 Thess. 5:14) Although many who are weak later become strong in the faith, others need our patient, ongoing support. This can include sharing upbuilding Scriptural thoughts, inviting them to join us in the ministry, or just taking time to listen to them. In addition, instead of simply thinking that a brother or a sister is either “strong” or “weak,” we should recognize that we all have strengths and weaknesses. Even the apostle Paul acknowledged his own weaknesses. (2 Cor. 12:9, 10) Thus, we can all benefit from the support of fellow Christians. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">w15</span><span class="font6"> 2/15 9 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">fl</span><span class="font6">16</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our tender words.</span><span class="font6"> Our tender affection for others moves us to “speak consolingly to those who are depressed.” (1 Thess. 5:14) What can we say to encourage such ones? We can lift their spirits by expressing our genuine care and concern for them. We can offer sincere commendation to help them see their positive qualities and abilities. We can remind them that Jehovah drew them to his Son, so they must be precious in his eyes. (John 6:44) We can reassure them that Jehovah deeply cares for his servants who are “brokenhearted” or “crushed in spirit.” (Ps. 34:18) Our tender words can have a healing effect on those who need comfort. —Prov. 16:24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 Thessalonians 4:3-6) </span><span class="font6">For this is the will of God, that you should be holy and abstain from sexual immorality. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font6">Each one of you should know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font6">not with greedy, uncontrolled sexual passion like the nations have that do not know God. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font6">No one should go beyond proper limits and take advantage of his brother in this matter, because Jehovah exacts punishment for all these things, just as we told you previously and also strongly warned you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font6">-1 863-864 Fornication</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fornication is an offense for which an individual may be expelled (disfellowshipped) from the Christian congregation. (1Co 5:9-13; Heb 12:15, 16) The apostle explains that a Christian committi ng fornication sins against his own body, using reproductive members for a perverted purpose. He is greatly affected spiritually in an adverse way, brings defilement into God’s congregation, and lays himself open to the danger of deadly sexually transmitted diseases. (1Co 6:18, 19) He encroaches on the rights of his Christian brothers (1Th 4:3-7) by (1) bringing uncleanness and disgraceful folly, with reproach, into the congregation (Heb 12:15, 16), (2) depriving the one with whom he commits fornication of a clean moral standing and, if that one is single, of being clean when entering into marriage, (3) depriving his own family of a clean moral record, as well as (4) wronging the parents, husband, or fiancee of the one with whom he commits fornication. He disregards, not man, whose laws may or may not condone fornication, but God, who will exact punishment for his sin.—1Th 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 Thessalonians 4:15-17) </span><span class="font6">For this is what we tell you by Jehovah’s word, that we the living who survive to the presence of the Lord will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep in death; </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font6">because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel’s voice and with God’s trumpet, and those who are dead in union with Christ will rise first. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font6">Afterward we the living who are surviving will, together with them, be caught away in clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we will always be with the Lord.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup></span><span class="font6"> What will happen after Gog of Magog starts the attack on God’s people? Both Matthew and Mark record the same event: “[The Son of man] will send out the angels and will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds, from earth’s extremity to heaven’s extremity.” (Mark 13:27; Matt. 24:31) This gathering work does not refer to the initial ingathering of anointed ones; nor does it refer to the final sealing of the remaining anointed ones. (Matt. 13:37, 38) That sealing happens before the outbreak of the great tribulation. (Rev. 7:1-4) So, what is this gathering work that Jesus mentions? It is the time when the remaining ones of the 144,000 will receive their heavenly reward. (1 Thess. 4: 15-17; Rev. 14:1) This event will take place at some point after the beginning of the attack by Gog of Magog. (Ezek. 38:11) Then these words of Jesus will be fulfilled: “At that time the righteous ones will shine as brightly as the sun </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in the Kingdom of their Father.”</span><span class="font6">—Matt. 13:43.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup></span><span class="font6"> Does this mean that there will be a “rapture” of the anointed ones? Many in Christendom believe, according to this teaching, that Christians will be bodily caught up from the earth. Then, they expect that Jesus will visibly return to rule the earth. However, the Bible clearly shows that “the sign of the Son of man” will appear in heaven and that Jesus will come “on the clouds of heaven.” (Matt. 24:30) Both of these expressions imply invisibility. Additionally, “flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s Kingdom.” So those who will be taken to heaven will first need to be “changed, in a moment, in the blink of an eye, during the last trumpet.” (Read 1 Corinthians 15:50-53.) Therefore, while we do not use the term “rapture” here because of its wrong connotation, the remaining faithful anointed will be gathered together in an instant of time.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(2 Thessalonians 2:6-8) </span><span class="font6">And now you know what is acting as a restraint, so that he will be revealed in his own due time. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font6">True, the mystery of this lawlessness is already at work, but only until the one who is right now acting as a restraint is out of the way. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font6">Then, indeed, the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will do away with by the spirit of his mouth and bring to nothing by the manifestation of his presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font6">-1 972-973</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Godly Devotion</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Herein lies another mystery, diametrically opposed to Jehovah’s “sacred secret.” It is “the mystery of this lawlessness.” This was a mystery to true Christians because in the apostle Paul’s day the identity of “the man of lawlessness” had not taken form in a definitely established and clearly identifiable class. Even after that “man” would take form, his identity would continue to be mysterious to most persons because his wickedness would be practiced under the guise and in the name of godly devotion. It would, in fact, be an apostasy from true godly devotion. Paul said that “the mystery of this lawlessness” was already at work in his day, because there was a lawless influence in the Christian congregation that would eventually result in producing this apostate class. Finally, this one would be done away with by Jesus Christ at the manifestation of his presence. This apostate, Satan-operated “man” would lift himself up “over everyone who is called ‘god’ or an object of reverence” (Gr., </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">se'basma</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">).</span><span class="font6"> Thus this great opposer of God as a Satanic instrument would be extremely deceptive and would bring destruction to those following its practices. The effectiveness of “the man of lawlessness” would lie in the fact that his wickedness would be cloaked in a hypocritical godly devotion.—2Th 2: 3-12; compare Mt 7:15, 21-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(2 Thessalonians 2:9-12) </span><span class="font6">But the lawless one’s presence is by the operation of Satan with every powerful work and lying signs and wonders </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font6">and every unrighteous deception for those who are perishing, as a retribution because they did not accept the love of the truth in order that they might be saved. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font6">That is why God lets a deluding influence mislead them so that they may come to believe the lie, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font6">in order that they all may be judged because they did not believe the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lie</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God allows “an operation of error” to go to persons who prefer falsehood “that they may get to believing the lie” rather than the good news about Jesus Christ. (2Th 2:9-12) This principle is illustrated by what happened centuries earlier in the case of Israelite King Ahab. Lying prophets assured Ahab of success in war against Ramoth-gilead, while Jehovah’s prophet Micaiah foretold disaster. As revealed in vision to Micaiah, Jehovah allowed a spirit creature to become “a deceptive spirit” in the mouth of Ahab’s prophets. That is to say, this spirit creature exercised his power upon them so that they spoke, not truth, but what they themselves wanted to say and what Ahab wanted to hear from them. Though forewarned, Ahab preferred to be fooled by their lies and paid for it with his life.—1Ki 22:1-38; 2Ch 18.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Inspired Expressions”—True and False.</span><span class="font6"> The Greek word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">pneuma</span><span class="font6"> (spirit) is used in a special manner in some apostolic writings. At 2 Thessalonians 2:2, for example, the apostle Paul urges his Thessalonian brothers not to get excited or shaken from their reason “either through an inspired expression [literally, “spirit”] or through a verbal message or through a letter as though from us, to the effect that the day of Jehovah is here.” It is clear that Paul uses the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">pneu'ma</span><span class="font6"> (spirit) in connection with means of communication, such as the “verbal message” or “letter.” For this reason Lange’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Commentary on the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font6"> (p. 126) says on this text: “By this the Apostle intends a spiritual suggestion, pretended prediction, utterance of a prophet.” (Translated and edited by P.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font6"> Read 1 Timothy 3:1. The Greek verb translated “reaching out” means stretching to grasp something, perhaps something beyond your normal reach. In using that word, the apostle Paul stressed that spiritual progress requires effort. Imagine a brother thinking about his future in the congregation. He may not now be serving as a ministerial servant, but he realizes that he needs to cultivate spiritual qualities. First, he strives to qualify as a ministerial servant. In time, he hopes to be spiritually qualified to serve as an overseer. In each case, he works hard to meet the qualifications needed to care for added responsibility in the congregation.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font6"> It is easy to see, then, why Paul said of such men that they “are acquiring . . . a fine standing.” This is not, as some suggest, an advancement in a church hierarchy. Rather, ministerial servants who “minister in a fine manner” are assured of a blessing from Jehovah and Jesus, and they have the respect and support of the whole congregation. Rightfully they acquire “great freeness of speech in the faith in connection with Christ Jesus.” Being true to their position, they are appreciated for their fine service; they have firmness of faith and can declare their faith without cowardice or fear of reproach.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6">Genealogy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To engage in studying and discussing such matters was pointless, and it was even more so at the time Paul wrote to Timothy. It was no longer vital to have the genealogical records maintained to prove one’s ancestry, since God did not now recognize any distinction between Jew and Gentile in the Christian congregation. (Ga 3:28) And the genealogical records had already established the descent of Christ through the line of David. Also, it would not be long after Paul wrote this admonition that Jerusalem would be destroyed, and along with it the Jewish records. God did not preserve them. Accordingly, Paul was anxious that Timothy and the congregations should not be sidetracked into spending time in research and in controversy over matters of personal pedigree, which contributed nothing to Christian faith. The genealogy furnished by the Bible is sufficient to prove Christ’s Messiahship, the genealogical matter of prime importance to Christians. The other Biblical genealogies stand as a testimony to the authenticity of the Scriptural record, manifesting clearly that it is a genuinely historical account.</span></p>

Psalm 90:2 says: “Even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God.” So Jehovah never began; he has always been. He is rightly called “the Ancient of Days”—he existed for an eternity before anyone or anything else in the universe came into being!

<p><span class="font6">Learning the Secret of Self-Sufficiency</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A major factor that contributed to Paul’s happiness and satisfaction was his sense of self-sufficiency. What, though, does it mean to be self-sufficient? Simply stated, it means being content with the basic things. Regarding this, Paul told Timothy, his companion in the ministry: “To be sure, it is a means of great gain, this godly devotion along with self-sufficiency. For we have brought nothing into the world, and neither can we carry anything out. So, having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.”—1 Timothy 6:6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Note that Paul associated self-sufficiency with godly devotion. He recognized that true happiness comes from godly devotion, that is, from putting our service to God in first place, and not from material possessions or wealth. “Sustenance and covering” were but the means to the end that he could continue pursuing godly devotion. So for Paul the secret of self-sufficiency was to rely on Jehovah, no matter what the circumstances might be.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Determined to Be Rich—How It Can Affect You</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course, most people do not die as a result of pursuing riches. Yet, life could easily pass them by while they are lost in their quest. Then, too, the quality of their lives may suffer if job stress or financial strain causes panic attacks, sleeplessness, chronic headaches, or ulcers—health problems that can shorten one’s life. And even if a person wakes up to the need to change his priorities, it may be too late. His mate may no longer trust him, his children may already be hampered emotionally, and his health may be ruined. Perhaps some of the damage can be repaired, but it will require a great deal of work. Such ones have indeed “stabbed themselves all over with many pains.”—1 Timothy 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 Timothy 6:10) </span><span class="font6">For the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Six Keys to Personal Success</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As we saw in the opening article of this series, people who avidly chase after riches as the key to success are, in fact, pursuing a mirage. Besides inviting disappointment, they invite many pains. For example, while ardently pursuing wealth, people often sacrifice relationships with family and friends. Others forgo needed sleep —if not because of work, then because of anxiety or worry. “The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep,” says Ecclesiastes 5:12.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hebrew Names Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Money is not just a cruel master but a deceitful one as well. Jesus Christ spoke of “the deceptive power of riches.” (Mark 4:19) In other words, riches promise happiness, but they do not deliver. They just create a craving for more. “The man who loves money can never have enough,” says Ecclesiastes 5:10.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The New English Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In short, the love of money is self-defeating and ultimately leads to disappointment, frustration, or even crime. (Proverbs 28:20) More closely linked to happiness and success are generosity, a forgiving attitude, moral cleanness, love, and spirituality.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A Good Conscience With God</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>17</sup></span><span class="font6"> The apostle Peter wrote: “Maintain a good conscience.” (1 Peter 3:16) Sadly, when people keep ignoring Jehovah’s principles, eventually their conscience does not warn them anymore. Paul said that such a conscience has been “seared as with a branding iron.” (1 Timothy 4:2) Have you ever been badly burned? When that happens, your skin becomes so scarred that you cannot feel anything there. If a person continues to do wrong things, his conscience can become “seared” and, in time, stop working.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Public Reading</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In the Christian Congregation.</span><span class="font6"> In the first century, few possessed copies of the many scrolls of the Bible, making public reading essential. The apostle Paul commanded public reading of his letters at the meetings of the Christian congregations and ordered them to be exchanged with his letters to other congregations so that these also might be read. (Col 4:16; 1Th 5: 27) Paul counseled the young Christian overseer Timothy to apply himself to “public reading, to exhortation, to teaching.”—1Ti 4:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Public reading should be done with fluency. (Hab 2:2) Since public reading is for the education of others, a public reader must thoroughly discern what he is reading and have a clear understanding of the writer’s intention, being careful in reading to avoid giving the wrong idea or impression to the listeners. According to Revelation 1:3, those who read that prophecy aloud, as well as those who hear the words and observe them, will be happy.</span></p>

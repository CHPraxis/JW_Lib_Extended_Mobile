<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“ ‘A Symbolic Drama’ With Meaning for Us” (Galatians 4:24, 25) </span><span class="font1">These things may be taken as a symbolic drama; for these women mean two covenants, the one from Mount Si</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font1">nai, which bears children for slavery and which is Ha</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font1">gar.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>25</sup> </span><span class="font1">Now Ha</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font1">gar means Si</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font1">nai, a mountain in Arabia, and she corresponds with the Jerusalem today, for she is in slavery with her children.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Hagar</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According to the apostle Paul, Hagar figured in a symbolic drama in which she represented the nation of fleshly Israel, bound to Jehovah by the Law covenant inaugurated at Mount Sinai, which covenant brought forth “children for slavery.” Because of the sinful condition of the people, the nation was unable to keep the terms of that covenant. Under it the Israelites did not become a free people but were condemned as sinners worthy of death; hence, they were slaves. (Joh 8:34; Ro 8: 1-3) Jerusalem of Paul’s day corresponded to Hagar, for Jerusalem the capital, representing the organization of natural Israel, found herself in slavery with her children. Spirit-begotten Christians, though, are children of the “Jerusalem above,” God’s symbolic woman. This Jerusalem, like Sarah the freewoman, has never been in slavery. But just as Isaac was persecuted by Ishmael, so also the children of the “Jerusalem above,” who have been set free by the Son, experienced persecution at the hands of the children of enslaved Jerusalem. However, Hagar and her son were driven out, representing Jehovah’s casting off natural Israel as a nation.—Ga 4:21-31; see also Joh 8:31-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Galatians 4:26, 27) </span><span class="font1">But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>27</sup> </span><span class="font1">For it is written: “Be glad, you barren woman who does not give birth; break into joyful shouting, you woman who does not have birth pains; for the children of the desolate woman are more numerous than those of her who has the husband.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Have Unshakable Faith in the Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font6">While the Abrahamic covenant had a literal fulfillment for the descendants of Abraham when they inherited the Promised Land, the Scriptures show that the terms of that covenant also have a spiritual fulfillment. (Gal. 4: 22-25) In this greater fulfillment, as the apostle Paul explained under inspiration, the primary part of the offspring of Abraham is Christ and the secondary part refers to the 144,000 spirit-anointed Christians. (Gal. 3:16, 29; Rev. 5:9, 10; 14:1, 4) The woman producing the offspring is none other than “the Jerusalem above”—the heavenly part of God’s organization, made up of loyal spirit creatures. (Gal. 4:26, 31) As the Abrahamic covenant promised, the offspring of the woman would bring blessings to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Galatians 4:28-31) </span><span class="font1">Now you, brothers, are children of the promise the same as Isaac was. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>29</sup> </span><span class="font1">But just as then the one born through natural descent began persecuting the one born through spirit, so also now. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>30</sup> </span><span class="font1">Nevertheless, what does the scripture say? “Drive out the servant girl and her son, for the son of the servant girl will by no means be an heir with the son of the free woman.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>31</sup> </span><span class="font1">So, brothers, we are children, not of a servant girl, but of the free woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Digging for Spiritual Gems</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Galatians 4:6) </span><span class="font1">Now because you are sons, God has sent the spirit of his Son into our hearts, and it cries out: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Abba,</span><span class="font1"> Father!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w09</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4/1 13 Did You Know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Why did Jesus in prayer address Jehovah as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Abba,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Father”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Aramaic word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">’abba&quot;</span><span class="font6"> can mean either “the father” or “O Father.” On each of the three occasions that the expression appears in the Scriptures, it is part of a prayer and is used with reference to the heavenly Father, Jehovah. What significance does the word carry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia</span><span class="font6"> states: “In the colloquial speech of Jesus’ time, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">’abba’</span><span class="font6"> was primarily used as a term of informal intimacy and respect by children of their fathers.” It was an endearing form of address and among the first words that a child learned. Jesus used the expression in a particularly fervent appeal to his Father. In the garden of Gethsemane, just hours before his death, Jesus in prayer addressed Jehovah with the words </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Abba,</span><span class="font6"> Father.”—Mark 14:36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“’Abba’</span><span class="font6"> as a form of address to God is extremely uncommon in Jewish l iteratu re of the Greco-Roman period, doubtless because it would have appeared irreverent to address God with this familiar term,” continues the above-mentioned reference work. H owever, “Jesus’ . . . use of this term in prayer is an indirect attestation of His extraordinary claim to intimacy with God.” The other two Scriptural occurrences of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Abba”</span><span class="font6">—both in the writings of the apostle Paul—indicate that first-century Christians also used it in their prayers.—Ro-mans 8:15; Galatians 4:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Galatians 6:17) </span><span class="font6">From now on let no one make trouble for me, for I am bearing on my body the brand marks of a slave of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w10</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 11/1 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Did You Know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">To what was the apostle Paul referring when he said that he bore on his body “the brand marks of a slave of Jesus”?—Galatians 6:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■ </span><span class="font6">Paul’s words could have suggested a number of possible meanings in the minds of his first-century audience. For instance, a red-hot iron was used in ancient times to identify prisoners of war, robbers of temples, and fugitive slaves. When used on humans in this way, the brand mark was considered dishonorable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, brand marks were not always viewed negatively. Many ancient peoples used them to denote membership of a specific tribe or of a particular religion. According to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Theological Dictionary of the New Testament,</span><span class="font6"> for example, “the Syrians consecrated themselves to the gods Hadad and Atargatis by signs branded on the wrist or neck . . . An ivy leaf was branded on the devotee of Dionysus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many modern-day commentators assume that Paul was referring to scars received in different episodes of physical abuse during his Christian missionary activity. (2 Corinthians 11:2327) Perhaps, though, Paul meant that his way of life—not any literal marks—identified him as a Christian.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sacred Secret</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Messianic Kingdom.</span><span class="font6"> In Paul’s writings he gives a full view of the revelation of the sacred secret of the Christ. At Ephesians 1:9-11 he speaks of God’s making known “the sacred secret” of his will, and says: “It is according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself for an administration at the full limit of the appointed times, namely, to gather all things together again in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth. Yes, in him, in union with whom we were also assigned as heirs, in that we were foreordained according to the purpose of him who operates all things according to the way his will counsels.” This “sacred secret” involves a government, the Messianic Kingdom of God. “The things in the heavens,” to which Paul refers, are the prospective heirs of that heavenly Kingdom with Christ. “The things on the earth” will be its earthly subjects. Jesus pointed out to his disciples that the sacred secret had to do with the Kingdom when he said to them: “To you the sacred secret of the kingdom of God has been given.”—Mr 4:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ephesians 1:10) </span><span class="font1">for an administration at the full limit of the appoi nted times, to gather all things together in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth. Yes, in him</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“One Jehovah” Gathers His Family</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font6"> Moses told the Israelites: “Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.” (Deut. 6:4) Jehovah’s actions and purpose are harmonious. Thus, “at the full limit of the appointed times,” God put into operation “an administration”—that is, an arrangement for unifying all his intelligent creatures. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Read Ephesians 1:8-10.)</span><span class="font6"> This administration will carry out its objective in two stages. The first stage prepares the congregation of anointed ones for life in heaven under Jesus Christ as their spiritual Head. This stage began at Pentecost 33 C.E. when Jehovah started to gather those who would rule with Christ in heaven. (Acts 2:1-4) Since the anointed have been declared righteous for life on the basis of Christ’s ransom sacrifice, they readily acknowledge that they have been adopted as “God’s children.”—Rom. 3:23, 24; 5:1; 8:15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font6"> The second stage prepares those who will dwell in Paradise on earth under Christ’s Messianic Kingdom. The “great crowd” make up the initial part of this group. (Rev. 7:9, 1317; 21:1-5) During the Thousand Year Reign, they will be joined by billions of resurrected ones. (Rev. 20:12, 13) Imagine how the resurrection will further demonstrate our unity! At the end of the thousand years, the “things on the earth” will be subjected to a final test. Those proving faithful will be adopted as earthly “children of God.”—Rom. 8:21; Rev. 20:7, 8.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>15</sup></span><span class="font6"> Our perseverance in doing Jehovah’s will helps others to take hold of glory. To the congregation in Ephesus, Paul wrote: “I ask you not to give up on account of these tribulations of mine in your behalf, for these mean glory for you.” (Eph. 3:13) In what sense did Paul’s tribulations “mean glory” for the Ephesians? Paul’s readiness to continue ministering to them despite trials demonstrated to the Ephesians that the privileges they enjoyed as Christians were weighty and of the highest conceivable value. Had Paul given up under tribulation, would that not have conveyed the message that their relationship with Jehovah, their ministry, and their hope were not valuable? Paul’s endurance exalted Christianity and demonstrated that discipleship is worth any sacrifice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“To Know the Love of the Christ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>21</sup></span><span class="font6"> The Greek term rendered “to know” means to know “practically, th roug h experience.” When we show love the way Jesus did—unself-ishly giving of ourselves in behalf of others, compassionately responding to their needs, forgiving them from our hearts—then we can genuinely appreciate his feelings. In this way, by experience we come “to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge.” And let us never forget that the more we become like Christ, the closer we will draw to the one whom Jesus perfectly imitated, our loving God, Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Young Ones—Stand Firm Against the Devil</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE apostle Paul likened our life as Christians to that of soldiers engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Of course, the war we fight is spiritual, not literal. Even so, our enemies are real. Satan and the demons are skilled warriors with vast experience. At first glance, our prospects may seem bleak. Young Christians in particular may appear to be vulnerable. How can they hope to win against superhuman, wicked spirit forces? The fact is, young ones can win, and they are winning! Why? Because they “go on acquiring power in the Lord.” But they do more than draw on God’s power. They are dressed for battle.

<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font6"> Similarly, the truths we learn from God’s Word protect us from the spiritual harm that false teachings cause. (John 8:31, 32; 1 John 4:1) And the more we love divine truths, the easier it is to carry our “breastplate,” that is, to live by God’s righteous standards. (Ps. 111: 7, 8; 1 John 5:3) In addition, when we have a clear understanding of the truths from God’s Word, we can confidently stand our ground and defend them against opposers.—1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font6"> What an appropriate symbol of how Jehovah’s righteous standards can protect our figurative heart! (Prov. 4:23) Just as a soldier would not swap a breastplate of iron for one made of an inferior metal, we would never want to exchange Jehovah’s standards of what is right for our own. Our judgment is just too flawed to offer us the protection that we need. (Prov. 3:5, 6) Instead, we regularly check that the ‘iron plates’ Jehovah has given us are firmly fixed over our heart.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup></span><span class="font6"> While the literal boots worn by Roman soldiers ca rried them into war, the symbol ic footwear worn by Christians helps them deliver a message of peace. (Isa. 52:7; Rom. 10:15) Even so, it takes courage to speak up when the opportunity arises. “I was afraid to witness to my classmates,” says 20-year-old Bo. “I think I was embarrassed. Looking back, I don’t know why I should have been. Now I’m happy to witness to my peers.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ephesians 6:16, 17) </span><span class="font1">Besides all of this, take up the large shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the wicked one’s burning arrows. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font1">Also, accept the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word,</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>13</sup></span><span class="font6"> Some of the “burning arrows” that Satan might fire at you are lies about Jehovah—that He does not care about you and that you are unlovable. Nineteen-year-old Ida struggles with feelings of unworthiness. She says, “I have often felt that Jehovah isn’t close to me and that he doesn’t want to be my Friend.” How does she deal with this attack? “The meetings are a giant boost to my faith,” says Ida. “I used to sit there and never comment, thinking that nobody would want to hear what I had to say. Now, though, I prepare for the meetings and try to answer two or three times. It’s difficult, but I feel much better when I do. And the brothers and sisters are so encouraging. I always come away from the meetings knowing that Jehovah loves me.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>16</sup></span><span class="font6"> Just as a helmet protects a soldier’s brain, our “hope of salvation” protects our mind, our thinking ability. (1 Thess. 5:8; Prov. 3:21) Hope keeps us focused on God’s promises and helps us see problems in the right perspective. (Ps. 27:1, 14; Acts 24:15) But if we want our “helmet” to be effective, we must wear it on our head, not carry it in our hand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>20</sup></span><span class="font6"> Paul likens God’s Word to a sword that Jehovah has given us. But we must learn to use it skillfully when defending our beliefs—or when adjusting our own thinking. (2 Cor. 10:4, 5; 2 Tim. 2:15) How can you improve your skills? Sebastian, aged 21, says: “I’ve been writing down one verse from every chapter in my Bible reading. I’m compiling a list of my favorite verses. That way, I feel more in tune with Jehovah’s thinking.” Daniel, quoted earlier, says: “As I do my Bible reading, I pick verses that I think will help people I meet in the ministry. I’ve found that people respond well when they see that you are passionate about the Bible and are doing your best to help them.”</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Holiness</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Holy spirit.</span><span class="font6"> Jehovah’s active force, or spirit, is subject to his control and always accomplishes his purpose. It is clean, pure, sacred, and set apart for God’s good use. Therefore it is called “holy spirit” and “the spirit of holiness.” (Ps 51: 11; Lu 11:13; Ro 1:4; Eph 1:13) The holy spirit operating on a person is a force for holiness or cleanness. Any unclean or wrong practice constitutes a resisting or “grieving” of that spirit. (Eph 4:30) Though impersonal in itself, the holy spirit is expressive of God’s holy personality and therefore can be ‘grieved.’ The practice of any wrongdoing tends to “put out the fire of the spirit.” (1Th 5:19) If such practice is continued, God’s holy spirit is, in effect, made to “feel hurt,” and this may result in God’s changing into an enemy of the rebellious one. (Isa 63:10) A person grieving the holy spirit may go so far as to blaspheme against it, which sin Jesus Christ said will not be forgiven in the present system of things nor in that to come. —Mt 12:31, 32; Mr 3:28-30; see SPIRIT.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Becomes Manifest in Actions. </span><span class="font6">Greediness will manifest itself in some overt act that will reveal the individual’s wrong and inordinate desire. The Bible writer James tells us that wrong desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin. (Jas 1:14, 15) The greedy person can therefore be detected by his actions. The apostle Paul states that being a greedy person means being an idolater. (Eph 5:5) In his greedy desire such a one makes the thing desired his god, putting it above the service and worship of the Creator.—Ro 1:24, 25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Philippians 4:6) </span><span class="font1">Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God;</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Peace of God . . . Surpasses All Understanding”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font6">What can help us not to be anxious over anything and to experience “the peace of God”? Paul’s words to the Philippians show us that the antidote to worry is prayer. So when we are anxious, we need to turn our worries into prayers. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Read 1 Peter 5:6, 7.) </span><span class="font6">Pray to Jehovah in full faith, knowing that he cares for you. Pray to him “with thanksgiving,” remembering your blessings. Our confidence in him will be strengthened when we keep in mind that he can “do more than superabundantly beyond all the things we ask or conceive.” —Eph. 3:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Philippians 4:7) </span><span class="font1">and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Peace of God . . . Surpasses All Understanding”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font6">No doubt when the brothers in Philippi read Paul’s letter to them, they remembered what had happened to him and how none of them had expected Jehovah to take action in the way that he did. What lesson was Paul teaching them? Basically: Do not worry. Pray, and then you will receive the peace of God. But notice that “the peace of God . . . surpasses all understanding.” What does that mean? Some translators render this expression “surpasses all our dreams” or “excels all human planning.” Paul was, in effect, saying that “the peace of God” is more wonderful than can be imagined. So although from a human viewpoint we may not see a way out of our problems, Jehovah does, and he can do the unexpected.—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Read 2 Peter 2:9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Peace of God . . . Surpasses All Understanding”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font6">What results when we receive this “peace of God that surpasses all understanding”? The Scriptures answer by saying that it ‘will guard our hearts and our mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.’ (Phil. 4:7) The original-language word for “guard” was a military expression. It referred to a garrison of troops that was assigned to guard a fortified city in ancient times. Philippi was such a city. The inhabitants of Philippi slept soundly at night, knowing that soldiers were guarding the gates of their city. In a similar manner, when we have “the peace of God,” our hearts and minds remain at rest. We know that Jehovah cares for us and wants us to succeed. (1 Pet. 5:10) That knowledge guards us from becoming overwhelmed by anxiety or discouragement.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Drink offerings.</span><span class="font6"> Drink offerings were presented along with most of the other offerings, especially after the Israelites had settled in the Promised Land. (Nu 15:2, 5, 8-10) This consisted of wine (“intoxicating liquor”) and was poured out on the altar. (Nu 28:7, 14; compare Ex 30:9; Nu 15:10.) The apostle Paul wrote to the Christians at Philippi: “If I am being poured out like a drink offering upon the sacrifice and public service to which faith has led you, I am glad.” Here he used the figure of a drink offering, expressing his willingness to expend himself in behalf of fellow Christians. (Php 2: 17) Shortly before his death, he wrote to Timothy: “I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the due time for my releasing is imminent.”—2Ti 4:6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font6"> Next, anointed members of “the Israel of God” must join the Lord Jesus Christ in heavenly glory, where they will “always be with the Lord.” (Galatians 6:16; 1 Thessalonians 4:17) That event is called “the earlier resurrection” or “the first resurrection.” (Philippians 3:10, 11; Revelation 20:6) When that resurrection is completed, the time will be at hand for millions to be resurrected back to the earth with the prospect of gaining everlasting life in Paradise. Hence, whether our hope is heavenly or earthly, we have a keen interest in “the first resurrection.” What kind of resurrection is it? When does it occur?</span></p>

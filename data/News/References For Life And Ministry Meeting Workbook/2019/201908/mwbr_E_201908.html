<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“God Did Not Give Us a Spirit of Cowardice” (2 Timothy 1:7) </span><span class="font1">For God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but one of power and of love and of soundness of mind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Youths—Make Your Advancement Manifest</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font7">To help Timothy, Paul later reminded him: “God gave us not a spirit of cowardice, but that of power and of love and of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">soundness of mind.”</span><span class="font7"> (2 Tim. 1:7) “Soundness of mind” involves being able to think and reason sensibly. It includes the ability to face things as they are—not the way you would like them to be. Some immature youths manifest a spirit of cowardice and mentally try to escape stressful situations by resorting to excessive sleep or TV viewing, drug or alcohol abuse, constant partying, or sexual immorality. Christians are admonished “to repudiate ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things.”—Titus 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(2 Timothy 1:8) </span><span class="font1">So do not become ashamed either of the witness about our Lord or of me, a prisoner for his sake, but take your part in suffering adversity for the good news by relying on the power of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">‘Be Courageous and Strong!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font7">Paul, writing to Timothy, said: “God gave us not a spirit of cowardice, but that of power . . . Therefore do not become ashamed of the witness about our Lord.” (2 Timothy 1:7, 8; Mark 8: 38) Having read those words, we can ask ourselves: ‘Am I ashamed of my faith, or am I courageous? At the place where I work (or go to school), do I let those around me know that I am a Witness of Jehovah, or do I try to hide the fact? Am I ashamed to be different from others, or am I proud to stand out because of my relationship with Jehovah?’ If anyone has negative feelings about preaching the good news or taking an unpopular stand, let him remember Jehovah’s counsel to Joshua: “Be courageous and strong.” Never forget, it is not the opinion of our workmates or our schoolmates that counts but the viewpoint of Jehovah and Jesus Christ.—Galatians 1:10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(2 Timothy 2:3, 4) </span><span class="font1">As a fine soldier of Christ Jesus, take your part in suffering adversity. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">No man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life, in order to gain the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Seeking Riches That Are True</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font7">Timothy was a man of faith. After calling Timothy “a fine soldier of Christ Jesus,” Paul told him: “No man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life, in order to gain the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier.” (2 Tim. 2:3, 4) Jesus’ followers today, including an army of over one million full-time ministers, apply Paul’s counsel to the extent that their circumstances allow. Resisting the pressures of advertising and the world around them, they remember the principle: “The borrower is a slave to the lender.” (Prov. 22:7) Satan would like nothing better than to have us spend all our time and energy as slaves to his commercial world. Some decisions could keep us in financial bondage for years. Huge home mortgages, lingering student loans, expensive car payments, even extravagant weddings can result in great financial pressure. We demonstrate practical wisdom when we simplify our life and reduce debt and expenses, setting ourselves free to slave for God rather than for today’s commercial system. —1 Tim. 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(2 Timothy 2:23) </span><span class="font1">Further, reject foolish and ignorant debates, knowing that they produce fights.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s People “Renounce Unrighteousness”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>10</sup></span><span class="font7"> Today, Jehovah’s people are not often confronted with apostasy within the congregation. Still, when exposed to unscriptural teachings, regardless of the source, we must decisively reject them. It would be unwise to engage in debates with apostates, whether in person, by responding to their blogs, or by any other form of communication. Even when the intention is to help the individual, such conversation would be contrary to the Scriptural direction we just considered. Rather, as Jehovah’s people, we completely avoid, yes reject, apostasy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Questions From Readers</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although the Scriptures do not explain in detail how every appointment was made back then, we do see some indication of how this was done. We are told that when Paul and Barnabas were on their way back home from their first missionary trip, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“they appointed elders</span><span class="font7"> for them in each congregation, offering prayer with fasting, and they entrusted them to Jehovah, in whom they had become believers.” (Acts 14:23) Years later, Paul wrote to his traveling companion Titus, saying: “I left you in Crete so that you would correct the things that were defective and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">make appointments of elders</span><span class="font7"> in city after city, as I instructed you.” (Titus 1:5) Likewise, Timothy, who traveled extensively with the apostle Paul, appears to have been given similar authority. (1 Tim. 5:22) Clearly, then, these appointments were made by traveling overseers, not by the apostles and older men in Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With this Biblical precedent in mind, the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses has adjusted how the appointments of elders and ministerial servants are made. As of September 1, 2014, appointments are being made as follows: Each circuit overseer carefully reviews the recommendations being made in his circuit. During his visits to the congregations, he will try to get to know those who are recommended, working along with them in the ministry if at all possible. After discussing the recommendations with the local body of elders, the circuit overseer has the responsibility of appointing the elders and ministerial servants in the congregations in his circuit. In this way, the arrangement is closer to the first-century pattern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Who handle the various roles in this process? As always, “the faithful and discreet slave” has the primary responsibility of feeding the domestics. (Matt. 24:45-47) This includes searching the Scriptures, with the help of the holy spirit, in order to provide direction on the practical application of Bible principles that have a bearing on the way the worldwide congregation is organized. The faithful slave also appoints all circuit overseers and Branch Committee members. In turn, each branch office provides practical assistance in implementing the direction given. Each body of elders has the solemn duty to review thoroughly the Scriptural qualifications of the brothers they recommend for appointment in God’s congregation. Each circuit overseer has the serious responsibility to consider carefully and prayerfully the recommendations made by the elders and then to appoint the men who qualify.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">He certainly was not agreeing with any allencompassing racial or ethnic slur against the Cretans. We can be sure of that, for Paul knew that on Crete there were fine Christians whom God had approved and anointed with His holy spirit. (Acts 2:5, 11, 33) There were enough devoted Christians to make up congregations in “city after city.” While such Christians were not perfect humans, we can be sure that they were not liars and lazy gluttons; otherwise they would not have continued to have Jehovah’s approval. (Philippians 3:18, 19; Revelation 21:8) And as we today find in all nations, likely there were on Crete honesthearted people who were saddened by the low moral standards around them and were ready to respond to the Christian mes-sage.—Ezekiel 9:4; compare Acts 13:48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Philemon 15, 16) </span><span class="font1">Perhaps this is really why he broke away for a short while, so that you may have him back forever, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font1">no longer as a slave, but as more than a slave, as a brother who is beloved, especially so to me, but how much more so to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font7"> Jehovah installed his Son as his Messianic King in the heavens in 1914. ‘The scepter of his kingdom is a scepter of uprightness,’ so the righteousness and equity of his reign are guaranteed. His authority is legitimate, since ‘God is his throne.’ That is, Jehovah is the foundation of his kingdom. Moreover, Jesus’ throne will last “forever and ever.” Are you not proud to be serving Jehovah under such a mighty, God-appointed King?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Hebrews 1:9) </span><span class="font1">You loved righteousness, and you hated lawlessness. That is why God, your God, anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your companions.”</span></p>

Jesus was anointed with “the oil of exultation” more than his “companions,” that is, the kings of Judah of the line of David. How so? For one thing, Jesus was anointed by Jehovah himself. Furthermore, Jehovah anointed him as both King and High Priest. (Ps. 2:2; Heb. 5:5, 6) In addition, Jesus was anointed not with oil but with holy spirit, and his kingship is not earthly but heavenly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Has Jesus always reflected his Father’s likeness to the same degree?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s firstborn Son, who later became the man Jesus, is in his Father’s image. (2Co 4:4) Inasmuch as that Son was obviously the one to whom God spoke in saying, “Let us make man in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font7"> image,” this likeness of the Son to his Father, the Creator, existed from when the Son was created. (Ge 1:26; Joh 1:1-3; Col 1:15, 16) When on earth as a perfect man, he reflected his Father’s qualities and personality to the fullest extent possible within human limitations, so he could say that “he that has seen me has seen the Father also.” (Joh 14:9; 5:17, 19, 30, 36; 8:28, 38, 42) This likeness, however, was certainly heightened at the time of Jesus’ resurrection to spirit life and his being granted “all authority . . . in heaven and on the earth” by his Father, Jehovah God. (1Pe 3:18; Mt 28:18) Since God then exalted Jesus to “a superior position,” God’s Son now reflected his Father’s glory to an even greater degree than he had before leaving the heavens to come to earth. (Php 2:9; Heb 2:9) He is now “the exact representation of [God’s] very being.”—Heb 1:2-4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The words of Psalm 102:25, 26 apply to Jehovah God, but the apostle Paul quotes them with reference to Jesus Christ. This is because God’s only-begotten Son was God’s personal Agent employed in creating the physical universe. Paul contrasts the Son’s permanence with that of the physical creation, which God, if he so designed, could ‘wrap up just as a cloak’ and set aside. —Heb 1:1, 2, 8, 10-12; compare 1Pe 2:3, ftn.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Hebrews 1:1-14) </span><span class="font1">Long ago God spoke to our forefathers by means of the prophets on many occasions and in many ways. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">Now at the end of these days he has spoken to us by means of a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the systems of things. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font1">He is the reflection of God’s glory and the exact representation of his very being, and he sustains all things by the word of his power. And after he had made a purification for our sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">So he has become better than the angels to the extent that he has inherited a name more excellent than theirs. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">For example, to which one of the angels did God ever say: “You are my son; today I have become your father”? And again: “I will become his father, and he will become my son”? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font1">But when he again brings his Firstborn into the inhabited earth, he says: “And let all of God’s angels do obeisance to him.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font1">Also, he says about the angels: “He makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font1">But about the Son, he says: “God is your throne forever and ever, and the scepter of your Kingdom is the scepter of uprightness. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font1">You loved righteousness, and you hated lawlessness. That is why God, your God, anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your companions.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font1">And: “At the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font1">They will perish, but you will remain; and just like a garment, they will all wear out, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font1">and you will wrap them up just as a cloak, as a garment, and they will be changed.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Do Your Utmost to Enter Into God’s Rest” (Hebrews 4:1) </span><span class="font1">Therefore, since a promise of entering into his rest remains, let us be on guard for fear someone among you seems to fall short of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Hebrews 4:4) </span><span class="font1">For in one place he has said of the seventh day as follows: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w11 7/15 24-25</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl3-5</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Rest—What Is It?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font7"> Two lines of evidence lead us to the conclusion that the seventh day was still under way in the first century C.E. First, consider Jesus’ words to opposers who criticized him for healing on the Sabbath, which they construed as a form of work. The Lord said to them: “My Father </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">has kept working until now,</span><span class="font7"> and I keep working.” (John 5:16, 17) What was the point? Jesus was being accused of working on the Sabbath. His reply: “My Father has kept working” answered that charge. In effect, Jesus was saying to his critics: ‘My Father and I are engaged in the same type of work. Since my Father has kept working during his millenniums-long Sabbath, it is quite permissible for me to keep working, even on the Sabbath.’ Thus, Jesus implied that as regards the earth, God’s great Sabbath day of rest, the seventh day, had not ended in his day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font7"> A second line of evidence is provided by the apostle Paul. When quoting Genesis 2:2 concerning God’s rest, Paul wrote under inspiration: “We who have exercised faith </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">do enter into the rest.”</span><span class="font7"> (Heb. 4:3, 4, 6, 9) So the seventh day was ongoing in Paul’s day. How much longer was that day of rest to continue?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font7"> In order to answer that question, we must remember the purpose of the seventh day. Genesis 2:3 explains what it is: “God proceeded to bless the seventh day and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">make it sacred.”</span><span class="font7"> That day was ‘made sacred’—sanctified, or set apart, by Jehovah—in order to bring his purpose to completion. That purpose is for the earth to be inhabited by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">obedient</span><span class="font7"> men and women who will take care of it and all life upon it. (Gen. 1:28) It is toward the realization of that purpose that both Jehovah God and Jesus Christ, the “Lord of the sabbath,” have “kept working until now.” (Matt. 12:8) God’s rest day will continue until his purpose in connection with it has been fully realized at the end of Christ’s Thousand Year Reign.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Hebrews 4:6) </span><span class="font1">Therefore, since it remains for some to enter into it, and those to whom the good news was first declared did not enter in because of disobedience,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w11 7/15 25</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl6</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God’s Rest—What Is It?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font7"> God’s purpose was clearly explained to Adam and Eve, but they failed to cooperate with it. Of course, Adam and Eve were only the first humans to pursue a course of disobedience. There have been millions of others since then. Even God’s chosen people, the nation of Israel, fell into a pattern of disobedience. And significantly, Paul warned first-century Christians that even some of them could fall into the same trap as the ancient Israelites. He wrote: “Let us therefore do our utmost to enter into that rest, for fear anyone should fall in the same pattern of disobedience.” (Heb. 4:11) Notice that Paul links disobedience with failure to enter into God’s rest. What does that mean for us? If we were to rebel against God’s purpose in some way, might we run the risk of not entering into God’s rest? Clearly, the answer to that question is of great importance to us, and we will consider it further. At this point, however, let us see what more we can learn about entering into God’s rest by considering the bad example of the Israelites.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Hebrews 4:9-11) </span><span class="font1">So there remains a sabbath-rest for the people of God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font1">For the man who has entered into God’s rest has also rested from his own works, just as God did from his own. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font1">Let us therefore do our utmost to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall into the same pattern of disobedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w11 7/15 28</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">16-17</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God’s Rest—What Is It?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>16</sup></span><span class="font7"> Few Christians today would insist on observing some aspect of the Mosaic Law in order to obtain salvation. Paul’s inspired words to the Ephesians are perfectly clear: “By this undeserved ki ndness, i ndeed, you have been saved through faith; and this not owing to you, it is God’s gift. No, it is not owing to works, in order that no man should have ground for boasting.” (Eph. 2:8, 9) What, then, does it mean for Christians to enter into God’s rest? Jehovah set aside the seventh day—his rest day— in order to bring his purpose respecting the earth to a glorious fulfillment. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">We can enter into Jehovah’s rest—or join him in his rest—by obediently working in harmony with his advancing purpose as it is revealed to us through his organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup></span><span class="font7"> On the other hand, if we minimized the Biblebased counsel that we receive through the faithful and discreet slave class, choosing to follow an independent course, we would be placing ourselves at odds with God’s unfolding purpose. This could endanger our peaceful relationship with Jehovah. In the next article, we will consider a few common situations that can affect God’s people and discuss how the decisions we make, whether to obey or to take an independent course, can determine if we have truly entered into God’s rest.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Hebrews 4:12) </span><span class="font1">For the word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of joints from the marrow, and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Questions From Readers</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What is “the word of God” that Hebrews 4:12 says “is alive and exerts power”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ </span><span class="font7">The context shows that the apostle Paul was referring to the message, or expression of God’s purpose, such as we find in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hebrews 4:12 is often cited in our publications to show that the Bible has power to change lives, and it is perfectly proper to make that application. However, it is helpful to view Hebrews 4:12 in its broad context. Paul was urging Hebrew Christians to cooperate with God’s purposes. Many of those were set out in the holy writings. Paul used as an example the Israelites who had been saved out of Egypt. They had the prospect of entering the promised land “flowing with milk and honey,” where they could enjoy true rest.—Ex. 3:8; Deut. 12:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That was God’s expressed purpose. Yet, the Israelites later hardened their hearts and did not exercise faith, so most of them failed to enter into that rest. (Num. 14:30; Josh. 14:6-10) However, Paul added that there was still “a promise of entering into [God’s] rest.” (Heb. 3:16-19; 4:1) That “promise” clearly is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">part</span><span class="font7"> of God’s expressed purpose. As did the Hebrew Christians, we can read of and cooperate with that purpose. To underscore that this promise is based on the Scriptures, Paul quoted parts of Genesis 2:2 and Psalm 95:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Certainly, it should touch us that “a promise of entering into [God’s] rest </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">remains.”</span><span class="font7"> We trust that the Bible-based prospect of entering into God’s rest is really possible, and we have taken steps to enter. We have not done that by striving to keep the Mosaic Law or to earn Jehovah’s approval by other works. Rather, in faith we have happily cooperated with and continue to cooperate with God’s revealed purpose. In addition, as noted above, thousands of people around the globe have begun to study the Bible and to learn of the expressions of God’s purpose. Many of them are moved to change their lifestyle, to exercise faith, and to become baptized Christians. The way they are being affected is clear proof that “the word of God is alive and exerts power.” God’s expressed purpose, as outlined in the Bible, has already affected our life, and it will continue to exert power in our life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Hebrews 6:17, 18) </span><span class="font1">In this same way, when God decided to demonstrate more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, he guaranteed it with an oath, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font1">in order that through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to the refuge may have strong encouragement to take firm hold of the hope set before us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Hope</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This hope of everlasting life and incorruption for those who are “partakers of the heavenly call-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ing” (Heb 3:1) is solidly based and is something that can be confidently relied on. It is supported by two things in which it is impossible for God to lie, namely, his promise and his oath, and the hope resides with Christ, who is now immortal in the heavens. Therefore this hope is spoken of as “an anchor for the soul, both sure and firm, and it enters in within the curtain [as the high priest entered the Most Holy on the Day of Atonement], where a forerunner has entered in our behalf, Jesus, who has become a high priest according to the manner of Melchiz-edek forever.”—Heb 6:17-20.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Hebrews 5:1-14) </span><span class="font1">For every high priest taken from among men is appointed in their behalf over the things relating to God, so that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">He is able to deal compassionately with the ignorant and erring ones, since he too is confronted with his own weakness, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font1">and because of that he must make offerings for his own sins just as he does for those of the people. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">A man does not take this honor of his own accord, but he receives it only when he is called by God, just as Aaron was. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">So, too, the Christ did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but was glorified by the One who said to him: “You are my son; today I have become your father.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font1">As he also says in another place, “You are a priest forever in the manner of Mehchiz</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font1">e^dek.”</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font1">During his life on earth, Christ offered up supplications and also petitions, with strong outcries and tears, to the One who was able to save him out of death, and he was favorably heard for his godly fear. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font1">Although he was a son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font1">And after he had been made perfect, he became responsible for everlasting salvation to all those obeying him, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font1">because he has been designated by God a high priest in the manner of Mebchiz</span><span class="font7">'</span><span class="font1">e^dek. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font1">We have much to say about him, and it is difficult to explain, because you have become dull in your hearing. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font1">For although by now you should be teachers, you again need someone to teach you from the beginning the elementary things of the sacred pronouncements of God, and you have gone back to needing milk, not solid food. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font1">For everyone who continues to feed on milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, for he is a young child. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font1">But solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> “First of all chaste.”</span><span class="font1"> To be chaste means to be pure and undefiled not just outwardly but inwardly. The Bible associates wisdom with the heart, but heavenly wisdom cannot enter into a heart that is defiled by wicked thoughts, desires, and motives. (Proverbs 2: 10; Matthew 15:19, 20) However, if our heart is chaste—that is, as far as is possible for imperfect humans—we will “turn away from what is bad and do what is good.” (Psalm 37:27; Proverbs 3:7) Is it not fitting that chasteness is the first quality of wisdom listed? After all, if we are not morally and spiritually clean, how can we truly reflect the other qualities of the wisdom from above?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>10</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> “Then peaceable.”</span><span class="font1"> Heavenly wisdom moves us to pursue peace, which is a fruit of God’s spirit. (Galatians 5:22) We strive to avoid disrupting the “bond of peace” that unites Jehovah’s people. (Ephesians 4:3) We also do our best to restore peace when it is disturbed. Why is this important? The Bible says: “Continue . . . to live peaceably; and the God of love and of peace will be with you.” (2 Corinthians 13:11) So as long as we continue to live peaceably, the God of peace will be with us. The way we treat fellow worshipers has a direct bearing on our relationship with Jehovah. How can we prove ourselves to be peacemakers? Consider an example.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(James 3:17) </span><span class="font1">But the wisdom from above is first of all pure, then peaceable, reasonable, ready to obey, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, not hypocritical.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>12</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> “Reasonable.”</span><span class="font1"> What does it mean to be reasonable? According to scholars, the original Greek word rendered “reasonable” at James 3:17 is difficult to translate. Translators have used such words as “gentle,” “forbearing,” and “considerate.” A footnote in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font1"> indicates that the literal meaning is “yielding.” How can we demonstrate that this aspect of the wisdom from above is at work in us? </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">cl 224-225</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">14-15</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>14</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> “Ready to obey.”</span><span class="font1"> The Greek word rendered “ready to obey” is not found elsewhere in the Christian Greek Scriptures. According to one scholar, this word “is often used of military discipline.” It conveys the idea of “easy to be persuaded” and “submissive.” One who is governed by the wisdom from above readily submits to what the Scriptures say. He is not known as one who makes up his mind and then refuses to be influenced by any facts that contradict him. Rather, he is quick to change when he is presented with clear Scriptural evidence that he has taken a wrong stand or has drawn erroneous conclusions. Is that how you are known by others?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Full of Mercy and Good Fruits”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>15</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> “Full of mercy and good fruits.”</span><span class="font1"> Mercy is an important part of the wisdom from above, for such wisdom is said to be </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“full</span><span class="font1"> of mercy.” Notice that “mercy” and “good fruits” are mentioned together. This is fitting, for in the Bible, mercy most often refers to an active concern for others, a compassion that produces a rich crop of kindly deeds. One reference work defines mercy as “a feeling of sorrow over someone’s bad situation and trying to do something about it.” Hence, godly wisdom is not dry, heartless, or merely intellectual. Instead, it is warm, heartfelt, and sensitive. How can we show that we are full of mercy?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(James 3:17) </span><span class="font1">But the wisdom from above is first of all pure, then peaceable, reasonable, ready to obey, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial, not hypocritical.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>18</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> “Not making partial distinctions.”</span><span class="font1"> Godly wisdom rises above racial prejudice and national pride. If we are guided by such wisdom, we endeavor to root out of our hearts any tendency to show favoritism. (James 2:9) We do not give preferential treatment to others on the basis of their educational background, financial standing, or congregational responsibility; nor do we look down on any of our fellow worshipers, regardless of how lowly they may seem to be. If Jehovah has made such ones recipients of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">his </span><span class="font1">love, we should certainly deem them worthy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font1"> love.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>19</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> “Not hypocritical.”</span><span class="font1"> The Greek word for “hypocrite” can refer to “an actor who played a role.” In ancient times, Greek and Roman actors wore large masks when performing. Hence, the Greek word for “hypocrite” came to apply to one putting on a pretense, or one playing false. This aspect of godly wisdom should influence not just how we treat fellow worshipers but also how we feel about them.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">4:5—What scripture is James quoting here? </span><span class="font1">James is not quoting any specific verse. However, these divinely inspired words are possibly based on the general thought behind such scriptures as Genesis 6:5; 8:21; Proverbs 21:10; and Galatians 5:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(James 4:11, 12) </span><span class="font1">Stop speaking against one another, brothers. Whoever speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against law and judges law. Now if you judge law, you are not a doer of law but a judge. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font1">There is only one who is Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and to destroy. But you, who are you to be judging your neighbor?</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font1"> It is sinful to speak against a fellow believer. (James 4:11, 12) Yet some are critical of fellow Christians, perhaps as a result of their own self-righteous attitude or because they want to exalt themselves by downgrading others. (Psalm 50: 20; Proverbs 3:29) The Greek term rendered ‘speak against’ denotes hostility and implies making an exaggerated or false accusation. This amounts to judging a brother adversely. How is this ‘speaking against and judging God’s law’? Well, the scribes and the Pharisees ‘adroitly set aside God’s commandment’ and judged by their own standards. (Mark 7:1-13) Similarly, if we condemned a brother that Jehovah would not condemn, would we not be ‘judging God’s law’ and sinfully imply that it is inadequate? And by unjustly criticizing our brother, we would not be fulfilling the law of love.—Romans 13:8-10.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(James 3:1-18) </span><span class="font1">Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">For we all stumble many times. If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able to bridle also his whole body. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font1">If we put bridles in the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we guide also their whole body. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">Look also at ships: Although they are so big and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the man at the helm is inclined to go. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">So, too, the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it makes great brags. See how small a fire it takes to set a great forest ablaze! </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font1">The tongue is also a fire.

(Deuteronomy 15:21) Our worship cannot be clean if we do things Jehovah hates, such as things that are immoral, violent, or connected with demonism. (Romans 6:12-14; 8:13) But it would also displease Jehovah if we allowed ourselves to be entertained by such things. This could make our worship unclean and unacceptable to Jehovah and could seriously damage our relationship with him.</span></p></li></ul>

(Ps 23:1; 80:1; Jer 23:3; Eze 34:12) Jehovah is also an overseer, the one who makes inspection. (Ps 17:3) The inspection (Gr., </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">epi-skope'</span><span class="font1">) could be associated with expression of adverse judgment by him, as in the first century C.E. in the case of Jerusalem, which did not discern the time of her “being inspected [Gr., </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">e-pi-sko-pes'</span><span class="font1">].” (Lu 19:44) Or it could bring favorable effect and benefits, as in the case of those glorifying God in the day “for his inspection [Gr., </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">e-pi-sko-pes'</span><span class="font1">].”—1Pe 2:12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Be Vigilant With a View to Prayers”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“THE most difficult time of the night to stay awake is just before the dawn of a new day,” says a former night worker. Very likely, others who have to remain awake all night would agree. Present-day Christians face a similar challenge because the long night of Satan’s wicked system of things is now at the darkest point in its history. (Rom. 13:12) How dangerous it would be for us to fall asleep at this late hour! It is imperative that we “be sound in mind” and heed the Scriptural exhortation to “be vigilant with a view to prayers.”—1 Pet. 4:7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How to Recognize and Overcome Any Spiritual Weakness</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Finally, keep firmly in mind the apostle Peter’s loving admonition: “The end of all things has drawn close. Be sound in mind, therefore, and be vigilant with a view to prayers. Above all things, have intense love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.” (1 Peter 4:7, 8) It is so easy to let human imperfections —other people’s and our own—work their way into our hearts and minds and become obstacles, stumbling blocks. Satan well knows this human weakness. Divide and conquer is one of his wily tactics. We must, therefore, be quick to cover over such sins with intense love for one another and not “allow place for the Devil.” —Ephesians 4:25-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 Peter 4:9) </span><span class="font1">Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Delightful Course of Hospitality—So Needed!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font1"> Among other things, Peter urged his brothers: “Be hospitable to one another.” (1 Pet. 4:9) The word “hospitality” in Greek literally means “fondness for, or kindness to, strangers.” Note, however, that Peter urged his Christian brothers and sisters to be hospitable “to one another,” to those whom they already knew and associated with. How would being hospitable help them?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font1"> It would draw them together. Consider your own experience. Have you had the pleasure of being invited to someone’s home? Did that occasion not leave you with warm memories? When you entertained some from your congregation, was your friendship not deepened? By extending hospitality, we get to know our brothers and sisters in a more personal way than we can in other settings. Christians in Peter’s day needed to draw ever closer as conditions grew worse. The same is true for Christians in these “last days.”—2 Tim. 3:1.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w13</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 6/15 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Questions From Readers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible says that Jesus “preached to the spirits in prison.” (1 Pet. 3:19) What does this mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ </span><span class="font1">The apostle Peter identifies these spirits as those who had “once been disobedient when the patience of God was waiting in Noah’s days.” (1 Pet. 3:20) Clearly, Peter was referring to spirit creatures who chose to join Satan’s rebellion. Jude mentions the angels who “did not keep their original position but forsook their own proper dwelling place,” saying that God “has reserved [them] with eternal bonds under dense darkness for the judgment of the great day.”—Jude 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In what way were spirit creatures disobedient in Noah’s day? Before the Deluge, these wicked spirits materialized in human form—something that God had not purposed for them. (Gen. 6: 2, 4) Furthermore, those angels who had sex with women were practicing a perversion. God did not create spirit creatures to engage in sexual relations with women. (Gen. 5:2) These wicked, disobedient angels will be destroyed in God’s due time. For now, as Jude notes, they are in a condition of “dense darkness”—a spiritual prison, so to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When and how did Jesus preach to these “spirits in prison”? Peter writes that this occurred after Jesus was “made alive in the spirit.” (1 Pet. 3:18, 19) Note, too, that Peter says that Jesus “preached.” Peter’s use of the past tense suggests that the preaching occurred before Peter wrote his first letter. It seems, then, that sometime after his resurrection, Jesus made a proclamation to the wicked spirits regarding the fully justified punishment they are due to receive. It was not a preaching that held out any hope for them. It was a preaching of judgment. (Jonah 1:1, 2) Once Jesus had demonstrated his faith and loyalty to death and then was resur-rected—proving that the Devil indeed had no hold on him—Jesus had the basis for making such a condemnatory proclamation.—John 14: 30; 16:8-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the future, Jesus will bind and throw into the abyss both Satan and those angels. (Luke 8:30, 31; Rev. 20:1-3) Until that time, these disobedient spirits are in a condition of dense spiritual darkness, and their final destruction is certain. —Rev. 20:7-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 Peter 4:6) </span><span class="font1">In fact, this is why the good news was declared also to the dead, so that although they are judged in the flesh from the standpoint of men, they might live in harmony with the spirit from God’s standpoint.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Highlights From the Letters of James and of Peter</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">4:6—Who were “the dead” to whom “the good news was declared”? </span><span class="font1">These were ones who were ‘dead in their trespasses and sins,’ or who were spiritually dead, before they heard the good news. (Eph. 2:1) After putting faith in the good news, though, they began to “live” spiritually.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Keep Close in Mind the Presence of the Day of Jehovah”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(2 Peter 3:9, 10) </span><span class="font1">Jehovah is not slow concerning his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with you because he does not desire anyone to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font1">But Jehovah’s day will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar, but the elements being intensely hot will be dissolved, and earth and the works in it will be exposed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah Will “Cause Justice to Be Done”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font1">How, though, should we understand Jesus’ assurance that Jehovah will cause justice to be done “speedily”? God’s Word shows that “even though [Jehovah] is long-suffering,” he will quickly execute justice when the time is ripe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(Luke 18:7, 8; 2 Peter 3:9, 10) In Noah’s time, when the Flood arrived, the wicked were destroyed without delay. Likewise, in Lot’s day, when fire rained from heaven, the wicked perished. Jesus said: “The same way it will be on that day when the Son of man is to be revealed.” (Luke 17:27-30) Again, the wicked will experience “sudden destruction.” (1 Thessalonians 5:2, 3) Indeed, we can be fully confident that Jehovah will not allow Satan’s world to exist for one day longer than justice requires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(2 Peter 3:11, 12) </span><span class="font1">Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, consider what sort of people you ought to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font1">as you await and keep close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah, through which the heavens will be destroyed in flames and the elements will melt in the intense heat!</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“The Great Day of Jehovah Is Near”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>18</sup></span><span class="font1"> No wonder the apostle Peter admonishes us to keep close in mind “the presence of the day of Jehovah”! How can we do this? One way is by being involved “in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion.” (2 Peter 3:11, 12) Keeping busy in such activities will help us to anticipate eagerly the arrival of “the day of Jehovah.” The Greek word translated “keeping close in mind” literally means “speeding up.” We cannot actually speed up the time that remains until the arrival of Jehovah’s day. Yet, as we wait for that day, the time will seem to pass much more quickly if we are busy in God’s service. —1 Corinthians 15:58.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1:19—Who is the “daystar,” when does he rise, and how do we come to know that this has happened? </span><span class="font1">The “daystar” is Jesus Christ in Kingdom power. (Rev. 22:16) In 1914, Jesus rose before all creation as the Messianic King, heralding the dawn of a new day. The transfiguration provided a visionary foreview of Jesus’ glory and Kingdom power, underscoring the dependability of God’s prophetic word. Paying attention to that word illuminates our hearts, and we are thus made aware that the Daystar has risen.</span></p>

It is a state of dense mental darkness regarding God’s bright purposes. Those in Tartarus have no hope for the future. God threw the disobedient angels into Tartarus in Noah’s day, and they will remain in that abased condition until they are destroyed.</span></p>

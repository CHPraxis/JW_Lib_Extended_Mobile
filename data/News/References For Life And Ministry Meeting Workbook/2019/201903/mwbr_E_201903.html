<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>“What It Means to Show Christian Love”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 12:10) </span><span class="font1">In brotherly love have tender affection for one another. In showing honor to one another, take the lead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">-1 55</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Affection</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brotherly love (Gr., </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">phbla^dehphia,</span><span class="font6"> literally, “affection for a brother”) should exist among all members of the Christian congregation. (Ro 12:10; Heb 13:1; see also 1Pe 3:8.) Thus, the relationships within the congregation should be as close, strong, and warm as in a natural family. Even though the members of the congregation already show brotherly love, they are urged to do it in fuller measure.—1Th 4:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Greek word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">phalo'stoagos,</span><span class="font6"> meaning “having tender affection,” is used of a person who is close to another in warm intimacy. One of the roots of this compound term, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ster'go,</span><span class="font6"> is frequently used to denote a natural affection, as between family members. The apostle Paul encouraged Christians to cultivate this quality. (Ro 12:10) Paul also indicated that the last days would be characterized by people “having no natural affection” (Gr., </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a'storgoi</span><span class="font6">) and that such persons are deserving of death.—2Ti 3:3; Ro 1: 31, 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 12:17-19) </span><span class="font1">Return evil for evil to no one. Take into consideration what is fine from the viewpoint of all men. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font1">If possible, as far as it depends on you, be peaceable with all men. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font1">Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but yield place to the wrath; for it is written: “ ‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay,’ says Jehovah.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Be Peaceable With All Men”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> Read Romans 12:17.</span><span class="font6"> Paul explained that when faced with hostility, we should not retaliate in kind. Heeding his counsel is particularly important in homes that are religiously divided. The Christian mate resists the temptation to repay an unkind word or act with another unkindness. No good comes from ‘returning evil for evil.’ On the contrary, such an attitude can only aggravate the situation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w07 7/1 24-25</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">12-13</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Return Evil for Evil to No One”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>12</sup></span><span class="font6"> Paul’s next admonition on how to treat believers and unbelievers is: “Return evil for evil to no one.” That statement is a logical consequence of what he said earlier, namely: “Abhor what is wicked.” After all, how could a person say that he truly abhors what is wicked, or evil, if he were to use evil as a means to repay others? Doing so would be the opposite of having love “without hypocrisy.” Then Paul says: “Provide fine things in the sight of all men.” (Romans 12:9, 17) How do we apply those words?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>13</sup></span><span class="font6"> Earlier, in his letter to the Corinthians, Paul wrote about the persecution that the apostles faced. He said: “We have become a theatrical spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.... When being reviled, we bless;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">when being persecuted, we bear up; when being defamed, we entreat.” (1 Corinthians 4: 9-13) Similarly, true Christians today are being watched by the people of this world. When those around us observe the fine things we do even while we are being treated unjustly, they may be inclined to look more favorably upon our Christian message.—1 Peter 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 12:20, 21) </span><span class="font1">But “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by doing this you will heap fiery coals on his head.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> </span><span class="font1">Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Forgive One Another Freely</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>13</sup></span><span class="font6"> There may be times when you feel that you can help someone who has wronged you to appreciate Christian standards. The apostle Paul wrote: “ ‘If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by doing this you will heap fiery coals upon his head.’ Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good.” (Rom. 12:20, 21) By your graciousness in the face of provocation, you may soften even the hardest of attitudes and bring out the good in people. By showing understanding, empathy—even compassion—for the offender, you might be able to help him learn Biblical truths. Whatever the case, a mild response gives the individual an opportunity to reflect on your fine conduct.—1 Pet. 2:12; 3:16.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 12:1) </span><span class="font1">Therefore, I appeal to you by the compassions of God, brothers, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, a sacred service with your power of reason.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Choose Our Entertainment</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font6"> Everything we do in life is connected to our worship of Jehovah. Paul explained this when he said: “Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God.” (Romans 12:1) Jesus said: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength.” (Mark 12:30) We always want to give Jehovah our best. In ancient Israel, when people sacrificed an animal to Jehovah, they were expected to give a healthy animal. If the sacrifice had something wrong with it, God did not accept it. (Leviticus 22:18-20) In a similar way, our worship could become unacceptable to Jehovah. How?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font6"> Jehovah tells us: “You must be holy, because I am holy.” (1 Peter 1:14-16; 2 Peter 3:11) Jehovah will accept our worship only if it is holy, or clean. (Deuteronomy 15:21) Our worship cannot be clean if we do things Jehovah hates, such as things that are immoral, violent, or connected with demonism. (Romans 6:12-14; 8:13) But it would also displease Jehovah if we allowed ourselves to be entertained by such things. This could make our worship unclean and unacceptable to Jehovah and could seriously damage our relationship with him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 13:1) </span><span class="font1">Let every person be in subjection to the superior authorities, for there is no authority except by God; the existing authorities stand placed in their relative positions by God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Highlights From the Letter to the Romans</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">13:1—In what way are the superior authorities “placed in their relative positions by God”? </span><span class="font6">Secular authorities “stand placed in their relative positions by God” in that they rule by God’s permission, and in some cases their rulership was foreseen by God. This is made evident by what the Bible foretold about a number of rulers.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Bible Reading</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 13:1-14) </span><span class="font1">Let every person be in subjection to the superior authorities, for there is no authority except by God; the existing authorities stand placed in their relative positions by God. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">Therefore, whoever opposes the authority has taken a stand against the arrangement of God; those who have taken a stand against it will bring judgment against themselves. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font1">For those rulers are an object of fear, not to the good deed,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">but to the bad. Do you want to be free of fear of the authority? Keep doing good, and you will have praise from it; </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">for it is God’s minister to you for your good. But if you are doing what is bad, be in fear, for it is not without purpose that it bears the sword. It is God’s minister, an avenger to express wrath against the one practicing what is bad. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">There is therefore compelling reason for you to be in subjection, not only on account of that wrath but also on account of your conscience. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font1">That is why you are also paying taxes; for they are God’s public servants constantly serving this very purpose. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font1">Render to all their dues: to the one who calls for the tax, the tax; to the one who calls for the tribute, the tribute; to the one who calls for fear, such fear; to the one who calls for honor, such honor. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font1">Do not owe anything to anyone except to love one another; for whoever loves his fellow man has fulfilled the law. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font1">For the law code, “You must not commit adultery, you must not murder, you must not steal, you must not covet,” and whatever other commandment there is, is summed up in this saying: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font1">Love does not work evil to one’s neighbor; therefore, love is the law’s fulfillment. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font1">And do this because you know the season, that it is already the hour for you to awake from sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than at the time when we became believers. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font1">The night is well along; the day has drawn near. Let us therefore throw off the works belonging to darkness and let us put on the weapons of the light. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font1">Let us walk decently as in the daytime, not in wild parties and drunkenness, not in immoral intercourse and brazen conduct, not in strife and jealousy. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font1">But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not be planning ahead for the desires of the flesh.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>“Look to Jehovah for Endurance and Comfort”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 15:4) </span><span class="font1">For all the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction, so that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Weep With Those Who Weep”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font6">The account about Jesus’ intense grief at the time of Lazarus’ death is just one of countless consoling scriptures found in God’s comforting Word. And no wonder, “for all the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction, so that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.” (Rom. 15:4) If you are grieving, you too can find soothing comfort from such scriptures as the following:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">■</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> “Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted; he saves those who are crushed in spirit.”—Ps. 34: 18, 19.</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font4">■</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> “May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and gave everlasting com fort and good hope by means of undeserved kindness, comfort your hearts and make you firm.”—2 Thess. 2:16, 17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 15:5) </span><span class="font1">Now may the God who supplies endurance and comfort grant you to have among yourselves the same mental attitude that Christ Jesus had,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Turn to Jehovah for strength.</span><span class="font6"> Jehovah is “the God who supplies endurance and comfort.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(Rom. 15:5) He alone fully understands not only the problems we face but also the way our environment, emotions, and even our genetic makeup affect us. He is thus the best one to equip us to endure. “He satisfies the desire of those who fear him,” the Bible says. “He hears their cry for help, and he rescues them.” (Ps. 145:19) How, though, will God answer our prayers for strength to endure?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 15:13) </span><span class="font1">May the God who gives hope fill you with all joy and peace by your trusting in him, so that you may abound in hope with power of holy spirit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>11</sup> Jehovah ‘gives hope that fills us with joy and peace.’</span><span class="font6"> (Rom. 15:13) God-given hope enables us to endure tests of faith. Anointed ones who prove ‘faithful even to death will be given the crown of heavenly life.’ (Rev. 2:10) Integritykeepers with an earthly hope will enjoy eternal blessings in the promised global Paradise. (Luke 23:43) What is our natural response to such prospects? Are we not filled with joy and peace, as well as love for the Giver of “every good gift and every perfect present”?—Jas. 1:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 15:27) </span><span class="font1">True, they have been pleased to do so, and indeed they were debtors to them; for if the nations have shared in their spiritual things, they also owe it to minister to them with their material things.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Certainly, their Gentile brothers should have been moved to respond to their plight. After all, they owed a special “debt” to the Christians in Jerusalem. Was it not from Jerusalem that the good news had spread to the Gentiles? Paul reckoned: “If the Jewish Christians shared their spiritual treasures with the Gentiles, the Gentiles have a clear duty to contribute to their material needs.”—Romans 15:27, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The New English Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 16:25) </span><span class="font1">Now to Him who can make you firm according to the good news I declare and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the sacred secret that has been kept in silence for long-lasting times </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it-1 858</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl5</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Foreknowledge, Foreordination</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Messiah, or Christ, was to be the promised Seed through whom all righteous persons of all the families of the earth would be blessed. (Ga 3:8, 14) The first mention of such “seed” came after the rebellion in Eden had already been initiated, but prior to the birth of Abel. (Ge 3:15) This was some 4,000 years before the revelation of “the sacred secret” was made by the clear identification of that Messianic “seed.” Hence, it was, indeed, “kept in silence for long-lasting times.”—Ro 16:25-27; Eph 1:810; 3:4-11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 Corinthians 2:14) </span><span class="font1">But a physical man does not accept the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot get to know them, because they are examined spiritually.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What Does It Mean to Be a Spiritual Person?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font6"> Consider first the attitude of a physical individual. The world has a predominant attitude that centers on the flesh. Paul describes it as “the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience.” (Eph. 2:2) This spirit influences most humans to adopt a common attitude—simply follow the crowd. They are focused on the flesh. As a result, the majority of them do what feels right in their own eyes and make no effort to live up to God’s standards. A physical, or fleshly-minded, person is often excessively concerned about prestige and material pursuits or about defending what he feels are his rights.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font6"> What else might identify a physical person? People who engage in any of “the works of the flesh” fall into that category. (Gal. 5:19-21) Paul’s first letter to the Corinthian congregation identifies a number of other characteristics of those who have a fleshly attitude. These include: promoting divisions, taking sides, fostering dissensions, taking one another to court, showing a lack of appreciation for headship, and being self-indulgent in food and drink. When confronted with temptation, the fleshly-minded person weakens and gives in. (Prov. 7:21, 22) Jude spoke of those who would deteriorate even to the point of “not having spirituality.” —Jude 18, 19.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What Does It Mean to Be a Spiritual Person?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font6"> What, then, does it mean to be a “spiritual man”? A spiritual person is inclined toward God, the opposite of the physical person. Spiritually-minded individuals strive to “become imitators of God.” (Eph. 5:1) This means that they make an effort to have Jehovah’s thinking on matters and to look at things from his point of view. God is very real to them. In contrast with fleshly-minded individuals, they try to bring all their ways into harmony with Jehovah’s standards. (Ps. 119:33; 143:10) Rather than focus on fleshly works, the spiritually-minded person endeavors to show “the fruitage of the spirit.” (Gal. 5:22, 23) To clarify the expression “spiritually-minded” further, think of this comparison: An individual who is skillful in commercial affairs is said to be business-minded. Similarly, someone who keenly values spiritual or religious interests is called spiritually-minded.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What Does It Mean to Be a Spiritual Person? </span><span class="font2"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font6">How can we personally imitate Christ? The Bible at 1 Corinthians 2:16 speaks of having “the mind of Christ.” And Romans 15:5 refers to having “the same mental attitude that Christ Jesus had.” Therefore, to be like Christ, we need to know his pattern of thinking and the full range of his personality. Then we need to follow in his footsteps. Jesus’ mind is focused on his relationship with God. So being like Jesus makes us more like Jehovah. For these reasons, it becomes clear how important it is to learn to think as Jesus does.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Wisdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So the world in its wisdom rejected God’s provision through Christ as foolishness; its rulers, though they may have been able and judicious administrators, even “impaled the glorious Lord.” (1Co 1:18; 2:7, 8) But God, in turn, was now proving the wisdom of the worldly wise to be foolishness, putting their wise men to shame by using what they considered “a foolish thing of God,” as well as persons they deemed ‘foolish, weak, and ignoble,’ to accomplish His invincible purpose. (1Co 1:19-28) Paul reminded the Corinthian Christians that “the wisdom of this system of things [and] that of the rulers of this system of things” would come to nothing; hence such wisdom was not part of the apostle’s spiritual message. (1Co 2:6, 13) He warned Christians in Colossae against being ensnared by “the philosophy [</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">phblo^so^phias, </span><span class="font6">literally, love of wisdom] and empty deception according to the tradition of men.”—Col 2:8; compare vss 20-23.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Highlights From the Letters to the Corinthians 2:3-5. </span><span class="font6">While witnessing in Corinth, a center of Greek philosophy and learning, Paul may have been concerned about whether he would be able to persuade his listeners. However, he did not allow any weakness or fear he might have had to interfere with the carrying out of his God-given ministry. Likewise, we should not permit unusual circumstances to hold us back from declaring the good news of God’s Kingdom. We can confidently look to Jehovah for help as did Paul.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 Corinthians 5:1, 2) </span><span class="font1">Actually sexual immorality is reported among you, and such immorality as is not even found among the nations—of a man living with his father’s wife. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">And are you proud of it?

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Leaven</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The apostle Paul employed the same symbolism when he commanded the Christian congregation in Corinth to expel an immoral man from the congregation, stating: “Do you not know that a little leaven ferments the whole lump? Clear away the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, according as you are free from ferment. For, indeed, Christ our passover has been sacrificed.” He then clearly showed what he meant by “leaven”: “Consequently let us keep</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the festival, not with old leaven, neither with leaven of badness and wickedness, but with unfermented cakes of sincerity and truth.” (1Co 5:6-8) Paul here was drawing on the pictorial meaning of the Jewish Festival of Unfermented Cakes, which immediately followed the Passover celebration. Just as a bit of sourdough soon causes the whole lump, or batch, of bread to be leavened, so the congregation as a body would become unclean in Jehovah’s eyes if they did not clear out this corrupting influence of the immoral man. They must act to get the “leaven” out of their midst, just as the Israelites could have no leaven in their houses during the festival.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What is meant by ‘handing a person over to Satan for destruction of the flesh’?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In instructing the congregation at Corinth as to the action to take toward a member of the congregation who had wickedly been committing incest with the wife of his father, the apostle Paul wrote: “Hand such a man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh.” (1Co 5:5) This was a command to expel the man from the congregation, cutting off all fellowship with him. (1Co 5:13) Turning him over to Satan would put him out of the congregation and into the world over which Satan is the god and ruler. Like “a little leaven” in “the whole lump” of dough, this man was “the flesh,” or fleshly element inside the congregation; and by removing this incestuous man, the spiritually minded congregation would destroy “the flesh” from the midst of it. (1Co 5: 6, 7) Similarly, Paul handed Hymenaeus and Alexander over to Satan, because they had thrust aside faith and a good conscience and had experienced shipwreck concerning their faith.—1Ti 1:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 Corinthians 5:9-11) </span><span class="font1">In my letter I wrote you to stop keeping company with sexually immoral people, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font1">not meaning entirely with the sexually immoral people of this world or the greedy people or extortioners or idolaters. Otherwise, you would actually have to get out of the world. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font1">But now I am writing you to stop keeping company with anyone called a brother who is sexually immoral or a greedy person or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner, not even eating with such a man.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">When someone who has seriously sinned does not repent and refuses to follow Jehovah’s standards, he can no longer be a member of the congregation. He needs to be disfellowshipped. When someone is disfellowshipped, we have no more dealings with that person and we stop talking to him. (1 Corinthians 5:11; 2 John 911) The disfellowshipping arrangement protects Jehovah’s name and the congregation. (1 Corinthians 5:6) Disfellowshipping is also discipline that can help someone to repent so that he can return to Jehovah.—Luke 15:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>16</sup></span><span class="font6"> Christians under trial are ‘a theatrical spectacle to angels.’ (1 Cor. 4:9) With great satisfaction, the angels observe our acts of fa ithfu l ness and even rejoice over the repentance of a sinner. (Luke 15:10) The godly conduct of Christian women is noted by the angels. The Bible shows that “the woman ought to have a sign of authority upon her head because of the angels.” (1 Cor. 11:3, 10) Yes, angels are</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">pleased to see Christian women and all other earthly servants of God comply with theocratic order and headship. Such obedience is a fitting reminder for these heavenly sons of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Law to Angels. </span><span class="font6">Angels, higher than man, are subject to the law and commandments of God. (Heb 1:7, 14; Ps 104:4) Jehovah even commanded and restricted his adversary Satan. (Job 1: 12; 2:6) Michael the archangel recognized and respected Jehovah’s position as Supreme Judge when he said, in dispute with the Devil: “May Jehovah rebuke you.” (Jude 9; compare Zec 3:2.) The glorified Jesus Christ has all the angels placed under his authority by Jehovah God. (Heb 1:6; 1Pe 3:22; Mt 13:41; 25:31; Php 2:9-11) Thus, by Jesus’ command, an angelic messenger was sent to John. (Re 1:1) Yet, at 1 Corinthians 6:3 the apostle Paul speaks of the spiritual brothers of Christ as designated to judge angels, evidently because they are to share in some way in executing judgment upon wicked spirits.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 2:14, 15) </span><span class="font6">For when people of the nations, who do not have law, do by nature the things of the law, these people, although not having law, are a law to themselves. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font6">They are the very ones who demonstrate the matter of the law to be written in their hearts, while their conscience is bearing witness with them, and by their own thoughts they are being accused or even excused.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A Good Conscience With God</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font5"> Even people who do not know Jehovah usually realize that there are things that are right and things that are wrong. The Bible says: “By their own thoughts they are being accused or even excused.” (Romans 2:14, 15) For example, most people know that it is wrong to murder or to steal. Though they may not realize it, they are actually listening to their conscience, the sense of right and wrong that Jehovah put inside of them. They are also following God’s principles, or the basic truths Jehovah has provided to help us to make good choices in life.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A Good Conscience With God</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font5"> Some people think that listening to their conscience simply means following their feelings. They think that they can do whatever they want as long as they feel good about it. But our feelings are imperfect, and they can mislead us. Our feelings can be so powerful that they affect our conscience. The Bible says: “The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate. Who can know it?” (Jeremiah 17:9) So we may begin to think that something is right even though it is wrong. For example, before Paul became a Christian, he viciously persecuted God’s people and believed that what he was doing was right. In his opinion, he had a good conscience. But he later said: “The one who examines me is Jehovah.” (1 Corinthians 4:4; Acts 23:1; 2 Timothy 1:3) When Paul learned how Jehovah felt about what he was doing, he realized that he needed to change. Clearly, before we do something, we need to ask ourselves, ‘What does Jehovah want me to do?’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font5"> When you love someone, you don’t want to displease him or her. Because we love Jehovah, we don’t want to do anything that will displease him. Our fear of displeasing Jehovah needs to be very strong. We see this from Nehemiah’s example. He refused to use his position as governor to get rich. Why? He explained that it was “because of the fear of God.” (Nehemiah 5: 15) Nehemiah did not want to do anything that would displease Jehovah. Like Nehemiah, we too are afraid of displeasing Jehovah by doing something wrong. We can learn what pleases Jehovah by reading the Bible.—See Endnote 6.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Highlights From the Letter to the Romans</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">3:24, 25—How could “the ransom paid by Christ Jesus” cover “the sins that occurred in the past” before it was paid? </span><span class="font5">The first Messianic prophecy, recorded at Genesis 3:15, found fulfillment in 33 C.E. when Jesus was put to death on a torture stake. (Gal. 3:13, 16) The moment Jehovah uttered that prophecy, however, the ransom price was as good as paid from his viewpoint, for nothing can prevent God from fulfilling what he purposes. So on the basis of the future sacrifice of Jesus Christ, Jehovah could forgive the sins of descendants of Adam who exercised faith in that promise. The ransom also makes possible a resurrection of those of pre-Christian times.—Acts 24:15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 5:8) </span><span class="font6">But God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 5:12) </span><span class="font6">That is why, just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned—.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font5"> Paul outlined the matter, starting with this point: “Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.” (Rom. 5:12) We are in a position to understand this because God had a record made of how human life began. Jehovah created two humans, Adam and Eve. The Creator is perfect, and so were those first humans, our ancestors. God gave them but one limiting directive and informed them that disobeying that law would bring a death sentence. (Gen. 2:17) However, they chose to act ruinously, violating God’s reasonable directive, thus rejecting him as Lawgiver and Sovereign.—Deut. 32:4, 5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 5:13, 14) </span><span class="font6">For sin was in the world before the Law, but sin is not charged against anyone when there is no law. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font6">Nevertheless, death ruled as king from Adam down to Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the same way that Adam transgressed, who bears a resemblance to the one who was to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w11 6/15 12</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">6</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God Recommends His Love to Us</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font5"> It was only after Adam had become a sinner that he fathered children, passing on sin and its effects to all of them. Of course, they had not violated the divine law as Adam had, so they were not charged with the same sin; nor had any law code yet been given. (Gen. 2:17) Still, Adam’s descendants inherited sin. Thus, sin and death ruled down to the time when God gave the Israelites a law code, which clearly showed that they were sinners. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Read Romans 5:13, 14.)</span><span class="font5"> The effect of inherited sin might be illustrated with certain inherited diseases or defects, such as Mediterranean anemia or hemophilia. You may have read that Alexis, son of Russian Czar Nicholas II and Alexandra, inherited the bleeding disorder hemophilia. Granted, even in such a family, some children do not suffer from those diseases, but they still may be carriers. Not so with sin. The defect of sin from Adam was inevitable. All are subject to it. It is always fatal. And it is passed on to all children. Could that predicament ever be overcome?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 5:18) </span><span class="font6">So, then, as through one trespass the result to men of all sorts was condemnation, so too through one act of justification the result to men of all sorts is their being declared righteous for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 5:21) </span><span class="font6">To what end? So that just as sin ruled as king with death, so also undeserved kindness might rule as king through righteousness leading to everlasti ng life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font5"> What is the sense of the Greek words underlying the expressions “declaration of righteousness” and “declaring of them righteous”? One Bible translator wrote of the concept: “It is a legal metaphor that makes a quasi-legal point. It speaks of a change in a person’s status in relation to God, not of an inner change in the person . . . The metaphor pictures God as the judge who has reached a decision in favor of the accused, who had been brought before God’s court, so to speak, on a charge of unrighteousness. But God acquits the accused.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>10</sup></span><span class="font5"> On what basis could the righteous “Judge of all the earth” acquit an unrighteous person? (Gen. 18:25) Laying the groundwork, God lovingly sent his only-begotten Son to earth. Jesus did his Father’s will perfectly, despite temptations, extreme ridicule, and abuse. He kept his integrity even to the extent of dying on a torture stake. (Heb. 2:10) In sacrificing his perfect human life, Jesus offered a ransom that might release, or redeem, Adam’s offspring from sin and death.—Matt. 20:28; Rom. 5:6-8.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Highlights From the Letter to the Romans</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">6:3-5—What is meant by baptism into Christ Jesus and baptism into his death? </span><span class="font5">When Jehovah anoints followers of Christ with the holy spirit, they are united with Jesus and become members of the congregation that is the body of Christ, he being the Head. (1 Cor. 12:12, 13, 27; Col. 1:18) This is their baptism into Christ Jesus. Anointed Christians are also “baptized into [Christ’s] death” in that they live a life of sacrifice and renounce any hope of everlasting life on earth. Their death, therefore, is a sacrificial one, as was Jesus’ death, though their death does not have ransoming value. This baptism into Christ’s death is completed when they die and are resurrected to life in heaven.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When the unrighteous are resurrected, will they be judged on the basis of their past actions? No. Romans 6:7 states: “The one who has died has been acquitted from his sin.” The unrighteous will have paid for their sins by dying. Thus, they will be judged on the basis of what they do after their resurrection, not what they did in ignorance before they died. How will they benefit?</span></p>

That revealing will begin when these “sons,” resurrected to the spirit realm, share with Christ in cleansing the earth of evil and preserving “a great crowd” into the new system of things.—Rev. 7:9, 14.</span></p>

(Gal. 3:16) By his death and resurrection, Jesus provided a solid basis for mankind’s hope to be set free from enslavement to sin and death. The realization of this hope is related to “the revealing of the sons of God.” The glorified anointed ones are the secondary part of the “seed.” They will be ‘revealed’ when they share with Christ in destroying Satan’s wicked system of things.

At that time, the glorified “sons of God” will be further ‘revealed’ when they act as priests with Christ, administering the benefits of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice to mankind. As subjects of the heavenly Kingdom, human “creation” will begin to experience deliverance from the effects of sin and death. Obedient humans will gradually “be set free from enslavement to corruption.” If they remain faithful to Jehovah throughout the Millennium and during the final test that will come at the end of it, their names will be permanently written in “the scroll of life.” They will enter into “the glorious freedom of the children of God.” (Rev. 20:7, 8, 11, 12) A glorious hope indeed!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What is the difference between “setting the mind on the flesh” and “setting the mind on the spirit”? (Rom. 8:6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The one doing the former focuses on the desires and leanings of the imperfect flesh, constantly talking about and glorifying things of the flesh. A person doing the latter centers his life on things related to God and his thoughts; such a Christian is dominated by holy spirit. The former leads to death, the latter to life and peace. —</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w16.12,</span><span class="font5"> pp. 15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 8:26, 27) </span><span class="font6">In like manner, the spirit also joins in with help for our weakness; for the problem is that we do not know what we should pray for as we need to, but the spirit itself pleads for us with unuttered groanings. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>27</sup> </span><span class="font6">But the one who searches the hearts knows what the meaning of the spirit is, because it is pleading in harmony with God for the holy ones.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>20</sup></span><span class="font5"> At times, we may not know what to say in our private prayers. “The problem of what we should pray for as we need to we do not know,” wrote Paul, “but the [holy] spirit itself pleads for us with groanings unuttered. Yet he [God] who searches the hearts knows what the meaning of the spirit is.” (Rom. 8:26, 27) Jehovah caused many prayers to be recorded in the Scriptures. He accepts these inspired petitions as requests we would like to make and therefore fulfills them. God knows us and the meaning of the things he caused his spirit to speak through the Bible writers. Jehovah answers our supplications when the spirit “pleads,” or intercedes, for us. But as we become better acquainted with God’s Word, what we should pray for may more readily come to mind.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>13</sup></span><span class="font5"> The apostle Paul goes on to compare those who become part of Abraham’s seed to branches on a symbolic olive tree. (Rom. 11:21) This cultivated olive tree represents the fulfillment of God’s purpose with regard to the Abraham-ic covenant. The root of the tree is holy and represents Jehovah as the one who gives life to spiritual Israel. (Isa. 10:20; Rom. 11:16) The trunk represents Jesus as the primary part of Abraham’s seed. The branches collectively represent “the full number” of those included in the secondary part of Abraham’s seed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 11:17) </span><span class="font6">However, if some of the branches were broken off and you, although being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became a sharer of the richness of the olive’s root,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 11:20, 21) </span><span class="font6">That is true! For their lack of faith, they were broken off, but you are standing by faith. Do not be haughty, but be in fear. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> </span><span class="font6">For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>15</sup></span><span class="font5"> What, then, did Jehovah do to fulfill his purpose? Paul explains that branches from a wild olive tree were grafted onto the cultivated olive tree to replace those broken off. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Read Romans 11:17, 18.)</span><span class="font5"> Thus, spirit-anointed Christians of the nations, such as some in the congregation in Rome, were figuratively grafted onto this symbolic olive tree. In this way they became part of Abraham’s seed. Originally, they were like wild olive branches, not having any opportunity to be a part of this special covenant. But Jehovah opened the way for them to become spiritual Jews.—Rom. 2:28, 29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Romans 11:25, 26) </span><span class="font6">For I do not want you to be unaware of this sacred secret, brothers, so that you do not become wise in your own eyes: A partial dulling of senses has come upon Israel until the full number of people of the nations has come in, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>26</sup> </span><span class="font6">and in this manner all Israel will be saved.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font5"> What if humans stubbornly refuse to be molded by the Great Potter? How, then, does he exercise his divine authority? Think about what happens to the clay if it becomes unsuited for the intended purpose. Why, the potter can make another type of vessel out of it or simply discard it! When the clay is useless, though, generally the potter is at fault. This is never the case with our Potter. (Deut. 32:4) When a person does not yield to Jehovah’s molding, the fault always lies with that person. Jehovah exercises his potterlike authority over humans by adjusting his dealings with them depending on their response to his molding. Those who respond properly are fashioned in a beneficial way. For example, anointed Christians are “vessels of mercy” who have been molded into ‘vessels for an honorable use.’ On the other hand, those who stubbornly oppose God end up as “vessels of wrath made fit for destruction.” —Rom. 9:19-23.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Misdirected Zeal.</span><span class="font5"> One may be sincerely zealous, or jealous, for a certain cause and yet be wrong and displeasing to God. That was true of many of the Jews of the first century. They looked for righteousness to come to them through their own works under the Mosaic Law. But Paul showed that their zeal was misdirected because of lack of accurate knowledge. Therefore they did not receive the real righteousness that comes from God. They would have to see their error and turn to God through Christ to receive righteousness and freedom from the condemnation of the Law. (Ro 10:1-10) Saul of Tarsus was one of such, being extremely zealous for Judaism to the point of excess, “persecuting the congregation of God and devastating it.” He was scrupulously keeping the Law as “one who proved himself blameless.” (Ga 1:13, 14; Php 3:6) Yet his jealousy for Judaism was a misdirected one. He was sincere of heart, for which reason Jehovah exercised undeserved kindness through Christ in turning him to the way of true worship.—1Ti 1:12, 13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Whoever Wants to Become Great Among You Must Be Your Minister”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 20:3) </span><span class="font0">Going out also about the third hour, he saw others standing unemployed in the marketplace;</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Marketplace</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some marketplaces, like the one depicted here, were located along a road. Vendors often placed so much merchandise in the street that it blocked traffic. Local residents could buy common household goods, pottery, and expensive glassware, as well as fresh produce. Because there was no refrigeration, people needed to visit the market each day to buy supplies. Here a shopper could hear news brought in by traders or other visitors, children could play, and the unemployed could wait to be hired. In the marketplace, Jesus healed the sick and Paul preached. (Ac 17:17) By contrast, the proud scribes and Pharisees loved to be noticed and greeted in these public areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 20:20, 21) </span><span class="font0">Then the mother of the sons of Zeb</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font0">e^dee approached him with her sons, doing obeisance and asking for something from him. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> </span><span class="font0">He said to her: “What do you want?” She replied to him: “Give the word that these two sons of mine may sit down, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> study notes on Mt 20:20, 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">mother of the sons of Zebedee: </span><span class="font0">That is, the mother of the apostles James and John. According to Mark’s account, James and John are the ones who approach Jesus. They are evidently the source of the request, but they make the request through their mother, Salome, who may have been Jesus’ aunt.—Mt 27:55, 56; Mr 15:40, 41; Joh 19:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">one at your right hand and one at your left: </span><span class="font0">Here both positions indicate honor and authority, but the place of greatest honor is always on the right.—Ps 110:1; Ac 7:55, 56; Ro 8:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 20:25-28) </span><span class="font0">But Jesus called them to him and said: “You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them and the great men wield authority over them. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>26</sup> </span><span class="font0">This must not be the way among you; but whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>27</sup> </span><span class="font0">and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>28</sup> </span><span class="font0">Just as the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">minister: </span><span class="font0">Or “servant.” The Bible often uses the Greek word </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">di-a'ko-nos</span><span class="font0"> to refer to one who does not let up in humbly rendering service in behalf of others. The term is used to describe Christ (Ro 15:8), ministers or servants of Christ (1Co 3:5-7; Col 1:23), ministerial servants (Php 1:1; 1Ti 3:8), as well as household servants (Joh 2: 5, 9) and government officials (Ro 13:4).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">not to be ministered to, but to minister: </span><span class="font0">Or “not to be served, but to serve.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 21:9) </span><span class="font0">Moreover, the crowds going ahead of him and those following him kept shouting: “Save, we pray, the Son of David! Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah’s name! Save him, we pray, in the heights above!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> study note on Mt 21:9</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Save, we pray: </span><span class="font0">Lit., “Hosanna.” That Greek term comes from a Hebrew expression that means “save, we pray” or “save, please.” Here the term is used as a plea to God for salvation or victory; it could be rendered “please, grant salvation to.” In time, it became an expression of both prayer and praise. The Hebrew expression is found at Ps 118:25, which was part of the Hallel Psalms sung regularly during Passover season. Therefore, these words readily came to mind on this occasion. One way God answered this prayer to save the Son of David was by resurrecting him from the dead. At Mt 21:42, Jesus himself quotes Ps 118:22, 23 and applies it to the Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Son of David: </span><span class="font0">An expression here showing recognition of Jesus’ line of descent and his role as the promised Messiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 21:18, 19) </span><span class="font0">While returning to the city early in the morning, he felt hungry. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font0">He caught sight of a fig tree by the road and went to it, but he found nothing on it except leaves, and he said to it: “Let no fruit come from you ever again.” And the fig tree withered instantly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">jy 244</span><span class="font4"> fl</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">4-6</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Fig Tree Is Used to Teach a Lesson About Faith</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But why did Jesus cause the tree to wither? He reveals the reason in his response: “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what I did to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen. And all the things you ask in prayer, having faith, you will receive.” (Matthew 21:21, 22) He is thus repeating the point he made earlier about faith being able to move a mountain.—Matthew 17:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So by causing the tree to wither, Jesus provides an object lesson on the need to have faith in God. He states: “All the things you pray and ask for, have faith that you have received them, and you will have them.” (Mark 11:24) What an important lesson for all of Jesus’ followers! It is especially appropriate for the apostles in view of the difficult tests they will soon face. There is yet another connection between the withering of the fig tree and the quality of faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Like this fig tree, the nation of Israel has a deceptive appearance. The people of this nation are in a covenant relationship with God, and they might outwardly appear to observe his Law. However, the nation as a whole has proved to be both lacking faith and barren of good fruitage. They even reject God’s own Son! Hence, by causing the unproductive fig tree to wither, Jesus demonstrates what the end will be for this fruitless, faithless nation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 20:1-19) </span><span class="font0">“For the Kingdom of the heavens is like the master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font0">After he had agreed with the workers for a de^narTus a day, he sent them into his vineyard. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font0">Going out also about the third hour, he saw others standing unemployed in the marketplace; </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font0">and to those he said, ‘You too go into the vineyard, and I will give you whatever is fair.’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font0">So off they went. Again he went out about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did likewise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font0">Finally, about the 11th hour, he went out and found others standing around, and he said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here all day unemployed?’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font0">They replied, ‘Because nobody has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You too go into the vineyard.’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font0">“When evening came, the master of the vineyard said to his man in charge, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last and ending with the first.’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font0">When the 11th-hour men came, they each received a de^narTus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font0">So when the first came, they assumed that they would receive more, but they too were paid at the rate of a de^narTus. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font0">On receiving it, they began to complain against the master of the house </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font0">and said, ‘These last men put in one hour’s work; still you made them equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the burning heat!’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font0">But he said in reply to one of them, ‘Fellow, I do you no wrong. You agreed with me for a de^nar</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font0">i-us, did you not? </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font0">Take what is yours and go. I want to give to this last one the same as to you. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font0">Do I not have the right to do what I want with my own things? Or is your eye envious because I am good?’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font0">In this way, the last ones will be first, and the first ones last.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font0">While going up to Jerusalem, Jesus took the 12 disciples aside privately and said to them on the road: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font0">“Look! We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font0">and hand him over to men of the nations to be mocked and scourged and executed on a stake; and on the third day he will be raised up.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Obey the Two Greatest Commandments” (Matthew 22:36-38) </span><span class="font0">“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>37</sup> </span><span class="font0">He said to him: “ ‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>38</sup> </span><span class="font0">This is the greatest and first commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> study note on Mt 22:37</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">heart: </span><span class="font0">When used in a figurative sense, this term generally refers to the total inner person. When mentioned together with “soul” and “mind,” however, it evidently takes on a more specific meaning and refers mainly to a person’s emotions, desires, and feelings. The three terms used here (heart, soul, and mind) are not mutually exclusive; they are used in an overlapping sense, emphasizing in the strongest possible way the need for complete and total love for God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">soul: </span><span class="font0">Or “whole being.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">mind: </span><span class="font0">That is, intellectual faculties. A person must use his mental faculties to come to know God and grow in love for him. (Joh 17:3, ftn.; Ro 12:1) In this quote from De 6:5, the original Hebrew text uses three terms, ‘heart, soul, and strength.’ However, according to Matthew’s account as it appears in Greek, the term for “mind” is used instead of “strength.” There may be several reasons for this use of different terms. First, although ancient Hebrew did not have a specific word for “mind,” this concept was often included in the Hebrew word for “heart.” This term when used figuratively refers to the whole inner person, including a person’s thinking, feelings, attitudes, and motivations. (De 29:4; Ps 26:2; 64:6; see study note on </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">heart </span><span class="font0">in this verse.) For this reason, where the Hebrew text uses the word “heart,” the Greek </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Septuagint</span><span class="font0"> often uses the Greek equivalent for “mind.” (Ge 8:21; 17:17; Pr 2:10; Isa 14:13) Another reason why Matthew may have used the Greek word for “mind” instead of “strength” when quoting De 6:5 is that the Hebrew word rendered “strength [or, “vital force,” ftn.]” could include both physical strength and mental or intellectual ability. Whatever the case, this overlapping of ideas between the Hebrew and Greek terms may help to explain why when quoting Deuteronomy the Gospel writers do not use the same exact wording.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 22:39) </span><span class="font0">The second, like it, is this: ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> study note on Mt 22:39</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The second: </span><span class="font0">At Mt 22:37, Jesus’ direct answer to the Pharisee is recorded, but Jesus now goes beyond the original question and quotes a second commandment (Le 19:18), teaching that the two commandments are inextricably linked and that the whole Law and the Prophets are summed up by them.—Mt 22:40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">neighbor: </span><span class="font0">This Greek word for “neighbor” (lit., “the one near”) can include more than just those who live nearby. It can refer to anyone with whom a person interacts.—Lu 10:29-37; Ro 13:8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 22:40) </span><span class="font0">On these two commandments the whole Law hangs, and the Prophets.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> study note on Mt 22:40</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the Law . . . the Prophets: </span><span class="font0">“The Law” refers to the Bible books of Genesis through Deuteronomy. “The Prophets” refers to the prophetic books of the Hebrew Scriptures. However, when these terms are mentioned together, the expression could be understood to include the entire Hebrew Scriptures.—Mt 7:12; 22:40; Lu 16:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">hangs: </span><span class="font0">The Greek verb with the literal meaning “to hang on” is here used in the figurative sense “to be dependent on; be based on.” Jesus thus indicated that not just the Law with the Ten Commandments but the entire Hebrew Scriptures are based on love.—Ro 13:9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 22:21) </span><span class="font0">They said: “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them: “Pay back, therefore, Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Caesar’s things to Caesar: </span><span class="font0">Jesus’ reply here, and in the parallel accounts at Mr 12:17 and Lu 20:25, is his only recorded reference to the Roman emperor. “Caesar’s things” include payment for services rendered by the secular government as well as the honor and relative subjection that is to be shown to such author-ities.—Ro 13:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s things to God: </span><span class="font0">This includes a person’s wholehearted worship, whole-souled love, and complete, loyal obedience.—Mt 4:10; 22:37, 38; Ac 5:29; Ro 14:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 23:24) </span><span class="font0">Blind guides, who strain out the gnat but gulp down the camel!</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">who strain out the gnat but gulp down the camel: </span><span class="font0">The gnat and the camel were among the smallest and the largest unclean creatures known to the Israelites. (Le 11:4, 21-24) Jesus uses hyperbole, combined with a degree of irony, in saying that the religious leaders filter their beverages so as not to be ceremonially defiled by a gnat, while they completely disregard the weightier matters of the Law, an action comparable to swallowing a camel.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 22:1-22) </span><span class="font0">Once more Jesus spoke to them with illustrations, saying: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font0">“The Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a king who made a marriage feast for his son. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font0">And he sent his slaves to call those invited to the marriage feast, but they were unwilling to come. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font0">Again he sent other slaves, saying, ‘Tell those invited: “Look! I have prepared my dinner, my bulls and fattened animals are slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the marriage feast.”’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font0">But unconcerned they went off, one to his own field, another to his business; </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font0">but the rest, seizing his slaves, treated them insolently and killed them. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font0">“The king grew wrathful and sent his armies and killed those murderers and burned their city. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font0">Then he said to his slaves, ‘The marriage feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font0">Therefore, go to the roads leading out of the city, and invite anyone you find to the marriage feast.’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font0">Accordingly, those slaves went out to the roads and gathered all they found, both wicked and good; and the room for the wedding ceremonies was filled with those dining. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font0">“When the king came in to inspect the guests, he caught sight of a man not wearing a marriage garment. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font0">So he said to him, ‘Fellow, how did you get in here without a marriage garment?’ He was speechless. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font0">Then the king said to his servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot and throw him into the darkness outside. There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be.’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font0">“For there are many invited, but few chosen.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font0">Then the Pharisees went and conspired together in order to trap him in his speech. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font0">So they sent their disciples to him, together with party followers of Herod, saying: “Teacher, we know you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not seek anyone’s favor, for you do not look at the outward appearance of people. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font0">Tell us, then, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay head tax to Caesar or not?” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font0">But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said: “Why do you put me to the test, hypocrites? </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font0">Show me the tax coin.” They brought him a de^narTus. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>20</sup> </span><span class="font0">He said to them: “Whose image and inscription is this?” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> </span><span class="font0">They said: “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them: “Pay back, therefore, Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>22</sup> </span><span class="font0">When they heard that, they were amazed, and they left him and went away.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">One’s Love Can Cool Off.</span><span class="font0"> Jesus Christ, in telling his disciples of the things ahead, indicated that the love (</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a^ga'pe</span><span class="font0">) of many who professed belief in God would cool off. (Mt 24:3, 12) The apostle Paul said that, as a feature of the critical times to come, men would become “lovers of money.” (2Ti 3:1, 2) It is evident, therefore, that a person can lose sight of right principles and that the proper love he once had can fade away. This emphasizes the importance of constant exercise and development of love by meditation on God’s Word and by molding one’s life according to His principles.—Eph 4:15, 22-24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Are You Fulfilling Your Whole Obligation to God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font0"> Jesus Christ said of our critical times: “Just as the days of Noah were, so the presence of the Son of man will be. For as they were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, men marrying and women being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark; and they took no note until the flood came and swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of man will be.” (Matthew 24:37-39) In moderation, there is nothing wrong with eating and drinking, and marriage is an arrangement originated by God himself. (Genesis 2:20-24) Yet, if we realize that the normal pursuits of life have become our chief concern, why not make this a matter of prayer? Jehovah can help us to keep Kingdom interests first, do what is right, and fulfill our obligation to him.—Matthew 6:33; Romans 12:12; 2 Corinthians 13:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 24:44) </span><span class="font0">On this account, you too prove yourselves ready, because the Son of man is coming at an hour that you do not think to be it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Apostles Ask for a Sign</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He says that his disciples will need to keep alert, to be on the watch, and to be ready. Jesus underscores this warning with another illustration: “Know one thing: If the householder had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have kept awake and not allowed his house to be broken into. On this account, you too prove yourselves ready, because the Son of man is coming at an hour that you do not think to be it.”—Matthew 24:43, 44.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 25:1-6) </span><span class="font0">“Then the Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font0">Five of them were foolish, and five were discreet. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font0">For the foolish took their lamps but took no oil with them, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font0">whereas the discreet took oil in their flasks along with their lamps. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font0">While the bridegroom was delaying, they all became drowsy and fell asleep. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font0">Right in the middle of the night there was a shout: ‘Here is the bridegroom!

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Loyally Supporting Christ’s Brothers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font0"> Today, we have a clear understanding of the illustration of the sheep and the goats. Regarding the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">identity</span><span class="font0"> of those mentioned, Jesus is “the Son of man,” the King. Those referred to as “my brothers” are spirit-anointed men and women, who will rule with Christ from heaven. (Rom. 8: 16, 17) “The sheep” and “the goats” represent individuals from all nations. These ones are not anointed by holy spirit. What about the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">timing </span><span class="font0">of the judgment? This judgment will occur toward the end of the great tribulation just ahead. And what of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">reason</span><span class="font0"> why people will be judged as either sheep or goats? The outcome hinges on how they have treated the remaining ones of Christ’s spirit-anointed brothers on earth. With the end of this system so close at hand, how grateful we are that Jehovah has progressively shed light on this illustration and on the related illustrations recorded in Matthew chapters 24 and 25!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 25:40) </span><span class="font0">In reply the King will say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w09</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 10/15 16 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fl </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">16-18 “You Are My Friends”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font0">If you hope to live on earth under God’s Kingdom, how can you express your friendship toward Christ’s brothers? Let us consider just three ways. First, by wholeheartedly sharing in the preaching work. Christ commanded his brothers to preach the good news worldwide. (Matt. 24:14) However, the remaining ones of Christ’s brothers on earth today would be hard-pressed to shoulder that responsibility without the assistance of their other sheep companions. Really, each time members of the other sheep class engage in the preaching work, they help Christ’s brothers to fulfill their sacred commission. The faithful and discreet slave class deeply appreciates this act of friendship, as does Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>17</sup></span><span class="font0">A second way that those of the other sheep class can help Christ’s brothers is by financially supporting the preaching work. Jesus encouraged his followers to make friends for themselves by means of “the unrighteous riches.” (Luke 16:9) Not that we can buy friendship with Jesus or Jehovah. Rather, by using our material assets to further Kingdom interests, we prove our friendship and love, not just in word, but “in deed and truth.” (1 John 3:16-18) We provide such financial support when we engage in the preaching work, when we donate money toward the construction and maintenance of our meeting facilities, and when we contribute funds toward the worldwide preaching work. Whether the amount we contribute is small or great, both Jehovah and Jesus certainly appreciate our cheerful giving.—2 Cor. 9:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font0">A third way that all of us prove that we are friends of Christ is by cooperating with the direction provided by congregation elders. These men are appointed by holy spirit under Christ’s direction. (Eph. 5:23) “Be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you and be submissive,” wrote the apostle Paul. (Heb. 13:17) At times, we may find it a challenge to obey the Bible-based direction given to us by the local elders. We are likely aware of their imperfections, and this may distort our view of their counsel. Still, Christ, the Head of the congregation, is pleased to use these imperfect men. Therefore, the way we react to their authority directly influences our friendship with Christ. When we overlook the faults of the elders and joyfully follow their direction, we prove our love for Christ.</span></p>

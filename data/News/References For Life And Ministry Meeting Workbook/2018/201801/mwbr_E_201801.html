<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THEW 1-3</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Kingdom of the Heavens Has Drawn Near”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 3:1, 2) </span><span class="font1">In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Ju^de</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font1">a,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">saying: “Repent, for the Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> study notes on Mt 3:1, 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">preaching: </span><span class="font0">The Greek word basically means “to make proclamation as a public messenger.” It stresses the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">manner</span><span class="font0"> of the proclamation: usually an open, public declaration rather than a sermon to a group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom: </span><span class="font0">First occurrence of the Greek word </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ba-si-leia,</span><span class="font0"> which refers to a royal government as well as to the territory and peoples under the rule of a king. Of the 162 occurrences of this Greek word in the Christian Greek Scriptures, 55 can be found in Matthew’s account and most of them refer to God’s heavenly rule. Matthew uses the term so frequently that his Gospel might be called the Kingdom Gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom of the heavens: </span><span class="font0">This expression occurs some 30 times and only in the Gospel of Matthew. In the Gospels of Mark and Luke, the parallel phrase “the Kingdom of God” is used, indicating that “the Kingdom of God” is based in and rules from the spiritual heavens.—Mt 21: 43; Mr 1:15; Lu 4:43; Da 2:44; 2Ti 4:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">has drawn near: </span><span class="font0">Here in the sense that the future Ruler of the heavenly Kingdom was about to appear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 3:4) </span><span class="font1">Now John was clothed with camel’s hair and had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>nwtsty</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> media</span><br><br><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>John the Baptizer’s Clothing and Appearance</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">John wore a garment that was woven from camel’s hair and was secured at the waist by a leather belt, or girdle, that could be used to carry small items. Similar clothing was worn by the prophet Elijah. (2Ki 1:8) Camel’s haircloth was a rough fabric commonly worn by the poor. By contrast, soft garments made of silk or linen were worn by the rich. (Mt 11:7-9) Because John was a Nazirite from birth, it is possible that his hair had never been cut. His dress and appearance likely made it immediately apparent that he lived a simple life, completely devoted to doing God’s will.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Locusts</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">As used in the Bible, the term “locusts” can refer to any of a variety of grasshoppers with short antennas, or feelers, especially grasshoppers that migrate in great swarms. According to an analysis made in Jerusalem, desert locusts consist of 75 percent protein. When used for food today, the head, legs, wings, and abdomen are removed. The remaining portion, the thorax, is eaten raw or cooked. These insects are said to taste something like shrimp or crab and are rich in protein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Wild Honey</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pictured here are a hive built by wild honey bees (1) and a honey-filled comb (2). The honey that John ate may have been produced by a wild species of bee known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Apis mellifera syriaca,</span><span class="font0"> which is native to the area. This aggressive species is well-adapted to living in the hot, dry climate of the Judean wilderness but is not suited to being farmed by man. However, as early as the ninth century B.C.E., people living in Israel kept honey bees in clay cylinders. A large number of the remains of these hives were discovered in the middle of what was an urban area (now known as Tel Rehov), located in the Jordan Valley. Honey from these hives was produced by a species of bee that seems to have been imported from what is now known as Turkey.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Tamar: </span><span class="font0">The first of five women listed in Matthew’s genealogy of the Messiah. The other four are Rahab and Ruth, both non-Israelite women (vs. 5); Bath-sheba, “the wife of Uriah” (vs. 6); and Mary (vs. 16). These women are likely included in an otherwise all-male genealogy because there is something outstanding in the way each one came to be an ancestress of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 3:11) </span><span class="font1">I, for my part, baptize you with water because of your repentance, but the one coming after me is stronger than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to take off. That one will baptize you with holy spirit and with fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> study note on Mt 3:11</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">baptize you: </span><span class="font0">Or “immerse you.” The Greek word </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ba-ptizo</span><span class="font0"> means “to dip; to plunge.” Other Biblical references indicate that baptism involves complete immersion. On one occasion, John was baptizing at a location in the Jordan Valley near Salim “because there was a great quantity of water there.” (Joh 3:23) When Philip baptized the Ethiopian eunuch, they both “went down into the water.” (Ac 8:38) The same Greek word is used in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Septuagint</span><span class="font0"> at 2Ki 5:14 when describing that Naaman “plunged into the Jordan seven times.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>“Lessons Learned From Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 5:3) </span><span class="font1">“Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need, since the Kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> study note on Mt 5:3</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Happy: </span><span class="font0">Not simply a state of lightheartedness, as when a person is enjoying a good time. Rather, when used of humans, it refers to the condition of one who is blessed by God and enjoys his favor. The term is also used as a description of God and of Jesus in his heavenly glory.—1Ti 1:11; 6:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">those conscious of their spiritual need: </span><span class="font0">The Greek expression rendered “those conscious,” literally, “those who are poor (needy; destitute; beggars),” in this context is used about those who have a need and are intensely aware of it. The same word is used in reference to the “beggar” Lazarus at Lu 16:20, 22. The Greek phrase that some translations render those who are “poor in spirit” conveys the idea of people who are painfully aware of their spiritual poverty and of their need for God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 5:7) </span><span class="font1">“Happy are the merciful, since they will be shown mercy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> study note on Mt 5:7</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">merciful: </span><span class="font0">The use of the Bible terms rendered “merciful” and “mercy” is not limited to forgiveness or leniency in judgment. It most often describes the feelings of compassion and pity that move a person to take the initiative to assist those in need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 5:9) </span><span class="font1">“Happy are the peacemakers, since they will be called sons of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">peacemakers: </span><span class="font0">Those who not only maintain peace but also bring peace to where it is lacking.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Christian parents are keenly interested in training their children to “seek peace and pursue it.” (1 Peter 3:11) The happiness that results from being a peacemaker is worth all the effort needed to conquer feelings of suspicion, frustration, and animosity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 4:9) </span><span class="font1">And he said to him: “All these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> study note on Mt 4:9</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">do an act of worship: </span><span class="font0">The Greek verb that can be rendered “to worship” is here in the aorist tense, which indicates a momentary action. Rendering it “do an act of worship” shows that the Devil did not ask Jesus to do constant or continuous worship to him; it was a single “act of worship.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 4:23) </span><span class="font1">Then he went throughout the whole of Gal</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font1">idee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the Kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity among the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">teaching . . . preaching: </span><span class="font0">Teaching differs from preaching in that the teacher does more than proclaim; he instructs, explains, uses persuasive arguments, and offers proof.</span></p>

Then Jesus showed that we should pray for God’s Kingdom to come and for Jehovah’s will to be done all over the earth. It was only after praying for those very important things that Jesus said that we should pray for our personal needs. When we put Jehovah and his will first in our prayers, we show what is most important to us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> Read Matthew 6:33. </span><span class="font0">Christ’s disciples must always make the Kingdom their first concern in life. If we do that, then, as Jesus said, “all these other things will be added” to us. Why could he say that? He explained in the preceding verse: “Your heavenly Father </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">knows</span><span class="font0"> that you need all these things,” meaning the necessities of life. Jehovah can easily anticipate our individual needs regarding food, clothing, and shelter, even before we become aware of them. (Phil. 4: 19) He knows which piece of our clothing will wear out next. He knows what our dietary requirements are and what would be adequate shelter for us, given the size of our family. Jehovah will see to it that we have what we really </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">need.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup></span><span class="font0"> Imagine that one day we receive a phone call but do not recognize the caller’s voice. He is a stranger, but he asks a question about the types of food we prefer. We wonder who the caller is and what he really wants. Out of politeness, perhaps we might briefly converse with him, but then we would likely indicate that we prefer to end the conversation. On the other hand, imagine that the caller identifies himself, lets us know that he works in the field of nutrition, and kindly tells us that he has some helpful information. We would probably be more receptive. After all, we appreciate it when people are straightforward yet tactful when approaching us. How can we extend the same courtesy to those we meet in our ministry?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup></span><span class="font0"> In many territories, we need to make the purpose of our visit clear to the householder. True, we have valuable information the householder does not have, but suppose we did not really introduce ourselves and merely began our presentation abruptly with a question like this: “If you could solve any problem in the world, what would it be?” We know that the purpose behind such a question is to find out what is on the person’s mind and then direct the conversation to the Bible. However, the householder might wonder: ‘Who is this stranger, and why is he asking me this question? What is this all about?’ So we should try to put the householder at ease. (Phil. 2:3, 4) How can we do so?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup></span><span class="font0"> One traveling overseer has found the following approach to be effective. After exchanging greetings, he hands the householder a copy of the tract </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know the Truth? </span><span class="font0">and says: “We’re giving one of these to everyone in the area today. It discusses six questions that many people ask. Here is your copy.” The brother reports that most people seem to relax a bit once they know the purpose of the visit. At that point, it is often easier to get a conversation under way. The traveling overseer next asks the person: “Have you ever thought about any of these questions?” If the householder chooses one, the brother opens the tract and discusses what the Bible says about that question. Otherwise, he selects a question and continues the discussion without putting the householder on the spot. Of course, there are many ways to start a conversation. In some areas, householders may expect more formalities before we get to the point of our visit. The key is to adjust our presentation to the way that people in our area likely want to be approached.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">not as their scribes: </span><span class="font0">Rather than quote revered rabbis as an authority, as was the scribes’ custom, Jesus speaks as Jehovah’s representative, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">as a person having authority, </span><span class="font0">basing his teachings on God’s Word.—Joh 7:16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 8:1-3) </span><span class="font1">After he came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">And look ! a leper came up and did obeisance to him, saying: “Lord, if you just want to, you can make me clean.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font1">So stretching out his hand, he touched him, saying: “I want to! Be made clean.” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed away.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">he touched him: </span><span class="font0">The Mosaic Law required that lepers be quarantined to protect others from contamination. (Le 13:45, 46; Nu 5:1-4) However, Jewish religious leaders imposed additional rules. For example, no one was to come within four cubits, that is, about 1.8 m (6 ft) of a leper, but on windy days, the distance was 100 cubits, that is, about 45 m (150 ft). Such rules led to heartless treatment of lepers. Tradition speaks favorably of a rabbi who hid from lepers and of another who threw stones at them to keep them at a distance. By contrast, Jesus was so deeply moved by the leper’s plight that he did what other Jews would consider un-thinkable—he touched the man. He did so even though he could have cured the leper with just a word.—Mt 8:5-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">I want to: </span><span class="font0">Jesus not only acknowledged the request but expressed a strong desire to respond to it, showing that he was motivated by more than just a sense of duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 9:9-13) </span><span class="font1">Next, while moving on from there, Jesus caught sight of a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office, and he said to him: “Be my follower.” At that he rose up and followed him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font1">Later as he was dining in the house, look! many tax collectors and sinners came and began dining with Jesus and his disciples. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font1">But on seeing this, the Pharisees said to his disciples: “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font1">Hearing them, he said: “Healthy people do not need a physician, but those who are ill do. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font1">Go, then, and learn what this means: ‘I want mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came to call, not righteous people, but sinners.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">dining: </span><span class="font0">Or “reclining at the table.” To recline with someone at a table indicated close fellowship with that person. Thus, Jews in Jesus’ day would normally never have reclined at the table, or taken a meal, with non-Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">tax collectors: </span><span class="font0">Many Jews collected taxes for the Roman authorities. People hated such Jews because they not only collaborated with a resented foreign power but also extorted more than the official tax rate. Tax collectors were generally shunned by fellow Jews, who put them on the same level as sinners and prosti-tutes.—Mt 11:19; 21:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 9:35-38) </span><span class="font1">And Jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the Kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>36</sup> </span><span class="font1">On seeing the crowds, he felt pity for them, because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>37</sup> </span><span class="font1">Then he said to his disciples: “Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>38</sup> </span><span class="font1">Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font0">Similarly, when an army officer—perhaps a Gentile, a Roman—approached and asked Jesus to cure an ailing slave, Jesus knew that the soldier had faults. An army officer of those days would likely have a past littered with many acts of violence, bloodshed, and false worship. Yet, Jesus focused on something good—the man’s outstanding faith. (Matthew 8:5-13) Later, when Jesus spoke to the evildoer who was hanging on the torture stake next to him, Jesus did not rebuke the man for his criminal past but encouraged him with a hope for the future. (Luke 23:43) Jesus knew well that taking a negative, critical view of others would only serve to discourage them. No doubt his efforts to find the good in others encouraged many to do even better.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Do Jesus’ Disciples Not Fast?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jesus is helping the disciples of John the Baptist to appreciate that no one should expect Jesus’ followers to conform to the old practices of Judaism, such as ritual fasting. He did not come to patch up and prolong an old, worn-out way of worship, a whole system of worship that was ready to be discarded. The worship that Jesus is encouraging is not one that conforms to the Judaism of the day with its traditions of men. No, he is not trying to put a new patch on an old garment or new wine into a stiff, old wineskin.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">even the hairs of your head are all numbered: </span><span class="font0">The number of hairs on the human head is said to average more than 100,000. Jehovah’s intimate knowledge of such minute details guarantees that he is keenly interested in each follower of Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Sparrows were the cheapest of all birds sold as food. Two of them could be purchased with the amount a man earned working for 45 minutes. The Greek term could embrace a variety of small birds, including a common house sparrow (</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Passer domesticus biblicus</span><span class="font0">) and the Spanish sparrow (</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Passer hispaniolensis</span><span class="font0">), which are still abundant in Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 11:28) </span><span class="font1">Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">loaded down: </span><span class="font0">Those whom Jesus beckons to come were “loaded down” by anxiety and toil. Their worship of Jehovah had become burdensome because of the human traditions that had been added to the Law of Moses. (Mt 23:4) Even the Sabbath, which was meant to be a source of refreshment, had become a burden. —Ex 23:12; Mr 2:23-28; Lu 6:1-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">I will refresh you: </span><span class="font0">The Greek word for “refresh” can refer both to rest (Mt 26:45; Mr 6:31) and to relief from toil in order to recover and regain strength (2Co 7:13; Phm 7). The context shows that taking on Jesus’ “yoke” (Mt 11:29) would involve service, not rest. The active Greek verb with Jesus as the subject conveys the thought of his rejuvenating and energizing weary ones so that they would desire to take up his light and kindly yoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 11:29, 30) </span><span class="font1">Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for yourselves. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>30</sup> </span><span class="font1">For my yoke is kindly, and my load is light.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Take my yoke upon you: </span><span class="font0">Jesus used “yoke” figuratively in the sense of submission to authority and direction. If he had in mind a double yoke, one that God placed upon Jesus, then he would be inviting his disciples to get under the yoke </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">with him</span><span class="font0"> and he would assist them. In that case, the phrase could be rendered: “Get under my yoke with me.” If the yoke is one that Jesus himself puts on others, then the reference is to submitting oneself to Christ’s authority and direction as his disciple.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Does that seem to be a strange question? John is a devoted man who, when baptizing Jesus nearly two years before, saw God’s spirit descend upon Jesus and heard God’s voice of approval. We have no reason to think that John’s faith has grown weak. Otherwise, Jesus would not speak so highly of John, as he does on this occasion. But if John is not having doubts, why does he ask this question of Jesus?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">John may simply want verification directly from Jesus that he is the Messiah. This would strengthen John as he languishes in prison. And John’s question apparently has an added sense. He is acquainted with the Bible prophecies that show that the Anointed One of God is to be a king and a deliverer. Yet, many months after Jesus was baptized, John is in prison. So John is asking if there is to be another one coming, a successor to Jesus, as it were, who will complete the fulfillment of all that the Messiah was foretold to accomplish.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Woe to an Unresponsive Generation</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jesus has high regard for John the Baptist, but how do most people regard John? “This generation,” Jesus declares, “is like young children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to their playmates, saying: ‘We played the flute for you, but you did not dance; we wailed, but you did not beat yourselves in grief.’”—Matthew 11: 16, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What does Jesus mean? He clarifies the thought: “John came neither eating nor drinking, but people say, ‘He has a demon.’ The Son of man did come eating and drinking, but people say, ‘Look! A man who is a glutton and is given to drinking wine, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’” (Matthew 11:18, 19) On the one hand, John has lived a simple life as a Nazirite, even abstaining from wine, yet this generation says he is demonized. (Numbers 6:2, 3; Luke 1: 15) On the other hand, Jesus lives like other men. He eats and drinks in a balanced way, but he is accused of going to excess. It seems impossible to satisfy the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 11:1-19) </span><span class="font1">When Jesus had finished giving instructions to his 12 disciples, he set out from there to teach and preach in their cities. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">But John, having heard in jail about the works of the Christ, sent his disciples </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font1">to ask him: “Are you the Coming One, or are we to expect a different one?” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">In reply Jesus said to them: “Go and report to John what you are hearing and seeing: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">The blind are now seeing and the lame are walking, the lepers are being cleansed and the deaf are hearing, the dead are being raised up and the poor are being told the good news. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font1">Happy is the one who finds no cause for stumbling in me.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font1">While these were on their way, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed being tossed by the wind? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font1">What, then, did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft garments? Why, those wearing soft garments are in the houses of kings. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font1">Really, then, why did you go out?

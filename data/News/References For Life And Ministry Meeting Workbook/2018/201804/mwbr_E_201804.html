<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 26:17-20) </span><span class="font1">On the first day of the U nleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying: “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font1">He said: “Go into the city to So-and-so and say to him, ‘The Teacher says: “My appointed time is near; I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your home.”’” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font1">So the disciples did as Jesus instructed them and prepared for the Passover. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>20</sup> </span><span class="font1">When evening came, he was reclining at the table with the 12 disciples.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>nwtsty</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> media</span><br><br><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>The Passover Meal</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Essential items at the Passover meal were: roast lamb (no bones in the animal were to be broken) (1); unleavened bread (2); and bitter greens (3). (Ex 12:5, 8; Nu 9:11) The bitter greens, which according to the Mishnah might have been lettuce, chicory, pepperwort, endive, or dandelion, evidently reminded the Israelites of their bitter slavery in Egypt. Jesus used the unleavened bread as a symbol of his perfect human body. (Mt 26:26) And the apostle Paul called Jesus “our Passover lamb.” (1Co 5:7) By the first century, wine (4) was also served as part of the Passover meal. Jesus used the wine to symbolize his blood, which would be poured out as a sacrifice.—Mt 26:27, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 26:26) </span><span class="font1">As they continued eating, Jesus took a loaf, and after saying a blessing, he broke it, and giving it to the disciples, he said: “Take, eat. This means my body.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">means: </span><span class="font0">The Greek word </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">e-stin'</span><span class="font0"> (literally meaning “is”) here has the sense of “signifies; symbolizes; stands for; represents.” This meaning was evident to the apostles, since on this occasion Jesus’ perfect body was there in front of them and so was the unleavened bread that they were about to eat. Therefore, the bread could not have been his literal body. It is worth noting that the same Greek word is used at Mt 12:7, and many Bible translations render it “means.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 26:27, 28) </span><span class="font1">And taking a cup, he offered thanks and gave it to them, saying: “Drink out of it, all of you, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>28</sup> </span><span class="font1">for this means my ‘blood of the covenant,’ which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">blood of the covenant: </span><span class="font0">The new covenant, between Jehovah and anointed Christians, was made operative by Jesus’ sacrifice. (Heb 8:10) Jesus here uses the same expression Moses used when acting as mediator and inaugurating the Law covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai. (Ex 24:8; Heb 9:19-21) Just as the blood of bulls and goats validated the Law covenant between God and the nation of Israel, Jesus’ blood made valid the new covena nt that Jehovah would make with spiritual Israel. That covenant went into effect at Pentecost 33 C.E.—Heb 9:14, 15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 26:17) </span><span class="font1">On the first day of the Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying: “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> study note on Mt 26:17</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">On the first day of the Unleavened Bread: </span><span class="font0">The Festival of Unleavened Bread began on Nisan 15, the day after the Passover (Nisan 14), and lasted for seven days. (See App. B15.) In Jesus’ time, however, the Passover had become so closely connected to this festival that all eight days, including Nisan 14, sometimes were referred to as “the Festival of the Unleavened Bread.” (Lu 22:1) In this context, the phrase “On the first day of” could be rendered “On the day before.” (Compare Joh 1:15, 30, where the Greek word for “first” [</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">pro'tos</span><span class="font0">] is rendered “before” in a similar construction, namely, “he existed before [</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">pro'tos</span><span class="font0">] me.”) So the original Greek, as well as Jewish custom, allows for the disciples’ question to have been asked of Jesus on Nisan 13. During the daytime of Nisan 13, the disciples made preparations for the Passover, which was later celebrated “after evening had fallen” at the beginning of Nisan 14.—Mr 14:16, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 26:39) </span><span class="font1">And going a little way forward, he fell facedown, praying: “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> study note on Mt 26:39</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">let this cup pass away: </span><span class="font0">In the Bible, “cup” is often used figuratively of God’s will, or the “assigned portion,” for a person. (See study note on Mt 20:22.) Jesus no doubt felt great concern over the reproach that his death as one charged with blasphemy and sedition could bring on God, moving him to pray that this “cup” pass away from him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 26:1-19) </span><span class="font1">Now when Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">“You know that two days from now the Passover takes place, and the Son of man will be handed over to be executed on the stake.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font1">Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the courtyard of the high priest, who was named Ca</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font1">ia^phas, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">and they conspired together to seize Jesus by cunning and to kill him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">However, they were saying: “Not at the festival, so that there may not be an uproar among the people.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font1">While Jesus was in Beth</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font1">a^ny in the house of Simon the leper, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font1">a woman with an alabaster jar of costly perfumed oil approached him, and she began pouring it on his head as he was dining. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font1">On seeing this, the disciples became indignant and said: “Why this waste? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font1">For this could have been sold for a great deal of money and given to the poor.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font1">Aware of this, Jesus said to them: “Why do you try to make trouble for the woman? She did a fine deed toward me. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font1">For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font1">When she put this perfumed oil on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font1">Truly I say to you, wherever this good news is preached in all the world, what this woman did will also be told in memory of her.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font1">Then one of the Twelve, the one called Judas IscarTot, went to the chief priests </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font1">and said: “What will you give me to betray him to you?” They stipulated to him 30 silver pieces. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font1">So from then on, he kept looking for a good opportunity to betray him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font1">On the first day of the Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying: “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font1">He said: “Go into the city to So-and-so and say to him, ‘The Teacher says: “My appointed time is near; I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your home.”’” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font1">So the disciples did as Jesus instructed them and prepared for the Passover.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">| </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MATTHEW 27-28</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Go Make Disciples—Why, Where, and How?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 28:18) </span><span class="font1">Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w04 7/1 8</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">4</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">‘Go and Make Disciples’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font0"> Jesus has authority over his congregation, and since 1914 he has had authority over God’s newly established Kingdom. (Colossians 1:13; Revelation 11:15) He is the archangel and as such commands a heavenly army of hundreds of millions of angels. (1 Thessalonians 4:16; 1 Peter 3:22; Revelation 19:14-16) He has been empowered by his Father to bring to nothing “all government and all authority and power” that oppose righteous principles. (1 Corinthians 15:24-26; Ephesians 1:20-23) Jesus’ authority is not limited to the living. He is also “judge of the living and the dead” and has God-given power to resurrect those who have fallen asleep in death. (Acts 10:42; John 5:26-28) Surely a command given by the One vested with such vast authority should be viewed as of the highest importance. Therefore, we respectfully and willingly obey Christ’s command to ‘go and make disciples.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 28:19) </span><span class="font1">Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty study notes on Mt 28:19</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">make disciples: </span><span class="font0">The Greek verb </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ma-the-teu'o </span><span class="font0">can be rendered “teach” with the intent of making pupils or disciples. (Compare usage at Mt 13:52, where it is rendered “taught.”) The verbs “baptizing” and “teaching” show what is involved in the command to “make disciples.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">people of all the nations: </span><span class="font0">A literal translation reads “all nations,” but the context indicates that this term refers to individuals out of all nations, since the Greek pronoun “them” in the expression </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">baptizing them </span><span class="font0">is in the masculine gender and refers to people, not to “nations,” which is neuter in Greek. This command to reach “people of all the nations” was new. Prior to Jesus’ ministry, the Scriptures indicate that Gentiles were welcomed to Israel if they came to serve Jehovah. (1Ki 8:41-43) With this command, however, Jesus commissions his disciples to extend the preaching work to people other than natural Jews, emphasizing the worldwide scope of the Christian disciple-making work.—Mt 10:1, 5-7; Re 7:9; see study note on Mt 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 28:20) </span><span class="font1">teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. And look ! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">teaching them: </span><span class="font0">The Greek word rendered “to teach” involves instruction, explanation, showing things by argument, and offering proofs. (See study notes on Mt 3:1; 4:23.) Teaching them to </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">observe all the things </span><span class="font0">that Jesus had commanded would be an ongoing process, which would include teaching what he taught, applying his teaching, and following his exam-ple.—Joh 13:17; Eph 4:21; 1Pe 2:21.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">curtain: </span><span class="font0">This beautifully ornamented drape sepa rated the Most Holy from the Holy in the temple. Jewish tradition indicates that this heavy curtain was some 18 m (60 ft) long, 9 m (30 ft) wide, and 7.4 cm (2.9 in.) thick. By tearing the curtain in two, Jehovah not only manifests his wrath against his Son’s killers but also signifies that entry into heaven itself is now possible.—Heb 10:19, 20; see Glossary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">sanctuary: </span><span class="font0">The Greek word </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">na-os'</span><span class="font0"> here refers to the central edifice with its Holy and Most Holy compartments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">tell his disciples that he was raised up: </span><span class="font0">These women are not only the first disciples to be told of Jesus’ resurrection but also the ones instructed to inform the other disciples. (Mt 28:2, 5, 7) According to unscriptural Jewish tradition, a woman’s testimony was not permissible in a court of law. By contrast, Jehovah’s angel dignifies the women by giving them this joyful assignment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 27:38-54) </span><span class="font1">Then two robbers were put on stakes alongside him, one on his right and one on his left. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>39</sup> </span><span class="font1">And those passing by spoke abusively of him, shaking their heads </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>40</sup> </span><span class="font1">and saying: “You who would throw down the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are a son of God, come down off the torture stake!” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>41</sup> </span><span class="font1">In the same way also, the chief priests with the scribes and the elders began mocking him, saying: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>42</sup> </span><span class="font1">“Others he saved; himself he cannot save! He is King of Israel; let him now come down off the torture stake, and we will believe in him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>43</sup> </span><span class="font1">He has put his trust in God; let Him now rescue him if He wants him, for he said, ‘I am God’s Son.’ ” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>44</sup> </span><span class="font1">In the same way, even the robbers who were on stakes alongside him were reproaching him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>45</sup> </span><span class="font1">From the sixth hour on, a darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>46</sup> </span><span class="font1">About the ninth hour, Jesus called out with a loud voice, saying: </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“E'li, E'li, la'ma sa-bach-tha'ni?&quot;</span><span class="font1"> that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>47</sup> </span><span class="font1">At hearing this, some of those standing there began to say: “This man is calling Edi</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font1">jah.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>48</sup> </span><span class="font1">And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and soaked it in sour wine and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>49</sup> </span><span class="font1">But the rest of them said: “Let him be! Let us see whether Edi</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font1">jah comes to save him.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>50</sup> </span><span class="font1">Again Jesus called out with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>51</sup> </span><span class="font1">And look! the curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two, from top to bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>52</sup> </span><span class="font1">And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the holy ones who had fallen asleep were raised up </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>53</sup> </span><span class="font1">(and people coming out from among the tombs after his being raised up entered into the holy city), and they became visible to many people. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>54</sup> </span><span class="font1">But when the army officer and those with him keeping watch over Jesus saw the earthquake and the things happening, they grew very much afraid and said: “Certainly this was God’s Son.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Mark 2:3-5) </span><span class="font1">And they brought him a paralytic carried by four men. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">But they could not bring him right to Jesus because of the crowd, so they removed the roof above Jesus, and after digging an opening, they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic: “Child, your sins are forgiven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">jy 67</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">3-5</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Your Sins Are Forgiven”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While Jesus is teaching in the crowded room, four men bring a paralyzed man on a stretcher. They want Jesus to heal their friend. Yet, because of the crowd, they cannot “bring him right to Jesus.” (Mark 2:4) Imagine how disappointing that is. They climb up onto the flat roof of the house and make an opening through the tiles. Then they lower the stretcher holding the paralyzed man down into the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Does Jesus get angry at the interruption? No, indeed! He is deeply impressed by their faith and says to the paralyzed man: “Your sins are forgiven.” (Matthew 9:2) But can Jesus actually forgive sins? The scribes and the Pharisees take issue with this, reasoning: “Why is this man talking this way? He is blaspheming. Who can forgive sins except one, God?”—Mark 2:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Knowing their thoughts, Jesus says to them: “Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk’?” (Mark 2:8, 9) Yes, based on the sacrifice that Jesus will in time offer, he can forgive the man’s sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Mark 2:6-12) </span><span class="font1">Now some of the scribes were there, sitting and reasoning in their hearts: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font1">“Why is this man talking this way? He is blaspheming. Who can forgive sins except one, God?” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font1">But immediately Jesus discerned by his spirit that they were reasoning that way among themselves, so he said to them: “Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font1">Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk’? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font1">But in order for you to know that the Son of man has authority to forgive sins on earth—” he said to the paralytic: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font1">“I say to you, Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font1">At that he got up and immediately picked up his stretcher and walked out in front of them all.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a voice came out of the heavens: </span><span class="font0">The first of three instances in the Gospel accounts where Jehovah is reported as speaking directly to hu-mans.—See study notes on Mr 9:7; Joh 12:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">You are my Son: </span><span class="font0">As a spirit creature, Jesus was God’s Son. (Joh 3:16) From the time of his birth as a human, Jesus was a “son of God” just as perfect Adam had been. (Lu 1:35; 3:38) However, it seems reasonable that God’s words here go beyond a mere statement of Jesus’ identity. By this declaration accompanied by the outpouring of holy spirit, God evidently indicated that the man Jesus was begotten as His spiritual Son, “born again” with the hope of returning to life in heaven and anointed by spirit to be God’s appointed King and High Priest.—Joh 3: 3-6; 6:51; compare Lu 1:31-33; Heb 2:17; 5:1, 4-10; 7:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">I have approved you: </span><span class="font0">Or “I am well-pleased with you; I take great delight in you.” The same expression is used at Mt 12:18, which is a quotation from Isa 42:1 regarding the promised Messiah, or Christ. The outpouring of holy spirit and God’s declaration concerning his Son were a clear identification of Jesus as the promised Messiah.—See study notes on Mt 3:17; 12:18.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord . . . of the Sabbath: </span><span class="font0">Jesus applies this expression to himself (Mt 12:8; Lu 6:5), indicating that the Sabbath was at his disposal for doing the work commanded by his heavenly Father. (Compare Joh 5:19; 10:37, 38.) On the Sabbath, Jesus performed some of his most outstanding miracles, which included healing the sick. (Lu 13:10-13; Joh 5:5-9; 9:1-14) This evidently foreshadowed the kind of relief he will bring during his Kingdom rule, which will be like a sabbath rest.—Heb 10:1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Mark 3:1, 2) </span><span class="font1">Once again he entered into a synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font1">So they were watching him closely to see whether he would cure the man on the Sabbath, in order to accuse him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">What Is Lawful on the Sabbath?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On another Sabbath, Jesus visits a synagogue, likely in Galilee. There he finds a man whose right hand is withered. (Luke 6:6) The scribes and the Pharisees are watching Jesus closely. Why? They reveal what their real intent is when they ask: “Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath?” —Matthew 12:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Jewish religious leaders believe that healing is lawful on the Sabbath </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font0"> if life is in danger. Thus, for example, on the Sabbath it is unlawful to set a bone or bandage a sprain, conditions that are not life threatening. Clearly the scribes and the Pharisees are not questioning Jesus because they feel genuine concern for this poor man’s suffering. They are trying to find a pretext for condemning Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Mark 3:3, 4) </span><span class="font1">He said to the man with the withered hand: “Get up and come to the center.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">Next he said to them: “Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to kill?” But they kept silent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">What Is Lawful on the Sabbath?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jesus, however, knows their twisted reasoning. He realizes that they have adopted an extreme, unscriptural view of what constitutes a violation of the prohibition against doing work on the Sabbath. (Exodus 20:8-10) He has already faced such misplaced criticism of his good works. Now Jesus sets the stage for a dramatic confrontation by telling the man with the withered hand: “Get up and come to the center.” —Mark 3:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Mark 3:5) </span><span class="font1">After looking around at them with indignation, being thoroughly grieved at the insensibility of their hearts, he said to the man: “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Mark 3:29) </span><span class="font1">But whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit has no forgiveness forever but is guilty of everlasting sin.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> study notes on Mr 3:29</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">blasphemes against the holy spirit: </span><span class="font0">Blasphemy refers to defamatory, injurious, or abusive speech against God or against sacred things. Since </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">holy spirit </span><span class="font0">ema nates from God himself, willfully opposing or denying its operation amounted to blasphemy against God. As shown at Mt 12:24, 28 and Mr 3:22, the Jewish religious leaders saw God’s spirit at work in Jesus as he performed miracles; yet, they attributed this power to Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">guilty of everlasting sin: </span><span class="font0">Seems to refer to willful sin that has eternal consequences; there is no sacrifice to cover such sin.—See study note on </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">blasphemes against the holy spirit </span><span class="font0">in this verse and study note on Mt 12:31, the parallel account.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You “Grasp the Meaning”?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> What can we learn from this illustration? </span><span class="font0">First of all, we have to admit that we have no control over the spiritual growth of a Bible student. Modesty on our part will help us to avoid the temptation to pressure or force a student to get baptized. We do all we can to assist and support the person, but we humbly admit that ultimately the decision to make a dedication belongs to that person. Dedication is something that must spring from a willing heart motivated by love for God. Anything less would not be acceptable to Jehovah.—Ps. 51:12; 54:6; 110:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font0"> Second, understanding the lesson behind this illustration will help us not to be discouraged if we do not at first see results from our work. We need to be patient. (Jas. 5:7, 8) Even though the seed does not bear fruit, if we have done our best to help the student, we realize that this outcome is not a sign of unfaithfulness on our part. Jehovah allows the seed of truth to flourish only in a humble heart that is willing to make changes. (Matt. 13:23) So we should not judge the effectiveness of our ministry merely by the results. In Jehovah’s eyes the success of our ministry is not determined by the response of those whom we teach. Rather, he treasures our faithful efforts regardless of the results.—</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Read Luke 10:17-20; 1 Corinthians 3:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font0"> Third, we do not always discern the changes that are taking place within a person. For example, a couple with whom a missionary had been studying approached him, asking to become unbaptized publishers. He reminded the couple that in order to qualify, they would have to stop smoking. Much to his surprise, they told him that they had quit several months before. Why did they quit? They had come to realize that Jehovah could see them smoking and that he hates hypocrisy. So their hearts motivated them to make a decision—either smoke in front of the missionary or stop altogether. Their newly developed love for Jehovah helped them to make the right decision. They had grown spiritually, even though the missionary had no idea of the change that had taken place.</span></p></li></ul>

(Ps 13:3; Joh 11:1114; Ac 7:60; 1Co 7:39; 15:51; 1Th 4:13) Jesus was going to bring the girl back to life, so he may have said this because he would demonstrate that just as people can be awakened from a deep sleep, they can be brought back from death. Jesus’ power to resurrect the girl came from his Father, “who makes the dead alive and calls the things that are not as though they are.” —Ro 4:17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">On earlier occasions, Jesus ordered those whom he healed not to publicize what he had done for them, and he does so again with these parents. Nevertheless, the delighted parents and others spread the news “into all that region.” (Matthew 9:26) Would you not talk about it excitedly if you had seen one of your loved ones raised from the dead? This is the second recorded resurrection Jesus performs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">shake off the dirt that is on your feet: </span><span class="font0">This gesture signified that the disciples disclaimed responsibility for the consequences that would come from God. A similar expression occurs at Mt 10:14; Lu 9:5. Mark and Luke add the expression </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">for a witness to </span><span class="font0">[or, “against”] </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">them. </span><span class="font0">Paul and Barnabas applied this instruction in Pi-sidian Antioch (Ac 13:51), and when Paul did something similar in Corinth by shaking out his garments, he added the explanatory words: “Let your blood be on your own heads. I am clean.” (Ac 18:6) Such gestures may already have been familiar to the disciples; pious Jews who had traveled through Gentile country would shake what they perceived to be unclean dust off their sandals before reentering Jewish territory. However, Jesus evidently had a different meaning in mind when giving these instructions to his disciples.</span></p>

And his sisters are here with us, are they not?” So they began to stumble because of him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font1">But Jesus said to them: “A prophet is not without honor except in his home territory and among his relatives and in his own house.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font1">So he was not able to do any powerful work there except to lay his hands on a few sick people and cure them. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font1">Indeed, he was amazed at their lack of faith. And he went around in a circuit to the villages, teaching. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font1">He now summoned the Twelve and started sending them out two by two, and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font1">Also, he gave them orders to carry nothing for the trip except a staff—no bread, no food pouch, no money in their belts— </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font1">but to put on sandals and not to wear two garments. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font1">Further, he said to them: “Wherever you enter into a home, stay there until you leave that place. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font1">And wherever a place will not receive you or listen to you, on going out from there, shake off the dirt that is on your feet for a witness to them.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font1">Then they set out and preached that people should repent, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font1">and they expelled many demons and greased many sick people with oil and cured them.</span></p>

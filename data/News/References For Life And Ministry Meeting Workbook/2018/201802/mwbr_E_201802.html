<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 13:24-26) </span><span class="font0">He presented another illustration to them, saying: “The Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a man who sowed fine seed in his field. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>25</sup> </span><span class="font0">While men were sleeping, his enemy came and oversowed weeds in among the wheat and left. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>26</sup> </span><span class="font0">When the stalk sprouted and produced fruit, then the weeds also appeared.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font0"> The events taking place in that farmer’s field illustrate how and when Jesus would gather out of mankind the entire wheat class—anointed Christians who will rule with him in his Kingdom. The sowing began at Pentecost 33 C.E. The gathering will be complete when the anointed who are alive at the end of this system of things receive their final sealing and then are taken to heaven. (Matt. 24:31; Rev. 7:1-4) Just as a lookout point on a mountain provides a person with a sweeping view of his surroundings, so this parable gives us a panoramic view of developments that would occur during a period of some 2,000 years. From our vantage point, what developments related to the Kingdom do we discern? The parable describes a time of sowing, growth, and harvesting. This article will focus mainly on the harvesttime.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">UNDER JESUS’ WATCHFUL CARE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font0"> At the dawn of the second century C.E., “the weeds appeared” when imitation Christians became visible in the world field. (Matt. 13:26) By the fourth century, weedlike Christians had greatly outnumbered anointed Christians. Recall that in the parable, the slaves asked their master for permission to uproot the weeds. (Matt. 13:28) How did the master respond?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 13:27-29) </span><span class="font0">So the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow fine seed in your field? How, then, does it have weeds?’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>28</sup> </span><span class="font0">He said to them, ‘An enemy, a man, did this.’ The slaves said to him, ‘Do you want us, then, to go out and collect them?’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>29</sup> </span><span class="font0">He said, ‘No, for fear that while collecting the weeds, you uproot the wheat with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w13 7/15 10</span><span class="font4"> fl </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">4</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Look! I Am With You All the Days”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font0"> Speaking about the wheat and the weeds, Jesus said: “Let both grow together until the harvest.” This command reveals that from the first century until today, there have always been some anointed wheatlike Christians on earth. That conclusion is confirmed by what Jesus later told his disciples: “I am with you </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font0"> the days until the conclusion of the system of things.” (Matt. 28:20) So anointed Christians would be protected by Jesus all the days leading up to the time of the end. However, since they were overgrown by weedlike Christians, we do not know for certain who belonged to the wheat class during that long period of time. However, some decades before the start of the harvest season, the wheat class became discernible. How did that come about?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 13:30) </span><span class="font0">Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the harvest season, I will tell the reapers: First collect the weeds and bind them in bundles to burn them up; then gather the wheat into my storehouse.’” </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w13</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7/15 12 </span><span class="font4">fl</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">10-12</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Look! I Am With You All the Days”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>10</sup></span><span class="font0"> First, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">collecting the weeds. </span><span class="font0">Jesus says: “In the harvest season I will tell the reapers, First collect the weeds and bind them in bundles.” After 1914, the angels began to “collect” weedlike Christians by separating them from the anointed “sons of the kingdom.”—Matt. 13:30, 38, 41.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup></span><span class="font0"> As the collecting work progressed, the distinction between the two groups became ever clearer. (Rev. 18:1, 4) By 1919, it became evident that Babylon the Great had fallen. What especially set true Christians apart from imitation ones? The preaching work. Those taking the lead among the Bible Students began to stress the importance of sharing personally in the Kingdom preaching work. For instance, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">To Whom the Work Is Entrusted,</span><span class="font0"> a pamphlet published in 1919, urged </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font0"> anointed Christians to preach from house to house. It stated: “The work appears stupendous, but it is the Lord’s, and in his strength we will perform it. You have the privilege of sharing in it.” What was the response? From that time onward, reported </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font0"> in 1922, the Bible Students stepped up their preaching activities. Before long, preaching from house to house became a hallmark of those faithful Christians—as it is till this day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>12</sup></span><span class="font0"> Second, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">gathering the wheat. </span><span class="font0">Jesus commands his angels: “Go to gathering the wheat into my storehouse.” (Matt. 13:30) Since 1919, anointed ones have been gathered into the restored Christian congregation. For those anointed Christians who will be alive at the end of this system of things, the final gathering will take place when they receive their heavenly re-ward.—Dan. 7:18, 22, 27.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0">The Greek expression “smoldering wick” may refer to a wick that gives off smoke because an ember is still present but the flame is fading or is extinguished. The prophecy of Isa 42:3 foretold Jesus’ compassion; he would never extinguish the last spark of hope in humble and downtrodden people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Did You Know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Is it believable that in ancient times someone would actually oversow another man’s field with weeds?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">AT MATTHEW 13:24-26, Jesus is quoted as saying: “The Kingdom of the heavens may be likened to a man who sowed fine seed in his field. While men were sleeping, his enemy came and oversowed weeds in among the wheat and left. When the stalk sprouted and produced fruit, then the weeds also appeared.” Different writers have questioned whether this illustration should be considered real, yet ancient Roman legal writings suggest that it should.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Sowing darnel in a field for purposes of revenge . . . was a crime under Roman legislation. The necessity for a law on the subject suggests that the action was not infrequent,” says one Bible dictionary. Legal scholar Alastair Kerr explains that in 533 C.E., Roman Emperor Justinian published his </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Digest,</span><span class="font0"> a summary of Roman law and excerpts from jurists of the classical period of the law (about 100-250 C.E.). According to this work (</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Digest,</span><span class="font0"> 9.2.27.14), the jurist Ulpian referred to a case considered by the second-century Roman statesman Celsus. Weeds had been sown in another person’s field, and as a result, a crop was ruined. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Digest</span><span class="font0"> considers the legal remedies available to the owner, or tenant farmer, in order to obtain compensation from the perpetrator for the loss suffered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That such malicious mischief occurred within the Roman Empire in ancient times indicates that the situation Jesus described was true to life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 12:1-21) </span><span class="font0">At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples got hungry and started to pluck heads of grain and to eat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font0">At seeing this, the Pharisees said to him: “Look! Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font0">He said to them: “Have you not read what David did when he and the men with him were hungry? </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font0">How he entered into the house of God and they ate the loaves of presentation, something that it was not lawful for him or those with him to eat, but for the priests only? </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font0">Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbaths the priests in the temple violate the Sabbath and continue guiltless? </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font0">But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font0">However, if you had understood what this means, ‘I want mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless ones. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font0">For the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font0">After departing from that place, he went into their synagogue, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font0">and look ! there was a man with a withered hand! So they asked him, “Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath?” so that they might accuse him. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font0">He said to them: “If you have one sheep and that sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, is there a man among you who will not grab hold of it and lift it out? </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font0">How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do a fine thing on the Sabbath.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font0">Then he said to the man: “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and it was restored sound like the other hand. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font0">But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him to kill him. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font0">Having come to know this, Jesus departed from there. Many also followed him, and he cured them all, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font0">but he sternly ordered them not to make him known, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font0">in order to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, who said: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font0">“Look! My servant whom I chose, my beloved, whom I have approved! I will put my spirit upon him, and what justice is he will make clear to the nations. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font0">He will not quarrel nor cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the main streets. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>20</sup> </span><span class="font0">No bruised reed will he crush, and no smoldering wick will he extinguish, until he brings justice with success. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> </span><span class="font0">Indeed, in his name nations will hope.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font0"> Upon seeing the crowd, Jesus is moved with pity for the people, so he heals the sick among them and teaches them many things about God’s Kingdom. When it gets late, the disciples urge Jesus to dismiss the people so that they might go to nearby villages and buy some food for themselves. But Jesus tells his disciples: “You give them something to eat.” His words must seem puzzling to them, for the provisions at hand are meager at best—five loaves and two small fish.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 14:18, 19) </span><span class="font0">He said: “Bring them here to me.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font0">And he instructed the crowds to recline on the grass.

<p><span class="font2"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font0"> Moved by compassion, Jesus performs a mir-acle—the only miracle that is recorded by all four Gospel writers. (Mark 6:35-44; Luke 9:1017; John 6:1-13) Jesus has his disciples tell the crowd to recline on the green grass in groups of 50 and of 100. After saying a blessing, he begins breaking the bread and dividing up the fish. Then, rather than giving the food to the people directly, Jesus distributes it “to the disciples, the disciples in turn to the crowds.” Miraculously, there is more than enough for everyone to eat! Just think: Jesus has fed thousands through the hands of a few—his disciples.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 14:20, 21) </span><span class="font0">So they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the leftover fragments, 12 baskets full. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> </span><span class="font0">Now those eating were about 5,000 men, as well as women and young children.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 15:26) </span><span class="font0">In answer he said: “It is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to the little dogs.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">children . . . little dogs: </span><span class="font0">Since dogs were unclean according to the Mosaic Law, the Scriptures often use the term in a derogatory sense. (Le 11:27; Mt 7:6; Php 3:2; Re 22:15) However, in both Mark’s account (7:27) and Matthew’s account of Jesus’ conversation, the diminutive form of the term meaning “little dog” or “house dog” is used, softening the comparison. Perhaps this indicates that Jesus was suggesting an affectionate term for household pets in non-Jewish homes. By likening Israelites to “children” and non-Jews to “little dogs,” Jesus evidently wanted to indicate an order of priority. In a household that had both children and dogs, the children would be fed first.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 16:21, 22) </span><span class="font0">From that time forward, Jesus began explaining to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed, and on the third day be raised up. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>22</sup> </span><span class="font0">At this Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying: “Be kind to yourself, Lord; you will not have this happen to you at all.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font0">On another occasion, Jesus explained to his apostles that he must go to Jerusalem, where he would be persecuted by “the older men and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.” At this Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying: “Be kind to yourself, Lord; you will not have this destiny at all.” Clearly, Peter’s view had been blurred by sentimentality. Correction was in order. So Jesus said to him: “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you think, not God’s thoughts, but those of men.”—Matthew 16:21-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 16:23) </span><span class="font0">But turning his back, he said to Peter: “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you think, not God’s thoughts, but those of men.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Watchful—Satan Wants to Devour You!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font0">Satan can fool even zealous servants of Jehovah. For example, consider what happened when Jesus told his disciples that he was about to be killed. No doubt with good motive, the apostle Peter took him aside and said: “Be kind to yourself, Lord; you will not have this happen to you at all.” Jesus’ reply to Peter was firm: “Get behind me, Satan!” (Matt. 16:22, 23) Why did Jesus call Peter “Satan”? Because Jesus understood what was about to happen. The hour approached when he would die as a ransom sacrifice and prove the Devil a liar. At that critical juncture in human history, it was not a time for Jesus to “be kind” to himself. Relaxing his guard would have been precisely what Satan wanted him to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font0">As we near the end of this system of things, we too are living in critical times. Satan wants us to relax our guard, to “be kind” to ourselves by carving out a niche in this world, thus losing our sense of urgency. Do not let that happen to you! Instead, “keep on the watch.” (Matt. 24: 42) Never believe Satan’s deceptive propaganda that the end is far off—or that it is not coming at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Matthew 16:24) </span><span class="font0">Then Jesus said to his disciples: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and keep following me.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font0">What does following Jesus’ example in doing God’s will involve? Jesus said to his disciples: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and continually follow me.” (Matthew 16:24) Here he outlined three things that we must do. First, we “disown” ourselves. In other words, we say no to our selfish, imperfect inclinations and yes to God’s counsel and direction. Second, we ‘pick up our torture stake.’ In Jesus’ day a torture stake was a symbol of shame and suffering. As Christians, we accept our part in suffering for the sake of the good news. (2 Timothy 1:8) Although the world may ridicule or reproach us, like Christ we ‘despise shame,’ happy in the knowledge that we are pleasing God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">You are Peter, and on this rock: </span><span class="font0">The Greek word </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">pe'tros</span><span class="font0"> in the masculine gender means “a piece of rock; a stone.” Here it is used as a proper name (Peter), the Greek form of the name Jesus gave Simon. (Joh 1:42) The feminine form </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">pe'tra</span><span class="font0"> is rendered “rock,” and it may denote bedrock, a cliff, or a mass of rock. This Greek word also occurs at Mt 7:24, 25; 27:60; Lu 6:48; 8:6; Ro 9:33; 1Co 10:4; 1Pe 2:8. Peter evidently did not view himself as the rock on which Jesus would build his congregation, since he wrote at 1Pe 2:4-8 that Jesus was the long-foretold “foundation cornerstone,” chosen by God himself. Similarly, the apostle Paul referred to Jesus as the “foundation” and “the spiritual rock.” (1Co 3:11; 10:4) So Jesus was evidently using a play on words, saying in effect: ‘You, the one I called Peter, a Piece of Rock, have discerned the true identity of the Christ, “this rock,” the one who will serve as the foundation of the Christian congregation.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">congregation: </span><span class="font0">This is the first occurrence of the Greek term </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ek-kle-si'a.</span><span class="font0"> It comes from two Greek words, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ek,</span><span class="font0"> meaning “out,” and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ka-le'o, </span><span class="font0">meaning “to call.” It refers to a group of people summoned or called together for a particular purpose or activity. (See Glossary.) In this context, Jesus foretells the formation of the Christian congregation, made up of anointed Christians, who as “living stones” are being “built up into a spiritual house.” (1Pe 2:4, 5) This Greek term is frequently used in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sep-tuagint</span><span class="font0"> as an equivalent of the Hebrew term rendered “congregation,” which often refers to the entire nation of God’s people. (De 23:3; 31: 30) At Ac 7:38, the Israelites who were called out of Egypt are referred to as a “congregation.” Similarly, Christians who are “called . . . out of darkness” and “chosen . . . out of the world” make up “the congregation of God.”—1Pe 2:9; Joh 15:19; 1Co 1:2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">keys of the Kingdom of the heavens: </span><span class="font0">In the Bible, those who were given certain keys, whether literal or figurative, were entrusted with a degree of authority. (1Ch 9:26, 27; Isa 22:20-22) So the term “key” came to symbolize authority and responsibility. Peter used these “keys” entrusted to him to open up for Jews (Ac 2:2241), Samaritans (Ac 8:14-17), and Gentiles (Ac 10:34-38) the opportunity to receive God’s spirit with a view to their entering the heavenly Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a millstone that is turned by a donkey: </span><span class="font0">Or “a huge millstone.” Lit., “a millstone of a donkey.” Such a millstone, likely 1.2-1.5 m (4-5 ft) in diameter, was so heavy that it had to be turned by a donkey.</span></p>

By extension, it came to refer to any impediment that would cause one to stumble or fall. In a figurative sense, it refers to an action or circumstance that leads a person to fol low an improper course, to stumble or fall morally, or to fall into sin. At Mt 18:8, 9, the related verb </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">skan-da-li-zo,</span><span class="font0"> translated “make stumble,” could also be rendered “become a snare; cause to sin.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Millstones were used for grinding grain and pressing oil out of olives. Some were small enough to be turned by hand, but others were so huge that they had to be turned by an animal. It may have been a large millstone similar to this one that Samson was forced to turn for the Philistines. (Jg 16:21) The animal-powered mill was common not only in Israel but also throughout much of the Roman Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Upper and Lower Millstones</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A large millstone like the one depicted here would be turned by a domestic animal, such as a donkey, and be used to grind grain or crush olives. An upper millstone might be as much as 1.5 m (5 ft) in diameter and would be turned on an even larger lower stone.</span></p>

(See App. B12, map “Jerusalem and Surrounding Area.”) By Jesus’ day, the valley had become a place for burning refuse, so the word “Gehenna” was a fitting symbol of complete destruction.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Gehenna</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Greek name for the Valley of Hinnom, southwest of ancient Jerusalem. (Jer 7:31) It was prophetically spoken of as a place where dead bodies would be strewn. (Jer 7:32; 19:6) There is no evidence that animals or humans were thrown into Gehenna to be burned alive or tormented. So the place could not symbolize an invisible region where human souls are tormented eternally in literal fire. Rather, Gehenna was used by Jesus and his disciples to symbolize the eternal punishment of “second death,” that is, everlasting destruction, annihilation.—Re 20:14; Mt 5:22; 10:28.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">How Spirit Creatures Affect Us</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jesus revealed that angels are given the responsibility to look out for the spiritual welfare of God’s servants. Thus, when Jesus warned his disciples against stumbling others, he said: “See to it that you men do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that their angels in heaven always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.” (Matthew 18:10) By this, Jesus did not necessarily mean that each of his followers has a guardian angel assigned to him. But Jesus did show that angels who work closely with God have an active interest in members of the Christian congregation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">77 times: </span><span class="font0">Lit., “seventy times seven.” This Greek expression can be understood to mean either “70 and 7” (77 times) or “70 multiplied by 7” (490 times). The same wording found in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Septuagint</span><span class="font0"> at Ge 4:24 renders the Hebrew expression “77 times,” which supports the rendering “77 times.” Regardless of how it is understood, the repetition of the number seven was equivalent to “indefinitely” or “without limit.” By turning Peter’s 7 times into 77, Jesus was telling his followers not to set an arbitrary limit on forgiveness. In contrast, the Babylonian Talmud (</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yoma</span><span class="font0"> 86</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0">) says: “If a man commits a transgression the first, second and third time he is forgiven, the fourth time he is not forgiven.”</span></p>

The intent of the Law was evidently to prevent rash divorces and to provide women with a measure of legal protection. (De 24:1) But in Jesus’ day, religious leaders had made divorce easy to obtain. The first-century historian Josephus, himself a divorced Pharisee, suggested that divorce was allowable “for any cause whatsoever (and many such causes happen among men).”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Show Gratitude”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Luke 17:11-14) </span><span class="font0">While he was going to Jerusalem, he was passing between Sa^mar'ra and Gal</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font0">i-lee. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font0">And as he was entering a village, ten men with leprosy met him, but they stood at a distance. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font0">And they raised their voices and said: “Jesus, Instructor, have mercy on us!” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font0">When he saw them, he said to them: “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” Then as they were going off, they were cleansed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> study notes on Lu 17:12, 14</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ten men with leprosy: </span><span class="font4">In Bible times, lepers evidently congregated together or lived in groups, making it possible for them to help one another. (2Ki 7:3-5) God’s Law required that lepers live in isolation. A leper was also to warn others of his presence by calling out: “Unclean, unclean!” (Le 13:45, 46) In line with what the Law prescribed, the lepers </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">stood at a distance </span><span class="font4">from Jesus.—See study note on Mt 8:2 and Glossary, “Leprosy; Leper.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">show yourselves to the priests: </span><span class="font4">Jesus Christ, being under the Law while on earth, recognized the Aaronic priesthood as being in force, and he directed ones whom he cured of leprosy to go to the priest. (Mt 8:4; Mr 1:44) In accord with the Mosaic Law, a priest had to verify that a leper was healed. The cured leper then traveled to the temple and brought as an offering, or gift, two live clean birds, cedarwood, scarlet material, and hyssop.—Le 14:2-32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Luke 17:15, 16) </span><span class="font0">One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font0">And he fell facedown at Jesus’ feet, thanking him. Furthermore, he was a Sa^marTtan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Luke 17: 17, 18) </span><span class="font0">In reply Jesus said: “All ten were cleansed, were they not? Where, then, are the other nine? </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font0">Did no one else turn back to give glory to God except this man of another nation?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Show Appreciation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Did Jesus overlook the failure of the others to express gratitude? The account continues: “In reply Jesus said: ‘The ten were cleansed, were they not? Where, then, are the other nine? Were none found that turned back to give glory to God but this man of another nation?’”—Luke 17: 17, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The other nine lepers were not wicked men. Earlier, they had openly expressed faith in Jesus and willingly obeyed his instructions, which involved traveling to Jerusalem to show themselves to the priests. However, although they no doubt felt deep appreciation for Jesus’ kind act, they failed to express that appreciation to him. Their conduct disappointed Christ. What about us? When someone treats us well, are we quick to say thank you and, where appropriate, to show appreciation by sending a written note?</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Luke 17:7-10) </span><span class="font0">“Which one of you who has a slave plowing or shepherding would say to him when he comes in from the field, ‘Come here at once and dine at the table’? </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font0">Rather, will he not say to him, ‘Get something ready for me to have my evening meal, and put on an apron and serve me until I finish eating and drinking, and afterward you can eat and drink’? </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font0">He will not feel gratitude to the slave because he did what was assigned, will he? </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font0">Likewise, when you have done all the things assigned to you, say: ‘We are good-for-nothing slaves. What we have done is what we ought to have done.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> study note on Lu 17:10</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">good-for-nothing: </span><span class="font4">Lit., “useless; worthless.” The point of Jesus’ illustration is not that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">slaves, </span><span class="font4">his disciples, are to consider themselves useless or worthless. According to the context, “good-for-nothing” conveys the idea that the slaves would view themselves modestly, not as deserving special credit or praise. Some scholars consider the term as it is used here to be hyperbole meaning “we are merely slaves deserving no special attention.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Luke 18:8) </span><span class="font0">I tell you, he will cause justice to be done to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man arrives, will he really find this faith on the earth?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> study note on Lu 18:8</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">this faith: </span><span class="font4">Or “this kind of faith.” Lit., “the faith.” The use of the Greek definite article before the word “faith” indicates that Jesus was referring, not to faith in a general sense, but to a particular kind of faith, like that of the widow in Jesus’ illustration. (Lu 18:1-8) This would include having faith in the power of prayer as well as faith that God will cause justice to be done to his chosen ones. Jesus apparently left the question about faith unanswered so that his disciples would think about the quality of their own faith. The illustration about prayer and faith was particularly appropriate because Jesus had just been describing the tests his disciples would face.—Lu 17:22-37.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Bible Reading</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Luke 18:24-43) </span><span class="font0">Jesus looked at him and said: “How difficult it will be for those having money to make their way into the Kingdom of God! </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>25</sup> </span><span class="font0">It is easier, in fact, for a camel to get through the eye of a sewing needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>26</sup> </span><span class="font0">Those who heard this said: “Who possibly can be saved?” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>27</sup> </span><span class="font0">He said: “The things impossible with men are possible with God.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>28</sup> </span><span class="font0">But Peter said: “Look! We have left what was ours and followed you.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>29</sup> </span><span class="font0">He said to them: “Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the Kingdom of God </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>30</sup> </span><span class="font0">who will not get many times more in this period of time, and in the coming system of things, everlasting life.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>31</sup> </span><span class="font0">Then he took the Twelve aside and said to them: “Look! We are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things written by means of the prophets about the Son of man will be accomplished. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>32</sup> </span><span class="font0">For instance, he will be handed over to men of the nations and will be mocked and treated insolently and spat on. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>33</sup> </span><span class="font0">And after scourging him, they will kill him, but on the third day he will rise.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>34</sup> </span><span class="font0">However, they did not get the meaning of any of these things, for these words were hidden from them, and they did not understand the things said. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>35</sup> </span><span class="font0">Now as Jesus was getting near to JerTcho, a blind man was sitting beside the road begging. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>36</sup> </span><span class="font0">Because he heard a crowd passing by, he began to inquire what was going on. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>37</sup> </span><span class="font0">They reported to him: “Jesus the Naz^a&lt;ene</span><span class="font4">' </span><span class="font0">is passing by!” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>38</sup> </span><span class="font0">At that he cried out: “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>39</sup> </span><span class="font0">And those who were in front began rebuking him, telling him to keep quiet, but all the more he kept shouting: “Son of David, have mercy on me!” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>40</sup> </span><span class="font0">Then Jesus stopped and commanded that the man be brought to him. After he came near, Jesus asked him: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>41</sup> </span><span class="font0">“What do you want me to do for you?” He said: “Lord, let me recover my sight.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>42</sup> </span><span class="font0">So Jesus said to him: “Recover your sight; your faith has made you well.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>43</sup> </span><span class="font0">And instantly he recovered his sight, and he began to follow him, glorifying God. Also, at seeing it, all the people gave praise to God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Learn From the Illustration of the Ten Minas”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Luke 19:12, 13) </span><span class="font0">So he said: “A man of noble birth traveled to a distant land to secure kingly power for himself and to return. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font0">Calling ten of his slaves, he gave them ten mi</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font0">nas and told them, ‘Do business with these until I come.’</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">His Illustration of Ten Minas</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He says: “A man of noble birth traveled to a distant land to secure kingly power for himself and to return.” (Luke 19:12) Such a trip would take time. Clearly Jesus is the “man of noble birth” who travels to a “distant land,” to heaven, where his Father will give him kingly power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the illustration, before the “man of noble birth” departs, he calls ten slaves and gives each a silver mina, telling them: “Do business with these until I come.” (Luke 19:13) Literal silver minas are valuable pieces of money. A mina amounts to the wages that an agricultural worker earns in over three months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The disciples may discern that they are like the ten slaves in the illustration, for Jesus has already likened them to harvest workers. (Matthew 9:35-38) Of course, he has not asked them to bring in a harvest of grain. Rather, the harvest consists of other disciples who can find a place in the Kingdom of God. The disciples use what assets they have to produce more heirs of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Luke 19:16-19) </span><span class="font0">So the first one came forward and said, ‘Lord, your mi</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font0">na gained ten mi</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font0">nas.’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font0">He said to him, ‘Well done, good slave! Because in a very small matter you have proved yourself faithful, hold authority over ten cities.’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font0">Now the second came, saying, ‘Your mi</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font0">na, Lord, made five mi</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font0">nas.’</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font0">He said to this one as well, ‘You too be in charge of five cities.’</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">His Illustration of Ten Minas</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the disciples perceive that they are like the slaves who use their assets to the full to make more disciples, they can rest assured that Jesus will be pleased. And they can trust that he will reward such diligence. Of course, not all of Jesus’ disciples have the same circumstances in life nor the same opportunities or abilities. Yet Jesus, who receives “kingly power,” will recognize and bless their loyal efforts at disciple-making.—Matthew 28:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Luke 19:20-24) </span><span class="font0">But another one came, saying, ‘Lord, here is your mi</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font0">na that I kept hidden away in a cloth. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>21</sup> </span><span class="font0">You see, I was in fear of you, because you are a harsh man; you take what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow.’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>22</sup> </span><span class="font0">He said to him, ‘By your own words I judge you, wicked slave. You knew, did you, that I am a harsh man, taking what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow? </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>23</sup> </span><span class="font0">So why did you not put my money in a bank? Then on my coming, I would have collected it with interest.’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>24</sup> </span><span class="font0">“With that he said to those standing by, ‘Take the mi</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font0">na from him and give it to the one who has the ten mi</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font0">nas.’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">jy 233</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> fl 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">His Illustration of Ten Minas</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For failing to work to increase the wealth of his master’s kingdom, this slave experiences loss. The apostles are anticipating Jesus’ reigning in the Kingdom of God. So from what he says about this last slave, they likely perceive that if they are not diligent, they will not find a place in that Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Luke 19:43) </span><span class="font0">Because the days will come upon you when your enemies will build around you a fortification of pointed stakes and will encircle you and besiege you from every side. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> study note on Lu 19:43</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fortification of pointed stakes: </span><span class="font4">Or “palisade.” The Greek word </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">kha'rax</span><span class="font4"> occurs only here in the Christian Greek Scriptures. It has been defined as a “pointed stick or post used to fence in an area; stake” and also as a “military installation involving the use of stakes; palisade.” Jesus’ words came true in the year 70 C.E. when the Romans, commanded by Titus, erected a siege wall, or palisade, around Jerusalem. Titus’ objective was threefold—to prevent the Jews from fleeing, to encourage their surrender, and to starve the inhabitants into submission. To provide materials for the construction of this fortification around Jerusalem, Roman troops stripped the countryside of trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Luke 20:38) </span><span class="font0">He is a God, not of the dead, but of the living, for they are all living to him.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> study note on Lu 20:38</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for they are all living to him: </span><span class="font4">Or “for they are all living from his standpoint.” The Bible shows that those who are living but who are alienated from God are dead from his standpoint. (Eph 2:1; 1Ti 5:6) Likewise, approved servants of God who die are still living from Jehovah’s standpoint, since his purpose to resurrect them is sure of fulfillment.—Ro 4:16, 17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>9</sup> Celestial phenomena.</span><span class="font4"> Jesus foretells: “The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven.” Certainly the religious leaders will not be looked to for light—they will no longer be identified as such. Was Jesus also referring to a supernatural manifestation in the heavens? Perhaps he was. (Isa. 13:9-11; Joel 2:1, 30, 31) How will people react to what they observe? They will be in “anguish” because of “not knowing the way out.” (Luke 21:25; Zeph. 1:17) Yes, enemies of God’s Kingdom—from ‘kings to slaves’—will grow “faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming” and will run for cover.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nwtsty study notes on Lu 21:33</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Heaven and earth will pass away:</span><span class="font4"> Other scriptures show that heaven and earth will endure forever. (Ge 9:16; Ps 104:5; Ec 1:4) So Jesus’ words here could be understood as hyperbole, meaning that even if the impossible happened and heaven and earth </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">did</span><span class="font4"> pass away, Jesus’ words would still be fulfilled. (Compare Mt 5:18.) However, the heaven and earth here may well refer to the figurative heavens and earth that are called “the former heaven and the former earth” at Re 21:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">my words will by no means pass away:</span><span class="font4"> Or “my words will certainly not pass away.” The use of two Greek negatives with the verb emphatically expresses rejection of an idea, vividly emphasizing the permanence of Jesus’ words.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You Will Become “a Kingdom of Priests”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>15</sup></span><span class="font4"> After instituting the Lord’s Evening Meal, Jesus made a covenant with his faithful disciples, often referred to as the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kingdom covenant. (Read Luke 22:28-30.)</span><span class="font4"> Unlike other covenants, in which Jehovah is one of the parties to the covenant, this is a personal covenant between Jesus and his anointed followers. When saying, “just as my Father has made a covenant with me,” Jesus was apparently alluding to the covenant that Jehovah had made with him to be “a priest forever in the manner of Melchizedek.” —Heb. 5:5, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>16</sup></span><span class="font4"> The 11 faithful apostles had ‘stuck with Jesus in his trials.’ The Kingdom covenant assured them that they would be with him in heaven and sit on thrones to rule as kings and serve as priests. However, those 11 would not be the only ones to have that privilege. The glorified Jesus appeared to the apostle John in a vision and said: “To the one who conquers I will grant to sit down with me on my throne, just as I conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.” (Rev. 3:21) Thus, the Kingdom covenant is made with the 144,000 anointed Christians. (Rev. 5:9, 10; 7:4) This is the covenant that forms a legal basis for them to rule with Jesus in heaven. This is similar to a bride from a noble family who might marry a ruling king and come into position to share in his ruling power. In fact, the Scriptures refer to anointed Christians as “the bride” of Christ, “a chaste virgin” promised in marriage to the Christ.—Rev. 19: 7, 8; 21:9; 2 Cor. 11:2.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Luke 23:34) </span><span class="font0">But Jesus was saying: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” Furthermore, they cast lots to distribute his garments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“To Know the Love of the Christ”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>16</sup></span><span class="font4"> Jesus perfectly reflected his Father’s love in another important way—he was “ready to forgive.” (Psalm 86:5) This willingness was evident even when he was on the torture stake. Subjected to a shameful death, with nails piercing his hands and feet, what did Jesus speak about? Did he call out to Jehovah to punish his executioners? On the contrary, among Jesus’ last words were: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”—Luke 23:34.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Luke 23:43) </span><span class="font0">And he said to him: “Truly I tell you today, you will be with me in Paradise.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2/08 11 fl5-6</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Does God Forgive Serious Sins?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is not only the sin but also the attitude of the sinner that Jehovah notes. (Isaiah 1:16-19) Reflect for a moment on the two evildoers impaled alongside Jesus. Both had evidently committed serious crimes, for one of the men admitted: “We are receiving in full what we deserve for things we did; but this man [Jesus] did nothing out of the way.” The evildoer’s words indicate that he knew something about Jesus. And that knowledge likely contributed to a wholesome change in his attitude. This is indicated by what he said next, this time imploring Jesus: “Remember me when you get into your kingdom.” How did Christ respond to that heartfelt entreaty? “Truly I tell you today,” he said, “You will be with me in Paradise.”—Luke 23:41-43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Think about that: Jesus’ final statements as a human included an expression of mercy toward a man who had admitted to deserving the death penalty. How encouraging that is! We can be sure, then, that both Jesus Christ and his Father, Jehovah, will show compassion toward all who manifest true repentance, regardless of their past deeds.—Romans 4:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Luke 24:34) </span><span class="font0">who said: “For a fact the Lord was raised up, and he appeared to Simon!” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">cl</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 297-298 fl17-18</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“To Know the Love of the Christ”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>17</sup></span><span class="font4"> Perhaps an even more touching example of Jesus’ forgiveness can be seen in the way he dealt with the apostle Peter. There is no question that Peter dearly loved Jesus. On Nisan 14, the final night of Jesus’ life, Peter told him: “Lord, I am ready to go with you both into prison and into death.” Yet, just a few hours later, Peter three times denied even knowing Jesus! The Bible tells us what happened as Peter uttered his third denial: “The Lord turned and looked upon Peter.” Crushed by the weight of his sin, Peter “went outside and wept bitterly.” When Jesus died later that day, the apostle may well have wondered, ‘Did my Lord forgive me?’ —Luke 22:33, 61, 62.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>18</sup></span><span class="font4"> Peter did not have to wait long for an answer. Jesus was resurrected on the morning of Nisan 16, and evidently on that same day, he made a personal visit to Peter. (Luke 24:34; 1 Corinthians 15:4-8) Why did Jesus give such special attention to the apostle who had so vigorously denied Him? Jesus may have wanted to assure the repentant Peter that he was still loved and valued by his Lord. But Jesus did even more to reassure Peter.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">when the tree is moist, . . . when it is withered: </span><span class="font4">Jesus is apparently referring to the Jewish nation. It was like a dying tree that still had some moisture left, for Jesus was present and so were a number of Jews who believed in him. However, Jesus would soon be executed, and faithful Jews would be anointed with holy spirit and become part of spiritual Israel. (Ro 2:28, 29; Ga 6:16) At that time, the literal nation of Israel would be spiritually dead, resembling a withered tree.—Mt 21:43.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">This is a photograph of a replica of a human heel bone pierced by an iron nail that was 11.5 cm (4.5 in.) long. The original artifact was found in 1968, during excavations in northern Jerusalem, and dates to Roman times. It provides archaeological evidence that nails were likely used in executions to fasten the person to a wooden stake. This nail may be similar to the nails employed by the Roman soldiers to fasten Jesus Christ to the stake. The artifact was found in a stone box, called an ossuary, into which the dried bones of a deceased person were placed after the flesh had decomposed. This indicates that someone executed on a stake could be given a burial.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup></span><span class="font7"> The five sisters approached Moses and asked him: “Why should the name of our father be taken away from the midst of his family because he had no son?” They pleaded: “O give us a possession in the midst of our father’s brothers.” Did Moses react by saying, ‘There are no exceptions to the rule’? No, he “presented their case before Jehovah.” (Num. 27:2-5) What was the response? Jehovah told Moses: “The daughters of Ze-lophehad are speaking right. By all means you should give them the possession of an inheritance in the midst of their father’s brothers, and you must cause their father’s inheritance to pass to them.” Jehovah went further. He turned the exception into a rule, instructing Moses: “In case any man should die without his having a son, you must then cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.” (Num. 27:6-8; Josh. 17:1-6) From then on, all Israelite women who faced the same plight would be protected.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup></span><span class="font7"> What a kind and impartial decision that was! Jehovah treated these women, who were in a vulnerable position, with dignity, as he did Israelites who had more favorable circumstances. (Ps. 68:5) This is just one of many Bible accounts that illustrate this heartwarming truth: Jehovah treats all of his servants with impartiality.—1 Sam. 16:1-13; Acts 10:30-35, 44-48.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>16</sup></span><span class="font7"> How can we imitate Jehovah’s impartiality? Remember, impartiality has two aspects. Only if we </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">are</span><span class="font7"> impartial will we </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">treat</span><span class="font7"> others without partiality. True, all of us like to think of ourselves as being open-minded and impartial. You will likely agree, though, that it is not always easy to evaluate our own feelings objectively. So, what could we do to find out if we are known as being unbiased? Well, when Jesus was interested in knowing what people were saying about him, he asked his trusted friends: “Who are men saying the Son of man is?” (Matt. 16:13, 14) Why not follow Jesus in that? You could ask some friend whom you can count on for candor whether you have a reputation for being impartial. If he or she concedes that there seem to be some lingering traces of racial, social, or economic partiality, what should you do? Pray earnestly to Jehovah about your feelings, begging him to help you adjust your attitude so that it will reflect his impartiality to a fuller degree.—Matt. 7:7; Col. 3:10, 11.</span></p></li></ul>

(Nu 15:2, 5, 810) This consisted of wine (“intoxicating liquor”) and was poured out on the altar. (Nu 28:7, 14; compare Ex 30:9; Nu 15:10.) The apostle Paul wrote to the Christians at Philippi: “If I am being poured out like a drink offering upon the sacrifice and public service to which faith has led you, I am glad.” Here he used the figure of a drink offering, expressing his willingness to expend himself in behalf of fellow Christians. (Php 2:17) Shortly before his death, he wrote to Timothy: “I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the due time for my releasing is imminent.”—2Ti 4:6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Vow</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Voluntary, but Binding When Once Made. </span><span class="font7">Vows were wholly voluntary. However, once a man made a vow, fulfillment was compulsory by divine law. Thus a vow was spoken of as being ‘bound upon his soul,’ implying that his very life became surety for the performance of his word. (Nu 30:2; see also Ro 1:31, 32.) Since life is at stake, it is understandable why the Scriptures urge one to use extreme caution before making a vow, carefully considering the obligations to be assumed. The Law stated: “In case you vow a vow to Jehovah . . . God will without fail require it of you, and it would indeed become a sin on your part. But in case you omit making a vow, it will not become a sin on your part.”—De 23:21, 22.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Vow</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A solemn promise made to God to perform some act, make some offering or gift, enter some service or condition, or abstain from certain things not unlawful in themselves. A vow was a voluntary expression made of one’s own free will. Being a solemn promise, a vow carried the force of an oath or a swearing, and at times the two expressions accompany each other in the Bible. (Nu 30:2; Mt 5:33) “Vow” is more the declaration of intent, while “oath” denotes the appeal made to a higher authority attesting to the truthfulness or binding nature of the declaration. Oaths often accompanied attestation to a covenant.—Ge 26:28; 31: 44, 53.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Highlights From the Book of Numbers 30:6-8—Can a Christian man set aside his wife’s vows?</span><span class="font7"> With regard to vows, Jehovah now deals with his worshipers individually. For example, dedication to Jehovah is a personal vow. (Galatians 6:5) A husband does not have the authority to set aside or cancel such a vow. A wife, though, should avoid making a vow that conflicts with God’s Word or her duties toward her husband.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Persons could be devoted to Jehovah’s exclusive service in connection with the sanctuary. It was a right that parents could exercise. Samuel was one such person, promised to tabernacle service by a vow of his mother Hannah before his birth. This vow was approved by her husband Elkanah. As soon as Samuel was weaned, Hannah offered him at the sanctuary. Along with him, Hannah brought an animal sacrifice. (1Sa 1: 11, 22-28; 2:11) Samson was another child specially devoted to God’s service as a Naz-irite.—Jg 13:2-5, 11-14; compare the father’s authority over a daughter as outlined in Nu 30:3-5, 16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">What were the “high places” frequently mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the Israelites were about to enter the Promised Land, Jehovah told them to eliminate all the places of worship of the Canaanites who lived there. “You must . . . destroy all their stone figures, and all their images of molten metal you should destroy, and all their sacred high places you should annihilate,” God commanded. (Numbers 33: 52) Those centers of false worship may have been either open-air hilltop sites or constructed platforms in other locations, such as under trees or in cities. (1 Kings 14:23; 2 Kings 17:29; Ezekiel 6:3) They could be equipped with altars, sacred pillars or poles, images, incense stands, and other paraphernalia for worship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Learn From the Errors of the Israelites</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Today, we face many challenges that are similar to those faced by the Israelites. Modern-day society has its share of idols. They include money, entertainment personalities, sports figures, political systems, certain religious leaders, and even family members. Any of these could potentially become our focus in life. Cultivating close friendships with those who do not love Jehovah can lead us to spiritual ruin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Illicit sex was an integral part of Baal worship that attracted and sed uced many Israelites. Similar snares still claim victims among God’s people. For example, the click of a mouse at a computer in the privacy of one’s own home may be all that a curious or unwary person needs to ruin his good conscience. How sad it would be if a Christian were to be enticed by Internet pornography!</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Canaan</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Joshua wisely “did not remove a word from all that Jehovah had commanded Moses” as to the destruction of the Canaanites. (Jos 11:15) But the Israelite nation failed to follow up his good lead and completely eliminate the source of pollution of the land. The continued presence of the Canaanites among them brought infection into Israel that, in the course of time, undoubtedly contributed toward more deaths (not to mention crime, immorality, and idolatry) than the decreed extermination of all the Canaanites would have produced had it been faithfully effected. (Nu 33:55, 56; Jg 2:1-3, 11-23; Ps 106:34-43) Jehovah had warned the Israelites that his justice and his judgments would not be partial and that for the Israelites to enter into relations with the Canaanites, intermarry with them, practice interfaith, and adopt their religious customs and degenerate practices would mean their inevitably bringing down upon themselves the same decree of annihilation and would result in their also being ‘vomited out of the land.’ —Ex 23:32, 33; 34:12-17; Le 18:26-30; De 7: 2-5, 25, 26.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">After the casting of the lot had determined the geographic location of a tribe, it would then be necessary to determine the extent of its territory on the basis of the second factor: its proportionate size. “You must apportion the land to yourselves as a possession by lot according to your families. To the populous one you should increase his inheritance, and to the sparse one you should reduce his inheritance. To where the lot will come out for him, there it will become his.” (Nu 33:54) The decision of the lot as to the basic geographic location would stand, but adjustment could be made as to the size of the inheritance. Thus, when Judah’s territory was found to be too large, its land area was reduced by assigning portions of it to the tribe of Simeon.—Jos 19:9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font7">How, though, did the Israelites handle cases of accidental bloodshed? Although his deed was accidental, an unintentional manslayer was still guilty of shedding innocent blood. (Gen. 9:5) Mercifully, however, he was allowed to flee from the avenger of blood to one of the six cities of refuge. There, he could find protection. The unintentional manslayer had to remain in the city of refuge until the high priest’s death.—Num. 35:15, 28.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font7">After he accidentally killed someone, a fugitive first had to “present his case in the hearing of the elders” at the gate of the city of refuge to which he had fled. He was to be received hospitably. (Josh. 20:4) Some time later, he was sent back to the elders of the city where the killing had occurred, and those elders judged the case. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">(Read Numbers 35:24, 25.) </span><span class="font7">Only after they had declared the killing accidental would the fugitive be returned to the city of refuge.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font7">Once inside a city of refuge, the fugitive was safe. Regarding those cities, Jehovah said: “They will serve as a refuge for you.” (Josh. 20:2, 3) Jehovah did not require the manslayer to be judged again for the same case; nor was the avenger of blood permitted to enter the city and take the fugitive’s life. The fugitive thus never had to fear reprisal. While in the city, he was safe and secure under Jehovah’s protection. This was not a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">prison</span><span class="font7"> of refuge. The city offered him an opportunity to work, to help others, and to serve Jehovah in peace. Yes, a happy and fulfilling life was possible!</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">A Corresponding Ransom for All</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font7">Neither Adam nor Eve, however, benefit from the ransom. The Mosaic Law contained this principle: “You must take no ransom for the soul of a murderer who is deserving to die.” (Numbers 35:31) Adam was not deceived, so his sin was willful, deliberate. (1 Timothy 2:14) It amounted to the murder of his offspring, for they now inherited his imperfection, thus coming under sentence of death. Clearly, Adam deserved to die, for as a perfect man, he had willfully chosen to disobey God’s law. It would have been contrary to Jehovah’s righteous principles for him to apply the ransom in Adam’s behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Paying the wage for Adam’s sin, however, does provide for the nullifying of the death sentence upon Adam’s offspring! (Romans 5: 16) In a legal sense, the destructive power of sin is cut off right at its source. The ransomer ‘tastes death for every man,’ bearing the consequences of sin for all of Adam’s children.—Hebrews 2:9; 2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 Peter 2:24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Appointed congregation elders are obliged to judge in cases of serious wrongdoing. (1 Corinthians 5:12, 13) When doing so, they remember that God’s justice seeks to extend mercy where possible. If there is no basis for it—as in the case of unrepentant sinners—mercy cannot be extended. But the elders do not expel such a wrongdoer from the congregation out of vindictiveness. They hope that the disfellowshipping action itself will bring him to his senses. (Compare Ezekiel 18:23.) Under Christ’s headship, the elders serve in the interests of justice, and this includes being like “a hiding place from the wind.” (Isaiah 32:1, 2) They must therefore show impartiality and reasonableness. —Deuteronomy 1:16, 17.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font7"> There was more to being a judge than knowing the Law, however. Being imperfect, the older men had to be alert to curb any of their own wayward tendencies—such as selfishness, partiality, and greed—that might pervert their judgment. Moses told them: “You must not be partial in judgment. You should hear the little one the same as the great one. You must not become frightened because of a man, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">for the judgment belongs to God.”</span><span class="font7"> Yes, Israel’s judges were judging for God.

Still, he repeatedly demonstrated that they could trust in him and his instructions. Using a pillar of cloud by day and one of fire by night, Jehovah reminded the Israelites that he was backing them as he led them across that inhospitable terrain. (Deut. 1: 19; Ex. 40:36-38) He also provided for their basic needs. “Their very garments did not wear out, and their feet themselves did not become swollen.” Indeed, “they lacked noth-ing.”—Neh. 9:19-21.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Understanding</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Diligence in studying and applying God’s Word and commands can enable a person to have greater insight than those set as his teachers and more understanding than those who are older men. (Ps 119:99, 100, 130; compare Lu 2:46, 47.) This is because wisdom and understanding are, in effect, built into God’s pure regulations and judicial decrees; hence Israel’s faithful observance of these would cause surrounding nations to view them as “a wise and understanding people.” (De 4:5-8; Ps 111:7, 8, 10; compare 1Ki 2:3.) The understanding person recognizes the inviolability of God’s Word, wants to see his own course in relation thereto, and petitions God’s aid in this. (Ps 119:169) He lets God’s message sink down deep (Mt 13:19-23), writes it on the tablet of his heart (Pr 3:3-6; 7:1-4), and comes to develop a hatred for “every false path” (Ps 119:104). God’s Son, when on earth, showed understanding in this way, even refusing to seek escape from death on the stake because the fulfillment of the Scriptures called for his dying in that manner.—Mt 26:51-54.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Astounded at what she heard and saw, the queen humbly replied: “Happy are these servants of yours who are standing before you constantly, listening to your wisdom!” (1 Kings 10:4-8) She did not pronounce Solomon’s servants happy because they were surrounded by opulence—although they were. Rather, Solomon’s servants were blessed because they could constantly listen to Solomon’s God-given wisdom. What a fine example the queen of Sheba is for Jehovah’s people today, who bask in the wisdom of the Creator himself and that of his Son, Jesus Christ!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Also noteworthy was the queen’s next comment to Solomon: “May Jehovah your God come to be blessed.” (1 Kings 10:9) Evidently, she saw Jehovah’s hand in Solomon’s wisdom and prosperity. This accords with what Jehovah earlier promised to Israel. ‘Keeping my regulations,’ he said, “is wisdom on your part and understanding on your part before the eyes of the peoples who will hear of all these regulations, and they will certainly say, ‘This great nation is undoubtedly a wise and understanding people.’”—Deu-teronomy 4:5-7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>13</sup></span><span class="font7"> When Jehovah bestows blessings on his people, he always g ives them the best. (James 1:17) For example, when Jehovah gave the Israelites a home, it was “a land flowing with milk and honey.” Although the land of Egypt had also been described that way, the land that Jehovah gave the Israelites was different in at least one vital respect. It was “a land that Jehovah your God is caring for,” Moses told the Israelites. In other words, they would prosper because Jehovah would be looking after them. As long as the Israelites remained faithful to Jehovah, they were richly blessed by him and enjoyed a way of life that was visibly superior to that of all the nations round about. Yes, it is Jehovah’s blessing that “makes rich”!—Numbers 16:13; Deuteronomy 4:5-8; 11:8-15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font7">On this subject, perhaps no passage of Scripture is quoted more often than Deuteronomy 6:5-7. Please open your Bible and read those verses. Note that parents are first told to cultivate their own spirituality, building love for Jehovah and taking his words to heart. Yes, you need to be a serious student of God’s Word, reading the Bible regularly and meditating on it so that you develop a real understanding of and love for Jehovah’s ways, principles, and laws. As a result, your heart will be full of fascinating Bible truths that will move you to feel joy, awe, and love for Jehovah. You will have an abundance of good things to impart to your children.—Luke 6:45.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">How Can I Help My Children Become Truly Educated?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Your dreams, ideals, values, and interests manifest themselves not only in what you say but also in what you do. (Romans 2:21, 22) From infancy, children learn by carefully observing their parents. Children perceive what is important to their parents, and these are the things that often become important to young ones. If you truly love Jehovah, your children will discern that. For instance, they will see that Bible reading and study are important to you. They will come to realize that you put Kingdom interests first in life. (Matthew 6:33) Your regular presence at Christian meetings and participation in the Kingdom-preaching work will show them that rendering sacred service to Jehovah is of utmost importance to you.—Matthew 28:19, 20; Hebrews 10:24, 25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Parents, Provide for the Needs of Your Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font7">As Deuteronomy 6:7 shows, there are many occasions when you parents can discuss spiritual things with your children. Whether traveling together, doing chores together, or relaxing together, you may find opportunities to provide for your children’s spiritual needs. Of course, you need not incessantly “lecture” your children about Bible truths. Rather, try to keep family conversation on an upbuilding, spiritual level. For example, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazine contains many articles on a wide variety of subjects. Such articles may pave the way for conversations about Jehovah’s animal creation, places of natural beauty around the world, and the wonderful variety among human cultures and ways of life. Such conversations may move young ones to read more of the literature provided by the faithful and discreet slave class.—Matthew 24:45-47.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Why Did God Require That His Worshippers Marry Only Fellow Believers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the broad scale, Jehovah knew that Satan wanted to corrupt His people by turning them to the worship of false gods. God thus went on to warn that the unbelievers “will turn your son from following me, and they will certainly serve other gods.” A lot was at stake here. If the nation of Israel fell to serving other gods, they would lose God’s favor and protection, becoming easy prey to their enemies. How, then, could the nation produce the promised Messiah? Clearly, Satan had reason to lure the Israelites into marrying unbelievers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Marry “Only in the Lord”—Still Realistic?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Still, Jehovah has set out in his Word the direction to marry only in the Lord. Why? Because he knows what is good for his people. Not only does he want to safeguard his servants from the pain resulting from pursuing an unwise course but he also wants them to be happy. In Nehemiah’s day when many Jews were marrying foreigners who did not worship Jehovah, Nehemiah referred to the bad example of Solomon. Although Solomon “was loved by his God, . . . the foreign wives caused even him to sin.” (Neh. 13:23-26) So for the good of his servants, God has directed us to marry only true worshippers. (Ps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">19:7-10; Isa. 48:17, 18) True Christians are grateful for God’s loving care and rely on his direction. By thus submitting themselves to him as Ruler, they recognize him as the Universal Sovereign.—Prov. 1:5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Watch Your Associations in These Last Days</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> </span><span class="font7">Watching their associations is particularly important for single Christians who want to get married. God’s Word clearly counsels: “Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers. For what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what sharing does light have with darkness?” (2 Cor. 6:14) The Bible counsels God’s servants who are seeking a marriage mate to marry “only in the Lord,” that is, to marry only a dedicated, baptized worshipper of Jehovah who lives according to Scriptural teachings. (1 Cor. 7: 39) By marrying fellow believers, Christians gain companions who are dedicated to Jehovah and will help them maintain their integrity to him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah Provides Our Daily Needs</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font7"> Our prayer for daily bread should also remind us of our need for daily spiritual food. Although very hungry after a long fast, Jesus resisted Satan’s temptation to turn stones into bread, saying: “It is written, ‘Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.’ ” (Matthew 4:4) Jesus here quoted the prophet Moses, who told the Israelites: “[Jehovah] humbled you and let you go hungry and fed you with the manna, which neither you had known nor your fathers had known; in order to make you know that not by bread alone does man live but by every expression of Jehovah’s mouth does man live.” (Deuteronomy 8:3) The way in which Jehovah supplied the manna provided the Israelites not only with physical food but also with spiritual lessons. For one thing, they were to “pick up each his amount day for day.” If they gathered more than enough for the day, the remainder began to smell and breed worms. (Exodus 16:4, 20) Yet, this did not occur on the sixth day when they had to gather double the daily amount to cover their needs for the Sabbath. (Exodus 16:5, 23, 24) So the manna impressed upon their minds that they had to be obedient and that their lives depended not just on bread but on “every expression of Jehovah’s mouth.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">What Does Jehovah Ask of Us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What could motivate us to obey God willingly? Moses mentions one factor, saying: “Fear Jehovah your God.” (Verse 12) This is not a morbid dread of bad consequences but, rather, a healthy, reverential regard for God and his ways. If we are filled with a profound awe of God, we will want to avoid displeasing him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What, though, should be our primary motive for obeying God? Moses states: “Love him [Jehovah] and . . . serve Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul.” (Verse 12) Love of God involves more than feelings. One reference work explains: “Hebrew verbs for feelings sometimes refer as well to the actions that result from them.” This same work says that to love God means “to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">act</span><span class="font7"> lovingly” toward him. In other words, if we truly love God, we will act in ways that we know are pleasing to him.—Proverbs 27:11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">What Does Jehovah Ask of Us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our willing obedience will bring blessings. Moses writes: “Keep the commandments . . . that I am commanding you today, for your good.” (Verse 13) Yes, every commandment of Jehovah—everything that he asks of us— is for our good. How could it be otherwise? “God is love,” the Bible says. (1 John 4:8) Hence, he has given only such commands as would further our lasting welfare. (Isaiah 48: 17) Doing all that Jehovah asks of us will spare us many frustrations now and lead to endless future blessings under his Kingdom rule.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Can You Really “Draw Close to God”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font7">Abraham of old was one who enjoyed such closeness. Jehovah identified that patriarch as “my friend.” (Isaiah 41:8) Yes, Jehovah considered Abraham to be a personal friend. Abraham was granted that close relationship because he “put faith in Jehovah.” (James 2:23) Today, too, Jehovah looks for opportunities to “get attached” to those who serve him out of love. (Deuteronomy 10:15) His Word urges: “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you.” (James 4:8) In these words we find both an invitation and a promise.</span></p>

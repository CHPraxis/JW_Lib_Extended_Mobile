<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Amos 5:4) </span><span class="font1">“For this is what Jehovah says to the house of Israel: ‘Search for me and keep living. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Amos 5:6) </span><span class="font1">Search for Jehovah, and keep living, So that he does not burst out like a fire on the house of Joseph, Consuming Beth</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font1">el, with no one to extinguish it.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>20</sup></span><span class="font0"> It must not have been easy for anyone living in Israel in those days to remain faithful to Jehovah. It is difficult to swim against the current, so to speak, as Christians today, young and old, well know. Yet, love for God and a desire to please him did motivate some Israelites to practice true worship. Jehovah extended to them the warm invitation recorded at Amos 5:4: “Search for me, and keep living.” Today, God similarly shows mercy to those who repent and search for him by taking in accurate knowledge of his Word and then doing his will. It is not easy to pursue this course, but doing so leads to everlasting life.—John 17:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Amos 5:14, 15) </span><span class="font1">Search for what is good, and not what is bad, So that you may keep living. Then Jehovah the God of armies may be with you, Just as you say he is. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> </span><span class="font1">Hate what is bad, and love what is good, Let justice prevail in the city gate. It may be that Jehovah the God of armies Will show favor to the remaining ones of Joseph.’</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Serve Jehovah According to His High Standards</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>16</sup></span><span class="font0"> The first man, Adam, made a foolish choice as to whose standards of good and bad were best. Will we choose more wisely? Amos admonished us to have strong feelings about this, urging: “Hate what is bad, and love what is good.” (Amos 5:15) William Rainey Harper, late professor of Semitic languages and literatures at the University of Chicago, noted about this verse: “The standard of good and evil, in [Amos’] mind, is conformity with Yahweh’s will.” This is a central concept that we can learn from the 12 prophets. Are we willing to accept Jehovah’s standards of good and bad? Those high standards are revealed to us in the Bible and explained by mature, experienced Christians who make up “the faithful and discreet slave.”—Matthew 24:45-47.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>17</sup></span><span class="font0"> Our hating what is bad helps us to refrain from things that displease God. For example, a man may be aware of the dangers of Internet pornography and try to turn away from viewing it. Yet, how does ‘the man he is inside’ feel about the content of pornographic Web sites? (Ephesians 3:16) By applying the divine exhortation found at Amos 5:15, he will find it easier to cultivate hatred for what is bad. He may thus be victorious in his spiritual struggle.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">8:1, 2—What did “a basket of summer fruit” signify?</span><span class="font0"> It signified that the day of Jehovah was near. Summer fruit is picked toward the end of the harvest season, that is, toward the end of the agricultural year. When Jehovah caused Amos to see “a basket of summer fruit,” it meant that the end was near for Israel. Therefore, God told Amos: “The end has come to my people Israel. I shall no more do any further excusing of them.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup></span><span class="font0"> What about Jonah? Did he learn to show his gratitude to Jehovah through obedience? He did. After three days and three nights, the fish brought Jonah right to the shore and “vomited out Jonah onto the dry land.” (Jonah 2:10) Imagine—after all that, Jonah did not even have to swim ashore! Of course, he did have to find his way from that beach, wherever it was. Before long, though, his spirit of gratitude was put to the test. Jonah 3:1, 2, says: “Then the word of Jehovah occurred to Jonah the second time, saying: ‘Get up, go to Nineveh the great city, and proclaim to her the proclamation that I am speaking to you.’ ” What would Jonah do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup></span><span class="font0"> Jonah did not hesitate. We read: “At that, Jonah got up and went to Nineveh in accord with the word of Jehovah.” (Jonah 3:3) Yes, he obeyed. Clearly, he had learned from his mistakes. In this too we need to imitate Jonah’s faith. We all sin; we all make mistakes. (Rom. 3:23) But do we give up, or do we learn from our mistakes and turn to a course of obedient service to God?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">10—How was Edom “cut off to time indefinite”? </span><span class="font0">As foretold, the nation of Edom, with a government and people in a specific region of the earth, became extinct. Babylonian King Nabonidus conquered Edom about the middle of the sixth century B.C.E. By the fourth century B.C.E., Edom’s territory was inhabited by the Nabataeans, and the Edomites had to take up residence in the southern part of Judea, the area of the Negeb that later came to be known as Idumea. After the Romans destroyed Jerusalem in 70 C.E., the Edomites ceased to exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Obadiah 12) </span><span class="font1">You should not gloat over your brother’s day on the day of his misfortune, You should not rejoice over the people of Judah on the day of their perishing, And you should not speak so arrogantly on the day of their distress. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">jd 112</span><span class="font6"> fl</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">4-5</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dealing With Others as God Desires</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font0"> You can find a lesson in God’s condemnation of Edom, a land near Israel: “You ought not to watch the sight in the day of your brother, in the day of his misfortune; and you ought not to rejoice at the sons of Judah in the day of their perishing.” (Obadiah 12) The Tyrians may have been “brothers” as to commercial activities, but the Edomites were in a real sense “brothers” to Israel, for they had descended from Esau, Jacob’s twin. Even Jehovah called the Edomites Israel’s “brothers.” (Deuteronomy 2:1-4) Hence, it was truly hateful of the Edomites to rejoice when the Jews met calamity at the hands of the Babylonians.—Ezekiel 25:12-14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font0"> Clearly, God did not approve of how the Edomites dealt with their Jewish brothers. We might ask, though, ‘How would God evaluate the way I deal with my brothers?’ One area of concern is how we view and treat a brother when things have not gone smoothly. For example, imagine that a Christian offended you or had a problem with one of your relatives. If you have “a cause for complaint,” will you harbor resentment, not putting the matter behind you or not attempting to settle it? (Colossians 3:13; Joshua 22:9-30; Matthew 5:23, 24) Doing so could affect your actions toward the brother; you might act coolly, avoiding his company or speaking negatively about him. Extending the example, imagine that this brother later erred, perhaps even needing counsel or correction from the congregation elders. (Galatians 6:1) Would you reflect the Edomites’ spirit and rejoice over the brother’s difficulty? How would God want you to act?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> </span><span class="font0">From God’s standpoint, our relationship with our brothers is an important part of true worship. Animal sacrifices were meaningless to Jehovah if those offering them did not treat their fellow man properly. (Mic. 6:6-8) Hence, Jesus urged his disciples to “be about settling matters quickly.” (Matt. 5:25) Along similar lines, Paul wrote: “Be wrathful, and yet do not sin; let the sun not set with you in a provoked state, neither allow place for the Devil.” (Eph. 4:26, 27) If we do become justifiably angry, we should act to settle matters quickly so that we do not remain in a provoked state and thus allow the Devil to take advantage of us.—Luke 17:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Micah 6:8) </span><span class="font1">He has told you, O man, what is good. And what is Jehovah requiring of you? Only to exercise justice, to cherish loyalty, And to walk in modesty with your God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w12</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 11/1 22 </span><span class="font6">fl</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">4-7</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“What Is Jehovah Asking Back From You?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Exercise justice.”</span><span class="font0"> The Hebrew word for “justice,” according to one reference work, “involves right and fair relationships in the community.” God asks us to treat others according to what is right and fair by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font0"> standards. We exercise justice by being impartial, upright, and honest in our dealings with others. (Leviticus 19:15; Isaiah 1:17; Hebrews 13:18) When we act justly toward others, they may be moved to act justly toward us in return.—Matthew 7:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“To love kindness.”</span><span class="font0"> God asks us not merely to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">show </span><span class="font0">kindness but to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font0"> it. The Hebrew word rendered “kindness” (</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">che'sedh</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">)</span><span class="font0"> may also be rendered “loving-kindness” or “loyal love.” Says one Bible scholar: “Love, mercy, and kindness are inadequate translations of [</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">che'sedh</span><span class="font0">]; it is no one of these virtues, but all of them together.” If we love kindness, we show it willingly; we find pleasure in helping those in need. As a result, we experience the happiness that comes from giving.—Acts 20:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“To be modest in walking with your God.”</span><span class="font0"> In the Bible, the phrase “to walk” means “to follow a certain course of action.” We walk with God by following the life course he has outlined in the Bible. We need “to be modest” in pursuing such a course. How so? When we are modest before God, we realistically evaluate our position before him and recognize our limitations. Therefore, “to walk modestly with” means to have a realistic view of what he requires and of what we can give.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thankfully, Jehovah never requires more than we can give. He is pleased with our best efforts to serve him. (Colossians 3:23) He understands our limitations. (Psalm 103:14) When we, with due modesty, learn to accept them as well, we can find joy in walking with him. Why not learn how you can begin walking with God? Such a course brings rich blessings from him.—Proverbs 10:22.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">2: 12—When was the prophecy about ‘collecting the remaining ones of Israel’ fulfilled? </span><span class="font0">Its first fulfillment was in 537 B.C.E. when a Jewish remnant returned to their homeland from Babylonian exile. In modern times, the prophecy finds its fulfillment in “the Israel of God.” (Galatians 6:16) Since 1919, anointed Christians have been collected together “like a flock in the pen.” Being joined by the “great crowd” of “other sheep,” especially since 1935, they have become “noisy with men.” (Revelation 7:9; John 10:16) Together, they zealously promote true worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Micah 7:7) </span><span class="font1">But as for me, I will keep on the lookout for Jehovah. I will show a waiting attitude for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w03</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> 8/15 24 </span><span class="font6">fl</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">20</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">What Does Jehovah Expect of Us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> </span><span class="font0">Experiencing Jehovah’s blessing moves us to imitate Micah’s spirit. He declares: “I will show a waiting attitude for the God of my salvation.” (Micah 7:7) How do these words relate to our walking modestly with God? Having a waiting attitude, or patience, helps us to avoid feeling disappointed that Jehovah’s day has not yet come. (Proverbs 13:12) Frankly, we all long for the end of this wicked world. However, every week thousands of people are just beginning to walk with God. Knowing that gives us a reason for showing a waiting attitude. One longtime Witness said in this connection: “Looking back over 55 years in the preaching work, I am convinced that I have not lost anything by waiting on Jehovah. On the contrary, I have been spared many heartaches.” Have you had a similar experience?</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">2:6—What “gates of the rivers” were opened? </span><span class="font0">These gates referred to the opening made in the walls of Nineveh by the waters of the Tigris River. In 632 B.C.E. when the joint forces of the Babylonians and the Medes came up against Nineveh, she did not feel particularly threatened. Secure behind her high walls, she considered herself to be an impenetrable city. However, heavy rains caused the Tigris to overflow. According to historian Diodorus, this “both inundated a portion of the city and broke down the walls for a distance.” The river gates were thus opened, and as foretold, Nineveh was taken as quickly as fire devours dry stubble.—Nahum 1:8-10.</span></p>

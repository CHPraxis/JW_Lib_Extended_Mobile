<p><span class="font5">In 612 B.C.E., a vision transports Ezekiel to Jerusalem. What detestable things he sees happening in God’s temple! When Jehovah sends his heavenly executional forces (represented by “six men”) to express his anger at the apostates, only those who have received ‘a mark on the forehead’ will be spared. (Ezekiel 9:2-6) First, though, “coals of fire”—God’s fiery message of destruction—must be tossed over the city. (Ezekiel 10:2) While ‘Jehovah will bring upon the head of the wicked their own way,’ he promises to regather the scattered ones of Israel.—Ezekiel 11:17-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ezekiel 11:19) </span><span class="font0">And I will give them a unified heart, and I will put a new spirit in them; and I will remove the heart of stone from their bodies and give them a heart of flesh,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">How Do You Make Personal Decisions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font5">If we are to make wise decisions, as Jesus did, we must rely on Jehovah for guidance. We need to act in accord with these wise words: “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding. In all your ways take notice of him, and he will make your paths straight. Do not become wise in your own eyes. Fear Jehovah and turn away from bad.” (Prov. 3:5-7) Getting to know Jehovah’s thinking through Bible study can help us to perceive what God would want us to do in a particular situation. The more familiar we are with Jehovah’s thoughts, the more our heart will become sensitive to his guidance.—Ezek. 11:19, ftn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ezekiel 11:20) </span><span class="font0">in order that they may walk in my statutes and observe my judgments and obey them. Then they will be my people, and I will be their God.”’</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ezekiel 12:26-28) </span><span class="font0">The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>27</sup> </span><span class="font0">“Son of man, this is what the people of Israel are saying, ‘The vision that he sees is for a long time from now, and he is prophesying about the distant future.’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>28</sup> </span><span class="font0">Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “‘None of my words will be delayed; whatever I say will be done,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”’”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">12:26-28. </span><span class="font5">Even to those scoffing at his message, Ezekiel was to say: “There will be no postponement anymore as to any words of [Jehovah].” We must do all we can to help others put their confidence in Jehovah before he brings an end to this system of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ezekiel 14:13, 14) </span><span class="font0">“Son of man, if a land sins against me by acting unfaithfully, I will stretch out my hand against it and destroy its food supply, and I will send famine upon it and cut off man and animal from it.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font0">“‘Even if these three men—Noah, Daniel, and Job—were within it, they would be able to save only themselves because of their righteousness,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Benefit Fully From Jehovah’s Provisions</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>13</sup> </span><span class="font5">For example, consider Ezekiel 14:13, 14, where we read: “If a land sins against me by acting unfaithfully, I will stretch out my hand against it and destroy its food supply, and I will send famine upon it and cut off man and animal from it. ‘Even if these three men—Noah, Daniel, and Job—were within it, they would be able to save only themselves because of their righteousness,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.” By doing some research, we learn that this portion of Ezekiel was written in about the year 612 B.C.E. By that time, Noah and Job had been dead for centuries, and their record of faithfulness was in God’s memory. But Daniel was still alive. In fact, he may have been in his late teens or early 20’s when Jehovah said that he was just as righteous as Noah and Job. The lesson?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah notices and values the integrity of all his faithful worshippers, including those who are relatively young.—Ps. 148:12-14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible Reading</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ezekiel 12:1-10) </span><span class="font0">The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font0">“Son of man, you are living in a rebellious house. They have eyes to see, but they do not see, and ears to hear, but they do not hear, for they are a rebellious house. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font0">As for you, son of man, prepare for yourself luggage for going into exile. Then, during the day while they are watching, you must go into exile. Go into exile from your home to another place while they are watching. Perhaps they will take notice, even though they are a rebellious house. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4 </sup></span><span class="font0">Bring out your luggage packed for going into exile during the day while they are watching, and then in the evening while they are watching, you should leave like someone being taken into exile. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font0">“While they are watching, bore a hole in the wall, and carry your belongings out through it. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6 </sup></span><span class="font0">While they are watching, put your belongings on your shoulder and carry them out in the darkness. Cover your face so that you cannot see the ground, for I am making you a sign to the house of Israel.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font0">I did just as I was commanded. During the day I brought out my luggage as luggage for going into exile, and in the evening I bored a hole through the wall by hand. And when it was dark, I took out my belongings, carrying them on my shoulder right before their eyes. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font0">In the morning the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font0">“Son of man, did not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, ask you, ‘What are you doing?’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> </span><span class="font0">Tell them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “This pronouncement concerns the chieftain in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel within the city.”’</span></p>

The first eagle comes to the treetop of the cedar, that is, to the ruler of the government in the royal line of David. This eagle plucks off the top of the young shoots by replacing King Jehoiachin of Judah with Zedekiah. Despite having taken a loyalty oath, Zedekiah seeks the help of the other eagle, Egypt’s ruler, but to no avail. He is to be taken captive and is to die in Babylon. Jehovah also plucks off “a tender one,” the Messianic King. This One is transplanted upon “a high and lofty mountain,” upon heavenly Mount Zion, where he will become “a majestic cedar,” a source of real blessings for the earth.—Revelation 14:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ezekiel 17:7) </span><span class="font0">“‘“And there came another great eagle, with great wings and large pinions.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Let Your Yes Mean Yes</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font5">Why has Jehovah had the above examples recorded for us in his Word? And how serious is the matter of letting our </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yes</span><span class="font5"> mean Yes? The Bible clearly warns that a person who is “false to agreements” is among those who are “deserving of death.” (Rom. 1:31, 32) Pharaoh of Egypt, Judean King Zedekiah, and Ananias and Sapphira are among the bad examples highlighted in the Bible of individuals whose </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yes</span><span class="font5"> did not mean Yes. They all fared badly and stand as warning examples for us.—Ex. 9:27, 28, 34, 35; Ezek. 17:13-15, 19, 20; Acts 5:1-10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah Unsheathes His Sword!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Next, the rulers of Babylon and Egypt were likened to great eagles. One broke off the top of a cedar tree by removing King Jehoiachin and replacing him with Zedekiah. Although Zedekiah took a loyalty oath to Nebuchadnezzar, he broke it, seeking the military help of Egypt’s ruler, the other great eagle. If Zedekiah invoked God’s name in taking his oath, breaking it brought reproach on Jehovah. The very thought of bringing reproach on God should restrain us from ever proving false to our word. Privileged we are indeed to bear the divine name as Jehovah’s Witnesses!—Ezekiel 17:1-21.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Because of her unfaithful inhabitants, Judah was likened to a wild vine without good fruit and fit only for the fire. (Ezekiel 15:1-8) She was also likened to a foundling saved by God from Egypt and nurtured to womanhood. Jehovah took her as his wife, but she turned to false gods and would suffer destruction for her spiritual adultery. Yet, with faithful ones God would ‘establish an indefinitely lasting covenant’—the new covenant with spiritual Israel.—Ezekiel 16:1-63; Jeremiah 31:31-34; Galatians 6:16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When God Forgives, Does He Forget?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What, then, if someone changed from doing bad to doing good? Jehovah said: “As regards someone wicked, in case he should turn back from all his sins that he has committed and he should actually keep all my statutes and execute justice and righteousness, he will positively keep living. He will not die.” (Verse 21) Yes, Jehovah was “ready to forgive” a sinner who turned back from his wayward course, manifesting true repentance.—Psalm 86:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What about the sins he had committed? “All his transgressions that he has committed—they will not be remembered against him,” Jehovah explained. (Verse 22) Notice that the repentant one’s sins would “not be remembered </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">against him.”</span><span class="font5"> Why is this significant?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Bible, the Hebrew word translated “remember” can mean more than just to recall the past. Regarding this word, one reference work says: “Quite often, in fact, [it] implies an action or appears in combination with verbs of action.” Thus, “to remember” can mean “to act.” Hence, when Jehovah says of a repentant sinner that his sins “will not be remembered against him,” He is saying that He will not thereafter </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">act against the individual</span><span class="font5"> because of those sins, such as by accusing or punishing him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The words of Ezekiel 18:21, 22 paint a touching picture of the extent of God’s forgiveness. When Jehovah forgives our sins, he will never hold those sins against us in the future. Instead, he puts the sins of repentant ones behind him. (Isaiah 38:17) It is as if he wipes out the record of those sins.—Acts 3:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As imperfect humans, we need God’s mercy. After all, we sin many times. (Romans 3:23) But Jehovah wants us to know that if we are sincerely repentant, he is willing to forgive. And when he forgives, he for-gets—that is, he will not rehash our sins in order to accuse or punish us ever again. What a comforting thought! Does God’s mercy move you to want to draw closer to him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ezekiel 18:23) </span><span class="font0">“‘Do I take any pleasure at all in the death of a wicked person?’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. ‘Do I not prefer that he turn away from his ways and keep living?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ezekiel 18:32) </span><span class="font0">“‘I do not take any pleasure in the death of anyone,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. ‘So turn back and live.’”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Armageddon—God’s War to End All Wars</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since God is the Judge, we can be sure that in every case the judgments against the wicked will be righteous. “Is the Judge of all the earth not going to do what is right?” asked Abraham. The answer, Abraham learned, is that Jehovah is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">always</span><span class="font5"> right! (Genesis 18:25) Furthermore, the Bible assures us that Jehovah finds no delight in destroying the wicked; he does so only as a last resort.—Ezekiel 18:32; 2 Peter 3:9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What It Means to Love Our Neighbor</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> In showing love to those who do not serve God, we can do no better than to imitate Jehovah himself. Though he is no lover of wickedness, he shows loving-kindness to all by extending to them the opportunity to turn back from their bad ways and receive everlasting life. (Ezekiel 18:23) Jehovah “desires all to attain to repentance.” (2 Peter 3:9) It is his will that “all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Timothy 2:4) That is why Jesus commissioned his followers to preach and to teach and to “make disciples of people of all the nations.” (Matthew 28:19, 20) By our participation in this work, we show love for both God and neighbor, yes, including even our enemies!</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In the seventh year of exile, 611 B.C.E., the elderly ones of Israel come to Ezekiel “to inquire of Jehovah.” They hear a long history of Israel’s rebellion and a warning that ‘Jehovah will bring forth his sword’ against them. (Ezekiel 20:1; 21:3) Addressing the chieftain of Israel (Zedekiah), Jehovah says: “Remove the turban, and lift off the crown. This will not be the same. Put on high even what is low, and bring low even the high one. A ruin, a ruin, a ruin I shall make it. As for this also, it will certainly become no one’s until he comes who has the legal right [Jesus Christ], and I must give it to him.”—Eze-kiel 21:26, 27.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Messiah was to be born of Israel’s tribe of Judah.</span><span class="font5"> In his deathbed blessing of his sons, the patriarch Jacob foretold: “The scepter will not turn aside from Judah, neither the commander’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; and to him the obedience of the peoples will belong.” (Gen. 49:10) Many Jewish scholars of the past associated those words with the Messiah. Starting with the rule of Judean King David, the scepter (royal sovereignty) and the commander’s staff (power to command) resided with the tribe of Judah. “Shiloh” signifies “He Whose It Is; He to Whom It Belongs.” The regal line of Judah would end in “Shiloh” as the permanent kingly Heir, for God told Zedekiah, the last Judean king, that rulership would be given to one having the legal right to it. (Ezek. 21:26, 27) After Zedekiah, Jesus was the only descendant of David to whom kingship was promised. Before Jesus’ birth, the angel Gabriel told Mary: “Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule as king over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end of his kingdom.” (Luke 1:32, 33) Shiloh must be Jesus Christ, who was a descendant of Judah and David.—Matt. 1:1-3, 6; Luke 3:23, 31-34.</span></p>

(Luke 1:30-33) Thus, Jehovah further narrowed the line of descent of the offspring and established that an heir of David would have “the legal right” to the throne of the Messianic Kingdom. (Ezek. 21:25-27) Through Jesus, David’s kingship “will be firmly established forever.” Indeed, David’s offspring “will endure forever; his throne will endure like the sun.” (Ps. 89:34-37) Yes, the Messiah’s rule will never become corrupt, and its accomplishments will last forever!</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Further proof of authenticity is to be found in the dramatic fulfillment of Ezekiel’s prophecies against neighboring nations, such as Tyre, Egypt, and Edom. For example, Ezekiel prophesied that Tyre would be devastated, and this was partly fulfilled when Nebuchadnezzar took the city after a siege of 13 years. (Ezek. 26:2-21) This conflict did not mean the complete end for Tyre. However, Jehovah’s judgment was that it should be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">totally</span><span class="font5"> destroyed. He had foretold through Ezekiel: “I will scrape her dust away from her and make her a shining, bare surface of a crag &nbsp;Your stones and your woodwork and your dust they will place in the very midst of the water.” (26:4, 12) This was all fulfilled more than 250 years later when Alexander the Great moved against the island city of Tyre. Alexander’s soldiers scraped up all the debris of the ruined mainland city and threw it into the sea, making a half-mile </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">[800 m] </span><span class="font5">causeway out to the island city. Then, with an intricate siegework, they scaled the 150-foot-high </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">[46 m] </span><span class="font5">walls to take the city in 332 B.C.E. Thousands were killed, and many more were sold into slavery. As Ezekiel had also predicted, Tyre became the ‘bare surface of a crag and a drying yard for dragnets.’ (26:14) On the other side of the Promised Land, the treacherous Edomites were also annihilated, in fulfillment of Ezekiel’s prophecy. (25:12, 13; 35:2-9) And, of course, Ezekiel’s prophecies about the destruction of Jerusalem and Israel’s restoration also proved to be accurate.—17:12-21; 36:7-14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Bible—Is It Really Inspired by God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Tyre was a prominent seaport of Phoenicia that had dealt treacherously with ancient Israel, her southern neighbor that worshiped Jehovah. Through a prophet named Ezekiel, Jehovah foretold its complete destruction over 250 years before it happened. Jehovah declared: “I will bring up against you many nations . . . And they will certainly bring the walls of Tyre to ruin and tear down her towers, and I will scrape her dust away from her and make her a shining, bare surface of a crag. A drying yard for dragnets is what she will become in the midst of the sea.” Ezekiel also named in advance the first nation and its leader to besiege Tyre: “Here I am bringing against Tyre Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon.”—Ezekiel 26:3-5, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ezekiel 26:4) </span><span class="font0">They will destroy the walls of Tyre and tear down her towers, and I will scrape away soil and make her a shining, bare rock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ezekiel 26:12) </span><span class="font0">They will loot your resources, plunder your merchandise, tear down your walls, and pull down your fine houses; then they will throw your stones and your woodwork and your soil into the water.’</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Alexander</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Instead of pursuing the fleeing Persians after two decisive victories in Asia Minor (the first at the Granicus River; the second on the Plain of Issus, where a great Persian army estimated at half a million met utter defeat), Alexander turned his attention to the island city of Tyre. Centuries earlier it had been foretold that the walls, towers, houses, and the very dust of Tyre would be pitched into the sea. (Eze 26:4, 12) It is, therefore, quite significant that Alexander took the rubble of the mainland city destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar some years before and built with it an 800-m (0.5 mi) causeway out to the island city. The pounding by his navy and engines of war destroyed that proud mistress of the sea in July 332 B.C.E.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">24:6-14 —What does the rust of the cooking pot represent?</span><span class="font5"> Jerusalem under siege is likened to a widemouthed cooking pot. Its rust represents the moral filth of the city—the uncleanness, loose conduct, and bloodshed for which she is responsible. So great is her uncleanness that even standing the pot empty upon its coals and making it very hot fails to remove the rust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ezekiel 24:16, 17) </span><span class="font0">“Son of man, in a single blow I am about to take away your dear one from you. You should not mourn; nor should you weep or shed tears. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>17</sup> </span><span class="font0">Groan in silence, and do not observe mourning rites for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put on your sandals. You should not cover over the mustache, and do not eat the bread brought to you by others.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah Unsheathes His Sword!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> Next, Ezekiel was to act in an unusual way. (</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Read Ezekiel 24:15-18.</span><span class="font5">) Why was the prophet to display no grief when his wife died? To show how stunned the Jews would be at the destruction of Jerusalem, her inhabitants, and the temple. Ezekiel had already said enough about such matters and would not speak God’s message again until Jerusalem’s downfall was reported to him. Similarly, Christendom and her hypocritical religionists will be stunned at the time of their destruction. And after the “great tribulation” begins, what the anointed watchman class had already said about her end will be enough. (Matthew 24:21) But when God’s “sword” descends upon Christendom, such stunned religionists and others ‘will have to know that he is Jehovah.’—Ezekiel 24:19-27.</span></p>

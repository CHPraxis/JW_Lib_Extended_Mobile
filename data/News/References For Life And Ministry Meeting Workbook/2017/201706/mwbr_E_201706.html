<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Jehovah’s Word Comes True in Every Detail” (Jeremiah 51:11) </span><span class="font0">“Polish the arrows; take up the circular shields. Jehovah has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes, Because he intends to bring Babylon to ruin. For this is the vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance for his temple. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Jeremiah 51:28) </span><span class="font0">Appoint against her the nations, The kings of Me</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font0">dra, its governors and all its deputy rulers And all the lands they rule over.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Medes, Media</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">With Persians defeat Babylon.</span><span class="font0"> In the eighth century B.C.E., the prophet Isaiah had foretold that Jehovah would arouse against Babylon “the Medes, who account silver itself as nothing and who, as respects gold, take no delight in it. And their bows will dash even young men to pieces.” (Isa 13:17-19; 21:2) The term “Medes” here may well include the Persians, even as the classical Greek historians commonly used the term to embrace both Medes and Persians. Their disdaining silver and gold evidently indicates that in Babylon’s case conquest was the prime motive with them rather than spoil, so that no bribe or offer of tribute would buy them off from their determined purpose. The Medes, like the Persians, used the bow as a principal weapon. The wooden bows, though sometimes mounted with bronze or copper (compare Ps 18:34), likely ‘dashed the young men of Babylon to pieces’ by the hail of arrows, individually polished so as to penetrate even deeper.—Jer 51:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It may be noted that Jeremiah (51:11, 28) makes reference to “the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">kings</span><span class="font0"> of Media” as among those attacking Babylon, the plural perhaps indicating that even under Cyrus, a subordinate Median king or kings may have continued to exist, a situation by no means incompatible with ancient practice. (Compare also Jer 25:25.) Thus, too, we find that when Babylon was captured by the combined forces of Medes, Persians, Elamites, and other neighboring tribes, it was a Mede named Darius who was “made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans,” evidently as an appointee of King Cyrus the Persian.—Da 5:31; 9:1; see DARIUS No. 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Jeremiah 51:30) </span><span class="font0">The warriors of Babylon have quit fighting. They sit in their strongholds. Their strength has failed. They have become like women. Her homes have been set on fire. Her bars have been broken.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Interestingly, the Chronicle says concerning the night of Babylon’s fall: “The army of Cyrus entered Babylon without battle.” This likely means without a general conflict and agrees with the prophecy of Jeremiah that ‘the mighty men of Babylon would cease to fight.’—Jer 51:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Jeremiah 51:37) </span><span class="font0">And Babylon will become piles of stones, A lair of jackals, An object of horror and something to whistle at, Without an inhabitant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Babylon</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From that memorable date, 539 B.C.E., Babylon’s glory began to fade as the city declined. Twice it revolted against the Persian emperor Darius I (Hystaspis), and on the second occasion it was dismantled. A partially restored city rebelled against Xerxes I and was plundered. Alexander the Great intended to make Babylon his capital, but he suddenly died in 323 B.C.E. Nicator conquered the city in 312 B.C.E. and transported much of its material to the banks of the Tigris for use in building his new capital of Seleucia. However, the city and a settlement of Jews remained in early Christian times, giving the apostle Peter reason to visit Babylon, as noted in his letter. (1Pe 5:13) Inscriptions found there show that Babylon’s temple of Bel existed as late as 75 C.E. By the fourth century C.E. the city was in ruins, and eventually passed out of existence. It became nothing more than “piles of stones.”—Jer 51:37.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Jeremiah 51:25) </span><span class="font0">“Here I am against you, O destructive mountain,” decla res Jehovah, “You destroyer of the whole earth. I will stretch out my hand against you and roll you down from the crags And make you a burned-out mountain.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mount, Mountain</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Represent governments.</span><span class="font0"> In Biblical symbolism mountains can represent kingdoms or ruling governments. (Da 2:35, 44, 45; compare Isa 41:15; Re 17:9-11, 18.) Babylon, by her military conquests, brought other lands to ruin and is, therefore, called a “ruinous mountain.” (Jer 51:24, 25) A psalm relating Jehovah’s activities against warring men depicts him as being “enveloped with light, more majestic than the mountains of prey.” (Ps 76:4) “The mountains of prey” may represent aggressive kingdoms. (Compare Na 2:11-13.) Regarding Jehovah, David said: “You have made my mountain to stand in strength,” probably meaning that Jehovah had exalted David’s kingdom and firmly established it. (Ps 30:7; compare 2Sa 5:12.) The fact that mountains may represent kingdoms aids one in understanding the significance of what is described at Revelation 8:8 as “something like a great mountain burning with fire.” Its resemblance to a burning mountain would suggest that it is associated with a form of rulership having a destructive nature like fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Jeremiah 51:42) </span><span class="font0">The sea has come up over Babylon. By the multitude of its waves she has been covered.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sea</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Overflowing armies.</span><span class="font0"> Jeremiah described the sound of the attackers of Babylon as being “like the sea that is boisterous.” (Jer 50:42) Hence, when he foretold that “the sea” would come up over Babylon, he evidently meant the flood of conquering troops under the Medes and Persians.—Jer 51:42; compare Da 9:26.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Soul Will . . . Bow Low Over Me”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Amid the sorrow, Jeremiah is filled with hope. He cries out to Jehovah: “Without fail your soul [Jehovah himself] will remember and bow low over me.” (Verse 20) Jeremiah has no doubt. He knows that Jehovah will not forget him—or repentant ones among His people. What, though, will the almighty God do?—Revelation 15:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jeremiah is certain that Jehovah will “bow low” over those who truly repent. Another translation says: “O remember, and stoop down to me.” Those words evoke a tender mental picture. Jehovah, “the Most High over all the earth,” will stoop down, so to speak, and lift his worshippers up out of their debased condition and restore them to his favor. (Psalm 83:18) Anchored by this hope, Jeremiah finds true comfort for his wounded heart. The faithful prophet is determined to wait patiently until Jehovah’s due time to deliver His repentant people. —Verse 21.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah Is My Share</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>8</sup> The Levites </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">as a tribe</span><span class="font0"> were to have Jehovah as their share. It is noteworthy, though, that individual Levites used the phrase “Jehovah is my share” to express devotion to God and reliance on him. (Lam. 3:24) One such Levite was a singer and composer. We will refer to him as Asaph, though he could have been a member of the house of Asaph, the Levite who led the singers in the days of King David. (1 Chron. 6:31-43) In Psalm 73 we read that Asaph (or one of his descendants) became perplexed. He envied the wicked who were leading a prosperous life and went to the point of saying: “Surely it is in vain that I have cleansed my heart and that I wash my hands in innocence itself.” He apparently lost sight of his privilege of service; he failed to appreciate that Jehovah was his share. He was spiritually troubled “until [he] proceeded to come into the grand sanctuary of God.”—Ps. 73:2, 3, 12, 13, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Lamentations 3:26, 27) </span><span class="font0">Good it is to wait in silence for the salvation of Jehovah. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>27</sup> </span><span class="font0">Good it is for a man to carry the yoke during his youth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Highlights From the Book of Lamentations</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3:21-26, 28-33.</span><span class="font0"> How can we endure even intense suffering? Jeremiah tells us. We should not forget that Jehovah is abundant in acts of loving-kindness and that many are his mercies. We should also remember that our being alive is reason enough not to give up hope and that we need to be patient and wait silently, without complaining, upon Jehovah for salvation. Moreover, we should “put [our] mouth in the very dust,” that is, humbly submit to trials, recognizing that what God allows to happen is permitted for good reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3:27.</span><span class="font0"> Facing up to tests of faith during youth may mean enduring hardship and ridicule. But it is ‘good for an able-bodied man to carry the yoke during his youth.’ Why? Because learning to bear a yoke of suffering while young prepares a person to deal with challenges in his later years.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2:17—What particular “saying” did Jehovah accomplish in connection with Jerusalem?</span><span class="font0"> The reference here is apparently to Leviticus 26:17, which states: “I shall indeed set my face against you, and you will certainly be defeated before your enemies; and those who hate you will just tread down upon you, and you will actually flee when no one is pursuing you.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5:7—Does Jehovah hold people accountable for the errors of their forefathers?</span><span class="font0"> No, Jehovah does not directly punish people for the sins of their ancestors. “Each of us will render an account for himself to God,” says the Bible. (Romans 14:12) However, consequences of errors can linger on and be experienced by later generations. For example, ancient Israel’s turning to idolatry made it difficult even for the faithful Israelites of later times to adhere to the course of righteousness.—Exodus 20:5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Lamentations 2:20-3:12) </span><span class="font0">See, O Jehovah, and look upon the one with whom you have dealt so harshly.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> The book of Ezekiel reveals something else that can help us to speak with boldness. In a vision, Jehovah gave Ezekiel a scroll written on both sides with “dirges and moaning and wailing” and told him to eat it, saying: “Son of man, you should cause your own belly to eat, that you may fill your very intestines with this roll that I am giving you.” What did this vision mean? Ezekiel was to absorb fully the message he was to deliver. It was to become part of him, as it were, affecting his inmost feelings. The prophet goes on to relate: “I began to eat it, and it came to be in my mouth like honey for sweetness.” Declaring God’s message in public was a delight—like tasting honey—for Ezekiel. He felt highly privileged to represent Jehovah and to fulfill this God-given assignment, even though that meant delivering a strong message to an unreceptive peo-ple.—</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Read Ezekiel 2:8-3:4, 7-9.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> This vision contains a valuable lesson for God’s servants today. We too have a strong message to deliver to people who are not always appreciative of our efforts. For us to continue to view the Christian ministry as a God-given privilege, we must be well-nourished spiritually. Superficial or haphazard study habits will not be sufficient for us to absorb God’s Word fully. Could you improve the quality or regularity of your personal Bible reading and Bible study? Could you more often meditate on what you read? —Ps. 1:2, 3.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">Intestines</span></p>

Ezekiel was to gain spiritual strength by meditating upon and storing in his memory the words written in the scroll. He was thereby nourished spiritually and provided with a message to speak.—Eze 3:1-6; compare Re 10:8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ezekiel 3:3) </span><span class="font0">He went on to say to me: “Son of man, eat this scroll that I am giving you, and fill your stomach with it.” So I began to eat it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4:1-17—Did Ezekiel really act out the scene depicting Jerusalem’s upcoming siege?</span><span class="font0"> Ezekiel’s appeal for the change of cooking fuel and Jehovah’s granting him his request indicate that the prophet actually acted out the scene. Lying on the left side was for the 390 years of error of the ten-tribe kingdom—from its beginning in 997 B.C.E. to the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E. Lying on the right side was for Judah’s 40 years of sin, spanning the period from Jeremiah’s appointment as a prophet in 647 B.C.E. to 607 B.C.E. During the entire 430-day period, Ezekiel existed on a meager supply of food and water, prophetically indicating that there would be a famine during the siege of Jerusalem.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Questions From Readers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whom do the man with the secretary’s inkhorn and the six men with smashing weapons described in Ezekiel’s vision symbolize?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■ </span><span class="font0">They picture heavenly forces that were involved in the destruction of Jerusalem and that will also be involved in the destruction of Satan’s wicked system at Armageddon. Why is this adjusted understanding reasonable?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After Ezekiel saw the wicked things being done in apostate Jerusalem prior to its destruction in 607 B.C.E., he was given a vision of the events leading up to that destruction. He saw six men with smashing weapons. He also saw a man among them who was “clothed in linen” and had “a secretary’s inkhorn.” (Ezek. 8:6-12; 9:2, 3) This man was told: “Go through the city, . . . and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who are sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done in the city.” Then, the men with the smashing weapons were told to kill all those in the city who did not have the mark. (Ezek. 9:4-7) What does this vision teach us, and who is the man with the secretary’s inkhorn?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This prophecy was given in 612 B.C.E., and its initial fulfillment refers to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonian army—something that was to occur just five years later. Although the pagan Babylonians were allowed to bring about that destruction, they were serving as Jehovah’s executioners. (Jer. 25:9, 15-18) This was because Jehovah used them to punish his apostate people. However, the destruction was not to be indiscriminate. The righteous would not be destroyed along with the wicked. Jehovah lovingly made provision to save those Jews who did not agree with the detestable things happening in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ezekiel was not involved in either the marking work or the destruction itself. Instead, the execution of judgment would be directed by the angels. So by means of this prophecy, we are allowed to see behind the scenes, as it were, into the heavenly realm itself. Jehovah had commissioned his angels not only to organize the destruction of the wicked but also to separate the righteous for survival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the past, we have explained that in the modernday fulfillment of this vision, the man with the secretary’s inkhorn represented the anointed remnant. It was thought that those who respond favorably to the message being preached are now marked for survival. In recent years, however, it has become clear that an adjustment needs to be made to this explanation. According to what is stated at Matthew 25:31-33, Jesus is the one who judges people. He makes his final judgment during the time of the great tribulation, separating the sheeplike ones, who will survive, from the goatlike ones, who will be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So in light of this adjusted understanding, what lessons do we learn from Ezekiel’s vision? There are at least five:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">(1) During the time leading up to the destruction of Jerusalem, Ezekiel served as a watchman along with Jeremiah, just as Isaiah had previously done. Today, Jehovah is using a small group of his anointed servants to feed his people and warn others before the outbreak of the great tribulation. In turn, all of Christ’s domestics have a share in sounding the warning.—Matt. 24:45-47.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">(2) Ezekiel was not involved with the actual marking of people for survival; neither are God’s servants today. They simply convey Jehovah’s message, which is a part of their preaching work, done under angelic direction.—Rev. 14:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">(3) In Ezekiel’s day, no one received a literal mark on his forehead. The same is true today. What do people need to do to be symbolically marked for survival? They need to react favorably to the preaching work that is taking place, put on the Christian personality, dedicate themselves to Jehovah, and loyally support Christ’s brothers. (Matt. 25:35-40) Those who do these things will receive the mark of survival during the coming great tribulation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">(4) In the modern-day fulfillment, the man with the secretary’s inkhorn represents Jesus Christ, the one behind the scenes who marks those who will survive. The great crowd will receive their mark when they are judged as sheep during the great tribulation. This will put them in line to receive everlasting life here on earth.—Matt. 25:34, 46.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">(5) In the modern-day fulfillment, the six men with smashing weapons represent Jesus’ heavenly armies with Jesus himself at the head. They will soon destroy the nations and all wickedness.—Ezek. 9:2, 6, 7; Rev. 19:11-21.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Understanding these valuable lessons strengthens our confidence that Jehovah does not destroy the righteous along with the wicked. (2 Pet. 2:9; 3:9) We are also reminded of the importance of the preaching work in our day. Everyone needs to hear the warning before the end comes!—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ezekiel 9:3, 4) </span><span class="font0">Then the glory of the God of Israel rose from where it had rested above the cherubs and moved to the threshold of the doorway of the house, and he began calling out to the man who was clothed in linen, at whose waist was the secretary’s inkhorn. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font0">Jehovah said to him: “Go through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who are sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done in the city.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ezekiel 9:5-7) </span><span class="font0">And to the others he said in my hearing: “Go through the city after him and strike. Do not let your eye feel sorry, and do not feel any compassion. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font0">Old man, young man, virgin, little child, and women you should kill off completely. But do not go near to any man on whom there is the mark. You should start from my sanctuary.” So they started with the elders who were in front of the house. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font0">Then he said to them: “Defile the house and fill the courtyards with the slain. Go!” So they went out and struck down people in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Digging for Spiritual Gems</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ezekiel 7:19) </span><span class="font0">“‘They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will become abhorrent to them. Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them in the day of Jehovah’s fury. They will not be satisfied, nor will they fill their stomachs, for it has become a stumbling block causing their error.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Excelling Value of Divine Education</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>10</sup> Jehovah is in a unique position to help us prepare for the future because he knows what lies ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He determines what mankind’s future will be. (Isa. 46:9, 10) Bible prophecy reveals that “the great day of Jehovah is near.” (Zeph. 1:14) Regarding that day, the words of Proverbs 11:4 will prove true: “Valuable things will be of no benefit on the day of fury, but righteousness itself will deliver from death.” When the time arrives for Jehovah’s judgment to be executed on Satan’s world, what will matter is our standing with God. Money will be worthless. In fact, Ezekiel 7:19 says: “Into the streets they will throw their very silver, and an abhorrent thing their own gold will become.” That foreknowledge can help us to act wisely now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ezekiel 8:12) </span><span class="font0">He said to me: “Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each one in the inner rooms where his idols are displayed? For they are saying, ‘Jehovah is not seeing us. Jehovah has left the land.’”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Are You Allowing God’s Spirit to Lead You?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>14</sup> Faith means, fundamentally, that Jehovah God is real to us. If God is not real to us, wrong conduct will be just a short step away. Consider what happened among God’s people in ancient times. Jehovah revealed to the prophet Ezekiel that detestable things were being done in private, saying: “Have you seen, O son of man, what the elderly ones of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each one in the inner rooms of his showpiece? For they are saying, ‘Jehovah is not seeing us. Jehovah has left the land.’” (Ezek. 8:12) Did you notice what contributed to the problem? They did not believe that Jehovah was aware of what they were doing. Jehovah was not real to them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">| </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">DANIEL 7-9 “Daniel’s Prophecy Foretold the Messiah’s Arrival”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Daniel 9:24) </span><span class="font0">“There are 70 weeks that have been determined for your people and your holy city, in order to terminate the transgression, to finish off sin, to make atonement for error, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up the vision and the prophecy, and to anoint the Holy of Holies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Seventy Weeks</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Transgression and sin terminated.</span><span class="font6"> Jesus’ being cut off in death, his resurrection, and his appearance in heaven resulted in ‘terminating transgression and finishing off sin as well as in making atonement for error.’ (Da 9:24) The Law covenant had exposed the Jews as sinners, condemned them as such, and brought upon them the curse as covenant breakers. But where sin “abounded” as exposed or made evident by the Mosaic Law, God’s mercy and favor abounded much more through his Messiah. (Ro 5: 20) By Messiah’s sacrifice, transgression and sin of the repentant sinners can be canceled and the penalty thereof be lifted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Daniel 9:25) </span><span class="font0">You should know and understand that from the issuing of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Mes^si</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font0">ah the Leader, there will be 7 weeks, also 62 weeks. She will be restored and rebuilt, with a public square and moat, but in times of distress.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Seventy Weeks</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Messiah’s Arrival After ‘Sixty-Nine Weeks.’</span><span class="font6"> As to the following “sixty-two weeks” (Da 9:25), these, being part of the 70 and named second in order, would continue from the conclusion of the “seven weeks.” Therefore, the time “from the going forth of the word” to rebuild Jerusalem until “Messiah the Leader” would be 7 plus 62 “weeks,” or 69 “weeks”—483 years—from the year 455 B.C.E. to 29 C.E. As mentioned above, in the autumn of that year, 29 C.E., Jesus was baptized in water, was anointed with holy spirit, and began his ministry as “Messiah the Lead-er.”—Lu 3:1, 2, 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Daniel 9:26, 27a) </span><span class="font0">“And after the 62 weeks, Mes-si</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font0">ah will be cut off, with nothing for himself. “And the people of a leader who is coming will destroy the city and the holy place. And its end will be by the flood. And until the end there will be war; what is decided upon is desolations. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>27</sup> </span><span class="font0">“And he will keep the covenant in force for the many for one week; and at the half of the week, he will cause sacrifice and gift offering to cease.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Seventy Weeks</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Cut off” at the half of the week.</span><span class="font6"> Gabriel further said to Daniel: “After the sixty-two weeks Messiah will be cut off, with nothing for himself.” (Da 9:26) It was sometime after the end of the ‘seven plus sixty-two weeks,’ actually about three and a half years afterward, that Christ was cut off in death on a torture stake, giving up all that he had, as a ransom for mankind. (Isa 53:8) Evidence indicates that the first half of the “week” was spent by Jesus in the ministry. On one occasion, likely in the fall of 32 C.E., he gave an illustration, apparently speaking of the Jewish nation as a fig tree (compare Mt 17:15-20; 21:18, 19, 43) that had borne no fruit for “three years.” The vinedresser said to the owner of the vineyard: “Master, let it alone also this year, until I dig around it and put on manure; and if then it produces fruit in the future, well and good; but if not, you shall cut it down.” (Lu 13:6-9) He may have referred here to the time period of his own ministry to that unresponsive nation, which ministry had continued at that point for about three years and was to continue into a fourth year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Seventy Weeks</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The half of the week” would be at the middle of seven years, or after three and a half years within that “week” of years. Since the 70th “week” began about the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">fall</span><span class="font6"> of 29 C.E. at Jesus’ baptism and anointing to be Christ, half of that week (three and a half years) would extend to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">spring</span><span class="font6"> of 33 C.E., or Passover time (Nisan 14) of that year. This day appears to have been April 1, 33 C.E., according to the Gregorian calendar. (See LORD’S EVENING MEAL [Time of Its Institution].) The apostle Paul tells us that Jesus ‘came to do the will of God,’ which was to ‘do away with what is first [the sacrifices and offerings according to the Law] that he may establish what is second.’ This he did by offering as a sacrifice his own body.—Heb 10:1-10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Daniel 9:24) </span><span class="font0">“There are 70 weeks that have been determined for your people and your holy city, in order to terminate the transgression, to finish off sin, to make atonement for error, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up the vision and the prophecy, and to anoint the Holy of Holies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Questions From Readers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">When was “the Holy of Holies” anointed, as foretold at Daniel 9:24?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Daniel 9:24-27 is a prophecy concerning the appearance of “Messiah the Leader”—the Christ. The foretold anointing of “the Holy of Holies,” then, does not refer to the anointing of the Most Holy compartment of the temple in Jerusalem. Rather, the expression “Holy of Holies” refers to the heavenly sanctuary of God—the heavenly Most Holy—in the great spiritual temple of Jehovah.—Hebrews 8:1-5; 9:2-10, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When did God’s spiritual temple begin to operate? Well, consider what took place when Jesus presented himself for baptism in 29 C.E. From that point on in his life, Jesus fulfilled the words of Psalm 40:6-8. The apostle Paul later indicated that Jesus had prayed to God: “Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me.” (Hebrews 10:5) Jesus knew that God “did not want” animal sacrifices to continue to be offered at Jerusalem’s temple. Instead, Jehovah had prepared a perfect human body for Jesus to offer as a sacrifice. Expressing his heartfelt desire, Jesus continued: “Look! I am come (in the roll of the book it is written about me) to do your will, O God.” (Hebrews 10:7) And what was Jehovah’s response? The Gospel of Matthew states: “After being baptized Jesus immediately came up from the water; and, look ! the heavens were opened up, and he saw descending like a dove God’s spirit coming upon him. Look! Also, there was a voice from the heavens that said: ‘This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.’ ”—Matthew 3:16, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God’s acceptance of the presentation of Jesus’ body for sacrifice meant that an altar greater than the literal altar in Jerusalem’s temple had come into existence. This was an altar of God’s “will,” or arrangement for accepting Jesus’ human life as a sacrifice. (Hebrews 10:10) The anointing of Jesus with holy spirit meant that God had now brought forth his entire spiritual temple arrangement. Hence, at the time of Jesus’ baptism, God’s heavenly abode was anointed, or set apart, as “the Holy of Holies” in the great spiritual temple arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Daniel 9:27) </span><span class="font0">“And he will keep the covenant in force for the many for one week; and at the half of the week, he will cause sacrifice and gift offering to cease. “And on the wing of disgusting things there will be the one causing desolation; and until an extermination, what was decided on will be poured out also on the one lying desolate.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Highlights From the Book of Daniel</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">9:27—What covenant was ‘kept in force for the many’ until the end of the 70th week of years, or 36 C.E.?</span><span class="font6"> The Law covenant was removed in 33 C.E. when Jesus was impaled. But by keeping the Abrahamic covenant in force toward fleshly Israel until 36 C.E., Jehovah extended the period of special favor to the Jews on the basis of their being descendants of Abraham. The Abrahamic covenant continues in force with regard to “the Israel of God.” —Galatians 3:7-9, 14-18, 29; 6:16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Daniel 7:1-10) </span><span class="font0">In the first year of King Bel-shaz</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font0">zar of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream; he recorded a complete account of the matters. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font0">Daniel declared: “I was watching in my visions during the night, and look! the four winds of the heavens were stirring up the vast sea. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font0">And four huge beasts came out of the sea, each different from the others. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font0">“The first one was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were plucked out, and it was lifted up from the earth and was made to stand up on two feet like a man, and it was given the heart of a man. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font0">“And look! another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, ‘Get up, eat much flesh.’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup> </span><span class="font0">“After this I kept watching, and look! another beast, like a leopard, but on its back it had four wings like those of a bird.

It was devouring and crushing, and what was left it trampled down with its feet. It was different from all the other beasts that were prior to it, and it had ten horns. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font0">While I considered the horns, look! another horn, a small one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were plucked up from before it.

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>“Jehovah Foresaw the Future of Kings”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Daniel 11:2) </span><span class="font0">What I will tell you now is the truth: “Look! Three more kings will stand up for Persia, and the fourth one will amass greater riches than all others. And when he becomes strong by means of his riches, he will rouse up everything against the kingdom of Greece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">dp 212-213</span><span class="font6"> fl</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">5-6</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Two Kings in Conflict</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font6"> The first three kings were Cyrus the Great, Cam-byses II, and Darius I (Hystaspes). Since Bardiya (or perhaps a pretender named Gaumata) ruled for only seven months, the prophecy did not take his brief reign into consideration. In 490 B.C.E., the third king, Darius I, attempted to invade Greece for the second time. However, the Persians were routed at Marathon and retreated to Asia Minor. Though Darius made careful preparations for a further campaign against Greece, he could not carry it out before his death four years later. That was left up to his son and successor, the “fourth” king, Xerxes I. He was the King Ahasuerus who married Esther.—Esther 1:1; 2:15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font6"> Xerxes I did indeed “rouse up everything against the kingdom of Greece,” that is, the independent Grecian states as a group. “Urged on by ambitious courtiers,” says the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Medes and Persians —Conquerors and Diplomats,</span><span class="font6"> “Xerxes launched an assault by land and sea.” Greek historian Herodotus, of the fifth century B.C.E., writes that “no other expedition compared to this seems of any account.” His record states that the sea force “amounted in all to 517,610 men. The number of the foot soldiers was 1,700,000; that of the horsemen 80,000; to which must be added the Arabs who rode on camels, and the Libyans who fought in chariots, whom I reckon at 20,000. The whole number, therefore, of the land and sea forces added together amounts to 2,317,610 men.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Daniel 11:3) </span><span class="font0">“And a mighty king will stand up and rule with extensive dominion and do as he pleases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">dp 213</span><span class="font6"> fl</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">8</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Two Kings in Conflict</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font6"> “A mighty king will certainly stand up and rule with extensive dominion and do according to his will,” said the angel. (Daniel 11:3) Twenty-year-old Alexander ‘stood up’ as king of Macedonia in 336 B.C.E. He did become “a mighty king”—Alexander the Great. Driven by a plan of his father, Philip II, he took the Persian provinces in the Middle East. Crossing the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, his 47,000 men scattered the 250,000 troops of Darius III at Gauga-mela. Subsequently, Darius fled and was murdered, ending the Persian dynasty. Greece now became the world power, and Alexander ‘ruled with extensive dominion and did according to his will.’</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Daniel 11:4) </span><span class="font0">But when he has stood up, his kingdom will be broken and be divided toward the four winds of the heavens, but not to his descendants and not like the dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom will be uprooted and go to others besides these.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Two Kings in Conflict</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>11</sup></span><span class="font6"> Following the death of Alexander, his kingdom was “divided toward the four winds.” His many generals quarreled among themselves as they grabbed for territory. One-eyed General Antigonus I tried to bring all of Alexander’s empire under his control. But he was killed in a battle at Ipsus in Phrygia. By the year 301 B.C.E., four of Alexander’s generals were in power over the vast territory that their commander had conquered. Cassander ruled Macedonia and Greece. Lysimachus gained control over Asia Minor and Thrace. Seleucus I Nicator secured Mesopotamia and Syria. And Ptolemy Lagus took Egypt and Palestine. True to the prophetic word, Alexander’s great empire was divided into four Hellenistic kingdoms.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Daniel 12:3) </span><span class="font0">“And those having insight will shine as brightly as the expanse of heaven, and those bringing the many to righteousness like the stars, forever and ever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Daniel 12:3 states that “the ones having insight [anointed Christians] will shine like the brightness of the expanse.” While still on earth, they do this by sharing in the preaching work. However, Matthew 13:43 points to the time when they will shine brightly in the heavenly Kingdom. Previously, we thought that both scriptures referred to the same activity —the preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Daniel 12:13) </span><span class="font0">“But as for you, go on to the end. You will rest, but you will stand up for your lot at the end of the days.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah Promises Daniel a Wonderful Reward</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font6">The book of Daniel closes with one of the most beautiful promises God has ever made to a human. Jehovah’s angel told Daniel: “You will stand up for your lot at the end of the days.” What did the angel mean? Well, since the “rest” he had just referred to was death, the promise that Daniel would “stand up” at some later time could mean only one thing —resurrection! In fact, some scholars have asserted that Daniel chapter 12 contains the first explicit reference to resurrection to be found in the Hebrew Scriptures. (Daniel 12:2) In this, though, they are wrong. Daniel was very familiar with the resurrection hope.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font6">Loyal love should be evident in all our dealings with fellow worshippers of Jehovah. Even under difficult circumstances, the law of loving-kindness should not depart from our tongue. When the loving-kindness of the sons of Israel became “like the dew that early goes away,” Jehovah was displeased. (Hos. 6:4, 6) On the other hand, Jehovah ta kes pleasure in a regular pattern of loving-kindness. Consider how he blesses those who pursue it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Hosea 6:6) </span><span class="font0">For in loyal love I delight, not in sacrifice, And in the knowledge of God, rather than in whole burnt offerings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah Values Your Obedience</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font6">In this connection, recall that in the past, Jehovah revealed to his ancient people that obedience was even more important than animal sacrifices. (Proverbs 21:3, 27; Hosea 6:6; Matthew 12:7) Why was that so, since it was Jehovah who had commanded his people to offer such sacrifices? Well, what is the motive of the one offering the sacrifice? Is he doing it to please God? Or is he merely following some ritual? If a worshipper is truly desirous of pleasing God, he will take care to be obedient to all of God’s commands. God has no need of animal sacrifices, but our obedience is one thing of value that we can give him.</span></p>

At that time, Jehovah ended the Assyrian threat to Jerusalem by having an angel slay 185,000 of the enemy’s forces in one night. (2 Kings 19:34, 35) Jehovah thus delivered Judah, not “by a bow or by a sword or by war, by horses or by horsemen,” but by an angel.</span></p>

This prophecy also had a fulfillment in 1919 C.E., when the remnant of spiritual Israel was freed from “Babylon the Great,” the world empire of false religion. They now dwell in security and enjoy life in a spiritual paradise with their companions, who hope to live forever on earth.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Hosea 14:2) </span><span class="font0">Come back to Jehovah with these words, Say to him, ‘May you pardon our error and accept what is good, And we will offer the praise of our lips as we would young bulls.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Offering Sacrifices That Please God</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Furthermore, the Bible indicates that our expressions of praise can be viewed as sacrifices offered to Jehovah. The prophet Hosea used the phrase “the young bulls of our lips,” showing that God considers the praise of our lips to be one of the finest sacrifices. (Hosea 14:2) The apostle Paul urged the Hebrew Christians: “Offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name.” (Hebrews 13:15) Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses stay very busy preaching the good news and making disciples of people of all nations. (Matthew 24:14; 28:19, 20) They are offering sacrifices of praise to God day and night around the earth.—Revelation 7:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Hosea 14:4) </span><span class="font0">I will heal their unfaithfulness. I will love them of my own free will, Because my anger has turned away from him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gaining God’s Approval Leads to Everlasting Life </span><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup></span><span class="font6">A bull was the costliest animal that an Israelite could offer to Jehovah. Hence, “the young bulls of our lips” referred to sincere, well-thought-out words spoken in praise of the true God. How did Jehovah respond to those making such sacrifices? He said: “I shall love them of my own free will.” (Hos. 14:4) To those offering such sacrifices of praise, Jehovah granted his forgiveness, approval, and friendship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Hosea 14:9) </span><span class="font0">Who is wise? Let him understand these things. Who is discreet? Let him know them. For the ways of Jehovah are upright, And the righteous will walk in them; But the transgressors will stumble in them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Serve Jehovah According to His High Standards</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> </span><span class="font6">Hosea 14:9 also turns our attention to the positive aspects of observing an upright course. Blessings and benefits come from measuring up to God’s requirements. As the Creator, he knows our makeup. What he expects of us is for our good. To illustrate the relationship between us and God, we might think of an automobile and its manufacturer. The maker knows how the auto is designed and put together. He knows that the car requires an oil change every so often. What would happen if you ignored that standard, perhaps reasoning that the car is running well? Much sooner than might otherwise be so, the engine would deteriorate and fail. The same is true of humans. Our Creator has given us commandments. Keeping them is for our benefit. (Isaiah 48:17, 18) Appreciating that we do benefit gives us additional reason to live up to his standards, to keep his commandments.—Psalm 112:1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font6"> Having received the holy spirit, the disciples in Jerusalem lost no time in sharing the good news of salvation with others, beginning with the crowd who had gathered that morning. Their preaching fulfilled a remarkable prophecy, recorded eight centuries earlier by Joel, the son of Pethuel: “I shall pour out my spirit on every sort of flesh, and your sons and your daughters will certainly prophesy. As for your old men, dreams they will dream. As for your young men, visions they will see. And even on the menservants and on the maidservants in those days I shall pour out my spirit . . . before the coming of the great and fear-inspiring day of Jehovah.” —Joel 1:1; 2:28, 29, 31; Acts 2:17, 18, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font6"> Did this mean that God was going to raise up a whole generation of prophets, both male and female, in the manner of David, Joel, and Deborah, and use them to foretell future events? No. Christian ‘sons and daughters, menservants and maidservants’ would prophesy in the sense that they would be impelled by Jehovah’s spirit to declare “the magnificent things” that Jehovah had done and would still do. So they would serve as spokesmen for the Most High. How, though, did the crowd react?—Hebrews 1:1, 2.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font6"> Look at the matter from another standpoint. Jehovah God told the prophet Joel of a time when people of every sort would prophesy, so to speak: “After that it must occur that I shall pour out my spirit on every sort of flesh, and your sons and your daughters will certainly prophesy. As for your old men, dreams they will dream. As for your young men, visions they will see.” (Joel 2:28-32) On the day of Pentecost 33 C.E., the apostle Peter applied this passage to the pouring out of holy spirit upon those who were gathered in an upper chamber in Jerusalem and to their subsequent preaching of “the magnificent things of God.” (Acts 1:12-14; 2:1-4, 11, 14-21) Now consider our time. Joel’s prophecy has been undergoing its major fulfillment since early in the 20th century. Spirit-anointed Christians—male and female, old and young—began to “prophesy,” that is, to declare “the magnificent things of God,” including the good news of the Kingdom, now established in the heavens.</span></p>

Hence, the place is also called “the low plain of Jehoshaphat.” (Joel 3:2, 12) In our day, it represents a symbolic location in which nations will be crushed like grapes in a winepress.—Revela-tion 19:15.</span></p>

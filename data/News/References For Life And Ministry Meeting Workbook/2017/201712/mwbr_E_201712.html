<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Seek Jehovah Before His Day of Anger”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">( Zephaniah 2:2, 3) </span><span class="font0">Before the decree takes effect, Before the day passes by like chaff, Before the burning anger of Jehovah comes upon you, Before the day of Jehovah’s anger comes upon you, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font0">Seek Jehovah, all you meek ones of the earth, Who observe his righteous decrees. Seek righteousness, seek meekness. Probably you will be concealed on the day of Jehovah’s anger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">w01 2/15 18-19</span><span class="font4"> fl</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">5-7</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Seek Jehovah Before the Day of His Anger</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font4"> You might say: ‘I am a dedicated, baptized servant of God, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Have I not already met those requirements?’ Actually, more is involved than dedicating ourselves to Jehovah. Israel was a dedicated nation, but in Zephaniah’s day the people of Judah were not living up to that dedication. As a result, the nation was eventually cast off. ‘Seeking Jehovah’ today involves developing and maintaining a warm personal relationship with him in association with his earthly organization. It means getting to know how God views matters and being attentive to his feelings. We seek Jehovah when we carefully study his Word, meditate upon it, and apply its counsel in life. As we also seek Jehovah’s guidance in fervent prayer and follow the leading of his holy spirit, our relationship with him deepens and we are impelled to serve him ‘with all our heart, soul, and vital force.’—Deuteronomy 6:5; Galatians 5:22-25; Philippians 4:6, 7; Revelation 4:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font4"> The second requirement mentioned at Zephaniah 2:3 is to “seek righteousness.” Most of us made important changes so that we could qualify for Christian baptism, but we must continue to uphold God’s righteous standards throughout our life. Some who started out well in this respect have allowed themselves to be sullied by the world. It is not easy to seek righteousness, for we are surrounded by people who view sexual immorality, lying, and other sins as normal. Yet, a strong desire to please Jehovah can overpower any tendency to seek the world’s approval by trying to blend in with it. Judah lost God’s favor because of mimicking her ungodly neighboring nations. Instead of imitating the world, then, let us be “imitators of God,” cultivating “the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty.”—Ephe-sians 4:24; 5:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font4"> The third point made at Zephaniah 2:3 is that if we want to be hidden in the day of Jehovah’s anger, we must “seek meekness.” Each day, we rub shoulders with men, women, and young people who are anything but meek. To them, being mild-tempered is a flaw. Submissiveness is considered a serious weakness. They are demanding, selfish, and opinionated, believing that their personal “rights” and preferences must be accommodated at all costs. How sad it would be if some of those attitudes were to rub off on us! This is the time to “seek meekness.” How? By being submissive to God, humbly accepting his discipline and conforming to his will.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1:8. </span><span class="font4">Some in Zephaniah’s day were apparently seeking the accepta nce of surrounding nations by “wearing foreign attire.” How foolish it would be for Jehovah’s worshippers today to try to conform to the world by similar means!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Haggai 2:9) </span><span class="font0">“‘The future glory of this house will be greater than the former,’ says Jehovah of armies. “‘And in this place I will grant peace,’ declares Jehovah of armies.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Highlights From the Books of Haggai and Zechariah</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2:9—In what ways could ‘the glory of the later house become greater than that of the former’? </span><span class="font4">This was to be in at least three ways: the number of years the temple was in existence, who taught there, and who flocked there to worship Jehovah. Although Solomon’s glorious temple stood for 420 years, from 1027 B.C.E. to 607 B.C.E., the “later house” was in use for over 580 years, from its completion in 515 B.C.E. to its destruction in 70 C.E. Moreover, the Messiah—Jesus Christ—taught in the “later house,” and more people came to it than to “the former” in order to worship God.—Acts 2:1-11.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font4">The flocking of many humans to worship Jehovah with his people in this time of the end was foretold by two ancient prophets. Isaiah prophesied: “Many peoples will go and say: ‘Come, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will instruct us about his ways, and we will walk in his paths.’ For law will go out of Zion, and the word of Jehovah out of Jerusalem.” (Isa. 2: 2, 3) Likewise, the prophet Zechariah foretold that “many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek Jehovah of armies in Jerusalem and to beg for the favor of Jehovah.” He depicted them as “ten men out of all the languages of the nations” who, symbolically speaking, would take hold of the robe of spiritual Israel, saying: “We want to go with you, for we have heard that God is with you people.”—Zech. 8:20-23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">( Zechariah 8:23) </span><span class="font0">“This is what Jehovah of armies says, ‘In those days ten men out of all the languages of the nations will take hold, yes, they will take firm hold of the robe of a Jew, saying: “We want to go with you, for we have heard that God is with you people.”’”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“We Want to Go With You”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> </span><span class="font4">If it is not possible to know with certainty the names of all spiritual Israelites on earth today, how can members of the other sheep “go with” them? Notice what the prophecy in Zechariah states concerning the figurative ten men. These ones would “take firm hold of the robe of a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jew,</span><span class="font4"> saying: ‘We want to go with </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">you,</span><span class="font4"> for we have heard that God is with </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">you people.’”</span><span class="font4"> Although only one Jew is mentioned here, in both instances the pronoun “you” refers to more than one person. This spiritual Jew must, then, be a composite person, not just one individual! So it is not necessary to identify every spiritual Jew and then go with him or her. Rather, we need to identify these ones </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">as a group</span><span class="font4"> and then support them as such. In no way do the Scriptures encourage us to follow an individual. Jesus is our Leader.—Matt. 23:10.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>14</sup></span><span class="font4"> Jesus Christ considers the loyal support given to his brothers as being given to him. (</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Read Matthew 25:40.</span><span class="font4">) In what way, then, can those who have the earthly hope support Ch rist’s spirit-anointed brothers? Principally by helping them with the Kingdom-preaching work. (Matt. 24:14; John 14: 12) While the number of anointed ones on the earth has decreased over the decades, the number of the other sheep has increased. When those who have an earthly hope share in the witness work, serving if possible as full-time evangelizers, they support the spirit-anointed ones in fulfilling the disciple-making assignment. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Not to be overlooked are the opportunities to support this work by making financial contributions in various ways.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Zechariah 5:6-11) </span><span class="font0">So I asked: “What is it?” He replied: “This is the e</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font0">phah container that is going out.” He continued: “This is their appearance in all the earth.” </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font0">And I saw that the round lid of lead was lifted up, and there was a woman sitting inside the container. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font0">So he said: “This is Wickedness.” Then he threw her back into the e</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font0">phah container, after which he thrust the lead weight over its mouth. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>9</sup> </span><span class="font0">Then I looked up and saw two women coming forward, and they were soaring in the wind.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>18</sup> </span><span class="font4">However, the vision also reminded the Jews of their responsibility to maintain the purity of their worship. Wickedness cannot and will not be allowed to creep into and dwell among Jehovah’s people. After we have been brought into the protective and loving care of God’s clean organization, we have the responsibility to help maintain it. Are we moved to keep our “house” clean? Wickedness in any form does not belong in our spiritual paradise.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">( Zechariah 6:1) </span><span class="font0">Then I looked up again and saw four chariots coming from between two mountains, and the mountains were of copper.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font4">In the Bible, mountains can represent kingdoms, or governments. The mountains in Zechariah’s account are similar to two mountains described in Daniel’s prophecy. One mountain represents Jehovah’s universal and eternal rulership. The other mountain represents the Messianic Kingdom in the hands of Jesus. (Dan. 2:35, 45) Since Jesus’ enthronement in the autumn of 1914, both mountains have been present and have played a special role in the fulfillment of God’s will on earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>8</sup> </span><span class="font4">Why are the mountains made of copper? Like gold, copper is a metal that is highly valued. Jehovah directed that this shiny metal be used in the construction of the tabernacle and later in the temple in Jerusalem. (Ex. 27:1-3; 1 Ki. 7:13-16) Appropriately, then, the copper of the two symbolic mountains reminds us of the excellent quality of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and of the Messianic Kingdom, which will provide stability and blessings to all mankind.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>10</sup></span><span class="font4"> When the symbolic mountain splits, half to the north and half to the south, Jehovah’s feet remain set upon both mountains. “A very great valley” comes into existence beneath Jehovah’s feet. This symbolic valley represents divine protection, by which Jehovah’s servants find safety under his universal sovereignty and his Son’s Messianic Kingdom. Jehovah will make sure that pure worship will never be snuffed out. When did this division of the mountain of the olive trees take place? It occurred when the Messianic Kingdom was established at the end of the Gentile Times in 1914. When did the flight of true worshippers to the symbolic valley begin?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">( Zechariah 14:5) </span><span class="font0">You will flee to the valley of my mountains, for the valley of the mountains will extend all the way to A</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font0">zel.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>13</sup></span><span class="font4"> If we stick to Jehovah and stand firm in the truth, he and his Son, Jesus Christ, will do their part, and God will not allow anyone or anything to ‘snatch us out of His hand.’ (John 10:28, 29) Jehovah is ready to extend whatever help is needed so that we may obey him as the Universal Sovereign and remain loyal subjects of the Messianic Kingdom.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Zechariah 14:15) </span><span class="font0">“And a scourge like that scourge will also come against the horses, the mules, the camels, the donkeys, and all the livestock that are in those camps.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Stay in Jehovah’s Valley of Protection</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>15</sup></span><span class="font4"> On the day of God’s warring, what will be the situation of those outside the “great valley” of protection? They will have “no precious light” of divine favor shining upon them. In that coming day of fight, “the horse, the mule, the camel, and the male ass, and every sort of domestic animal”—symbols of the nations’ military equipment—will be affected. Such equipment will be “congealed,” put out of operation as if stiffened by cold. Jehovah will also use pestilence and “the scourge.” Whether literal or not, the scourge will silence terrifying threats. On that day, “one’s very eyes . . . and tongue will rot away” in that the attackers will be able to strike out only blindly and their defiant speech will be silenced. (Zech. 14:6, 7, 12, 15) No section of the earth will escape destruction. The forces lined up on Satan’s side in the battle will be tremendous. (Rev. 19:1921) “Those slain by Jehovah will certainly come to be in that day from one end of the earth clear to the other end.”—Jer. 25:32, 33.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font4"> Zechariah’s prophecy sheds light on the reason why the nations take their stand against true Christians. Note what Zechariah 12:3 says: “It must occur in that day that I shall make Jerusalem a burdensome stone to all the peoples.” To which Jerusalem does this prophecy point? Zechariah’s prophecy concerning Jerusalem applies to “heavenly Jerusalem,” the heavenly Kingdom to which anointed Christians have been called. (Hebrews 12:22) A small remnant of these heirs of the Messianic Kingdom are still on earth. Along with their companions, the “other sheep,” they urge people to turn to God’s Kingdom while there is yet time. (John 10:16; Revelation 11:15) How have the nations reacted to this invitation? And what kind of support does Jehovah give to true worshippers today? Let us find out as we further examine the meaning of Zechariah chapter 12. Doing so, we can gain the assurance that ‘no weapon will succeed’ against God’s anointed ones and their dedicated associates.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>10</sup></span><span class="font4"> Zechariah 12:3 indicates that the nations receive “severe scratches.” How does this happen? God has decreed that the good news of the Kingdom must be preached. Jehovah’s Witnesses take seriously the obligation to preach. However, the heralding of the Kingdom as mankind’s only hope has become “a burdensome stone” to the nations. They try to lift it out of the way by interfering with the Kingdom preachers. In so doing, the meddling nations have received “severe scratches for themselves,” getting all cut up. Even their reputations have been hurt as they meet with humiliating failure. They cannot silence true worshippers, who cherish the privilege of proclaiming the “everlasting good news” of God’s Messianic Kingdom before the end of this system of things. (Revelation 14:6) When seeing the violence done to Jehovah’s servants, a prison guard in one African land said, in effect: ‘You are wasting your efforts in persecuting these people. They will never compromise. They just increase.’</span></p></li></ul>

Such people would be the first affected and would be in need of protection if an enemy nation came to attack the city of Jerusalem. The expression “the tents of Judah” indicates that the anointed remnant in our time are out in the open field, so to speak, not in fortified cities. There they fearlessly defend the interests of the Messianic Kingdom. Jehovah of armies will save “the tents of Judah first” because these are in the direct line of Satan’s attack.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Does Your Marriage Please Jehovah?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Malachi 2:13, 14) </span><span class="font0">“And there is another thing that you do, which results in covering the altar of Jehovah with tears and with weeping and sighing, so that he no longer pays attention to your gift offering or looks favorably on anything from your hand. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>14</sup> </span><span class="font0">And you say, ‘For what reason?’ It is because Jehovah has acted as a witness between you and the wife of your youth, with whom you have dealt treacherously, although she is your partner and your wife by covenant.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font4"> During Malachi’s day in the fifth century B.C.E., divorce was rampant among the Jews. Malachi told them: “Jehovah himself has borne witness between you and the wife of your youth, with whom you yourself have dealt treacherously.” Because of treacherous dealings on the part of husbands, the altar of Jehovah was covered with the tears of betrayed wives, “with weeping and sighing.” And corrupt priests condoned such cruelty!—Malachi 2: 13, 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font4"> How did Jehovah view the deplorable attitude toward marriage in Malachi’s time? “‘He has hated a divorcing,’ Jehovah the God of Israel has said,” wrote Malachi. He also affirmed that Jehovah ‘has not changed.’ (Malachi 2:16; 3:6) Do you see the point? God had earlier taken a position against divorce. (Genesis 2:18, 24) He did so in Malachi’s day. And he still does today. Some people may decide to walk out of their marriage simply because they are not satisfied with their mate. Treacherous though their heart may be, Jehovah searches through it. (Jeremiah 17:9, 10) He is aware of any deceit or malicious scheming behind a divorce, however one may rationalize it. Yes, “all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting.”—Hebrews 4:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Malachi 2:15, 16) </span><span class="font0">But there was one who did not do it, for he had what remained of the spirit. And what was that one seeking? The offspring of God. So guard yourselves respecting your spirit, and do not deal treacherously with the wife of your youth. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>16</sup> </span><span class="font0">For I hate divorce,” says Jehovah the God of Israel, “and the one who covers his garment with violence,” says Jehovah of armies. “And guard yourselves respecting your spirit, and you must not deal treacherously.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>19</sup></span><span class="font4"> On the positive side, Malachi shows that some husbands were not dealing treacherously with their wives. They ‘had what was remaining of God’s holy spirit.’ (Verse 15) Happily, God’s organization today abounds with such men who ‘assign honor to their wives.’ (1 Peter 3:7) They do not abuse their wives physically or verbally, do not insist on degrading sexual practices, and do not dishonor their wives by flirting with other women or by viewing pornography. Jehovah’s organization is also blessed by having an abundance of faithful Christian wives who are loyal to God and his laws. All such men and women know what God hates, and they think and act accordingly. Continue to be like them, ‘obeying God as ruler’ and being blessed by his holy spirit. —Acts 5:29.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font4"> Centuries before Jesus gave the illustration of the wheat and the weeds, Jehovah inspired his prophet Malachi to foretell events that are reflected in Jesus’ illustration. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Read Malachi 3:1-4.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">) </span><span class="font4">John the Baptiz-er was the ‘messenger who cleared up the way.’ (Matt. 11:10, 11) When he came in 29 C.E., a time of judgment for the nation of Israel had drawn close. Jesus was the second messenger. He cleansed the temple in Jerusalem twice—first at the start of his ministry and second toward the end. (Matt. 21:12, 13; John 2:14-17) Hence, Jesus’ cleansing work involved a period of time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font4"> What is the larger fulfillment of Malachi’s prophecy? During the decades leading up to 1914, C. T. Russell and his close associates did a work like that of John the Baptizer. That vital work involved restoring Bible truths. The Bible Students taught the true meaning of Christ’s ransom sacrifice, exposed the hellfire lie, and proclaimed the coming end of the Gentile Times. Still, there were numerous religious groups who claimed to be Christ’s followers. So a crucial question needed to be answered: Who among those groups were the wheat? To settle that question, Jesus began to inspect the spiritual temple in 1914. That inspection and cleansing work involved a period of time—from 1914 to the early part of 1919.</span></p></li></ul>
